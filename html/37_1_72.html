belong.

birth.  As the Prime Minister stated on May 18, 2000, there is 
one thing in the life of a nation and it is to make sure that the 
rights of citizens are protected by the courts in our land and 
not subject to the capricious elected.

order.  I wonder if you might seek the unanimous consent of the 
House to allow me to table a private member's bill this morning 
identifying September 3rd as Merchant Navy Veterans Day.  The 
rationale for this is because I am not sure I can get it on the 
order paper prior to the House rising for the summer and 
obviously we will not be back in time for September 3rd.  The 
hope is that many of the veterans who are alive today will have 
an opportunity to celebrate that national day on September 3rd. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B> Does the hon. member 
have the consent of the House?

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK15"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I move that the 14th report of the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, presented to the House 
on Wednesday, May 9, be concurred in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This particular report, as many will recall, came about as a 
result of the actions, not personally on the part of the Minister 
of Justice but more so within her department and the decision that 
was taken to release information about Bill C-15 that is 
currently before the House.  The information was provided to 
members of the media in the form of a briefing to which members 
of parliament were not invited, nor were members of their staff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It resulted in a complaint and a point of privilege that was 
raised on March 14 by the hon. member for Provencher.  The 
question was deemed to be a breach of privilege by the Speaker at 
the time and it led to a referral to the procedure and House 
affairs committee where there was some deliberation which 
resulted in the minister herself and members of the staff 
appearing before the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was truly an affront I believe to all members of parliament 
that the minister in her wisdom and her department decided to 
exclude members of parliament from information on a bill which 
can be deemed fairly important and substantive.  It takes the 
form of an omnibus bill, which means there are number of pieces 
of legislation that are put together in somewhat of an artificial 
form, I would suggest, in this instance because the amendments to 
the criminal code are completely unrelated.  This is what has 
caused a lot of concern for members of the opposition and, I 
suspect, there are members on the government side who are equally 
uncomfortable with how the bill appears before this Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would deem the legislation itself to be very important.  It 
touches upon such issues as stalking and increasing the penalties 
that would be attached to that.  It deals specifically with and 
creates a new offence for criminal harassment on the Internet and 
approaches, in a new and innovative way, the manner in which our 
current criminal procedure can attach to those who choose this 
nefarious means to harass and to stalk, in particular, children, 
and the availability of pornography on the Internet and the way 
that is dispersed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What really offends members of the Progressive Conservative 
Party is that we are faced with an opportunity to bring this type 
of legislation into the House of Commons to pass before the 
recess.  The Minister of Justice, for reasons perhaps known only 
to her, is dragging her feet on this in denying the House and 
thereby denying the country the ability to bring the legislation 
forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition stance has been consistent in the past number of 
weeks which is that within the omnibus bill there are very 
controversial provisions that deal specifically with cruelty to 
animals.  That is not to suggest for a moment that this type of 
legislation is not needed as well.  It is a matter for which all 
members of parliament are concerned but there are elements of the 
bill dealing with cruelty to animals and with firearms that have 
caused some consternation throughout the country. 
Members specifically are concerned on behalf of their 
constituents about how this will affect legitimate professions 
and practices as it relates to animals, trappers, hunters and 
cattlemen.  Those who are dealing daily, as part of their 
profession, with animals are very concerned about how these new 
criminal code provisions and amendments will affect them and 
their livelihood.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For that reason, there has to be an opportunity to examine in 
detail and hear from some of these witnesses at that committee. 
That opportunity would come through committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality, in terms of how the procedure could unfold, is the 
minister has been given a very legitimate offer from the 
opposition to sever out parts of this omnibus bill and bring it 
back in the fall when the entire bill under the current schedule 
will be revisited.  Certain sections of that bill could be taken 
out.  Then the Internet pornography sections, specifically the 
stalking provisions that would increase the current criminal 
sanctions for stalking, could be dealt with.  This initiative was 
taken by Senator Oliver in the other place and is one that he 
pursued vigorously over the past number of years.  Suffice it to 
say that the Progressive Conservative Party is very supportive of 
that provision and others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would also increase the sentences, specifically creating a 
new offence for disarming a police officer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know, Madam Speaker, you have more than just a passing 
knowledge and understanding of these types of bills and omnibus 
pieces of legislation.  However, what has happened and what is 
offensive is the minister has decided to force feed the entire 
bill to the House of Commons.  In a very strident and stubborn 
way she has said that she refuses to take out those sections 
which attach controversy and raise the ire of many in the 
country.  Therefore, she is willing to stand pat and let the 
entire legislation be deferred and stalled on the order paper 
until next fall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In plain speak, that is not good enough.  Members of the 
opposition do not accept this.  When we look at the priorities of 
the government, we are left only to wonder as to why we would be 
rushing headlong toward bringing in a piece of legislation which 
would increase our remuneration.  When we have an opportunity to 
bring in a very positive piece of legislation that is supported 
by all members of the opposition, and obviously members of the 
government, by simply making a very small concession, I would 
suggest that would lead a piece of legislation— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall:</B>  Madam  Speaker, I rise on a point 
of order.  I question the relevance of debating another bill 
before the House today in the context of a motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  The member can debate 
a motion.  It is within the standing orders, and it is within the 
context of his motion that the debate is taking place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Madam Speaker, I commend your wisdom of 
that point.  If the hon. government whip who has just joined us 
would unplug her ears and plug in her earpiece, she would know 
very clearly that this is extremely relevant and important, and I 
invite her to listen to my remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the opposition, and I suggest many in her own government, 
would like to see happen is for the minister to simply divide up 
the omnibus bill and remove two rather controversial elements of 
the legislation.  They would be returned in stand alone form and 
would advance, if she would agree to this, and improve in their 
standing and speed in which they would pass in the fall.  By 
doing this, it would allow Canadians to have the benefit of this 
new legislation which would attach specifically to Internet 
stalking and pornography being sent around the country in this 
new way.  This very nefarious practice could be addressed by 
bringing in this type of legislation now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would we hesitate?  That is the question that we are left to 
ponder.  Why would the Minister of Justice refuse the opportunity 
to bring forward this very positive legislation supported by the 
opposition and by her own government?  It seems she simply is 
doing this out of some defiance or stubbornness because it was an 
idea that originated on the other side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a practice that unfortunately we see far too often. 
Ideas somehow on this side of the House are lesser ideas or are 
ideas that somehow should not be given the same credence; the 
same way the Prime Minister would have Canadians accept that if 
members of this side of the House in the opposition do not get 
down on their knees, kiss his ring, ask for contrition and ask 
that we be given a pay raise, we do not get it. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1020"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This perpetrates again this idea that we have two separate 
classes of members of parliament.  We have those who bow down and 
support the Prime Minister in his every effort and those who do 
not for some reason.  They try to fulfil their role in opposition 
legitimately by questioning his ideas and vision, if there is 
one.  This is the type of attitude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can talk endlessly about ways to modernize parliament.  We 
can talk about procedural change and the way to empower members 
of the opposition and backbench Liberals.  Yet it is this palace 
guard, pinnacle top-down approach, which we have seen from the 
Prime Minister in particular, that squashes that.  It absolutely 
goes against any type of individual thought.  It is meant 
entirely to put down anyone that might have an original idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If parliament is supposed to improve its lot, if we are to 
somehow improve the way in which Canadians view the legitimacy 
and the relevance of the Chamber, that has to change. 
Unfortunately, we can do everything in our power to try to change 
procedurally the way that the House works, but as long as this 
attitude exists, as long as there is this Prime Minister in 
place, as long as the PMO is going to view any sort of legitimate 
dissent or questioning of this unfettered power that has now 
accrued in the PMO, we are not going to see an improvement of 
this place.  We are not going to see members of parliament 
encouraged to step forward into the breach on occasion against 
the power and the winds of change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is yet another example.  We have a very clear, common sense 
opportunity to bring forward a piece of legislation that would 
protect children.  It would increase the ability of our justice 
system to deal with individuals who act violently toward police. 
It would increase the ability of our justice system to respond 
appropriately and proportionately to those who engage in the very 
disturbing practice of harassment, of targeting a person and 
terrorizing his or her life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The practice of criminal harassment, colloquially known as 
stalking, is something that has, for reasons that defy logic, 
taken on a whole new meaning.  Quite frequently we see 
individuals, usually women, subjected to this very disturbing 
approach that destabilizes a people's lives.  It injects itself 
into their stability or the way in which they can carry on their 
normal practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, this is important legislation.  This is the type of bill 
that should be brought forward with great haste.  What is the 
deterrent?  What is blocking our ability to do that?  It is the 
Minister of Justice who has the power and is embodied with the 
responsibility to protect Canadians in the first instance and to 
take every opportunity to bring forward this type of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend her for bringing it this far, but we are at the goal 
line.  We are just about to bring the legislation forward through 
the House, on through the other place, into practice and into 
being law.  Yet the minister, defying all logic, defying all 
reasonable approach by the opposition, and I suggest by lobbying 
within her own ranks, is refusing to do so, and is refusing to 
even answer why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When questions were posed to her in the House of Commons, she 
pointed the finger in her academic, professorial way and 
accusatorially told the opposition that it was playing politics. 
We are playing politics because we want to support a government 
bill?  That is playing politics?  We are trying to bring it in so 
that it will be the practice to protect Canadians.  That is 
playing politics?  She is denying the opposition an opportunity 
to work with government simply because she feels perhaps this 
idea is coming from a place outside of her political world, a 
place outside the government's world, because only good ideas 
come from the government benches.  That is inevitably what we are 
left to ponder. 
Why can the opposition not originate a good idea?  It can, and I 
think most Canadians recognize that.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of justice has a lot to answer.  She seems, for 
reasons known only to her, to have dug in and said the government 
will not bring the bill forward.  It will not allow Canadians to 
have this protective, positive legislation in place before the 
recess, because it has bigger priorities.  It has to get pay 
raises through.  It has to somehow improve its own lot and not 
that of those who would be affected by this type of criminal 
activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This report speaks volumes.  This report came about as a result 
of the same type of action and pattern of arrogance that 
Canadians sadly have come to expect and have borne witness to 
during this government's administration.  We saw the minister 
brought before a committee because of this type of action before, 
yet it does not seem to have had the desired effect.  It does not 
seem to have made any kind of an imprint on the minister's mind 
as to why she should perhaps listen on occasion to the opposition 
and why she might somehow open her eyes to the fact that the 
opposition is not always out for blood.  It is not always out to 
try in a partisan way to embarrass the government.  There are 
occasions where we simply want to try to support the government. 
This is just one of those occasions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a bill that very clearly would improve the criminal 
justice system in the country.  All it takes is a little 
compromise.  All it takes is the minister's recognition that to 
give a little she would get a lot.  She would get the support of 
this party, and I am sure other parties in the House, to bring 
forward Bill C-15 in a new, revamped way that would attach to 
these provisions and remove some of the controversial provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said before, those issues that deal with firearms and 
cruelty to animals would return in the fall in a stand alone 
form, advancing from where they currently sit on the order paper. 
They would move in a more rapid pace when we return in the fall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems so logical, so common sense, yet the minister has 
chosen to simply ignore this request, which was first brought 
forward through the government House leader.  She was approached 
in a number of ways and in a number of forms.  I know the member 
for Provencher wrote to her with a very similar straightforward 
request and was flatly turned down with no reasons given.  That 
is not accountability and that is not good enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice has something to answer to here. 
Because of this report, there should be a bit of a sword of 
Damocles hanging over her head.  She has exhibited this type of 
strident attitude before, ignoring the pleas of the opposition 
and ignoring the wishes of Canadians who predominantly would 
support any efforts to bring in legislation that would protect 
them, their children, their homes and their law enforcement 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the reason behind bringing this matter forward.  We in 
the opposition have on occasion limited opportunity to ask the 
questions and bring forward legitimate issues.  The government 
sets the agenda to a large extent, particularly the legislative 
agenda and the priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again we are left to wonder why is it that we would rush 
headlong into a bill that enhances our pay and our pensions?  Why 
is that the priority before we go home?  Why, in the remaining 
days of parliament, will members of the House and members of the 
Senate be dealing with that?  Surely it is not consistent with 
what Canadians expect?  Surely this is not where we should be 
focusing our efforts in the remaining time that we have in the 
Parliament of Canada.  If we have an opportunity of choice 
between taking a pay raise or helping children, surely the answer 
is obvious.  Why the minister of justice cannot see that and 
embrace that is beyond comprehension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the Minister of Justice for coming before the 
committee and making proper apologies.  She admitted there was 
something wrong.  She was prepared to make changes to ensure that 
this type of practice would not occur again.  Yet at the very 
first instance, when an occasion arose where the minister could 
show a little understanding and willingness to compromise and 
work with the opposition not against it on behalf of Canadians on 
a very legitimate issue, her bill, she did not.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not something that originates from the opposition side. 
We simply are saying to the minister “Let us pass the bill. Let 
us get this legislation through quickly”.  We want to work with 
her and support the legislation because it is such a positive 
initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, no, it does not seem like that will happen, and why? We 
have not heard from the minister yet.  I guess the response is 
just because, much like the Prime Minister, because the 
government can.  Why do animals do certain things to themselves? 
Because they can.  As vulgar as that may sound that appears to be 
the response we get.  There is no response because the power is 
there to do so and therefore the government is prepared to 
exercise it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what enrages opposition members.  That is what offends 
Canadians.  They see that members of the Parliament of Canada 
cannot work together on such positive issues as protecting 
children and improving the way in which our justice system works. 
What is more fundamental than that?  What is more important than 
that?  Surely it is not pay raises.  Surely it is not the way in 
which we can improve our own lot in life.  We are elected to come 
here to bring forward important pieces of legislation that would 
do very good things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that, my time has expired.  We would hope that we might 
hear at some point from the government at least, if not the 
minister herself, as to why this seemingly indefensible position 
has been taken by the minister and her department. 
<P><A NAME="LINK16"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I concur as much as I can possibly concur with what the 
hon. member has just said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a contempt for members of the opposition and even for 
backbenchers on the Liberal side that has been shown over and 
over by the government.  Instead of using the ploy of enhancing 
the salaries of members of parliament in order to try to give 
them more dignity in the public eye, it is about time that the 
occasion be used to recognize that members of parliament are 
elected by their respective constituencies, are here to do a job 
and should be heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am deeply offended by Bill C-15 and the move the government is 
making here by mixing into the motion many very good items with a 
few totally deplorable items.  I have used this analogy before: 
we get a bowl of really nice pudding—I like custard pudding—but 
in it is a bunch of gravel and we are supposed to eat the whole 
thing.  I am using the example of gravel in order to try to be 
polite because there are other things that come to mind which the 
Liberals mix into good parts of a bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-15, the bill under discussion here, in fact has some very 
good parts, as the member has pointed out, but what has the 
government done?  It has thrown into it things that are totally 
offensive to most Canadians.  The members of parliament on this 
side and the other side would love to express that, but they 
cannot because it is all tied together in one big package.  It is 
an all or nothing thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is doing the same thing with MPs' salaries. There 
are some good things and a bunch of stuff that is bad.  We cannot 
amend it.  The government will not accept it.  In its arrogance 
and its majority here it just does whatever it wants. The Prime 
Minister acts like a dictator.  He says it and it is done.  That 
is very offensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to congratulate the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough for what he is doing today and I 
give him 100% support for this motion.  I also believe that this 
report should be accepted.  I would like to see the House seized 
with this issue before any other because of the importance of the 
protection of our children and our society.  I would like the 
member's comments on that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Madam Speaker, I appreciate those 
comments from the member for Elk Island.  I know that what he has 
said and has put on the record is very true.  It is very 
consistent with other behaviour on the part of the government. 
The Liberal government has always portrayed itself in a 
Janus-like way, saying one thing and doing another.  We have seen 
that consistently since the Liberals came to office.  We have 
seen it on a number of issues:  the GST, free trade, Pearson 
airport.  Consistently the government has said one thing and done 
another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what is happening here in a more nefarious way.  The 
government is bringing in a piece of legislation, saying that it 
feels this is important, that it is in response to what Canadians 
want.  However, when given the opportunity and basically given a 
free ride, when the opposition says to pass this legislation 
quickly, the government says no, that is not really its priority 
at all.  Its priority is bringing in a pay hike, putting members 
on the spot and somehow trying to set them up in such a way that 
if they do not vote for it, if they do not lay down and give the 
government its way they will not get it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This occasion is one on which the opposition is saying “Let us 
do a good thing before we go home.  Let us bring in a piece of 
legislation that Canadians can respect and be proud of”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would we shy away from that?  Why we would not somehow try 
to do the right thing, put the proper emphasis on it and 
proportionately move in a direction Canadians would expect?  It 
is very disappointing and very frustrating for this side of the 
House when we are giving the government the opportunity to do 
that.  The government members can hang their heads in shame, but 
I suggest that if we leave here with that bad taste in everyone's 
mouth then we have a lot to account for and I suspect we will 
have a long, hot summer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I would hope that the government would reverse itself as 
it has done on so many occasions, but reverse itself in the right 
direction.  The way the government did it on helicopters, for 
example, it reversed itself by in some way trying not to take the 
right contract.  Now the Liberals are struggling to do everything 
they can to avoid buying the same helicopters they cancelled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us try to put some of this partisanship aside and bring in a 
piece of legislation that Canadians want and Canadians are 
looking for. 
<P><A NAME="LINK17"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
listened with great interest to the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough.  I listened with some sympathy 
with respect to his discussion of the report, which was actually 
the topic of the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in terms of Bill C-15, and I hope the hon. member will 
reply to this, it does seem to me that there must be parts of 
that bill that he has serious concerns about.  There are the 
firearms part, the animal cruelty part and the law enforcement 
officer part.  Generally speaking, I support all three of those 
components.  I have my concerns about some parts of them, but 
that is normal as legislation moves through the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member is so concerned about it, would he now give us an 
indication of which parts of those individual areas of the 
legislation he disagrees with? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Madam Speaker, I appreciate the very 
straightforward and relevant question from the member for 
Peterborough.  My simple response is this:  where has he been? 
What I have said is that the difficulty I have with this 
legislation is the cruelty to animals provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard from a number of stakeholders who are concerned, 
including farmers, those who operate slaughterhouses, those in 
the trapping and fur industry and those who deal with animals 
regularly as part of their livelihood.  They want to come before 
committee.  That is what would hold up the bill.  These people 
want a legitimate opportunity to come before the committee and 
put their concerns on the record, which might lead to possible 
amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give the government its due.  It has made some amendments 
to those animal cruelty provisions, which have answered a great 
deal of what the industry was concerned about, but it is not 
there yet.  The stakeholders want to see some possible 
amendments.  In particular, they want an opportunity to find out 
if criminal charges might result from practices they are 
currently carrying out.  That is their concern, which is very 
legitimate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, there is the firearms provision.  The Progressive 
Conservative Party has said since the introduction of Bill C-68 
that it does not agree with this billion dollars or more that 
will be accumulated in public costs before this legislation will 
be in effect.  We oppose it. 
To be consistent, we are not particularly quick to embrace the 
firearms provisions of this omnibus bill, but that is the point. 
It is an omnibus bill.  It is all or nothing.  It is take all of 
these provisions or take none.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am suggesting is that this legislation, but for those two 
provisions, would pass quickly through the House with the 
unanimous support of the opposition.  The government would get 
its way.  The bill itself, in every other way but for those two 
provisions, would be passed.  Those two provisions would be 
returned in the fall as stand alone bills.  They would have 
advanced from the point they are at now and would pass quickly in 
the fall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what could be done instead of carrying over the whole 
bill and having it spend the summer sitting on the order paper 
when it could be in effect.  The Internet stalking and 
pornography provisions in the criminal code would take effect by 
the end of the month and would start to protect young people 
immediately.  We would beef up the sanctions that attach to 
police officers who are attacked by people in an effort to remove 
their firearms.  It would beef up the stalking provisions in the 
criminal code and it would toughen the sanctions that attach for 
those who harass women and children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is all I am suggesting:  to divide the bill up in a very 
logical way, remove the controversy, bring those provisions back, 
and pass the rest of it part and parcel in this legislation 
before we go home.  Let us do something good before we leave 
instead of just jacking up our own pay. 
<P><A NAME="LINK18"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I would like to inform the member that I totally agree 
with his comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding we have probably some of the largest livestock 
producers in the country, who are very efficient and effective in 
what they do.  A number of cases have gone to court because of 
certain acts, like the SPCA charging farmers because a cow had a 
cancerous eye.  Of course the courts did not charge the 
individual or find him guilty.  It was thrown out of court. 
Nevertheless the lawyers made a pile of money over that kind of 
thing.  With respect to the animal part, the bill really needs a 
lot deal of work.  The child issue needs little or none.  Could 
the member please explain why this minister thinks that 
protecting children is playing politics? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  Unfortunately there 
is no more time left.  If there is unanimous consent I can permit 
the hon. member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough to answer the 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there unanimous consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
<P><A NAME="LINK19"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
just want to let the hon. members opposite know that my speaking 
here is just as democratic as their speaking over there.  I have 
been listening to the debate and so far have not intervened.  I 
am pleased to do so now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate is on a motion for concurrence in a report of the 
procedure and house affairs committee which was tabled in the 
House just a few weeks ago.  That report dealt with the matter of 
privilege that was referred to the committee from the House 
through the Speaker.  The report, known as the 14th report, was 
adopted unanimously at the procedure and house affairs committee 
so there should be no doubt here in the House that there is cross 
party support for the report as tabled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will also be aware that it is if not routine at least 
customary for the government to respond to reports of committees. 
I can advise the House that it is the government's intention to 
respond.  In fact, response to that unanimous report has been 
prepared and will be introduced into the House on Thursday.  In 
some respects it is regrettable that the debate now put forward— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark:</B>  And debate is regrettable? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee:</B>  Yes, it is.  It is perhaps unfortunate 
that it needed to happen today in the views of some members when 
the government response is only a couple of days away.  It would 
be preferable, I think, for all in the House to have the 
government response before we engage in a debate of this nature.

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I could not help but note that a lot of the debate that 
has occurred here had to do with a statute that is not even the 
subject matter of the motion.  It had to do with a bill we call 
Bill C-15, a bill to revise the Criminal Code of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that the debate we are engaging in on the 14th report 
of the standing committee is not really what the mover wanted to 
talk about at all.  In fact there are other agendas in place.  I 
have to note as well, as we all will, that we are moving toward 
the end of a sitting of the House.  We are moving toward the end 
of our work.  We are not all finished yet but we certainly have 
an obvious short list of items that we want to complete within 
the next week or two.  As a result, there are any number of other 
political agendas being put forward by individual members or 
political parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard earlier the oft repeated mantra from across the way that 
the government is somehow arrogant.  Of course, sitting with the 
government I reject that totally.  The government is simply 
pursuing its legislative agenda, 90% of which has been on the 
order paper for a very long time.  Members opposite know that. I 
do not mind hearing the mantra of arrogance repeated but I also 
have to point out that most of the members opposite, in the sense 
that they continue with the mantra, are simply continuing their 
membership in the ranks of the perpetually indignant.  We all 
accept that in opposition they do have a role and that they are 
doing their best to fulfil it today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage members, if they are interested in the progress of 
Bill C-15 amending the criminal code, that they direct their 
attention to that outside the debate here.  I do not think it is 
particularly relevant to the privilege matter that was discussed 
in the 14th report.  I direct members' attention again to the 
fact that a government response will be tabled in the House 
within a couple of days and that the reported had been adopted 
unanimously at committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I think it is appropriate to move:

the House to adopt the motion?

Bill S-17, an act to amend the Patent Act, be read the third time 
and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK26"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to 
begin third reading of Bill S-17, an act to amend the Patent Act. 
Bill S-17 is the end result of two separate World Trade 
Organization challenges, one by the European Union and one by the 
United States, against different aspects of Canada's drug patent 
regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of these challenges the WTO ruled that certain 
aspects of our drug patent regime, namely stockpiling and our old 
act patent term, were inconsistent with our international 
obligations under the WTO agreement on trade related aspects of 
intellectual property rights, also known as TRIPS. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a more positive note, Canada won an important aspect of the 
challenges when the WTO validated our early working exception 
that accelerates the market entry of generic drugs by a period of 
three to six and a half years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overall these rulings neither undermine nor threaten the 
underlying balance of Canada's patent regime.  They do, however, 
mean the Patent Act needs to be amended to comply with our 
obligations under TRIPS. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us deals exclusively with issues of patent term 
and stockpiling.  Its primary objective is to bring Canada's 
Patent Act into compliance with the WTO ruling.  It is very 
important therefore that we proceed expeditiously with the 
amendments before us because the WTO has imposed an August 12 
deadline for compliance with the patent term ruling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments in the bill have deliberately been kept as simple 
and straightforward as possible to help meet the deadline.  If we 
do not respect the deadline we could face retaliatory trade 
sanctions.  To avoid such a result requires that the bill be 
passed by parliament and given royal assent before the summer 
recess.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Some would say that Bill S-17 would alter the balance of 
Canada's drug patent regime.  That is not the case.  We have 
demonstrated that the amendments would not increase the price of 
drugs.  They would affect only a small percentage of drugs on the 
market, less than 1%, and would not affect the speed at which 
generic drugs enter the market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This demonstrates that the amendments would not undermine the 
balance of Canada's drug patent regime, a balance that rewards 
innovation and guarantees access to affordable drugs for all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because some have expressed concerns about how a change in the 
terms of patent protection would affect drug costs, I will go 
into the issue in more detail.  We heard in committee that the 
number of commercially significant drugs that would benefit from 
patent term extension is approximately 30.  That number is 
relatively insignificant when compared to the 5,200 patent and 
non-patent prescription drugs available to Canadians.  The 
average term extension for patents on the 30 drugs I mentioned is 
less than six months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed amendments would not increase the overall price of 
drugs.  Rather, they could delay by a few months the potential 
savings offered by generic alternatives.  Even under the most 
generous of assumptions, the forgone savings would amount to less 
than one-tenth of 1% of drug sales over the next eight years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our current patent regime serves Canadians well.  According to 
the latest report from the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board, 
prices in Canada are 11% below the median foreign price and 
Canadians pay 40% less for patent drugs than do Americans. The 
amendments contained in Bill S-17 would not hinder the PMPRB's 
role of ensuring that Canadians do not pay excessive prices for 
drug prescriptions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-17 has undergone scrutiny by committees in both houses of 
parliament.  The Senate Standing Committee on Banking, Trade and 
Commerce held hearings in March and April.  As a result of the 
hearings I understand that committee members developed a common 
understanding that Bill S-17 was necessary to comply with WTO 
rulings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the more divisive issue of NOC linkage regulations, there was 
a general recognition from the Senate committee that they fell 
outside the scope of Bill S-17 and that now was not the time to 
address broader intellectual property rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House of Commons Standing Committee on Industry, Science and 
Technology held hearings in May.  I would venture to say that 
there was a general recognition by most members of the committee 
that meeting our international obligations was important and that 
the passage of Bill S-17 was necessary to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of the NOC linkage regulations, we heard that the 
early working exception and the NOC regulations, taken together, 
were an important part of our balanced approach.  For the most 
part, members of the committee agree that it was a matter for 
another time.  The immediate priority is the passage of Bill S-17 
before the summer recess. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-17 contains the amendments necessary to bring the Patent 
Act into compliance with the WTO rulings.  Neither the WTO 
rulings nor the proposed amendments would undermine the structure 
of the Canadian patent regime as it currently exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important that innovation continue and be rewarded 
and that Canadians continue to have access to affordable drugs. 
The government's objective is to build a world class leading 
economy driven by innovation, ideas and talent.  We need a strong 
and modern intellectual property framework to do so.  The 
amendments contained in Bill S-17 would help maintain Canada's 
leadership in the global knowledge based economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all members on both sides of the House to work together 
and move expeditiously to support the bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Canadian Alliance):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to speak to third reading of Bill S-17, an 
act to amend the Patent Act.  I will be brief in my remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance supports the bill and its intent to bring 
Canada's patent regime up to international standards.  The 
purpose of Bill S-17 is to bring Canada's Patent Act into 
compliance with the trade related aspects of intellectual 
property rights agreement, or TRIPS, which Canada and all other 
members of the World Trade Organization have signed and must 
adhere to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Canadian Alliance recognize that sometimes at these 
international bodies we will win cases and sometimes we will 
lose.  However it is a large group.  Roughly 150 member countries 
make the decisions.  Overall, Canada gains by the process of the 
rule of law.  We are a small member country in terms of 
population but we have been very influential in bringing forward 
proposals to do away with subsidies and tariffs internationally 
since the end of the second world war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what it is all about.  Last fall the World Trade 
Organization found Canada's patent legislation to be deficient 
because patents introduced before 1989 were given only a 17 year 
protection, not 20 as required by the agreement we signed, the 
agreement called TRIPS. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must therefore make the necessary amendments to the Patent 
Act.  Bill S-17 would change section 45 of the act to provide a 
20 year term of patent protection from the date of application. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About 30 patents in the pre-1989 act represent commercially 
significant patent drugs.  The Canadian Drug Manufacturers 
Association, which represents the generic drug industry, has 
fully acknowledged that the Government of Canada must make 
legislative changes to the Patent Act to comply with its 
international trade obligations.  However, the association has 
objected to what it claims is an imbalance in drug patent 
regulations, particularly the notice of compliance linkage 
regulations.  It also talks about the two year stay process that 
is in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree that this is an important issue but it should not slow 
down the passage of Bill S-17 which is intended to bring us into 
compliance with the World Trade Organization.  That body gave us 
until August to change our patent laws, so we must make the 
amendments as soon as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance recognizes that the dispute over drug 
regulations should not be ignored but should be examined as a 
separate issue.  The Minister of Industry has suggested that he 
will ask the committee to study the issue in the fall, and we 
concur completely.  We should call witnesses and hear testimony 
on the important issue of regulations when it comes to drug 
patents after the 20 year process.  We would encourage the 
committee next fall to take on the issue, listen to witnesses 
carefully and to make a judgment based on the information that 
comes before it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk a bit about how important it is for Canada to 
recognize and comply with rulings that are made when we sign 
important agreements such as the GATT under the World Trade 
Organization.  We are a mid-sized trading nation.  A large part 
of Canada's prosperity depends on our ability to sell our 
products abroad.  We need the WTO and other trading agreements 
such as NAFTA to protect our international trade from unfair 
subsidies, countervailing duties and trade wars.  Some may not 
like all the decisions coming out of the WTO but there is no 
question that overall we benefit from the stability and clarity 
the organization provides to world trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give an example of how we have gone off track from time 
to time and why it is necessary for us to work within the 
framework of these organizations.  We need only look at the 
accelerated trade war between Canada and Brazil over regional 
jets.  Despite winning several rounds at the WTO over the issue, 
the industry minister announced in January that the government 
would give an estimated $1.5 billion below market interest rate 
loan to Air Wisconsin to help Bombardier secure a regional jet 
contract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While it sounds okay on the surface, the loan was described as a 
one time deal to save Canadian jobs threatened by Brazil's 
subsidies to its regional jet manufacturer, Embraer.  Rather than 
make Brazil see the reason in this, Canada chose not to use the 
process in place at the World Trade Organization which is to 
exercise sanctions against a rogue nation that will not comply.

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than seeing the reason in this process, as the minister 
suggested, Brazil has dug in its heels over the issue and feels 
that it has to continue subsidizing as long as Canada is 
subsidizing as well.  All those years of working within the WTO 
system on this issue are now in question, and I would suggest in 
jeopardy, because Canada has stooped to Brazil's level.  There is 
no end in sight to this dispute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bombardier is now seeking another subsidized government backed 
loan for another one of its customers.  That customer is 
Northwest Airlines, the fourth biggest airline in the United 
States.  The industry minister is seeking that loan on behalf of 
the government so that Northwest can be enticed to purchase 
Bombardier jets rather than Embraer's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is less than five months from the time that the Minister of 
Industry told the House that this would be a one time deal to 
bring Brazil to its senses.  It has not worked because Bombardier 
is back asking for another $1.5 billion to keep it going.  The 
trade war goes on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been working for 50 years with institutions like the 
general agreement on tariffs and trade.  We went through a seven 
year process at the Uruguay round of the GATT to bring some 
sanity to the process of subsidies and tariffs.  Canada was a 
leading nation.  We were well respected for our ability to move 
the process forward.  However Canada is now working outside the 
rules of the WTO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Canada is to have any credibility in future negotiations, 
particularly on the issue of compliance in the drug manufacturing 
debate, it needs to start to comply with these rulings and work 
within the framework. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The framework in the Bombardier dispute with Embraer was that on 
December 6 the World Trade Organization authorized Canada to 
impose $244 million in sanctions against Brazil to stop that 
unfair practice but Canada did not take that step.  We were wrong 
in not doing that.  That was the only method we had at the World 
Trade Organization and we chose to work outside the organization 
on that issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This points out that we need a rules based system.  We have 
worked hard to develop it in the past.  We know it is effective 
in cases like the Canadian Drug Manufacturers Association and its 
dispute in terms of the 20 year patent.  Now Canada has moved to 
come into compliance with it.  We need to continue that process 
and continue to work within the organization to build Canada's 
credibility in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other industries are watching, such as shipbuilding, 
agriculture, steel and softwood lumber.  We need some resolve or 
some process to settle these disputes.  Canada has been a leader 
for 50 years.  If Canada will not work within the rules then who 
will? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Matching subsidies is sometimes called levelling the playing 
field, but the Canadian Alliance and I believe it is misguided 
policy.  Instead taxpayers of the two countries involved end up 
subsidizing foreign airlines in this case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A company in Arizona bought regional jets from Bombardier and is 
now saying that it did not get that kind of deal.  It wants it 
too and is asking why it was given to everybody else.  Instead of 
subsidizing Northwest Airlines in the United States, we should 
work within the framework of the WTO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coming back to the business of the drug patent law or patent law 
in general, we heard a lot of testimony in committee indicating 
that we need a strong intellectual property system in Canada so 
that those who come up with new ideas are able to realize some 
profit and protection for their property.  I suggest it is no 
different in the area of drug patents.  A reasonable length of 
time is required to recover the money.  Once the patent is up, it 
is fine.  The generic companies can then get involved and 
manufacture products which might be cheaper than research based 
pharmaceuticals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the important debate over notice of compliance and the 
regulations will take place next fall.  I am looking forward to 
it, to see who is right on this issue.  In the meantime it is 
very important for Canada to comply with the WTO rulings, bring 
Bill S-17 forward, and pass it as quickly as possible to bring us 
into compliance so that Canada is not a rogue nation but is 
working to try to resolve international issues in a reasonable 
manner.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I am pleased to intervene briefly this morning on Bill S-17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill does not require a long intervention, because the 
principles involved are relatively clear and part of the daily 
life of people living in a democracy.  Membership in an 
international organization implies acceptance of the 
organization's decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aim of Bill S-17 is essentially to comply with two decisions 
taken last year.  The bill brings the Patent Act into line with 
the requirements of the WTO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec is especially proud to have operating within its economy 
a number of international pharmacology and biotechnology firms. 
Laval, for instance, is known for its science and high 
technology park, a model in the area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would happen if Canada decided not to comply with the 
Patent Act any more?  Of course, there would be drawn out court 
proceedings, with all that involves.  It would mean losses 
somewhere for Quebec's and Canada's economies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois will support Bill S-17.  This support makes 
very clear the position a sovereign Quebec will take once it has 
the privilege and the right to sit at the table of nations and 
sign its own international agreements, which it will support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This therefore is a dress rehearsal.  Quebec will sign WTO 
agreements and recognize decisions made, because, in all good 
faith, this is how it would have signed international 
agreements.

<P><A NAME="LINK29"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
will comment on a number of different issues relating to the 
bill.  A good number of them have been mentioned by other 
speakers but probably from a somewhat different context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As someone who has been sitting on the committee dealing with 
the issue for a very short period of time among many other issues 
that were being rushed about, I will not make a point of rushing 
through the debate.  Everyone else is talking about the need to 
be brief but I think this is one time when we should not be 
brief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about an issue that relates to the health of 
Canadians and the health of people of the world, for that matter. 
It is related to the issue of patent protection and its 
relationship to drugs throughout the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will comment on the brief period of time the Government of 
Canada has to deal with the issue and make sure it is passed to 
meet the WTO trade agreement.  In its submission to the tribunal 
body which was ruling on the matter, the U.S. presented the 
reasons Canada had to comply by August 12.  Normally a 14 month 
to 17 month period of time is given to countries to comply.  In 
this case Canada got a whole lot less time.  We got 10 months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The U.S. submitted that Canada had a parliamentary system which 
would allow its government with its parliamentary majority to 
effectively ensure that whatever legislation it wants will be 
passed in a short period of time.  The United States asserted 
that as past practice illustrated many bills had been swiftly 
passed by the government.  For instance, in the 36th parliament 
40 of the 78 government bills that received royal assent were 
passed in four months or less.  Indeed bills have been enacted in 
as short a period of time as a week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that the past practice of the government of not having 
full debate, full disclosure and full input from the people of 
Canada are the reasons Canada was given this brief period of 
time.  It was because of the actions of the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the United States, with Canada's ability to 
promptly pass legislation, the underlying question was whether 
Canada would make the passage of the bill a priority in its 
legislative agenda. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1155"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government did not make it a priority and did not start 
discussions on the bill some time ago.  It brought in the bill a 
short time ago so there would be less discussion. Instead of 
bringing it through the elected House it brought it through the 
Senate, once again to delay the process where Canadians elected 
by Canadians would have the opportunity to speak their minds on 
the issue.  What we have is very limited discussion on the whole 
issue of patent legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not have to wait until the fall of this year to have a 
discussion which really needs to be had.  I listened to my 
colleague in the Alliance and I was thoroughly disgusted with his 
comments.  He was saying that we would discuss it in the fall and 
hear the positions then.  We should not have to wait until the 
fall. We should have pursued the issue a whole lot sooner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When something as important as the health of Canadians and of 
people of the world is at stake, why would we wait until the fall 
to discuss this important issue?  It is probably one of the 
single most important issues we have been discussing for a period 
of time, and it is to be rushed through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That ends my comments with regard to why we are passing the 
legislation through the House so quickly.  I will now discuss why 
we have the issue before us at all.  At one time Canada would not 
have been subjected to rulings of the World Trade Organization 
which said that we had to move as a country on a decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We decided to have 17 year patent legislation, which is no short 
period of time.  I challenge any drug company to say that it has 
not received its return a hundredfold in 17 years.  It is not a 
matter of getting a return on research investment.  It is a 
matter of pure and simple greed by drug companies.  Prior to the 
legislation not a drug company was suffering.  If there was a 
need for more research dollars the government had a 
responsibility to respond to that need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue between the 17 years and 20 years is a matter of pure 
and simple greed.  It is the same pure and simple greed that led 
a number of wonderful drug companies to work in collusion to 
increase the price of an additive to vitamins and other 
medications a few years back.  They all ended up charged.  It was 
pure and simple greed.  They were not making enough billions of 
dollars.  They wanted many billion more.  We are not dealing with 
companies that have corporate ethics and the well-being of the 
world as their primary concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not suggesting for a second that we do not need trade 
regulations.  I am not suggesting that we do not need recognition 
of patent protection.  I am saying that we have gone beyond 
reasonable patent protection to pure and simple greed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At one time we did not have the World Trade Organization. 
Therefore we did not have to meet those regulations.  At one time 
we would have had countries fighting for what would benefit the 
people, not for corporations making a profit.  We now have a 
number of countries agreeing to get together, not to do what is 
best for the people of the world but purely for the profit of 
corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who do we want negotiating on our behalf when we have 
governments negotiating patent agreements up because they believe 
it is right for people to have to pay millions of dollars more 
for their drugs?  I suggest that those negotiating are not doing 
their job.  Those government representatives should be saying 
that it is out of hand and that they are not doing what is best 
for the people of the world.  They should be negotiating those 
patent agreements down, not up.  If our representative is not 
doing that he is not doing his job for the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is where the changes have to be made.  It is not okay to 
accept the fact that we have a World Trade Organization that is 
protecting profits for corporations and not ensuring the 
well-being of people of the world.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole issue was related to drugs.  I will fall back on a 
comment my colleague in the Alliance mentioned, that we cannot 
have rogue states.  Was it a rogue state that went out and said 
that it wanted AIDS medications cheaper, otherwise people would 
die off by the thousands?  Was that a rogue state or was that a 
government acting responsibly for its people that said it would 
continue producing generic drugs and to heck with World Trade 
Organization rulings because that was good for people, not 
corporations? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will comment on the specific regulations that seem to have 
created the greatest problem at this point, recognizing that the 
Liberal government's approach to getting legislation through 
quickly, recognizing that we are part of the World Trade 
Organization and recognizing that by August 12 we need the bill 
through.  We know it will be passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some issues that the government could have addressed 
in the legislation that it has failed to address.  First is the 
notice of compliance regulations.  In the period of time 
available to us it is difficult to explain the whole process of 
the notice of compliance regulations, which have to come through 
the Department of Health, and their effect.  Ultimately it 
lengthens the amount of time it takes generic drugs to get on the 
market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been suggested that the period of time will not mean a 
great increase, but I suggest it could be $50 million for the few 
drugs that may be affected.  We in the New Democratic Party are 
often criticized because we say it is not that much money.  I can 
tell the House that $50 million is a lot of money.  Nobody in the 
New Democratic Party thinks any differently.  We just do not like 
the government's priorities on a number of issues, but $50 
million is a lot of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of the change from 17 years to 20 years in the 
patent regulations it could mean $300 million over a period of 
time.  That is a lot of money.  It is a huge amount of money. The 
notice of compliance regulations could have been addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rulings were made in the Senate committee.  It made 
recommendations with regard to notice of compliance.  Patent or 
brand name drug manufacturers came up with automatic injunctions 
against the generic companies to delay the process.  A comment 
was made by the supreme court.  As a result the Senate committee 
recognized that the observations were outside the purview of Bill 
S-17.  It also indicated that the minister said that things would 
be looked at.  I am just giving a general view of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Supreme Court of Canada criticized the notice of compliance 
regulations, describing them as draconian.  The high court ruling 
indicated that to subject generic drug producers to such a 
draconian regime would be manifestly unjust.  Generic drugs are 
kept out of the market immediately, without any consideration of 
the merits of either position.  According to Judge Iacobucci, 
manufacturers of generic drugs were entitled to market their 
products years earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not talking about an issue that could not be dealt with 
in the legislation or that would affect the trade ruling.  It 
would not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area of the bill that would not affect the trade ruling 
is the right of the government to make regulations related to 
stockpiling.  We have already met the criteria of no longer 
allowing stockpiling right now.  That is not happening.  Why is 
it necessary to remove the right of the government to put that 
stockpiling back in should there be a change in the World Trade 
Organization ruling?  Why not leave the right of the government 
to make that regulation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments are supposed to be doing what is best for the people 
of their countries, not meeting World Trade Organization rulings. 
Therefore that regulation could have been left in.  We would have 
adhered to the World Trade Organization ruling but still left in 
the right of the government to make the regulations.

17 years to 20 years to make sure that the World Trade 
Organization ruling was met.  However a number of patents go 
beyond 20 years.  Instead of the bill making everybody fall 
within the 20 years, some patents out there will be allowed to go 
beyond 20 years.  Why they were not all brought into the same 20 
years is beyond me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At one of the final meetings of the committee it was suggested 
that once we give someone the right to be over 20 years we cannot 
really take it back.  There seemed to be a question of that not 
being the case, that as a government we pass legislation and that 
is the way it has to be.  It leads us to question why all patents 
would not have been brought down to 20 years.  If we could move 
them from 17 years to 20 years, certainly those that had 23 years 
protection could have been brought down to 20 years as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is not coming before the House to benefit the people of 
Canada.  It will not benefit the shortage of dollars in our 
health care system.  Quite frankly it will tax our health care 
system that much more.  Again, what kind of negotiator agrees to 
something like that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to refer to another area that has not yet been 
discussed.  I represent a number of first nations communities. At 
a time when we are looking toward allowing first nations people 
the right to self-government and the right to look after their 
own affairs, I am extremely concerned with the shortage of 
adequate funds to provide the overall services first nations 
communities need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From what I have seen in the area of health transfers I have 
real concern that dollars were cut in the last year or so before 
health transfers were to take place.  I am happy to say that a 
number of first nations communities are treading very slowly into 
health transfer now because of that.  They have recognized that 
they were being shorted on funds to look after their health 
services.  They knew that taking over those health services would 
be tough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a time when first nations communities should be given 
adequate funds to take over their health services and want to do 
it, I am extremely concerned that we are accepting legislation 
that will increase the cost of health services to a large degree 
to first nations people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the conditions they have been living in, a higher 
majority of first nations people end up in our health care system 
for a variety of reasons.  Each and every one of those first 
nations communities will have increased costs related to health 
care.  From what I have seen they do not get the needed support 
dollar-wise or the increased support they need on a year to year 
basis.  I am truly concerned that they will bear a greater 
portion of the bad effects of the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard the U.S. position on how things get done by the 
Government of Canada, so I know the bill will pass.  When first 
nation communities tell us that the dollars they are being given 
for health care just do not cut it, we will need increased 
resources because of the increased cost of medications.  When the 
provinces tell us that they do not have enough money to provide 
our health care because of the increased cost, we will need to 
make sure that they are getting increased dollars to provide 
those services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what this debate is about.  It is about being forced 
into the position of having to ration what we have because we do 
not have the dollars to provide the services.  That is largely 
due to a lack of priorities within the federal government.

make sure we have the dollars to provide much needed medications 
and other services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all members to recognize that in the upcoming years after 
we pass the legislation. Even though it may only affect 30-odd 
medications, some of them are high cost medications that people 
just cannot do without right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am getting to the end of my comments on the legislation.  I 
know that my colleague from Winnipeg, our health critic, has her 
thoughts to add to it.  She has seen firsthand and dealt with the 
issue for a number of years.  She has been greatly involved for a 
number of years and has listened to people throughout Canada who 
have felt the impact of the previous increase in the patent 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly seniors groups around the country have indicated their 
objection.  There is no question that seniors were a vibrant 
force the last time the legislation came before the House. 
Because of that the government of the day was made to feel some 
shame over what it was doing.  When the present industry minister 
was in opposition he felt the same way as those seniors did, that 
it was unacceptable the government would allow it to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is part of the reason the government took a roundabout 
route to getting the legislation before the House this time.  I 
commend seniors for their fight in the past.  I know we will join 
them in the future as we continue to make sure the government 
acknowledges that it should be doing what is best for Canadians 
and not just for corporate profit.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I begin by commending and commenting on the work of the 
NDP industry critic, the member for Churchill.  She has done an 
incredible job of following the bill, pursuing amendments and 
making suggestions all the way through the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member indicated my background in health care.  I was the 
culture minister in 1986 and I was health critic for the NDP in 
the Manitoba legislature from 1990 onward.  I had to deal with 
the ramifications of the Conservative government in Ottawa making 
drastic changes to the Patent Act which put us on the course we 
are on today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time we tried very hard to get the Conservative 
government of Manitoba to speak out against Bill C-91 that had 
been brought in by the Mulroney Conservatives.  We failed in 
terms of trying to ensure that provincial voices registered clear 
opposition to those very regressive moves.  The battle continues 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My questions for the member for Churchill are threefold.  Since 
she has followed the process and been on the committee, I should 
like to know from her whether or not the government gave any 
indication of caving in further to the World Trade Organization 
and extending patent protection even further since we know from 
some of the documentary around this issue that the United States 
government has said it would see 20 years as a minimum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to know whether she heard any explanations for 
the flip-flop by the Liberals on this issue between pre-1993 and 
the actions taken since they became government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally I would like to know if she heard anything from the 
government throughout the committee process about alternatives to 
dramatically increasing prices in the field of drugs and 
solutions for a very serious problem in Canada today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not know if I can 
answer all the member's questions in the period of time I have 
available.  I was extremely annoyed toward the end of our 
committee hearings to hear some comments that maybe 20 years was 
not enough.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have already been quite sickened by the process of bringing 
the bill through the Senate and by the speed with which we are 
pushing it through the House without adequate consultation.  My 
colleague from the Alliance hopes that we get a chance in the 
fall to really discuss the bill and hear different points of 
view.  However, the bottom line is that we should not be 
approving the bill without having heard all the facts and 
recognizing that it is not legislation that will benefit people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was also sickened to hear comments saying that it was not 
enough.  I would refer to my point that this is pure and simple 
greed.  It is not a matter of not getting money back on our 
investment.  I would not suggest that for a second, but we have 
gone beyond that.  It is pure and simple greed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is there this flip-flop by the government?  We in opposition 
often hear comments that the government does it all wrong the 
moment it gets in.  I would suggest that the present industry 
minister was very vocal and critical of the Tory government when 
it was going about this process but who had an absolute flip-flop 
once he showed up in the House in the last couple of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that the flip-flop is due to the major lobbying 
effort by the brand name drug manufacturers of the government 
side.  Major investment dollars from the brand name drug 
manufacturing companies go to the Liberals. I would suggest that 
has carried far more weight than it should have.  It is 
disappointing.  I want Canadians to be on guard and to know that 
there was a suggestion of increasing the patent protection even 
further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want us all to hold each and every member of the government 
accountable for every increased health dollar that has to be 
spent as a result of the legislation or any increases that they 
might be thinking about.  I want the government to continually be 
taken to task this summer. I want the people in Canada to be a 
force out there and let the government know that it is not 
acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard my colleague from the Bloc indicate that the Bloc is in 
agreement because there are a lot of drug manufacturers in its 
province.  I want the people of Quebec to also hold the Bloc and 
its members accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anybody who supports the legislation is, in my view, wasting 
valuable health care dollars as a result of pure and simple 
greed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK31"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I always enjoy listening to the hon. member.  She has 
some interesting ideas and of course some of them I have heard 
many times before having been raised in Saskatchewan which is 
true CCF and now NDP country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to pose a problem to her.  If I build a house, 
whether I build it with my own hands or hire some workers to help 
me, it is mine.  I and my family can live in it for as long as we 
wish.  There is no time limitation on the ownership of that 
house.  Similarly, if I build an apartment, I can rent out the 
suites in it and I can collect the rent.  There is not a 17 or a 
20 year time period after which she can come in with her 
socialist friends and start collecting the rent on half of the 
suites. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I happened to be a computer programmer in a previous life.  I am 
now incompetent in that area so no one should call me.  Over the 
last eight years I have fallen way behind.  However I used to 
write computer programs which are now intellectual property.  I 
would like to know from the hon. member how many years I should 
have the ownership of a program and be able to sell it before she 
can sell it and keep the money from the program that I have 
produced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The simple point I am making is that R and D for these drugs 
companies costs millions of dollars.  The legislation says that 
after a certain time, even though a company spent the money and 
did it, it is no longer theirs and somebody else can take that 
result and use it to produce money for themselves.  How does she 
reconcile that?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would suggest that it 
is fair.  I have said that there needs to be a reasonable period 
of time where there is patent protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of rental properties, we saw the need to implement 
landlord and tenant agreements because there were landlords out 
there who were gouging tenants and tenants out there who were not 
treating the rental properties properly.  They were implemented 
under provincial legislation so it is not unheard of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though there might be millions of other people out in the 
world who have the same knowledge, they may not get a patent in 
the nick of time.  How often have we heard about a particular 
company rushing to patent something before another company does? 
It is not as if it is only this one individual who has the 
intelligence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have recognized that while we are going to give companies the 
right of first to the post and to allow a patent, we also have to 
recognize they are not the only ones with any degree of 
intelligence and that there has to be time limits on that patent. 
I am suggesting that the limits we are going by now are as a 
result of greed and not the right to get one's investment back. I 
am not saying that a person cannot make a profit, but the bottom 
line is that it has gone way beyond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is the best news I have 
heard for a long time.  One of the things I did in my previous 
life was write computer programs.  I wrote a word processing 
program before Bill Gates had even thought of it.  However, even 
though I had the intelligence, he managed to patent it first, 
which means that now after the 20 years is up I get one half of 
his money.  I am very appreciative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if the member were more 
open to a different political view he would have a right to some 
of Mr. Gates' money, but not half because he did not make it 
first to the post. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one is suggesting for a second that there should not be rules 
but we really need to balance the rights of the patent and the 
rights of the rest of the world.  That is the most important 
thing.   Above all, people need to come first no matter what we 
are dealing with. 
<P><A NAME="LINK32"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have listened with interest to much of the debate 
by previous members who have made a very compelling case and 
bring a great deal of passion to this particular debate.  This is 
understandable when we are talking about drugs, whether they be 
generic or manufactured, in the first instance, from a 
pharmaceutical company.  We know those drugs are often the 
lifesaving instrument for many individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, when we talk about consistency and the business 
elements of this issue, one has to agree that the WTO, although 
it has not set an arbitrary length of time, it has set 20 years 
for the life of a patent.  Canada is presently not fitting within 
that guideline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A ruling has given rise to Bill S-17, the legislation that is 
before us, and there is an effort on the part of the Canadian 
government and this parliament, through the legislation, to be 
consistent and in line with what the WTO has said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When applied to drug development and production, the whole 
notion of intellectual property and property protection becomes a 
very divisive issue.  It is an issue that in many ways pits 
certain sectors of this industry against one another. Patent 
protection and commercial opportunities for Canadians and 
Canadian pharmaceutical companies are on one side of the coin, 
while on the other side we hear and are certainly cognizant of 
the need for cost effective access to these new drugs and these 
technologies.  Therefore there is no question that there is an 
element of competing interest here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to recognize that without a high degree of 
investment in research and development there would never be this 
particular dilemma that we have before us.  Pharmaceutical 
companies do require an incentive just like any other business. 
It therefore stands to reason that they would want to be the 
beneficiaries of their efforts.  They want the ability to profit 
from their toil and their labour in the same manner afforded 
other industries. 
This type of protection is such that it allows companies to 
receive that reward.  In a global economy, it also encourages 
companies to come to Canada to avail themselves of that 
particular protection.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak with some personal knowledge.  I have a colleague in the 
House from New Brunswick who has been the recipient of drugs 
aimed at the treatment of cancer.  There are other very serious 
illnesses, such as AIDS, which these types of drugs are aimed 
specifically at.  Some of these drugs can alleviate the symptoms 
or even put the disease in remission.  The member from New 
Brunswick tells me that the environment created through this type 
of legislation allows companies to come to Canada.  The rationale 
behind the original legislation in the 1990s was to allow 
pharmaceutical companies that come to Canada to be open to the 
same type of protection found in other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like many other pieces of legislation, this legislation has been 
put forward to ensure that Canadian companies can be competitive 
in the world market, not just in North America and not just with 
companies here but to see that there is a level of consistency 
and an invitation to companies to come here and allow them to 
have the patent protection that they would find in the United 
States, the United Kingdom or other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ruling handed down has significant implications.  If Canada 
does not choose to follow the ruling or if it somehow lags 
behind, there are grave implications.  This is the rationale 
behind encouraging companies to come here and do their research 
and development.  To be the beneficiary of this, we need to have 
a parity with other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pharmaceutical companies that are doing research and 
development, the scientific background and the leg work that 
leads to the invention of drugs, which later become the subject 
of generic drugs, must to be encouraged to come to Canada. That 
is not to suggest that there are not occasions when generic drugs 
cannot play a significant role.  However there is a level of 
patent benefit that should flow, whether it be for 10, 15 or 20 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The continuing argument of the Progressive Conservative Party 
has been that we need to be consistent.  Canada has to be in line 
with what the WTO has said about the issue.  We have to ensure 
that availability and access is achieved.  Our efforts must be 
placed on lobbying in terms of making a case for access and 
availability of these very important drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to this issue and with respecting the credibility 
of where the government is coming from on this particular issue, 
there is some inconsistency that bears some mentioning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government took a very different stand during the initial 
debate in the 1990s and in particular in 1999 when the matter 
first came before parliament.  It is fair to say that the 
Minister of Industry himself perhaps set a whole new standard for 
hypocrisy and probably raised the bar to a whole new level, such 
that it would make the most blatant hypocrite blush when looking 
at the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The inclusion of the current provisions in the bill were very 
similar and very consistent with the original position taken by 
the Progressive Conservatives in the 1980s.  We have already 
heard other members mention this, but let me state what the 
Minister of Industry had to say initially about this particular 
issue.  In <I>Hansard</I> on April 7, 1987, the current Minister 
of Industry said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is inconceivable to me that Parliament finds it necessary yet 
again to deal with yet another measure proposed by the Government 
because it is bound and chained by some ideological dictate which 
says this kind of Patent Act is necessary.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to expound upon the evils of the direction that the 
government of day was headed in.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The citizens will need more than generic drugs to recover from 
the festering wounds which are about to be inflicted on the 
exposed ankles of Canada's poorest citizens when the Minister 
sinks his teeth in, past the bone, into the marrow and sucks the 
life's blood out of Canada's poorest citizens with Bill C-22. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-22 was of course the forerunner to this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joseph Volpe:</B>  Yes, that's what he was reading from. 
He wasn't reading from his speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  I hear some chirping across the way. 
Heaven forbid that we put into the record the actual words spoken 
by the Minister of Industry, the minister of reversals, the 
minister of rat packers, who has now in his new reincarnation 
completely reversed himself.  He has somersaulted 180° from where 
he was.  He has swallowed himself whole.  He has done so time and 
again.  He did so along with other members of the government on 
the GST, free trade, Pearson airport, helicopters and 
privatization.  The list goes on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps most recent and most pronounced was his reversal in 
terms of his commitment to the people of Newfoundland to stay in 
provincial politics.  When the bell rang and there was an 
opportunity to better himself, lo and behold, he answered that 
bell and came to Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While all that huffing, puffing and blowing and all the harping 
against the government was going on when he was among the 
unwashed in the opposition, he certainly made a wonderful case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joseph Volpe:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I have been here since the beginning of the debate and I 
have listened very intently to the merits of the debate, the 
points at issue in the discussion.  The member opposite, who is 
usually fairly eloquent in expressing his views and the people's 
views on what should be discussed, has now ranted on for the 
better part of three minutes in what can best be characterized as 
character assassination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Far be it for me to come to the defence of other members in the 
House who are capable of defending themselves but let us get— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  He's quoting his words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  I understand the member. 
I do not know if he is right or not but let us be careful and 
judicious in our choice of words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, all I can say about that 
intervention is that the truth hurts.  I am quoting into the 
record the words of the Minister of Industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The moral flexibility that has been so common in this place, 
particularly on the part of that minister, is one that does 
offend people.  It should offend the member opposite as well, 
because all the frothing and terrible finger pointing that went 
on in opposition among the current Liberals is really something 
to behold now.  It is a foghorn type of voice that we hear from 
the Minister of Industry and the real shame is that coastal 
communities back in Newfoundland are without foghorns while we 
have a perfectly good one here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to focus not only on the hypocrisy but on the 
merits of the bill, given what the member opposite said.  There 
is a certain degree of merit in allowing these pharmaceutical 
companies to be consistent and to be in a position where they can 
afford themselves patent protection.  That is what this 
legislation comes down to at the end of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Irrespective of those earlier positions, the government has, as 
it has done before, recognized the wisdom in following the 
policies put in place by the previous administration.  Even 
though it was against them at the time and made great hay by 
pointing out how terrible it would be, it has now embraced them. 
It is encouraging to see that the truth has come through and that 
the merits of a lot of those policies which were so vilified are 
now becoming recognized as the right ones for the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that in mind, the genesis of those types of drugs and that 
type of research and development, which allows these types of 
treatments to come to fruition, is what is really important here. 
We have to ensure that Canada will play a leading and pivotal 
role in the production of these types of drugs which certainly 
are meant to address in a very specific way the human ailments 
that exist.  As we speak, there also are yet undiscovered 
pharmaceutical drugs with which scientists continue to experiment 
and continue to strive to discover. 
This is what is important.  If we are to foster a very important 
and very critical industry within this country we have to be 
consistent.  We have to be prepared to open that door to the same 
protections that exist elsewhere.

that direction.  That is why we will support this bill, as we did 
in its introduction phase in the Senate of Canada, the other 
place.  It is in fact to allow the benefits to flow, to recognize 
the importance that can be reached in this country in terms of 
making those drugs available and affordable and making them 
welcome on our market that we would be supporting Bill S-17. This 
research and development practice that currently exists in our 
country is one that we have to be extremely proud of.  This is an 
industry in which Canadians can and do play a very leading role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To that end we would embrace this move for consistency, this 
move toward ensuring Canada will be a leader and an effective 
player in this market.  Bill S-17 does just that.  It is a bill 
that recognizes the need for market competitiveness and the need 
for encouragement for our own pharmaceutical industry.  It is one 
that is inviting and open to those who choose to come and 
participate in that market in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be supporting this legislation.  We look forward to this 
bill passing this House and becoming law in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the comments made by the Conservative 
member.  He was quick to point out the hypocrisy or the flip-flop 
of the Liberals in the House.  It is something we all enjoy doing 
because it is such a transparent and obvious development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the key issue in this debate is really this:  how do we 
deal with escalating drug prices in this country?  How do we deal 
with the fact that for many Canadians access to necessary 
medication is just not a reality?  It is all well and good for 
the Conservatives to chastise the Liberals and not accept 
responsibility for the current situation we are in without giving 
some solution and some explanation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough 
is this one.  What are the solutions that his party is prepared 
to offer in terms of bringing down the prices of drugs and 
ensuring that every citizen in our country today has access to 
necessary medications for their own health and well-being? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for that question.  I know she has been very much a participant 
in this issue, in this debate, and her question is relevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we address this issue of escalating drug costs?  One way 
to do that is to ensure that those drugs are being produced here 
in Canada, at home, ensuring that there will be thousands of jobs 
provided through this industry.  I believe that the current 
market will show that drugs are 40% less expensive now in Canada 
compared to the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other element is with respect to the World Trade 
Organization itself.  There is indication in the ruling that the 
impact of the ruling over an eight year period is very much aimed 
at ensuring that pharmaceutical prices do remain low and that 
Canada will continue to have access to these affordable drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The background vaunts the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board 
as having “the mandate to ensure that prices of patent medicines 
for sale in Canada are not excessive”.  There are specific 
provisions in place to address just the issue the hon. member 
raises.  I would suggest that participating in the market, 
ensuring that Canadians are producing these drugs at home and 
that we do not have to always go abroad to access and to reach 
the available levels, in and of itself is certainly aimed at 
keeping the prices down.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that the efforts being made to try to prevent 
this legislation from coming into being and to try to expand the 
market to include the generic manufacturers could be better spent 
lobbying and ensuring that the pharmaceutical producers in the 
first instance are aware certainly of their moral obligation.  If 
need be, the government would have to intervene to ensure that 
those levels are at an affordable rate and available to those 
most in need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree that this has to be the crux of the debate.  I do not 
have all the answers as to how we can ensure availability and low 
prices but I would suggest that the WTO has taken some steps in 
that direction.  The government itself has to be continually 
reminded, and hounded on occasion, to make sure there are 
affordable drugs, particularly drugs aimed at preventive measures 
and the treatment of life threatening illnesses.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough did 
mention, much to the dissatisfaction of some members across the 
way, the present Minister of Industry's outrage back in the late 
eighties when the Conservative government of the day brought in 
patent legislation.  He quoted some of the comments the present 
Minister of Industry made at the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know why there has been a big flip-flop.  Has it 
something to do with the reality of governing and the fact that 
the patent legislation did act in the fashion we thought it 
would?  In fact it did bring thousands of pharmaceutical jobs to 
Canada and preserved what we had. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you well know, Mr. Speaker, being a member of parliament very 
close to Montreal, we did establish a pharmaceutical research 
industry in that city that is one of the big engines of the 
Montreal economy, not to mention those in Mississauga and 
Toronto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the legislation did what we said it would do.  It 
preserved jobs, created more jobs and is obviously an industry we 
can count on in terms of its successes, not to mention the 
medical successes.  Would this stark reality be one of the 
reasons the present minister might have changed his position on 
the bill? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his intervention.  I know that both personally and in his 
duties here as a member of parliament and a former health critic, 
he has followed the issue consistently and has spoken out on the 
issue on numerous occasions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His question focuses on why people change their minds but more 
so on the partisan atmosphere we see here, which sometimes leads 
members in opposition to act irresponsibly, to go outside the 
bounds of constructive criticism or even sometimes warranted 
criticism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister himself has established a record of moral outrage 
and righteous indignation on issues he now embraces and has 
publicly said he embraces.  In fact he was heard recently outside 
of Canada directly congratulating the former prime minister, 
Brian Mulroney, on the introduction of the free trade agreement 
and suggesting he was wrong in opposing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is refreshing to see an hon. member actually admit he was 
wrong.  It happens so rarely that it is almost refreshing to 
people's ears to hear someone say “I was wrong.  Based on the 
information I had at the time, I made those comments and I regret 
making those comments.  Perhaps if I had had the benefit of 
hindsight and judgment I might have made a different comment”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It happens very rarely, but the Minister of Industry has a long 
track record of clamouring, making a great deal of partisan noise 
and then completely reversing himself when poised for and given 
the mantle of power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a reminder for us in opposition that we have to be 
careful, thoughtful, learned and sometimes measured in our 
criticisms of government.  It is a reminder for us to make sure 
that we do a little research and not just sound off every time 
the government introduces something.  There is a responsibility 
in opposition just as there is in government to make thoughtful 
interventions, to press the government on issues and to ensure 
that positions are backed with sound judgment and research.  If 
that were to happen I think the atmosphere and attitudes we need 
here would certainly be more digestible and acceptable to 
Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to come back 
to the issue around the Conservative policy and also address the 
issue that the member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough refuses 
to comment on.  That is the very negative impact on health care 
in Canada today and the prices of drugs as a result of the 
Mulroney government's decision to dismantle what was then 
considered to be one of the best drug laws and best patent 
protection systems around, which ensured that not only were 
Canadian companies competitive internationally, but were able to 
provide reasonable access to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The facts are very clear with regard to Bill C-22 and Bill C-91, 
that Mulroney government really jettisoned legislation that 
ensured competition between foreign and domestic drug companies, 
served most Canadians well.  The only thing that has gone up 
since the Mulroney legislation is the prices and the profit 
margins for the big corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member account for that kind of failed policy and 
indicate whether he is now prepared to get with it and support us 
in opposing this bill? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I guess the short answer 
is no.  I put my comments on the record.  I would be mirroring 
the political tact of the Minister of Industry if I was to stand 
up 30 seconds later and completely reverse myself.  I am not 
prepared to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the hon. member for the passion and the position she 
has staked out for her party and her constituents.  I guess it is 
a matter of debate.  I would suggest the record will show that in 
the long run this is the position Canada should pursue and is one 
that the Progressive Conservative Party supports. 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Eglinton—Lawrence, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I was heartened to hear the last member address the debate by 
mentioning that perhaps we in opposition would want to do some 
research.  I am not in opposition, thank God.  I am tempted to be 
flippant and ask when that will start, but I am a little more 
disciplined now, so I will not ask.  I will exercise that 
discipline.  I am simply thinking out loud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-17 is a bill designed to bring Canada into compliance 
with World Trade Organization dictates.  We have heard that from 
members on this side and in a rare moment from members on the 
opposition side.  I am not one of those people who agrees with 
that, by the way, but I am on the government side and I have 
fought the good fight.  I did not win that good fight, but 
neither has Canada nor many other countries, because they have 
weighed into balance that the advantages of participation in the 
WTO far exceed the disadvantages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, our government is attempting to bring 
legislation in line with the dictates of the WTO.  What that does 
is open up our legislation for scrutiny and remediation.  In my 
view, this is one of the cases where the opening up of the issues 
relative to patent protection affords us an opportunity to take a 
look at the issues which need to be examined and take appropriate 
action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to my previous colleague who has taken great 
opportunities to slag the character of one of our ministers, I am 
will not engage in any personality reflections.  What I will do 
is suggest that the minister, who just underwent a huge attack by 
the opposition members on a personal character basis, has already 
given his commitment, as recognized by the member for Peace 
River, that there will be an opening up of the regulations in 
order to address those issues, which may appear to be lacking at 
this moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me address the issue of patent protection.  I was on both 
sides of the House and on both sides of the debate when we 
debated Bill C-91 and when we reviewed the regulations. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1250"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not suggest for a moment that I share the same sort of 
self-confidence as the member who have spoken on this with such 
expert demeanour.  However, I have learned a bit about the 
regulations and how the industry works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate should address the workings of the industry, the 
consequences to the consumer, policies relative to health care, 
and policies related to research and development.  That means a 
whole array of educational policies, even though that sounds like 
a provincial area, as they relate to institutions that provide 
the research and development necessary for industries, like the 
pharmaceutical and biotechnological industries, of which to avail 
themselves and provide growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to have a reasoned and reasonable debate on the issues 
relative to Bill S-17, then we need to examine the successes both 
of the legislation and the regulation, as well as what the 
consequences, intended or otherwise, might be as a result of 
legislation that has been brought before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much has been made of the importance of providing patent 
protection for companies that engage in the development of 
intellectual properties.  I do not think there is anyone who 
questions that a creator of something deserves the right to 
profit from the commercialization of that invention.  We are 
really talking about the commercialization of inventions that may 
not necessarily be in the possession of the institution that 
files the patent.  The governments of any country share in some 
of that contribution to the development of those intellectual 
properties.  They do it willingly because it is an important 
element of growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sat on both the industry and health committees when the patent 
prices review board came before them and outlined what the 
outcome was of this investment in an industry for the creation of 
new product.  I am not making a distinction between generic and 
patent.  It was shocking.  As of 1999, Canada ranked dead last in 
providing brand new, innovative pharmaceutical products.  We were 
well behind countries like Belgium, the Benelux countries, Italy, 
Ireland and England. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I can enunciate those countries is because under 
these very generous patent protection conditions, which are 
available in other countries as well, Canada has been able to 
claim one product that can be classified as new and innovative. 
This is thanks to all the research and development done by those 
industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I hear the discussions on needing to have this money to 
develop a research and development industry, does that mean wet 
lab?  Does that mean pure innovation?  Does that mean that we 
have to go through the second and third phase clinical trials 
process, plus the advertising associated, plus the other 
expenses, administrative mostly, associated with getting a 
product on the market? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a fairly rigorous system for getting a product on the 
market because the Government of Canada, irrespective of its 
political stripe, is governed by one issue and one issue only. 
For a pharmaceutical product to go on the market, it must first, 
be safe and second, be effective.  Until those two are proven, 
nothing goes on the market. 
The process for getting a notice of compliance is rather 
rigorous.  That is where some of the expense is.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for research and development on the wet lab side, these 
companies are looking for places where the ideas are percolating, 
where concepts can be bought and the initial steps of research 
and development can be had for a song, otherwise they would not 
be good business people.  It does not matter who the people are 
or where they are from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government over the last eight years has provided an 
enormous amount of money for research and development to 
universities and the medical science institutes and hospitals 
associated with them, to develop that kind of an environment.  As 
Canadian citizens we expect an industry that is responsible 
enough to ensure that product comes on the market in a timely 
fashion and in a price range that is affordable both by the 
marketplace and by the patients who will hopefully profit by its 
consumption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure that has happened.  I looked at what had happened 
over the course of the last seven years in terms of prices.  More 
important, I looked at the market share by the patent holders, as 
opposed to the non-patent product producers and the generic 
producers.  Sometimes they are all one and the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We went through a huge debate in the House in the early 
nineties, as the members opposite well know.  The government of 
the day decided it would institute Bill C-91.  As a result, the 
patent protection was supposed to go up to 20 years.  Without 
going into all the details around the issue of the government, 
the one that preceded it said it wanted to create a competitive 
patent industry to ensure that prices would come down.  It said 
it would develop a research centre industry in Canada and that it 
would make these pharmaceuticals available to a broader spectrum 
of the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those governments adopted a series of legislation, in particular 
one that allowed Canadian companies to develop and produce 
product, notwithstanding the patent and the patent protection 
after a particular period of time, and only after the generic 
provided a royalty to the patent holder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-91 did away with that.  What it did not do away with were 
the regulations that allowed a patent holder, by merely alleging 
that there had been a patent infringement, to go to the courts 
and get an injunction against the competitor for producing a 
product, even though we were at the end of a patent period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does that mean?  Essentially patent holders who rightfully 
enjoy the protection of the patent period can merely make an 
allegation of infringement.  They do not have to prove it nor do 
they have to go through the exercise of the rule of law, as my 
colleague from Prince George—Peace River suggested.  They do not 
have go through courts for an injunction, where they might have 
to prove there was a patent infringement or they suffered as a 
result of that.  They simply have to make an allegation— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I am listening very closely to the speaker.  The point I 
want to make is whose side of this debate is he on?  He should be 
on this side of the House after listening to the logic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  The member knows, as 
well as I do, that is not a point of order.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joseph Volpe:</B>  Mr. Speaker, is it not wonderful to be 
in demand?  Even opposition members recognize the value of 
reasoned debate.  I compliment them on their perspectives.  I 
thank them very much and I accept the compliment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of going through the rule of law it takes advantage of a 
very special privilege.  We are not talking about duty.  We are 
not talking about obligations.  We are not talking about 
protections.  We are not talking about due right under law, 
whether national or international.  We are talking about taking 
advantage of a very special privilege that is hidden away in the 
regulations initially designed to ensure they would get their 
full 20 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that we have legislation which says they cannot have less 
than 20 years, there is this little regulation which says that if 
an allegation of infringement on a patent is made, it can be 
extended for another two years.  So what?  It is a big boy's 
game, no sexism intended.  If they do not like it, tough luck. 
This is the marketplace, which is a good place because it says 
competition will allow the percolation not only of ideas but of a 
good quality product at an attractive price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone profits.  That is what it does and what it says.  I say 
no, not in this instance.  We do not want that competition, not 
even after our legitimate 20 years are up.  We can also engage in 
something called evergreening or modifying it a little to get a 
greater extension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are no saints in this discussion.  Nor are there any 
sinners.  There are only those who are advancing their interests. 
We are trying to advance the interests of all our companies and 
industries.  We do not want to beggar any of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to bring a bit of balance to a discussion that has turned 
rather personal.  The minister has recognized that there is this 
problem.  As I indicated earlier, my colleague from the Canadian 
Alliance complimented the minister on his commitment to address 
the issue in the fall.  He is an honourable man.  Why would 
anyone disagree? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It appears members opposite are all anxious to get the 
legislation through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joseph Volpe:</B>  I am sorry, not all members.  I did not 
mean to include everyone.  If we are to meet the deadline of 
August 12 they would want the bill passed. Members would want to 
take a look at some of the issues associated with what must be 
done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must redress that very special privilege.  There should be 
none in a democratic environment, in a marketplace environment. 
There should be no special privilege industries.  Let us remove 
those privileges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke a few moments ago about the injunctions that ended up in 
court.  Of 55 cases involving patent infringement that recently 
appeared before the courts, I think 45 have been dismissed as 
being frivolous.  Under normal circumstances this would suggest 
that some companies have been taking undue advantage of an 
intention that was noble at its genesis and continues to be so. 
However, when the legislation is changed, surely regulations must 
follow the same due and proper course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues have probably looked at some of the issues I have 
raised in terms of what these companies have provided.  It is a 
valuable industry because it provides thousands of jobs.  Let us 
call the generic industry its competitor.  It too provides a 
valuable function.  It provides research jobs here in Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no theft of product.  There is a borrowing of ideas. It 
is done only after a particular period of time has elapsed.  I 
want to reassure all members here without sounding as if I am on 
one side or another.  I want to refer to what I said a moment ago 
and that is that most of the money the pharmaceutical industry 
has spent in this country on the research and development side, 
aside from the administrative and advertising side, goes toward 
clinical trials.  There is no wet lab innovation there.  It is 
just proving that a product either has efficacy or it does not 
and that it is safe or it is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the very least we are at a stage where, in a competitive 
environment, companies, whether they are generic or patent, are 
now being forced to look at making use of the research and 
development institutions that we have funded.  They are making 
use of that human and personal capital that emanates from those 
places.  They are able to do it and they should be doing it right 
here in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When members in the House deliberate on this matter, I would 
like them to think in terms of final outcomes because that should 
be what guides a reasoned and reasonable debate. Those outcomes 
have to keep in mind our health care system and what its costs 
not only on the public purse but on the private purse, on private 
energies and on private resources.  If government has a role then 
it must have a role in ensuring that the health of its people can 
be maintained at an affordable level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must ensure that those research and development institutions 
continue to thrive and that the manufacturing and marketing arms 
associated with their innovations continue to thrive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we have to take a look at the consistency and coherence 
of a comprehensive plan that allows for industries to emerge, 
thrive and benefit the marketplace which demands its product. The 
marketplace includes our constituents, colleagues, friends, 
families and everybody who may require a pharmaceutical product 
down the road.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the speech made by the member for 
Eglinton—Lawrence.  He spoke with a great deal of passion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we have to get to the bottom of this.  On the one hand 
the member stands up and acts as if he is addressing a new area 
for which he is prepared to push his government on and, on the 
other hand, he fails to acknowledge just how much his own 
government has been negligent in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about notice of compliance regulations.  We are 
talking about the fact that the Brian Mulroney government failed 
to eliminate the injunction that gave brand name drug companies 
another two year protection beyond the 20 years.  We are talking 
about a Liberal government that in 1998, rather than address the 
situation, actually made it worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want the member to account for the decision by his own 
Minister of Industry in March 1998 to push through changes to the 
notice of compliance regulations, which actually evoked the ire 
of Canadians, health organizations and the generic drug industry. 
Those individuals and organizations were very concerned and went 
so far as to suggest that the Minister of Industry was doing 
nothing more than being a servant of foreign owned multinational 
drug companies.  They called for his resignation because, as they 
noted, the government did exactly what Brian Mulroney did in 
1993.  It moved with haste to respond in the best interests of 
the brand name drug companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How in heaven's name can the member stand up today and show such 
indignation over something that his government should have and 
should have acted but refused to act on?  We are now left with a 
situation where we are not dealing with a 20 year patent 
protection but at least a 22 year patent protection.  Could he 
account for that kind of two faced position and that kind of 
flip-flopping?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joseph Volpe:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thought we had emerged 
from the position of character assassination, but I guess that is 
a standard that is a little too high for most people to meet. 
However, in my own humble fashion, I shall make the effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I took some pains to describe that there have been battles 
fought, some won, some lost, some mitigated and some not.  I have 
made efforts as a member of parliament, as I know you have, Mr. 
Speaker, and as have other colleagues on this side of the House. 
I do not know what happens in other caucuses but in our own 
caucus we really encourage diversity of debate.  The reason we do 
that is because we cannot prevent it.  We all come from different 
parts of the country.  We were all elected by different 
constituencies representing different interests and we are here 
to ensure that those points of view formulate what will emerge as 
a Canadian view of life.  We cannot do it if we are all silenced, 
so we speak up.  Unfortunately that does not jibe with the 
perception of opposition members of what happens, but that is 
what life is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We fight our fights and we move on.  We would like to win them 
all.  We would like to have our own philosophy and be the 
singular imprint on the decisions of any government.  I would 
like to do that.  People did not elect me to be the absolute 
ruler of the country, much as I would like to be.  I would 
probably end up getting hung but I would still like to have the 
opportunity to glory in my own errors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the marketplace has decided that my point of view is not 
the only one.  I acknowledge that and I accept it.  What I am 
doing today, even if it bothers some members of the opposition, 
is reminding them that we already have a commitment to get a 
change that nobody on that side has pointed out yet, save the 
member opposite who just asked me the question and her colleague 
who indicated that there is a special privilege that must be 
removed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where do I stand?  I have already said that, yes, we must 
comply.  We need to comply with world trade organizations because 
we believe in a world that is rules based and we want the same 
rules based here in this country to operate internally.  If that 
is a principle worth fighting for, will the members of the 
opposition begrudge me the opportunity to stand in the House, to 
which I was elected, and say that this is what we need to do and 
to compliment my Minister of Industry for having had the courage 
to say that is what we are going to do? 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the more I listen to the member the more confused I get 
regarding his position.  Clearly, he does not, in his own mind, 
in an intellectual way support the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of intellectual aerobatics is the member performing? 
If he does not believe in it, which he obviously does not, how 
can he come into the House and support it?  It makes absolutely 
no sense on an intellectual basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know he is entitled to his point of view and he has 
articulated that point of view, but what kind of aerobatics, what 
kind of trickery is he practising here?  He says one thing and 
will vote in another fashion when Bill S-17 comes before the 
House for its final vote.  How can he do it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joseph Volpe:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am sorry the member is 
confused.  I indicated earlier on, to my great my surprise, that 
this was one of those few bills that seems to have the support of 
opposition members.  Members of the Canadian Alliance and the 
Bloc Quebecois have said that they have absolutely no qualms at 
all about the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of that party come into the House with no analysis and 
no deductions but all kinds of presumptions.  I do not know what 
analysis they have because I have not heard them.  I have only 
heard character assassinations and that they will support the 
bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A member of the House, no matter what side of the House he or 
she is on, may have a view that, without false modesty, is based 
on a modicum of research.  Members may assail such a view and say 
that it is not based on thorough research, but it is based on 
research nonetheless.  The view may not be consistent with what 
the members think the government wants, but it might be well 
reasoned and draw support for the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been sitting here all morning and members from the 
opposition have been slagging the government for virtually 
everything it has done.  I am surprised we are still breathing. 
If one has a view and reasons it out in debate, which may be a 
novel word for members of the opposition, then one exercises the 
opportunity.  Debate allows people to vent and voice their views 
and it lets members know their views are not ignored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition is incapable of performing its minimum duty. 
There are absolutely no negative consequences to expressing a 
reasoned and reasonable view in the House of Commons.  We in the 
government do so without false modesty and with the backing of 
all who have supported us.  That is an alien concept to the 
members opposite.  In my own defence I can only refer to the 
introduction of the member.  He is confused. 
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
colleague on the opposite side talked about the minister being an 
honourable man.  That honourable man spoke in a totally different 
way when he was in opposition.  I want to make that point clear. 
I will not bring out the reams of comments he made in the House 
criticizing this type of legislation when he was in opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague talked about a rules based economy and our need for 
rules.  I will give an example from Haiti where rice is the main 
staple food.  Until free trade was instituted, Haitian farmers 
grew the bulk of the rice they needed to feed their country. Very 
little was imported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the mid-eighties, Haiti was forced to comply with IMF rules 
to lift tariffs on imported rice.  As a result, Haiti was flooded 
with highly subsidized rice grown in the United States.  Haitian 
farmers were unable to compete with U.S. subsidized prices and 
were put out of business.  That is a wonderful example of a rules 
based economy from the IMF. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give another example in pharmaceutical— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  I am sorry to interrupt 
the hon. member.  The hon. member for Eglinton—Lawrence has time 
for a very brief response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joseph Volpe:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is not much to say. 
I can only applaud the member for having a philosophical position 
and basis for her discussions.  Philosophy is a good point of 
departure for any debate.  However, as I said earlier, I thought 
we were going on the facts and issues relative to the bill.  That 
is what I focused my comments on.  I am willing to acknowledge 
that other people have different philosophies. 
<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to address an issue 
of fundamental importance to many Canadians.  It is interesting 
for anyone following the debate to notice what is happening in 
this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it were not for the NDP there would be no voices of 
opposition to one of the most regressive social policies in the 
history of the country.  Any observer watching what is happening 
in this place will know that the tables have been turned.  New 
Democrats in the House are calling for competition in the 
marketplace while Liberal members, supported by the Alliance and 
Conservative Parties, are suggesting that we need more welfare 
for corporations, more subsidization of the brand name drug 
industry and more socialism when it comes to big corporations and 
drug manufacturers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us bring some reason to the debate.  We are talking about 
ensuring that our legislation provides for reasonable prices in 
terms of drugs and necessary medications in the marketplace 
today. 
We are talking about formulating public policy that addresses 
fundamental values, priorities and philosophies around our health 
care system.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the comments made by members of the Alliance 
earlier today and their suggestion that one should never tamper 
with the marketplace. They say we are talking about investment by 
individuals and private interests which have the right to accrue 
benefits in perpetuity because of a one time investment or 
personal commitment over a period of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are talking about today is something I thought was a 
rock bottom value: a non-profit, universally accessible health 
care system.  That is the framework we are operating from in 
trying to address drug policy.  We are trying to address rapidly 
rising pharmaceutical prices and at the same time have a 
universally accessible public health care system.  We are trying 
to balance the two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are trying to preserve, support and stabilize medicare but we 
cannot do that in the context of unfettered access to the 
marketplace.  We cannot do that in the context of a complete cave 
in and a weak position by the Liberal government.  We cannot do 
that by simply backing off and, as the Alliance members would 
say, letting the survival of the fittest philosophy take 
precedence in society today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The context is a universal, non-profit, publicly administered, 
accessible health care system.  In that context let us be clear. 
We must find a way to bring down drug prices.  There is no 
question about it.  We simply cannot go on with the way things 
are now.  We cannot sustain medicare and ensure access by all 
Canadians to necessary medications at this rate.  We must take 
action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the government is proposing with Bill S-17 totally flies in 
the face of its rhetoric and its statements suggesting that 
medicare is a program it believes in and wants to sustain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am somewhat agitated as I begin my speech, having listened to 
the hon. member for Eglinton—Lawrence.  We have dealt with this 
time and time again.  The government takes a strong position that 
is regressive and problematic for Canadian society, and then 
there is always a backbencher from the Liberals who stands and 
tries to pretend the Liberals are coming from a different 
position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Eglinton—Lawrence will have to decide if he 
is supporting government policy or not.  His government had a 
chance to deal with a very difficult situation around the two 
year injunction provisions and did not.  The government made them 
worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad the parliamentary secretary to the Minister of 
Industry is here.  He will know that two or three years ago the 
then minister of industry made the situation with respect to 
patent protection for brand name drug companies even worse. The 
hon. member for Eglinton—Lawrence has the gall to stand in the 
House today and suggest the issue is not so bad.  He suggests the 
extension of patent protection to bring us into compliance with 
the WTO is not so bad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real issue is that this place has never really addressed the 
1993 decision of the Mulroney Conservative government not to 
eliminate the provision allowing drug companies to have another 
two years because of legal cases pertaining to the generic 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very difficult for us in the House to accept that kind of 
two faced positioning on the part of the Liberals.  The Liberals 
must decide where they stand.  Liberal members who disagree with 
the government must stand and say so and vote accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear that in 1998 the Minister of Industry had an 
opportunity to deal with the situation the hon. member for 
Eglinton—Lawrence has commented on.  He did not.  He made the 
situation worse. 
Everything the government has done smacks of the Brian Mulroney 
approach to policy making when it comes to drug pricing and 
patent protection.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate is very important to us.  We are doing whatever we 
can to oppose Bill S-17 and for good reason.  Notwithstanding the 
substance of the issue, we have grave concerns about the fact 
that the bill was sponsored through the Senate.  In our view that 
is a symbol of how embarrassed the government must be to bring in 
changes that fly in the face of everything it has said and done 
in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hard for us to accept a bill coming from the Senate 
because the government has used the Senate when convenient and 
refused to allow bills from the Senate when not convenient. There 
is a two faced, double edged approach to the whole process around 
legislation that must be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps there is some rationale, some way to understand a bill 
of this nature coming from the Senate.  A bill has been sponsored 
by an unelected, unaccountable body, the Senate, in direct 
response to the government caving in to a decision by another 
unelected, unaccountable body, the World Trade Organization. 
Perhaps there is a message in that in terms of what the 
government is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Needless to say, it is repugnant to us that the government is 
bringing in the bill in the first place.  It is made even more 
repugnant by the fact that it chose the Senate to do its dirty 
business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know very clearly what the bill intends to do.  I will say it 
once more.  It would amend the Patent Act to implement two recent 
decisions of the World Trade Organization.  One relates to 
patents filed before October 1, 1989, and the other pertains to 
the stockpiling provisions under the Patent Act.  The essence of 
these two aspects of Bill S-17 is more protection for brand name 
pharmaceutical corporations that want to hang on to their patents 
and prevent competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we have said over and over again, and why I was so interested 
in the comments of the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, is that the bill would round out 
and add to the policies put in place by the Mulroney 
Conservatives.  We are dealing with a chain reaction, a 
continuation and enhancement by the Liberal government of the 
policies begun under Brian Mulroney and the Conservatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the symbolism of the bill is more important in terms of 
understanding what kind of government we are dealing with.  The 
bill symbolizes how much the Liberal Party has moved away from 
its tradition of providing balanced government and trying to 
ensure the needs of Canadians are protected in the face of 
globalization and corporate needs.  That whole agenda has been 
transformed.  Today we are at a point where the government 
decides it is appropriate to cave in the minute the WTO makes its 
rulings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was time.  The government did not have to cave in 
immediately.  There was ample opportunity to carve out a 
different position and stand up to the World Trade Organization. 
It chose not to.  Why? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One could say it is a result of the government's general agenda 
to pursue globalization at all costs. It could be due to its 
desire to succumb not to a rules based trade agenda, as the 
member for Eglinton—Lawrence suggested, but to an unfair free 
trade approach that puts the needs of corporations like brand 
name drug companies ahead of individual rights and the needs of 
our health care system as a whole.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is probably worth noting that in fact Bill S-17 was directly 
in response to the United States demanding interest patent 
protection.  As my colleague from Churchill has said, it was in 
response to the government of a powerful country in the world 
today that believes a 20 year patent protection is but a minimum. 
That does not bode well for the future in terms of where the 
government might take this country given its tendency to cave in 
at every chance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is that these decisions and this law will have a 
very negative impact on when generic versions of brand name drugs 
become available on the Canadian market.  The bottom line is that 
the bill means a delay in getting generic drugs on the market 
after a patent has expired.  The bottom line is that patent 
termination of some 30 or more commercially significant drugs, 
previously protected under the old provisions prior to October 1, 
1989 will be extended.  The bottom line is that we will be faced 
with tremendous delays in terms of the potential entry into the 
marketplace of generic substitutes, as the terms of decree of 
October 1, 1989 patents expire between now and 2009. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is that we will be dealing with much greater 
costs for our health care system as a whole, with the significant 
burden of that being placed on individuals across Canada.  In 
fact some would estimate that this simple move on the part of the 
government to cave in to U.S. pressures and the WTO ruling will 
cost us over $100 million, just on its own, never mind the 
ongoing and ever rising costs in terms of patent protection or 
the other ways in which brand name drug companies can use the 
system to further their bottom lines, improve their profits and 
cost Canadians consumers even more.  Just in terms of this bill 
alone there is a tremendous cost for a system that is under 
enormous pressure and cannot really handle or withstand any more 
increases than it is already facing today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier I asked a question.  Is this an indication of a 
government completely abdicating responsibility in the face of a 
world trade agenda or is it a government that truly believes it 
has found a way to bring down drug prices and preserve our health 
care system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the answer is obvious.  We have a government that is 
committed to jumping to it whenever the World Trade Organization 
makes a ruling.  We have a government that feels it must always 
cater to the big corporate interests of society today.  It is 
interesting to note that the minute the WTO made its ruling on 
the U.S. complaint back in December 1999, the Canadian Chamber of 
Commerce told the government to get on with it.  The government 
chose to get on with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was time to develop a position to deal with the impact of 
such a decision, time to delay and certainly time to put in place 
provisions to counter the impact of the World Trade Organization 
ruling.  Instead this government chose to jump to it.  It did 
exactly what the chamber said and got on with it, bringing in 
Bill S-17 through the back door and forcing it through the House 
as quickly as possible so that it would be implemented well in 
advance of the deadline actually provided by the WTO, which is 
December. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note that before this past election the 
federal government and the Minister of Industry actually said 
that non-compliance was not out of the question, that they were 
looking at all options and that different possibilities were on 
the table.  Yet the minute the election was over the government 
slipped in Bill S-17 through the back door and into this place. 
Unless we can stop it today it will become law and it will set us 
back enormously in terms of our health care agenda in the country 
today.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, the member for Winnipeg—Transcona, who is also 
our trade critic, says it all when he points out that Canada has 
hoisted itself on its own petard.  It has brought on these 
problems itself by playing a game on the free trade front and 
going after certain countries when it is in disagreement with the 
actions they take to protect the interests of their citizens and 
then having to face the consequences of other nations going after 
Canada when we are trying to protect our own interests.  The fact 
of the matter is that we are facing the results of a game being 
played out on the world front that is contrary to any notion of 
democracy and certainly contrary to the idea of a nation state 
controlling its own agenda and setting policies that benefit its 
own citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are facing the consequences of the Liberal approach to trade, 
which really is at the root of the problem.  I know it is not the 
time and place to get at the whole trade question, but it would 
be far more productive for the government to address the root of 
the problem than to simply say that these are WTO rules and we 
have to cave in, there is nothing we can do about it, and then 
try to cover its tracks by suggesting that the Liberals were 
really wrong all along prior to 1993 by suggesting that there was 
anything wrong to begin with in regard to the Mulroney 
government's decision to change our Patent Act and to add many 
years of patent protection for brand name drug companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be far better if the government said it is in a 
difficult position, some of it brought on by itself, and it now 
has to address it so let us be honest about what is happening and 
try to correct the situation.  Instead we had a cave in and then 
a confession of previous statements made around patent 
protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However this has unfolded, and I come back to this again and 
again, the bottom line is that it has an enormous impact on the 
ability of our health care system to be sustained in the future. 
Let us look at what we are talking about.  We are talking about 
an increase in drug prices.  The recent study from CIHI, the 
Canadian Institute for Health Information, shows an almost 100% 
increase in drug prices in the last few years of this decade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about 10% of Canadian people who have no drug 
insurance and another 10% who are under insured.   We are talking 
about a patchwork of entitlements, about people making difficult 
decisions between buying the drugs and medications they need to 
deal with their particular health conditions and putting food on 
the table and about seniors with chronic illnesses who have 
horrible decisions to make.  We are talking about enormous 
pressures on provincial health care systems that are making our 
system more and more unsustainable.  Really we are talking about 
a self-fulfilling prophecy when we put it all together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our objective today is to put in place reasonable public 
policies to sustain our health care system.  We believe that the 
patent protection measures taken by the government previously and 
under Bill S-17 only aid and abet the agenda of brand name drug 
companies and do nothing to keep our prices in line, and they 
certainly contribute to the steady erosion of medicare.  That has 
to be stopped.  That is why we stand today and urge the 
government to reconsider.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I was very pleased to hear the intervention of the hon. 
member for Winnipeg North Centre.  I know it is an issue that she 
has spoken passionately about in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I too have taken a great interest in the issue of drug patents, 
going back all the way to my candidacy in 1992 when I was first 
elected as a Liberal candidate.  It was a big issue in my riding. 
The hon. member will know that I have no generics in my riding. 
However, I do have two brand name manufacturers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue, however, has not garnered a lot of attention outside 
of the few members of parliament who have talked about it, 
including the member for Eglinton—Lawrence, who has also stood 
shoulder to shoulder with me on this issue over the past several 
years.  It came as a bit of a surprise to see in the <I>Hill 
Times</I> a headline that suggests something very different from 
what I suggested in terms of the interview.  I want to apologize 
to members for that.  It is simply important for me to illustrate 
that the headline, which I had no control over, had nothing to do 
with the comments I made.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>More important, though, is the question I have for the hon. 
member.  The motion I brought into committee dealt with the 
question of the automatic injunction, which gives the effect of 
extending drug patents well beyond the 20 year patent regime. The 
hon. member also knows that when new drug prices are brought 
forward Canada is related to the other seven nations, the top 
nations that have the privilege of having a warehouse or head 
office in their own countries.  We also know that when we talk 
about R and D, the $900 million, much of it is for advertising. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the hon. member if she would comment on some 
of the methodologies of the PMPRB, which tend to give a very 
distorted view of what Canadians are actually paying when it 
comes to high drug costs, and on the overall implications for 
Canada's number one concern, the health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
question.  I am glad for the member's support of our position to 
the extent that he has stated.  It was also curious to hear that 
he, like the member for Eglinton—Lawrence, has suggested that 
there is an avenue of action not yet taken.  That is the 
elimination of the injunction in the notice of compliance 
regulations, which actually tack on more years to the present 20 
year protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come back to the fact that the government had an opportunity 
to address that situation, chose not to and in fact in 1998 made 
it worse.  How does any Liberal member stand in the House and 
raise this issue knowing full well that his own government and 
the Minister of Industry have taken action that flies directly in 
the face of that very reasonable suggestion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course I support the elimination of the provision that gives 
brand name drug companies another two years to fight for their 
rights, adding another couple of years onto an already lengthy 
and overly generous patent protection provision.  I also believe 
that there are many other courses of action we can pursue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about some of the provisions and a review of 
the policies of the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board.  We 
absolutely support the kinds of suggestions he is making.  I wish 
we could have received support for the suggestions we have made 
over the last number of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the member is fully aware of an Industry Canada draft 
report that came out prior to 1997 and made very strong 
recommendations, one being that the government should ask the 
World Trade Organization to re-evaluate 20 year patents on drugs 
and should take all steps to foster international co-operation on 
the problems of drug costs and utilization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that makes the point very well that the government could 
have done something other than cave in to the WTO.  There is 
another viewpoint and there were other avenues available to the 
minister.  It obviously chose not to take them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is that the draft report by Industry 
Canada suddenly was revised, amended and changed.  Different 
recommendations came forward in the post-1997 election period 
because some considerable political work was done behind the 
scenes to make sure that the amendments were compatible with the 
dictates of the minister at the time and the overall agenda of 
the government, which was not to operate in the best interests of 
fair prices and policies that protect consumers but to cater to 
brand name drug companies, to deny opportunities for generic 
companies to compete in the marketplace and to condone ever 
increasing prices that harm our health care system and deny 
necessary drugs to consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the Liberal member who just spoke, and to 
others, is this:  when will they convince their own government to 
actually take action on the recommendations that were made in the 
past in the consultations leading up to 1997?  When will the 
member and others join with us in trying to force policy changes 
that will bring into play a more competitive marketplace and 
fairer prices for all?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Comartin (Windsor—St. Clair, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I commend both the member for Winnipeg North Centre and the 
member for Churchill for their comments today.  They spoke with 
passion, sincerity and some degree of eloquence on this point.  I 
will make a comment and then ask a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my understanding that the major argument from the major 
pharmaceutical companies is that they need more money in order to 
do their research and development.  Is the member for Winnipeg 
North Centre aware that as much as 50 cents of every dollar that 
the pharmaceutical companies spend is spent, not on research and 
development, not on basic administration of their companies but 
on promotion, marketing and advertising? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a supplementary question, what effect would this have on any 
potential for a pharmacare program in the country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the question about 
the profitability of brand name drug companies is a very 
important one because members of the four parties who support 
Bill S-17 feel that the excessive profits of these drug companies 
should be allowed to become even more exorbitant.  Profits for 
brand name drug companies are already triple the industrial 
average and this industry is probably the second, if not the 
first, fastest growing industry in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not talking about companies that are making modest 
profits and getting a return on their investment.  We are not 
talking about a corporate sector that is necessarily investing in 
new innovative changes and approaches to our health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard time and again from many witnesses and from people 
in the House over the course of the debate that drug companies 
often invest in me too drugs.  They often invest in developing 
and finding new terminologies for disorders so they can take a 
drug on which the patent is about and give it a new name in 
response to a new disorder that they have defined themselves and 
get another patent extension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Brand name companies use all kinds of games and manipulative 
practices to extend patent protection.  Whatever the rules or 
laws of the land are, they will find a way around them.  I do not 
believe we are getting a fair return on our investment.  It ends 
up that taxpayer money and public revenues are subsidizing the 
extremely wealthy, profitable corporate entities that are 
monopolizing the field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, we are subsidizing and giving welfare to 
these monolithic entities that are denying competition from the 
generic industry.  That does not bode well for pharmacare and 
medicare.  It does not bode well for Canadians who want access to 
drugs when they need them or to have hope of new research and the 
development of new products that will deal with changing 
circumstances and different issues.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When I first came to the House of Commons in 1988, some four

had in the House of Commons was pushing the main financial 
institutions of the country to do more for small business.  I 
stand here today to say a bigger issue is the challenge that we 
have as parliamentarians to deal with the most profitable 
companies in the world, the pharmaceutical drug manufacturers.

stand here today saddened that we have not been able to meet all 
our objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side of the House are blessed with having a member of 
parliament who has essentially devoted a great portion of his 
parliamentary career to dealing with the technicalities, the 
specifics and the development of a proper policy in the 
particular area of pharmaceuticals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support everything that my colleague from

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, there seems to be monumental confusion among government 
members on whether or not they support the bill, given their past 
record of opposing it going back to the days when they were in 
opposition and fought tooth and nail against anything to do with 
patent legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We just heard from the member for Eglinton—Lawrence, the former 
chairman of the health committee, who spent a career opposing 
this issue.  He made a huge intellectual leap or performed a high 
wire act.  Members who are totally concerned about the merits of 
the legislation, and rightfully so given their past history, are 
now telling us that they will stand in the House of Commons and 
support something they do not believe in.  We need an 
explanation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is something that the 
members of the Canadian Alliance and the Conservative Party have 
yet to understand.  In the Liberal Party there are many of us— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  The Liberals are hypocrites. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Mills:</B>  No, we are not hypocrites.  We realize 
that we never get everything we want within our own government, 
within our own executive, but at least we support our team.  At 
the same time as we provide constructive and rigorous debate we 
can still hold our team together, which is something, I say 
humbly, my friends in the Conservative Party have yet to figure 
out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there must be total and 
utter confusion in the minds of the Canadian people.  Two members 
have just spoken that do not support the government's position 
but will stand in the House like trained seals to support 
something they do not believe in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does that tell us about this institution called parliament? 
The Prime Minister can crack the whip, fold in, stand and vote 
for something that they do not believe in.  How can they 
rationalize that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am trying hard to 
communicate to the member that many of us on this side of the 
House are not comfortable with the direction in which we are 
heading in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However we have world trade agreements that we have to work 
with.  Unlike members of the Conservative Party, if they do not 
get their way immediately they change, they alter and they bolt. 
We believe that through a steady process and persistence 
eventually the executive of our government will come to see our 
position.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to offer the member for New Brunswick 
Southwest a bit of variety in terms of how he might want to 
rephrase his questions because it is obvious that he keeps asking 
the same questions.  Let me provide him with a very simple 
answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His party had an opportunity in committee to examine a motion 
that would have dealt with an issue de facto that is increasing 
and extending patent protection beyond 20 years.  No member of 
parliament in the House voted for it, but it was written in the 
regulations and is a mockery of our legal system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member talks about the Patent Act as it relates to the 
ability of the drug manufacturing industry exclusively to claim 
an automatic infringement without even a shred of evidence.  It 
has been built into the legislation.  The hon. member's party had 
an opportunity to look at that point, open it up, and perhaps 
question in committee about it, but instead it defeated it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to deal with what is at issue.  Bill S-17 is about 
respecting our WTO commitments.  There is no doubt the government 
and the minister have bravely moved ahead to ensure that the 
timetable is met.  I compliment them for that and I believe we 
all agree that it should be met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an obligation to look at the 1997 committee report of 
parliament which said in Recommendations Nos. 4 and 5 that we had 
to deal with regulations which were created after parliament had 
an opportunity to look at them. As members of parliament we are 
accountable to all people of Canada.  Yet we have regulations 
which clearly and demonstrably have been shown to be more 
excessive than what parliament intended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada's witnesses before the committee made very clear 
that the minimum extension of infringement as a result of this 
ridiculous automatic injunction, which exists nowhere in law and 
puts the reverse onus on the person applying for a new patent, 
creates a situation where at least 14 months is the guaranteed 
extension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the effect on the Canadian public and the health care 
system?  Obviously these are issues the Conservative Party and 
that member choose to ignore.  We on this side of the House 
recognize the international obligations but at the same time want 
to make sure we have laws and regulations consistent with public 
expectation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an earlier speech the same hon. member commented on the west 
island of Montreal and other places across Canada that are doing 
very well.  If the hon. member really cared about understanding 
where we are relative to fantasyland, he would have asked a 
question that was raised in committee:  Why is it that Canada is 
now recording a $4 billion trade deficit when it comes to 
pharmaceuticals when it was only at $1 billion in 1993?  Is this 
his vaunted research and development? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about research and development.  We now find that a 
good deal of the $900 million is nothing more than advertising. 
Does the hon. member not find a problem with trying to tell 
Canadians on the one hand that they are getting lots of research 
and development when it is advertising to continue the 
opportunity of these companies to make a bit more money at the 
same time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the highest prices for drugs in the world. The hon. 
member did not want to talk the question of relativity to other 
countries. It strikes me that we have a drug regime in which 
Canadians are paying among the highest prices in the world. 
Seventy per cent of the people in my province do not have 
adequate drug protection.  They are people from my age all the 
way up to age 64.  If these issues could be raised perhaps there 
would be some impetus to create an opportunity for us to deal 
with our health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope hon. members on the other side are listening.  The 
government and this party are.  I wish they would.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Shortly after the union of Canada in February 1841, a large 
building on the shore of Lake Ontario and Kingston that was 
originally commissioned as a hospital, was rented out to the new 
Government of Canada to house the legislative council and the 
legislative assembly.  Eventually, however, Kingston's 
insufficient number of office buildings forced parliament to move 
to Montreal where it opened on November 28, 1844. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thanks to the hard work of Mr. Ian Milne and Dr. Margaret Angus, 
the founders of First Capital Day, the occasion of Kingston's 
choice as Canada's first capital has been marked with much 
celebration for the past three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of myself and the very popular member for Kingston and 
the Islands, I would like to congratulate those behind the 
organizing of First Capital Day in Kingston and wish them a very 
successful celebration this June 15.

transportation safety in our country is in question with

truck driver hours, heavier trucks, and a weak national safety 
code add to highway risk.

that were ignored.  The inspector was friends with the boat owner 
and the inspector's brother did renovations on the boat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the Liberal government respond?  Boats this size will 
no longer be inspected.  It rammed the Marine Liability Act 
through parliament without ensuring mandatory liability insurance 
for boat owners.

which the government has taken no position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read it for the first time this noon.  I did not find the

someone in the government who censured it.  It is certainly not 
the academic who censured his own work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the federal government's strategy, should we expect, in 
the next four years when the surpluses will vary between $70

consolidate transfers to the provinces.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta—South Richmond, Canadian

Bay or at all.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the Mi'kmaq in Nova Scotia do not enjoy an 
aboriginal right to harvest lobster for food.  Why does the

should refrain from talking about things that are before the

just the opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are working with the churches and eventually the victims to 
try to settle the matter outside the litigation process.  If the

telling us that the reason we have to import such volumes is to 
meet domestic demand.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, allow me to clarify this issue once again. There 
has been no restriction on imports and exports of breaded cheese 
sticks for 20 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have always refrained from imposing such controls, because 
this dairy product has more bread crumbs than cheese. If we 
subject this product to our supply management system, it could 
create quite a problem for us, since such a measure could be 
challenged by the United States. This is an irresponsible 
option, in my opinion. Our approach is to reopen the U.S. market 
and to go back to the situation that has existed for 20 years.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Neigette-et-la Mitis, BQ):</B> Mr.

in 1995. It is as if he ignores that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Americans, for their part, have been prohibiting access to 
their market since 1999 to foreign cheese sticks and they 
respect the quotas that they have agreed on, something Canada is 
not doing.

cannot be pastured because the water wells and the dugouts lack 
water.

money four days after the renewal of this year's budget.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food,

We are certainly pleased that some rain did fall on much of that 
area yesterday, and we hope that it continues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PFRA allocates a sum of money each year to assist in dugouts

this year and that money has been allocated for this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the hon. member that in the reallocation of safety nets 
last year the province of Alberta received an additional $34

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Kevin Sorenson (Crowfoot, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr.

PFRA supports community or group projects, but individual farmer 
and rancher projects will only be considered depending on the 
availability of funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is cold comfort to people like Dale Fagin of Hardisty and

</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK179">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK180"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-28, an act to amend the 
Parliament of Canada Act, the Members of Parliament Retiring 
Allowances Act and the Salaries Act, be read the second time and 
referred to committee of the whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak to 
Bill C-28, which I had the honour to introduce yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of parliament, we have a responsibility for fairness 
and accountability in all of our work in this House as 
representatives of Canadian taxpayers.  This is particularly true 
for the matter of parliamentary compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Parliament of Canada Act requires that an independent 
commission be set up after each election to review the allowances 
of parliamentarians.  A commission, chaired this time by the hon. 
Ed Lumley, was appointed on January 12 of this year.  The Lumley 
commission's report was tabled last Tuesday, May 29, in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Lumley commission concluded that the current compensation 
for parliamentarians needed to be made more transparent and 
brought into line with compensation for other similar 
professions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commission remarked: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliamentarians' salaries are important, not just to the 
members of parliament themselves, but to all citizens; certainly, 
how we compensate members of parliament can influence the ability 
to attract good candidates. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us today is straightforward.  It implements the 
Lumley commission's recommendations. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me outline the key provisions of the bill.  First, the 
current tax free allowance is eliminated.  Many people had asked 
for that.  It is to be converted into a taxable amount and added 
to the base salary of parliamentarians.  This will increase the 
transparency in parliamentary compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the base salary of members is to be increased by 20%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, a new allowance is provided for committee chairs and 
vice-chairs.  This recognizes the valuable contribution and the 
responsibilities of such workloads.  It also builds on the 
commitment the government made in the throne speech to increase 
Library of Parliament research and support parliamentary 
committees.  Together these measures will strengthen our 
committee system as part of our ongoing work on parliamentary 
reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, parliamentary compensation would be based from here on 
in on the compensation of the supreme court chief justice.  This 
is not a new idea.  Officers of parliament, such as the 
information commissioner and the chief electoral officer, already 
receive the same compensation as a federal court judge, so the 
precedent is there for officers of the House.  What we are 
proposing here is to do the same for parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Bill C-28, the prime minister would receive the same 
compensation as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, not one 
dollar more but the same compensation.  Most Canadians probably 
believe that was already the case.  Ministers would receive 74% 
of the salary of the chief justice; parliamentary secretaries, 
55%; and members of the House, 50%.  Senators would receive 50% 
of the salary of the chief justice, minus $25,000, which is the 
difference between the current tax free allowance between the 
House and the senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would restore parliamentary compensation closer to the 
levels we used to have.  For example, members may be interested 
to note that in 1963, when the Deputy Prime Minister was first 
elected to parliament, or thereabouts, a member of the House of 
Commons earned at the time 12% more than a federal court judge. 
Today a member earns 54% less than the same judge. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1510"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT55"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT55"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1510
<A HREF="#LINKT56"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT54"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if the bill were to pass, which I hope it will, a member 
would still earn 36% less than a judge when the same person would 
have earned more a few decades ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1980 the prime minister earned 28% more than the chief 
justice of the supreme court.  Today, as we speak, the Prime 
Minister earns 42% less than the chief justice.  Under the bill 
the Prime Minister would earn the same salary, not more but the 
same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the future, changes to the compensation of the chief justice 
would be applied to parliamentarians.  This means that the 
current political process for parliamentary compensation will 
end.  Under Bill C-28 parliamentary compensation would apply to 
results of the completely independent and non-partisan process 
established for judicial compensation.  If it is any consolation, 
if we adopt the bill hopefully we will not have to go through 
this exercise again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will not have to be placed in the sometimes difficult 
position, and I acknowledge that it is for some, of having to 
decide their own compensation level.  It makes parliamentary 
compensation more accountable to Canadian taxpayers because from 
here on in it will be strictly based on this independent 
commission that also acts for the judiciary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Lumley commission recommended that parliamentary pensions be 
adjusted to limit the cost impact of higher compensation levels I 
have just outlined.  To this end, Bill C-28 reduces the accrual 
rate from 4% to 3% for members of the House.  It would remain the 
same for members of the Senate.  They are already at 3%.  This is 
a 25% reduction in the accrual rate which would reduce the 
pension costs that would have resulted from the higher 
parliamentary compensation.  At the same time, it is to be noted 
that the premiums of members of parliament to the compensation, 
and this was not raised yesterday by the so-called taxpayers 
foundation, would be increased by $2,900 a year. This makes the 
plan more sound.  I think everyone who is an objective observer 
will recognize that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lower accrual would mean that the number of years to 
accumulate a pension equal to 75% compensation, in other words 
the maximum pension, would now be 25 years.  Surely no one can 
claim that it is the wrong approach.  That is the correct 
approach.  Only 5 out of 301 members sitting in the House today 
have 25 years of service. The average tenure in the House, for 
the information of Canadians, is about eight years.  When I was 
re-elected as a government member in 1993, it had dropped down at 
that point to some six years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most people are not here for a very long time and certainly 
would not collect that full pension that it was alleged yesterday 
we would.  In addition, the number of years for a member's 
pension would be made the same as it is in the public service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would also extend the current disability allowance, 
which is available to members up to age 65 right now, to age 75 
or the date of the next election.  Again, this is keeping in 
conformity with what is done in the Judge's Act.  Although this 
provision is not specifically mentioned in the Lumley commission 
report, it is based on representations made by parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-28 would also adjust the designation of Parliament Hill 
by moving the boundary from Bank Street to Kent Street to take 
account of recent changes and for the new justice building which 
will now form part of the parliamentary precinct. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would like to thank all the members of the 
commission for their work: the commission chair, the hon. Ed 
Lumley, and the other members of the commission, the hon. Jake 
Epp and Dr. Huguette Labelle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commission's work reflects their consultations with all 
parties, with outside experts in the area of compensation, and 
with other interested Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wish to thank all members of the House for their approach 
to this very important issue.

recommendations of the Lumley commission is evidence that the 
commission's recommendations are reasonable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The praise of many commentators from the private sector and many 
members on both sides of the House also indicates the fairness of 
the bill before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The broad support of Canadians for the Lumley report shows 
that the provisions of this bill are fair.  I would therefore 
invite all members to support this bill.

of this bill and adhere to it. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>]

still hope they will adhere to the bill and sign up for the 
benefits.  I sincerely believe that all members of parliament are 
equally worthy of the high task asked of us all, and I hope they 
will not only support the bill but adhere to the clause of being 
part of it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Canadian Alliance has repeatedly 
called for an independent commission to make recommendations 
regarding MPs' salaries.  It is entrenched Canadian Alliance 
Party policy that the issue and process of MP salaries be 
transparent.  The commission's work has been transparent.  I 
commend the commissioners for their contributions to the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also commend them for making sure that in the future the Prime 
Minister will not appoint any more commissions to look at pay, it 
will be done by the people who look at the judges' salaries, 
which is independent.  They are appointed by the judges plus 
judicial counsel, both sides agreeing on an independent 
chairperson.  That is a good recommendation and I commend the 
commission for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance is pleased that the commission recommended 
a reduction in the accrual and contributions rate in the Members 
of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance has also promoted the concept that MPs' 
pensions should be more in line with the private sector.  The 
commission has concurred and we thank them for that 
acknowledgement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the day we got the report from the commission as house 
leaders, it was recommending a 2.5% accrual rate.  The government 
had seen to make it 3%.  I wish it would have stayed with the 
2.5% because that was more acceptable and much closer to the 
public sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  And the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds:</B>  And the private sector also. 
The issue of MPs' salaries has always been a contentious one. 
Accordingly, the Canadian Alliance will treat each vote on the 
bill as a free vote for our members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member over there can smile and laugh but that is what the 
House is all about; it is about integrity and making one's 
position and one's point with a free vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members of that party over there want to talk about 
integrity, I would ask them to talk about the minister for 
multiculturalism and her integrity about flags burning in Prince 
George.  If they want to about integrity, we will talk about 
that.  If they want to talk about integrity, let us talk about 
Bill C-15 and how they will not split a bill that is very 
important for all Canadians.  We are prepared to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government also did one thing that was not put in the report 
by the commission.  The commission recommended that it be 
retroactive to April 1.  The government wants it to be January 1. 
That is greedy and not acceptable.  It should be April 1, which 
is our fiscal year.  That would have been fine with members on 
this side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has also been the policy of the Canadian Alliance that our 
constituents have their say on the issue of MPs' salary 
increases.  Accordingly, we will move at the report stage that 
the increase, if passed, come into force after the next general 
election.  This fulfils our policy that voters be involved in the 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a strange twist in Bill C-28, and it is something that 
I think should be talked about.  I have checked for precedent, 
including with the crucible of our parliamentary system 
Westminster.  I can find no precedent.  Bill C-28 calls for an 
opting in, in order to receive a salary increase.  I have heard 
of opting out, which of course we saw in the issue of MP 
pensions.  However Bill C-28 has an implied threat that if anyone 
does not sign on in 90 days, then one does not receive the salary 
increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister's threat of a week ago has come home to 
roost.  It is intimidation, which I find unparliamentary.  The 
government, obviously as instructed by the Prime Minister, is 
entertaining the notion of two classes of MPs.  Rather than take 
the recorded vote as final determination on the bill, and 
consequently salary increases, the government is holding MPs 
hostage to another step in the process: sign a document within 90 
days of passage of this bill indicating they are opting in or 
they will receive less than other colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the House leader said that is unacceptable.  Nobody in the 
House should be earning any different from anybody else, yet it 
is in the bill. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1520"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT56"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this not a form of double jeopardy?  It certainly is stealthy 
politics in an already sensitive and contentious issue.  Why 
would the government want to add further dimension to the issue 
other than to embarrass certain MPs from certain parties? 
Passage of a bill on third reading in our parliamentary system is 
final determination.  Does the government have the constitutional 
right to alter this entrenched process?  That is a very good 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new way of determining the outcome of articles in 
legislation may even contravene pay equity.  Does the government 
have the right to establish two classes of MPs?  I may not be 
stretching the point by saying that this opting in initiative may 
be an affront to parliament itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 31 of the charter of rights and freedoms states that 
nothing in the charter extends the legislative powers of any body 
or authority.  Is the government overextending its legislative 
powers by the addition of this fourth step, the new opting in 
requirements in Bill C-28? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The nuances of opting out of something as opposed to being 
forced to opt into something that the majority of parliament may 
pass is not subtle.  It is a dynamic and dramatic departure from 
legislative precedent and nothing but intimidation and mendacity 
on the part of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an implied threat in Bill C-28 that has no place in our 
parliament.  Politics may ensue during debate on a bill, but I do 
not believe that a political manipulation should be encapsulated 
in a bill and then foisted on MPs after passage of a bill.  It is 
a mockery of our process and diminishes the significance of the 
three stages of the passing of legislation.  Why have debate?  We 
could anonymously sign on to any initiative and that would 
determine the outcome.  Has the government become that arrogant? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In view of that clause of the bill, I move: 
<A NAME="LINK182">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by replacing all the words after the 
word “That” with the following: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“this House declines to give second reading to Bill C-28, an act 
to amend the Parliament of Canada Act, the Members of Parliament 
Retiring Allowances Act and the Salaries Act, since the principle 
of the bill contravenes the spirit of pay equity by establishing 
a two tier pay scheme for Members of Parliament.” 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The Chair finds the amendment to be in 
order. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is always a bit awkward to speak to a bill like Bill 
C-28, since it is a matter of parliamentarians addressing the 
remuneration of members of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that there are nevertheless certain unavoidable things 
that have to be dealt with, certain obligations connected to the 
position of member of parliament, I believe that we must, as 
democratically elected representatives of the people, get 
directly to the subject of concern to us, that is the 
remuneration of the 301 members of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the sensitive nature of the situation, the government 
decided to seek advice on this matter from an independent 
committee headed by Mr. Lumley. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1525"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT58"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT58"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1525

<A HREF="#LINKT57"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Bloc Quebecois are of the opinion that Mr. Lumley and 
the other two members of his committee have carried out a 
serious, detailed and well researched study of the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I need to offer what I believe is an appropriate reminder that 
the members of parliament on both sides of this Chamber, 
including the government members, did not participate in the 
Lumley Commission.  It is what is termed an independent 
commission.  I have no intention of resorting to innuendo 
attacking the credibility of Mr. Lumley or the other two members 
of the commission. 
Speaking for the Bloc Quebecois, I believe we have been involved 
in a clear and transparent process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the few minutes I have, I would like to look at the 
commission's recommendations.  The first outstanding one builds 
up the salary structure, no more, no less.  We have to ask 
ourselves whether it is proper, acceptable and realistic for the 
Prime Minister of Canada to be earning a salary equivalent to 
that of the highest official he appoints. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I worked in human resources for 16 years before becoming a 
member of parliament.  I worked in pay policy for a paper 
company called Abitibi Price.  I worked with these concepts.  We 
wondered whether a company president should earn as much or less 
than persons reporting to him.  I think the question is 
perfectly legitimate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Lumley's first recommendation is that the Prime Minister of 
Canada should earn a salary equivalent to that of the highest 
official he himself appoints.  That highest official is the 
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that premise, with the first level of the pyramid 
established, we move to the second level.  Is it proper and 
realistic for a minister to earn at least as much or slightly 
more than his deputy minister?  The existing structure allows a 
deputy minister to earn more than his minister.  This is a 
monumental aberration.  It is therefore proper and realistic for 
ministers to earn as much as their deputies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moving on to the third level of the salary structure, members' 
salary must be proportionate to what a minister and the Prime 
Minister earn. 
At this point, I must say that members' salaries provide a good 
opportunity to engage in demagoguery. They provide a good 
opportunity to behave like hypocrites. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebecers are paying $32 billion in taxes to Ottawa. They are 
fully justified in electing members who will look after Quebec's 
interests. Therefore, as long as Quebecers will be paying taxes 
to Ottawa, we Bloc Quebecois members will not engage in 
demagoguery or behave like hypocrites on the issue of members' 
salaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree with the provision of the bill which provides that 
members who agree with the salary increase sign a form to that 
effect. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1530"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT59"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT59"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1530

<A HREF="#LINKT58"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If, for some reason, an hon. member feels, based on his deep 
beliefs, that this salary increase is unjustified, he or she 
will be free not to sign the form authorizing his salary 
increase. Contrary to what we heard before, the Bloc Quebecois 
supports the principle of signing a form to get the salary 
increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, I said it was too easy to engage in demagoguery. Some 
could say, as we have heard on other occasions, that this does 
not make sense, it is much too much. 
However we could receive the salary increase in secret or through 
internal correspondence and publicly condemn it and say that MPs 
are paid too much and that it does not make sense, but still 
pocket that increase. This is to act like hypocrites. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another attitude consists in watching the train go by, in doing 
nothing and say “No, this issue is too sensitive. We do not have 
to shoulder the political weight of this decision”. We can then 
watch the train go by and pocket the salary increase. This is 
another example of demagoguery and hypocrisy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As parliamentarians, we must have the courage of making 
decisions, defending them and facing public opinion. If some 
lobbies or groups are not pleased with our decision, they will 
let us know. Every day, parliamentarians receive an enormous 
amount of e-mails and letters. In a democracy, people have the 
right to tell us whether they agree or not with our decisions. 
However, we must have the courage to defend our decisions and to 
face public opinion, even if it may sometimes be harsh in its 
judgments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the Bloc Quebecois, I say that this bill does not 
have to be reviewed behind closed doors, in a hurry, at three in 
the morning. 
As for the approach adopted by the government House leader, I do 
not normally make a practice of congratulating him, but I think 
that, in a democracy, when the members opposite do something that 
we feel is right and acceptable, we should say so.  We should not 
criticize the government just for the pleasure of it. The approach 
developed by the government House leader for 
the introduction of this bill has been transparent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Notice was given last Friday, June 1. The bill was introduced 
yesterday and, today, Tuesday, June 5, we are debating the bill 
at second reading.  Tomorrow will be third reading debate, 
followed by a vote on Thursday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, given that this bill includes provisions to 
eliminate the tax free allowance, which is what the public 
wanted, and a reduction in pension benefits, and that overall 
remuneration will now be more equitable and consistent with 
market trends, we in the Bloc Quebecois support the bill at 
second reading.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. James Moore (Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam,

As we are debating Bill C-28 at second reading, I have the 
<I>Standing Orders of the House of Commons</I> here.  Chapter II, 
Standing Order 21 reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No Member is entitled to vote upon any question in which he or 
she has a direct pecuniary interest, and the vote of any Member 
so interested will be disallowed. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me, based on the standing orders and Bill C-28 which 
we are debating, that there is a clear conflict.  Could the 
Speaker please rule on this?

<P><A NAME="LINK184"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on the same point of order to point out that 
in the <I>Annotated Standing Orders of the House of Commons</I>, 
Standing Order 21 reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a Member has a direct pecuniary interest in a question being 
decided in the House, the Member may not vote.  For a Member to 
be disqualified from voting, the monetary interest must be direct 
and personal. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me anticipate an objection which the Chair may raise to this 
point.  It goes on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As such, measures with a wide application, such as matters of 
public policy, are not generally considered in this light.  Even 
voting a pay increase to Members themselves does not amount to a 
case of direct monetary interest, because it applies to all 
Members, rather than to just one, or to certain Members but not 
to others. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will anticipate an objection the Speaker may raise to my 
colleague's point of order by pointing out that in the bill 
before us the pay increase does not apply to all members and it 
does not apply to all rather than to just one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, I point to the section of the bill that would 
require members to “opt in to the pay increase proposed 
therein” which would, by its nature, not apply to all members 
equally.  It would have an unequal application. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I further point to the section that proposes an increase in 
indemnity for the right hon. Prime Minister of 42%, which is 
substantially greater than the increase proposed for members of 
parliament.  There is therefore at least one or perhaps several 
members who would, if the bill were passed, exercise the opt in 
clause and obtain a direct pecuniary benefit exclusive to 
themselves, not as a matter of public policy generally applicable 
to all members of the House but to themselves solely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore submit to the Chair that the bill before us is in 
violation of the standing orders. 
<P><A NAME="LINK185"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I thank the hon. members for their 
comments.  The hon. member for Calgary Southeast certainly did 
find the relevant paragraph in the annotated standing orders, to 
which I am sure he knew the Chair would refer in dealing with the 
point of order raised by his colleague.  I congratulate him for 
finding it so quickly and pointing it out to me.  I find it very 
helpful and quite instructive in dealing with the situation we 
are faced with in the House this afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the hon. member for Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port 
Coquitlam, hearing the whole paragraph, will realize the position 
he got himself into by raising the point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a Member has a direct pecuniary interest in a question being 
decided in the House, the Member may not vote.  For a Member to 
be disqualified from voting, the monetary interest must be direct 
and personal.  As such, measures with a wide application, such as 
matters of public policy, are not generally considered in this 
light.  Even voting a pay increase to Members themselves does not 
amount to a case of direct monetary interest, because it applies 
to all Members, rather than to just one, or to certain Members 
but not to others. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case, as I understand it, the bill provides for an 
increase of a specified amount that applies to all hon. members. 
There are differences between certain members who hold different 
offices in the House, such as the Speaker, ministers of the 
crown, parliamentary secretaries, whips, House leaders and so on. 
They all have different salary adjustments.  However the increase 
is a general one applied across the board with some minor 
adjustments within those divisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the hon. member for Calgary Southeast has suggested that 
only members who opt in get it but the fact is that the opting in 
provision is available to all hon. members.  It is a matter of 
general application. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly after the expiry of the time for opting in has passed 
there may be differences in the rates of pay of various members. 
However the fact is that the rates are established for all 
members, should they choose to opt in, and every MP has the right 
to opt in under the bill as I understand it.  I have not been 
able to see anything in the bill before us that would restrict 
that right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must therefore conclude that while the argument may be 
academically interesting, it is without merit.  I do not believe 
that Standing Order 21, based on the interpretation and the 
application of the rule since its inception almost 100 years ago, 
has any formal validity in dealing with this bill.  I am unable 
to find that the hon. members between them have raised a valid 
point.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I begin by saying as one who has been in this place for 22 years 
and has gone through a number of processes by which we increased 
our compensation, that the process we have embarked on today is 
much superior to ones I have experienced in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say that with regard to the controversy that exists to some 
extent about what has been called fast tracking of the 
legislation.  It is only fast tracking in the sense that there is 
a House order, but the fact of the matter is that this process or 
debate is taking about four or five days longer than any similar 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House and parliamentarians have been criticized in the past 
because it has been done in an hour.  It has been done on the 
last day before a break.  Everything has been done by unanimous 
consent and there has not necessarily been debate.  Things are 
done on division.  There has been a number of different ways in 
which this has been done in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have here, with notice being given on a Friday, the bill 
introduced on a Monday, second reading debate on Tuesday, 
committee of the whole on Wednesday and third reading and final 
vote on Thursday, is certainly a much more prolonged process than 
has usually been the case.  It does give Canadians time to get in 
touch with their MPs and give them their opinions before dealing 
with a fait accompli. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The circumstances of this package deserve to be reflected upon. 
Although it is ostensibly a response to the report of a 
commission created by statute after every election, there is no 
question that the impetus and momentum for this pay package come 
out of discussions within the Liberal caucus and a feeling within 
that party that it is time for a raise and time for so-called 
bold action on this file. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commission made its report, but many commissions have made 
reports in the past which have not been acted upon.  The 
government decided to act on this report.  There is much in the 
report that the NDP finds commendable.  There are things in it 
that we have asked for over the years.  I am thinking first of 
all of the demand for transparency and that the tax free 
allowance be converted to taxable income so that there is no 
illusion as to what members are making.  That is a good 
recommendation of the commission.  It is something we support and 
which is part of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the bill is passed we will never need to go through this 
again.  The determination of members' salaries will happen 
pursuant to a process that will not happen in the House of 
Commons.  That in itself is good.  I think every member of 
parliament going through this experience will, just at the 
existential level, be glad to know it is not something any member 
will have to go through again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support these things, but we do have a problem with the 
extent of the raise proposed, the 20% raise.  We feel, and we 
have said so publicly, that a 10% raise would have been more in 
order and that various indicators could have been used to justify 
a 10% raise. We find the 20% raise a bit too rich for our 
understanding of what was needed, so we will be moving an 
amendment to reduce the 20% raise to a 10% raise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  I see I have members' attention in any 
event.  Members should feel free to vote for that amendment and 
we hope they will because we think it would make the package more 
acceptable to the Canadian public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been mentioned already, we do not like what I would call 
the excessive retroactivity of the bill, the fact that it goes 
all the way back to January 1.  Maybe I am a bit naive.  I 
assumed we would start getting paid the new rate after we passed 
the bill.  I could see how April 1 could be justified in terms of 
the fiscal year, but going back to January 1 we find somewhat 
unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing a lot of us do not like, and I hope it is not just 
within the New Democratic caucus, is that we find ourselves 
uncomfortable, as do a lot of Canadians, with some of the 
arguments offered in favour of the bill, for example, that we 
have to pay a certain amount of money to get good people into 
parliament.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a lot of good people out there who have run for 
parliament over the years, who are in this parliament now and who 
will be in future parliaments and who will be attracted to 
political life and attracted to parliament because of things that 
they believe, because of changes that they want to see made. They 
will not be reckoning on the salary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we ever arrive at the day when people are reckoning on the 
salary as to whether or not they should go into politics, then I 
think we will have arrived at a particularly sad day.  This is an 
argument that comes more out of the corporate world than anything 
else, where there may be a lot of people who do have to take a 
so-called cut in salary in order to become a member of 
parliament, but for a great many Canadians this is not so and 
there are a great many Canadians out there that we would do well 
to attract to political life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can attract them by making sure that what happens in this 
place is more meaningful than it is today.  The greatest reason 
people would have for not going into politics today is to ask 
themselves the question, what kind of influence can I have as a 
member of parliament?  That is the question that we should be 
asking and answering instead of the compensation one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, with respect to something that has been raised by the 
Alliance, and as I say we will support their motion, I find that 
the opting in clause in the bill is particularly offensive 
because it really is a form of intimidation.  I think the 
Alliance House leader used that word.  It is a form of 
intimidation on the part of the Prime Minister.  It is basically 
trying to put us in a position where politically we will be 
vulnerable if we both express our opinion on what we think is 
proper and vote accordingly.  We are to be put in the position 
where we will be called hypocrites, we will be called 
inconsistent et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the NDP say we will not be intimidated on the principle of 
free speech in the House of Commons.  We will say what we think 
about this particular bill, we will vote as we please and we will 
vote against this package, and we will abide by a principle that 
we have always upheld in the past and uphold this day, and that 
is that all members of parliament should be paid the same, that 
there should not be any differential rate, that there should not 
be a two tier system for MPs any more than there should be in any 
other sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We say to the Prime Minister that if he was really interested, 
as I thought he was for a while, in uplifting and enriching or 
enhancing the image of parliamentarians in Canadian society, he 
should have had the courage of his own convictions instead of 
introducing an element into this legislation that can only create 
a situation in which people will come to think less of 
parliamentarians rather than more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the member from the Bloc who was concerned about 
demagoguery and so on that I think this so far has been handled 
with a minimum of demagoguery.  We do not intend to be demagogic 
about it and I have not heard anyone else being that way yet.  I 
hope we can all keep our tone down on this.  I hope we can deal 
with this civilly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally I just want to say that we will vote against the bill, 
unless of course our amendment is accepted, but we also as a 
caucus have taken a decision, because we believe in equal pay for 
work of equal value, that we will be opting in.  We will not 
suffer a situation in which some members of parliament are paid 
less than other members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage members to vote for the Alliance amendment because 
in effect it would teach the government a lesson for having put 
this particular element into the bill.  I do not expect it to 
pass. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also encourage members to consider our amendment because 
we think it might make this package, which has some very good 
elements within it, more acceptable in the eyes of many 
Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
deeply troubled by the idea that this parliament would be allowed 
to vote itself a raise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of some health problems this past week, I was back home 
in my riding.  Even so, I was in my constituency office each day 
for a number of hours.  There was an editorial in the local paper 
in which the editor stated that all citizens should get in touch 
with their MP if they did not agree with this raise.  We have 
been swamped, absolutely swamped, with calls.  The phones are 
jammed with calls and there are letters coming in. 
The calls and letters are not just for Elsie.  They are for every 
member in the House of Commons, for every person.  They are 
saying the same thing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we ran to become members of parliament we knew exactly what 
we would be paid.  We knew that we had to have two residences, 
one at home for the family and one here.  There is an image being 
portrayed out there.  Everyone thinks that when we get to the 
Hill we become very wealthy.  I think the take home pay after 
taxes is probably around $48,000 unless a member is on the 
government side and is a minister or a parliamentary secretary. 
It is not very much, but nevertheless we knew that.  All of us 
knew that when we came to parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about a democratic parliament.  When the government says 
“If you do not vote our way, you are out.  You have to do it our 
way”, how can we call it a democratic parliament? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I made some calls today to find out if this had ever taken place 
in the House of Commons, if any government had said this to 
anyone on its side as well as on the opposition side.  I was told 
by members who had been here before that no, this has never, ever 
been done.  Nothing like this has ever been put forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe in my heart and soul that the salaries have to be 
reviewed and that there should be an independent commission. When 
I say an independent commission I mean that the House leaders 
should all sit down and choose who should form the commission, 
not the government but the House leaders.  Whatever is brought 
forward should be binding.  We just do not put our elected people 
in that position.  We just do not do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at the issues, particularly back home in the maritime 
provinces, that we should be dealing with.  I dealt with one 
today, asking for a national shipbuilding policy.  I look up to 
the gallery and I see the faces of men, many men whose families 
are on welfare now.  A lot of them have no alternative whatsoever 
and they are hurting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at the child pornography situation.  I do not believe 
there is a member in the House who wants child pornography in 
Canada but we are not dealing with it in the right manner.  We 
cannot compare children with animals.  We cannot do that.  I do 
not know what has happened to us.  I really and truly do not 
know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are so many issues we need to deal with.  I see the poor. 
I see young people on the street begging.  For some reason the 
family unit is becoming weaker, not stronger.  We have to do 
something about it.  We have to bring in some policies to help 
the family unit become stronger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really was shocked when I heard that if we vote against the 
bill then we will have a two tier system in the House of Commons. 
I do not think we would find that anywhere around the world.  I 
do not think we would find that in any parliament around the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It tugs at my heart.  I have respect for my colleagues on the 
government side.  I have respect for the leader of the 
government. I do, but am telling the House this:  it is pretty 
hard to stand here and say “Yes, Elsie is worth more than you 
are paying her”.  That is not how people see it, particularly 
those who are poor and hungry and do not have any money in the 
bank.  I have to say that.  There is no way that those people 
feel we are worth more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The image out there is that the only thing we do is question 
period.  Nobody knows that when we work on committees we are here 
night and day, from the morning until usually 10 or 11 at night. 
If we are in our ridings it is for seven days a week. 
We know that and we understood that when we came up here.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell members about pay.  When I got elected as a 
councillor in Saint John, New Brunswick I got a cheque at the end 
of the month.  I went to the clerk and asked what it was.  I said 
that nobody could buy me.  I was told that I got paid for doing 
that work.  I think it was $9,000 a year.  I never knew that 
before then. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not come here because we are looking for a cheque.  What 
we come here for is to see what we can bring forth to help build 
this country and to provide a better quality of life for all of 
our citizens.  That is what we are here for.  That is what we 
want to do.  Will we do more if are able to put more in the bank 
each week?  Will we bring forth better policies that way?  Will 
the government bring forth better policies that way? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is to be a review, that review should be done and we 
should be voting on it for all those who will be running as 
parliamentarians for the next parliament.  It should be their 
salary, because when we ran every one of us knew exactly what our 
salary would be.  All members on the government side and all 
members over here knew what our salaries would be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am really worried.  Our responsibility to Canadian people is 
to do what is best for them.  That is what we are here for.  I 
know that a lot of my colleagues ran for that reason and got 
elected because they wanted to do what was best for the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Canadians elected us, as they did last November, they did 
so with the belief and understanding that we would not abuse 
their trust.  I believe that right now this is abusing their 
trust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of all 301 of us in the House, whether on the 
government side or on the opposition side, I have to say I do not 
believe that this should be brought before the House and that we 
should be forced to vote on a raise to increase our salaries. 
<P><A NAME="LINK188"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, for 
this opportunity to speak on the bill I would like to split my 
remarks into two parts, the first part with respect to actual 
compensation and the second part with respect to the role and 
responsibilities of a member of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not spend a lot of time trying to compare apples to 
oranges to grapefruit.  Am I worth more or less than a nurse or a 
teacher or a doctor?  It is something of a hopeless case trying 
to compare the role and responsibilities of an MP with those of 
other professions.  One can spend endless amounts of time saying 
that others are worth more than an MP or worth less or are more 
or less deserving.  We live in a bit of a bizarre society when 
the entire budget of the Toronto Maple Leafs hockey team would 
more than pay for all 301 MPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was elected four years ago.  It was a little like getting 
married.  I really did not realize what I was getting into.  I 
practised law for 22 years and enjoyed it.  I was successful 
enough to keep my family certainly at a scale of compensation 
quite a bit in excess of what I earn as a member of parliament. I 
did realize that as a member of parliament I would earn less than 
I did as a lawyer, but what I did not realize was that I would 
actually end up working harder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am continuously amazed at how critical the public is of our 
role while knowing little or nothing about what we actually do. 
It is almost an industry.  To be fair, when I was elected I too 
did not know what was expected of me so I have sympathy for some 
who criticize our role because they only see our public role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I may take this opportunity, I would like to try to explain 
to Canadians what I do as an MP.  I am sure others can in a 
similar fashion explain what they do as members of parliament. As 
I see it this is really three jobs in one.  We have our work in 
our constituency, we have our work in Ottawa and we have our 
international work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last Thursday evening, for instance, I flew home.  I dodged in 
on the Blue Jays game as a guest of Mr. Rogers and Mr. Godfrey 
and then left a bit early.  No doubt they wanted to tell me about 
the declining fortunes of the Toronto Blue Jays baseball club.  I 
slipped out early, went home and reintroduced myself to my kids. 
I said “Hi kids, I'm your dad.  Remember me?”

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Friday morning I was out at the constituency office and saw six 
rather unhappy constituents.  Pretty well all had been turned 
down by the government for something.  Each had a legitimate 
point to make, and in each instance I could say what I could or 
could not do for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am quite proud of my constituency office.  I would stack it up 
against any constituency office in the country.  We speak eight 
languages and within our budgetary limitations provide a first 
class service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issues I dealt with that morning were in the range of a 
denial of a visitor's visa, why their relatives did not get so 
many points on the immigration scale and a deportation much like 
the one that has been in the papers recently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a lot of fun as a politician to have to say no. 
However we do have an opportunity from time to time to deal with 
situations which clearly are unfair and offend one's sense of 
fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The following day, Saturday morning, I then went to four events 
in the riding.  The first was in Highland Creek, which is one of 
the most degraded watersheds in all of the Great Lakes area. This 
was the fourth annual cleanup sponsored by me.  Once we got that 
started, I ran off to do a parade in the Guildwood area of my 
riding.  I frankly do not like doing parades but it is expected 
of us.  One of the benefits however of a parade is that at the 
end we get to talk to people and they share with us whatever 
concerns they have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I then left the parade, came back and did the Highland Creek 
cleanup with my volunteers, did a television interview, thanked 
the volunteers and then ran off to another event.  The other 
event was at the Beare Road landfill site.  With my colleague 
from Scarborough—Rouge River and my colleague from Scarborough 
Centre, we presented a cheque to the Friends of the Rouge River 
and the Rouge Alliance.  They are involved in cleaning up the 
Beare Road landfill site, which is a colossal eyesore in the 
eastern part of Toronto.  These folks are doing absolutely 
fabulous work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From there I went home, said hello to my kids again, got dressed 
and went to downtown Toronto.  The University of Toronto at 
Scarborough was having a reunion for the class of '71 and '76 and 
had asked me to be the guest speaker.  The principal, Paul 
Thompson, was quite complimentary toward the federal government 
and its initiatives in the area of millennium scholarships and 
CFI, the Canada Foundation for Innovation.  The university, 
particularly the university at Scarborough, has been a 
significant beneficiary of both of those initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I took the opportunity to lobby him with respect to the 
university's involvement in the community, particularly with 
respect to the degraded watershed of the Highland Creek which flows 
right through the university campus and the Morningside landfill 
site which sits right opposite the campus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second part of the job is what we do in Ottawa.  Last week 
I spent a very productive evening with my colleagues on the 
justice committee arguing about Bill C-24, the anti-gang bill. 
This is a bill that enjoys large support among all colleagues in 
the House.  We had a pretty animated discussion for four hours on 
Tuesday night with some rather bizarre happenings, at least 
bizarre according to this place, where government members were 
not supporting government amendments and opposition members were 
supporting government amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, we had other initiatives where opposition amendments 
were being supported by government members and being voted 
against by other opposition members.  I think at the end of the 
day after a vigorous debate, we had a better bill coming out of 
the committee than we had going in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I like other members want to make sure that the police have the 
tools to do the job.  The Canadian public also needs to know that 
we spend a great deal of time with lobbyists.  These are people 
with a particular point of view, some are paid, some are not 
paid.  I frankly like interacting with lobbyists because they 
fill up my informational void.  I wonder sometimes however why if 
we are so marginal, such voting machines, so irrelevant, so 
useless or one can name the pejorative adjective applied to us by 
the press, these lobbyists spend so much time, effort and money 
on us trying to persuade us to their point of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third part of the job is the international part.  It is 
frankly not one that I appreciated when I was in the private 
sector. 
I thought parliamentary junkets were what the newspapers 
described them as, wonderful pool side parties with beautiful 
women and drinks.  However, the reality is somewhat different.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been to China, Mongolia and Israel this year.  I expect I 
will be leading a delegation to Taiwan in the summer.  Strangely 
enough, when other countries' taxpayers are paying the bill, they 
have the strange idea we should actually work when there.  The 
usual experience I had was that around 6.30 a.m. in the morning 
they expected us to start our working day and end it around 9 
o'clock or 10 o'clock that night.  They expected us to do that 
each and every day we were there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the Canada-Taiwan Parliamentary Friendship Group, of which I 
am the president, those will be fairly extensive discussions.  We 
have no government to government direct relationships between 
Canada and Taiwan.  As a consequence, our parliamentary 
friendship group gets to be used as a vehicle for a number of 
exchanges between those two countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was in China on the day the American spy plane was shot down. 
Needless to say, that led to some rather animated conversations 
between ourselves and our Chinese hosts.  It was also a useful 
occasion on which to subtly remind our hosts that we took a 
somewhat different view than our American friends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the break week I was in Israel, and while there several 
instances of terrorism occurred, including the M16 attack.  Now I 
certainly read newspapers with a clearer insight into what is 
going on there.  We arrived a week after the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs was there, who had upgraded himself from being burned in 
effigy to being a respected third party interlocutor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the very brief time I have left this is a summary of my life 
as a member of parliament.  I find the job stimulating and 
intriguing.  Unlike some I think it is one that Canadians can 
hope that their children think to be worthy.  To be sure, it has 
its level of foolishness and frustrations, but may I end with a 
quote form an 18th century political leader, who said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Politics is the most hazardous of all professions.  There is not 
another in which a man can hope to do so much good for his fellow 
creatures; neither is there any in which by mere loss of nerve he 
may do such widespread harm; nor is there another in which he may 
so easily lose his own soul—With all the temptation and 
degradation that besets it, politics is still the noblest career 
man can choose. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would urge all hon. members to support this initiative. 
<P><A NAME="LINK189"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Young Offenders Act has created and worsened 
problems with serious repeat offenders for years and a registry 
of pedophiles would help curtail the sexual predation of 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on with a lot of things that the House could be 
dealing with, but instead for three parliaments these and other 
issues have not been substantially or satisfactorily dealt with. 
However, the MP compensation package which we are debating today 
will spend less than a week here in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By comparison, some legislation in this place is dealt with in a 
glacially slow manner, while some, like this legislation, passes 
in what is the equivalent of the blink of an eye.  I have 
constituents who over the last little while have been rightly 
complaining about that process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>M. Spevack wrote me today over the Internet.  One question posed 
was “What is the urgency that it has to be passed in three days, 
since it is retroactive to January anyway?”  That is a perfectly 
good question.  If this is retroactively applying legislation 
there is no need to have this done in three days, in less than a 
week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other question this constituent posed was “Why can't other, 
more important legislation pass as quickly?”  That is something 
that we should all spend some serious time contemplating about. 
I hope our constituents at home over the summer will remind 
members of parliament of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the last six days I have been trying to do what I could, 
wrapping up yesterday, by doing my best to deprive unanimous 
consent from the government House leader to fast track this 
legislation. 
It involved some sacrifice on my part, but I thought it was 
important because the process we engaged in last time was an 
atrocious one.  I thought we at least could learn from that 
example and better what we would do this time.  I cannot say we 
have made much of an improvement over the last time because the 
process has been almost as fast.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government House leader then rose in his place just across 
the way and used Standing Order 56.1, a fairly obscure procedure 
used an average of maybe twice a year.  It basically fast tracked 
the legislation and imposed closure on the debate.  Since 25 
opposition members did not stand it was done.  It was as simple 
as that because he is a minister of the crown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing order is not something which has existed from the 
beginning of time with regard to parliamentary procedure.  It was 
created on April 11, 1991.  It has only been used five times 
since 1998:  Monday, April 12, 1999; March 22, 1999; March 19, 
1999; June 9, 1998; and the last time which I traced back for the 
purposes of this debate was February 9, 1998.  It just goes to 
show how obscure some of these things are and that when the 
government is intent it will find a way to get its will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also rose on a point of order today right after question 
period.  I was seeking the unanimous consent of the House to 
withdraw the order passed by the government House leader on 
Monday, June 4, pursuant to the standing order.  It was forcing a 
fast track and all stage guillotine of Bill C-28, the bill that 
deals with MP and senator compensation.  I was deprived of that 
unanimous consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will speak to the commission because a lot of people have 
spoken with regard to the independent commission.  The commission 
recommended that there be no increase in the MP pension plan as a 
result of these changes.  I would like to read into the record 
what the commission said on page 20 of its report.  It said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commission recommends that these changes not result in any 
material impact, either positive or negative, to the benefits 
that parliamentarians receive from the pension plan.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That was the committee's recommendation.  Instead we have in 
Bill C-28 an increase in total compensation from $109,500 to 
$131,400 for the House, and from $88,200 to $105,840 for the 
Senate, and that it will have a commensurate impact on the 
pension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to read into the record the other recommendation of the 
commission found on page 26.  It said the legislation should be 
“retroactive to April 1, 2001, once the legislation is 
proclaimed”.  That is not what the legislation has done.  It has 
not followed the recommendation of the commission.  It went ahead 
and made it retroactive from January 1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party is going to move an amendment to the legislation to the 
effect that the pay raise should come into force after the next 
general election.  The reason we are proposing this amendment is 
so that the decision of parliament would be implemented after a 
subsequent election.  This would avoid the conflict of interest 
members of parliament would have in voting on their own salary 
increases, rather than that of those who follow them, which I 
think would be the wiser course of action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those encapsulate some of my real problems with this process and 
as well how the policy did not follow even what the commission 
recommended to the tee.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to lay out what I think would be an improvement to 
the situation.  It is not party policy.  It is something that I 
happen to believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we should have a super retirement savings plan, 
similar to an RRSP, but it would be mandatory.  Five per cent of 
individuals' salaries, whether they were janitors, presidents of 
a corporation, members of parliament or prime ministers for that 
matter, would be set aside in this account.  People would know 
what they were contributing to their own fund.  They would know 
the total amount of moneys they had contributed and what type of 
return on investment they would actually be getting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge any member in this place or anybody for that matter 
to know exactly how much they have put into the Canada pension 
plan and what benefits would be accruing to them.  I would allow 
people to invest in bonds, treasury bills, guaranteed investment 
certificates and even mutual funds because in that way it would 
be owned by the individuals and not by the government.  There 
would be a personal stake in making sure they knew what was 
happening with those funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think people are fairly intelligent and they respond to 
incentives.  The more people who work under a bureaucrat, just as 
an example, the more the bureaucrat earns, and so bureaucrats 
tend to build empires.  That is the nature of government.  It is 
a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madsen Pirie, with the Adam Smith Institute, in his book 
<I>Blueprint for a Revolution</I>, laid out how we could combat 
that natural built in incentive in any bureaucracy or 
corporation, and that is to reward people for saving taxpayer 
dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of my constituents have raised concerns about the whole MP 
pay package because it did not have merit based pay nor 
performance indicators.  I think our salary could be tied to our 
attendance, to whether or not we cast votes as we are hired to do 
and to whether or not we have a presence on a committee of our 
choice.   I would even go so far as to link our salary to 
producing a balanced budget, lowering taxes and, for my friends 
in the New Democratic Party and others, maybe even having a 
social component to it so that if there were increased literacy, 
decreased surgery waiting lists, lower homicide rates or longer 
life expectancies, it would affect the performance rating for a 
member of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will vote against the bill affecting MP's and Senator's 
compensation.  I voted against many bills before because of their 
flaws, whether it was with the policy or the process, and I will 
have to oppose the bill as well.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am sure there are more people 
across the country watching the debate and listening to the 
speakers than we have had in a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the outset I want to make it abundantly clear to everyone in 
the House that I do not want, in my actions, to hurt any one 
individual within my party or within the government party.  It is 
not in my nature to be spiteful or hateful.  Whatever an hon. 
member chooses to do with his or her vote on the bill is all 
right with me.  However I do not want anyone coming back and 
saying that what he or she selected to do hurt them.  Let us make 
it clear that this is a free vote on the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was really disturbed after reading the press reports on the 
bill.  The press has made fun of this institution and of members 
of parliament and, in doing so, have made fun of me to the point 
of being incompetent, not being able to accomplish anything and 
not doing anything.  That does not serve the House at all and it 
does not serve the country one little bit.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me relate what amounts to a day's work for me.  My office 
door in Ottawa opens at 7.30 every morning and the average time 
that office door closes is 9.30 at night.  The press does not 
report on that.  The press does not report that in the last two 
weeks I attended four different committee meetings.  The press 
does not report that I leave here on a Friday night and finally 
get home in the wee hours of Saturday morning to wake up at 6 
a.m. so I can get to a special event that has been organized. The 
press does not report on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The comments I have read about people in the House who were 
elected just like I was are irresponsible.  Yes, there are people 
here not doing their jobs.  There are always people in the House 
not doing their jobs but they are few.  We should not all be 
branded by the press as being totally incompetent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was elected to this institution in 1997 I was asked to 
serve my constituents.  I was born only 40 miles from the town in 
which I now live.  I know most of the people in my constituency 
by their first names.  Four years later, last November, those 
same people, I like to think because of the service I provided to 
them, increased my vote by 23%.  They did that because of the 
work we have to do to be professional members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It bothers me to be intimidated by those saying if we do not 
vote for this we are not as good as those who would vote for it. 
I come from an area where I have spent all but 12 to 13 years of 
my professional career.  I watched communities across my rural 
area go from booming institutions downhill to a point where I can 
take a given area in a 50 mile radius where there is not one new 
housing start.  I have watched paved highways being turned into 
gravel roads.  I have watched farming people trucking their grain 
80 miles in one direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have before us a bill.  I am very proud to say that the most 
important people in my career, aside from my wife, are my 
constituents.  I listen to them everyday through phone calls, 
letters, e-mails and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three main reasons I will be voting the way I will on 
the bill.  Three young couples live within the same block: Deb 
and Rob, Marlo and Audrey, Carl and Penny.  They each have two 
children with both mom and dad working.  They are finding it 
tough to make ends meet.  Can one imagine my voting for a raise 
up to $130,000, going back to talk to them and their kids, and 
their having the same respect for me as they did previously?  I 
do not believe so.

come to my office to show after they have completed their income 
tax and paid their rent how much money they have left to buy 
their food, fuel and medicine?  I do not believe so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know some of colleagues will be able take this pay raise to 
their constituencies and very little will be said.  I know people 
who have said that I would crazy not to take it because people 
will forget about it in six months.  I am reminded of the

</I></B></P><P align=left>When I go out to the agricultural community I know very well 
that the average net income of farmers in my constituency last 
year was $7,500.  That means a lot of them went into the hole.  I 
know that some of them have had negative income for three years 
in a row and do not see any future.  Currently there is a drought 
over half of my constituency.  No, I could not go home to face 
the people who elected me.  For that reason I cannot support the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I probably have more reason to support the bill than most people 
because this September I will have a balanced portfolio.  I will 
have four grandchildren in university.  I did not come here to 
make a lot of money.  I am not used to being rich.  I am a very 
common, ordinary individual.  I will not support a bill that 
would absolutely be a slap in the face to 65% of the people who 
put their X beside my name. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not quarrel and make animosity with any member on this 
side or that side of the House.  We will still be friends, but I 
hope those people watching this debate understand my position. 
Maybe we should all think twice before we walk away with that 
amount of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  It is my duty pursuant to Standing 
Order 38 to inform the House that the questions to be raised

Winnipeg North Centre, Health. 
<P><A NAME="LINK191"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
sat in the House most of the day and listened to the debate on 
Bill C-28.  I particularly enjoyed the speech made by the hon. 
member for Souris—Moose Mountain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have empathy with him because I can suggest to the hon. member 
for Souris—Moose Mountain that when I put my name forward and 
was elected on November 27 for the second time never was this an 
election issue.  I remember debating quite frequently with 
candidates from the Liberal side of the House.  Never did they 
ever put forward the suggestion that one of the first orders of 
business on coming to the House would be to look at members' pay 
packets and to put forward some compensation changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talked about health care and agriculture.  In my case we 
talked about defence and the possibility of the PPCLI coming to 
Shilo.  We talked about all major issues that were necessary 
during an election campaign but not once did the topic of 
members' compensation packages come up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mention that because I appreciate what the hon. member for 
Souris—Moose Mountain is saying and what the government is 
doing, particularly the Prime Minister.  He should take full 
responsibility because he is putting the hon. member and other 
hon. members not only on this side of the House but on that side 
of the House in a very difficult position.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party has said, and I will get into my own personal 
circumstance later, that it was unfair to put members of 
parliament in the position of voting on their own compensation 
packages for the same reasons the member just articulated.  We 
said that if we were going to put together a reasonable pay 
package or compensation package for members of parliament, it 
should be done for the next parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us have the studies, let us have the suggestions as to what 
a reasonable amount of money is for members of parliament and put 
that forward in the next parliament, so that when we sit on the 
podium and debate the issues we know that everyone is equal, we 
know that the next decision has already been made and that is 
what one is trying to attain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I ran for parliament I knew what the compensation was and I 
was happy with it.  By the way, surprisingly enough, I am still 
happy with that compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said the party position was that we should do it for the next 
parliament.  I had a previous life and was a politician in that 
life.  I lived by that rule.  Unfortunately or fortunately, 
whichever way one may look at it, it did not quite work out that 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On principle I also said not to give me a raise in my capacity 
as mayor, but if people wanted to attract someone to replace me 
in the next election, then put that forward in the next campaign 
and in the next election.  My council of the day decided that 
that was not going to happen and it was passed by my council on 
my behalf.  Yes, I took it because I felt that it was something 
the council wished to put into legislation.  It was accepted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Honestly, in principle, I still believe it should be for the 
next parliament.  Then the hon. member from Souris—Moose 
Mountain would not be put in this position, would not have to 
vote no against it, would not have to say he was not going to 
take it and become in my mind a lesser member of parliament than 
members on the backbench of the Liberals.  There will be a two 
tier system and we will talk about it later.  However, first we 
should do is make the decision now for the next parliament, not 
for this parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have in this piece of legislation a suggestion that 
committee chairs should be compensated for their jobs.  I have 
thought about this quite often actually, because there are 
different levels of compensation for different levels of 
responsibility.  I might even accept that but for the fact that 
those chairs are appointed by the Prime Minister.  There is no 
open and honest election.  In fact we tried that.  I know the 
Alliance Party suggested that there should be at the very least a 
secret ballot, and there should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a lot of good faith with committee work.  I think 
committees could work extremely well and probably better than 
they are now if there were a less partisan member sitting as the 
chair of a committee.  Let us have secret ballots.  Let us have, 
goodness gracious, the possibility of a member of the opposition 
sitting as the chair, as opposed to the chair having to be a 
member of the government.  That is shocking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it not be wonderful if we could have a member of the 
opposition as the chair of a committee?  Then the committee could 
operate as a true committee, not as one that is being tailored 
either by the minister's hand or by the Prime Minister's hand. 
Again, I and my party do not accept the fact that there should be 
additional compensation for the chair unless it is an open, 
honest and true election for the chair of a particular committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it was mentioned earlier in debate, but we also believe 
there should not be any retroactivity.  We were elected on 
November 27. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  We knew what the pay was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  We knew what the pay was.  We have 
gone there already.  The fact is we are in the month of June, 
soon to take a summer recess and all of a sudden in the 
legislation package it says to pay the people retroactive to 
January 1.  That was not expected when we got elected on November 
27.  That was not even in the card nor was it suggested.  Now all 
of a sudden there is retroactivity to January 1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is the deal.  Why do we not put a cap on it right now and 
let the legislation sit in limbo until we come back in the fall? 
Let people talk over the summer as to what we should or should 
not do and how we should handle it.  Let us not have the 
retroactivity.  Let us go through the summer and into the fall 
and talk about what it is the people of the country would like to 
see.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The opt in clause is possibly one of the most blatant, 
undemocratic positions the Prime Minister has ever taken.  It 
shows the total gross arrogance of a government that has nothing 
but contempt for the opposition, as well as its own backbench 
MPs.  What the Prime Minister is attempting to do is absolutely 
disreputable.  Let me give members an example of what I mean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister is telling members that if they do not 
support his position, this is not a even government position, he 
is prepared, as being the lord of the land, to take the increase 
away.  Some members will be paid less than other members who sit 
on that side of the House.  There will be a two tier level of 
MPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member from Moose Mountain said he works hard.  However, 90% 
of members of the House work equally as hard as he does. I will 
not mention the names of the remaining 10%, but they are usually 
on the government side.  I will not go any further than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ninety per cent of the members in the House work diligently and 
hard on behalf of their constituents.  Now the Prime Minister, in 
his arrogant way, is telling members that if they do not vote the 
way he tells them to vote, they will not get the same as what 
others on that side of the House will get.  That is absolutely 
terrible.  That is absolutely dishonest to the Canadian public. 
It should not happen.  The next time that party goes to the polls 
I hope that it happens— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
With respect, to characterize any actions of a member of 
parliament to be dishonest is not within the decorum of this 
place.  I would ask the member to withdraw that allegation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  While I would encourage the member 
for Brandon—Souris to be more judicious in the selection of his 
words, I do not find cause for the Chair to ask for the 
withdrawal of his comments.  They certainly were not directed 
toward an individual member.  In the spirit of the debate of the 
day, I would ask the member for Brandon—Souris to be a bit more 
judicious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Mr. Speaker, thank you for your 
latitude.  I do appreciate that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well as the Alliance Party, the Progressive Conservative 
Party will have a free, open, transparent and honest vote.  How 
anyone votes on this issue remains to be seen because there is 
the wonderful little opt in clause, which in itself is terribly 
hypocritical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc member who spoke said Bloc members would support this 
legislation.  Good for them.  However, I find it rather 
interesting that they always try to put a separatist spin on 
everything, and I never heard that spin this time.  They will 
take good Canadian cold hard cash and put it into their pockets. 
There is no separatist spin at all on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know we will have an opportunity to vote and to speak to this 
matter many times again.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brian Pallister (Portage—Lisgar, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Brandon—Souris for his 
comments.  I share many of the views expressed he expressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill begins and ends with some errors in it.  One of the key 
errors is it seems to misunderstand in its writing the fact that 
this is not the private sector we are talking about.  Many of the 
members in the Chamber could be in the private sector earning 
more.  Many of them came from the private sector where they were 
earning more.  Many came from jobs in the private sector or the 
public service where they were earning less.

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is many members in this Chamber, if they 
were in the private sector, would have been fired long ago.  The 
fact is that many of the members in this Chamber, if they were in 
the private sector, would have taken demonstrable cuts in their 
pay because of their inability to serve their constituents well 
or because of their unwillingness to serve all their constituents 
rather than just the few who perhaps supported them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that this is not the private sector.  To be fair, 
the reality also is that there are many members in the House who 
would in the private sector have earned bonuses and additional 
pay because the job they have done is above and beyond the call 
and the responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the fact of the matter is this is not the private 
sector.  Therefore, the fundamental principle that is at work 
here is that all members are equal and that all members are paid 
equally.  The fundamental flaw that lies in this bill is the opt 
out provision which the Prime Minister has clearly designed to 
try to muzzle opponents to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is there is a fundamental principle in our society 
and embodied in some of the acts of parliament that requires 
equal pay for equal service.  The reality is that in most cases 
it is impossible in the public sector to measure the value of 
that service.  Nonetheless the fundamental principle exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth of the matter is that for most of the members of the 
House this is not at all about the money.  This was not about the 
money when they ran.  It is not about the money now that they are 
here, and it probably will not be about the money when they 
leave.  It is about something entirely different.  It is about 
making a difference.  It is about coming here to try to better 
society.  It is about coming here to try to create a better 
society than the one that existed before we came here. Those 
things are far more in the minds of most of the members of the 
House, I expect in all parties, than the money.  It is about 
making a difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because so many members in the House are absent from the 
processes and the actual power making, there is a great sense of 
frustration.  I would say frustration would be the dominant 
emotion on all sides of the House.  With the possible exception 
of the front bench of the government, most members feel absent 
from the opportunity to really make a contribution and a 
difference. That being said, just because they cannot make a real 
contribution does not entitle them to get what they can out of 
the job in terms of financial compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The argument has been made that by increasing the compensation 
Canadians will benefit because we will be able to draw a better 
class of people to this place.  That does not say much about the 
people who are here now.  I do not buy that argument any more 
than I buy many of the arguments made by the government in 
defending this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a fine quality of people here generally and the reality 
is that most of them, as I said before, were not drawn here 
because of the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why then would this bill be fair?  It is fair in some respects. 
It is fair in part because the process which led up to it being 
drafted, for example the arm's length nature of the way in which 
the recommendations were developed, was good and we supported it. 
As the Canadian Alliance has said for a long time, we believe 
that the arm's length process should be followed in terms of the 
compensation determination for members of the House.  As well we 
have supported the greater transparency that will be embodied in 
part by some aspects of this bill.  The changing of tax free 
compensation to taxable is a move in that direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I supported as a provincial legislator a number of measures to 
increase the greater transparency and understanding taxpayers 
would have concerning legislation, regulations and compensation 
of members and people in the public service.  I believe very 
strongly that this greater transparency is something to be 
applauded and it is something that we should support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, I believe there are some positive aspects the bill in 
terms of the future removal of direct involvement by members of 
this House in the determination of what their compensation would 
be.  These things are good, fair and comprise part of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However on balance I cannot support the bill.  We will support 
our amendments to hoist this particular piece of legislation.  I 
see it as largely unfair.  I see it as departing from the 
so-called arm's length panel's recommendations in some key ways, 
particularly the MP pension calculations.  It departs 
significantly from the recommendations made by the panel.  That 
is not right.  In terms of the retroactivity of the benefits back 
to January, it departs from the panel's recommendations, yet 
again creates greater generosity toward the members of the House 
than was the intention of that independent panel. 
That is unfair.  That should not be the case.  I cannot support 
the bill on those bases.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, this was not an election issue, as was mentioned by the 
member for Brandon—Souris, certainly not in my riding or in his. 
Nor, do I expect, was it an issue in the ridings of most members 
of the House.  It was not an election issue.  It was not raised. 
Why the hurry now?  What is the rush?  What is the reason that we 
have to push this thing through as quickly as this?  I do not 
understand that and I do not think most members on this side of 
the House understand or accept the arguments made by the 
government on that issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were election issues and there are issues that are 
important to Canadians that have not been addressed, very urgent 
and important issues in terms of agriculture, in terms of a 
decaying infrastructure and in terms of a growing sense of 
regional alienation across the country.  Meaningful ways of 
addressing those serious and urgent problems should be sought and 
must be found.  Instead the government moves to push this to the 
top of the order paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are clearly three options that each of the members in the 
House must choose from in regard to this legislation, apart from 
abstaining which I will not include.  I will include in these 
options whether or not they choose to opt out or in of these 
benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, they can say yes to the bill and obviously would 
therefore say yes to the benefits.  If they believe on balance 
that this is a good bill, an urgent and necessary one, then that 
would be their position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second position would be to say no to the bill and no to 
opting in, thus creating by their decision, their moral decision, 
which is their rightful decision to make, a two tiered structure 
for members of parliament in terms of their compensation, based 
on a system that would punish those who stand on the basis of 
principle and reward those who choose to support the bill. 
Clearly this is what the Prime Minister had in mind when he put 
the opting out clause in the bill itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a third option.  The third option is this:  to say no 
to the bill because on balance it is seen to be wrong, because it 
is weak in many ways, because it needs to be debated more 
stringently and more fully by the Canadian people and for many 
other good reasons.  The option is to say no to the bill, but 
then to be forced to make a decision subsequent to its passage, 
which the government may choose to force, to say yes to the 
benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would happen if someone were to do that?  That person would 
be labelled a hypocrite, certainly by the Prime Minister I am 
afraid, certainly by certain members of the public.  That person 
would be labelled a hypocrite but the reality is that this might 
not be the case at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In regard to including an opt out provision, I will reference 
Shakespeare.  This is something from <I>Othello</I> which I was 
reading the other day: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who steals my purse steals trash; 'tis something, nothing;<BR> 
'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to a thousands;<BR> 
But he that filches from me my good name<BR> 
Robs me of that which not enriches him,<BR> 
And makes me poor indeed. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The attempt by this government through this Prime Minister's 
design of this piece of legislation is to rob honourable people 
of their good names.  It is to rob proud people who stand on 
moral ground and say no.  It is to rob them of their income and 
then to rob them by accusation, if they choose not to support a 
two tiered compensation system for members of parliament, to rob 
them of their good name by calling them hypocrites. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say it would be hypocritical of a government to create 
that circumstance.  I know of no good reason why the government 
would include such an obligation as to opt in or opt out of 
compensation and create a two tiered system within the House when 
such has not been the case in the past.  Nor should it be the 
case in the future.  Equal pay for equal work should be the rule 
that governs this society and it should govern in the House as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I want to say that there should be a free vote.  Our 
party would support a free vote in the House.  We should be 
mindful and respectful of the views of all who express their 
opinions on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not give in to muzzling attempts.  I will not give in to 
threats.  Threats do not work with me and they should not work 
with any thinking and respectful member of this parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage the members on the opposite side to join with us and 
hoist this bill six months into the future so that Canadians can 
be part of this important discussion just as much as the members 
of the House have been.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise to address Bill C-28 today.  I 
want to compliment my friend from Portage—Lisgar for his 
excellent speech and the excellent points he made respecting the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to say that I am just as frustrated as he is with Bill 
C-28.  The reason I am frustrated is that while there are some 
good things in it, very obviously the government has attempted to 
politicize this issue.  I am in politics and I understand the 
temptation to do that, but why do we have to do that on 
everything? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was an opportunity for the government to use the 
independent panel to establish remuneration for members of 
parliament and in doing that really set a precedent whereby MPs 
could vote for the recommendations or vote against them based 
upon what the independent third party had done.  Instead the 
government felt it had to meddle in this, to politicize the whole 
process and poison it in doing so.  I will get back to that in a 
moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk about some of the things that are in the bill. First 
of all the Canadian Alliance has taken a number of positions on 
and has policy with respect to MP remuneration.  We have said in 
article 70 of our principles that we believe MP remuneration 
should be set by an independent third party.  Substantially that 
is what we have with this commission.  We have no problem with 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we have said that the remuneration should come into 
effect after the next election, for obvious reasons.  If the 
public is dissatisfied with this issue, with the package that has 
been proposed, it can be an election issue.  MPs will not be in 
the position where they directly implement a pay increase that 
affects them, because of course their fate as members of 
parliament will not be known until after the next election.  We 
believe in that very strongly.  The government had the 
opportunity to put that in the legislation and did not do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we have said that we believe in converting the tax free 
expense allowance into salary that is taxable.  The commission 
recommended that and it is in the bill.  We agree with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe, and we have said in the past, that the accrual rate 
for the MP pension should be reduced and brought in line with the 
private sector.  To a substantial degree, but not completely, the 
commission did that when it recommended an accrual rate of 2.5%. 
For reasons that are not clear to me, the government moved it up 
to 3%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House leader from the government side is here and he says it 
did not do that.  He is technically correct.  What the government 
said was that it should produce the same result as the previous 
pension plan.  We had a 4% accrual rate on a much lower salary. 
Now we have a much higher salary and at the same time the 
government is recommending goosing the accrual rate so that we 
end up with higher pensions.  That is about an 18% increase for 
the typical MP over what it would normally be.  The government 
should not have done that.  That poisons the whole thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next point is that we believe this should be fully vetted in 
the House of Commons according to the regular procedure for any 
other bill.  We are pushing this through.  I know that there will 
be arguments made that this was agreed to, but I still want to 
argue that this should have been put off until the fall.  We 
could have had a regular debate and even have had witnesses. That 
would have removed the appearance that we are pushing this 
through simply because we want to avoid the political heat.  I am 
grateful for the chance to speak on this, but now that we are 
pushing this through we do not have that excuse any more.  We 
cannot say that we did allow people to come and comment on this 
and bring forward their testimony.  The result is that people 
will rightly say that we pushed it through.  I think that is one 
of the problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last point I want to make with respect to a stand that our 
party has taken in the past is that we believe very strongly that 
the government has poisoned the process by putting the opt out 
clause in the legislation.  What it is attempting to do is 
suggest to the public that if we have concerns about the 
legislation and want to vote against it, then we should be duty 
bound to opt out. 
That is wrong.  That is reprehensible.  My friend said it 
correctly a minute ago:  equal pay for equal work.  This is a 
blatant attempt to unduly politicize this thing.

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that the public is already confused by this.  It 
is complicated.  This confuses the issue even more.  It is a 
blatant attempt to politicize this whole process.  We should 
reject it.  A pox on the government's house for suggesting it. It 
is clearly political manipulation, both of the public and of MPs 
who have concerns about the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concerns do not end there, but those are some of the things 
we have raised in the past.  I wanted to address them today to 
explain how some of the recommendations meet concerns that we 
have had and how other recommendations are completely at odds 
with our position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other things I want to mention.  I want to mention the 
retroactivity.  I disagree with that.  That was not a 
recommendation.  I do not understand why we have the 
retroactivity.  I do not understand why we have the extra 
salaries for chairs of committees and for vice-chairs, of which I 
am one, when we do not have parliamentary reform to go along with 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend, our former House leader, brought forward a whole 
suite of changes that the Canadian Alliance would have liked to 
have seen introduced last February.  They were sensible changes. 
They were changes aimed at democratizing this place, changes that 
would introduce democracy really for the first time in this place 
in a way that would do justice to this place, which is supposed 
to be the home of democracy in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of that, we got some pretty lukewarm changes which the 
government introduced just the other day.  We appreciate those 
changes, but they really hardly go anywhere near where we need to 
go so that people have confidence that this place is concerned 
about really allowing MPs to represent their constituents.  We 
have not gone anywhere near far enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until we have members of parliament from the opposition allowed 
to be elected to serve as chairs of different committees, apart 
from the couple that are already allowed, I do not think we can 
support that.  I cannot support vice-chairs getting extra wages. 
I think it is wrong.  I do not think we should not be doing it. 
It is not part of the recommendations.  It is not what Canadians 
want, I think, until this place is really reformed.  I oppose 
that and I think my colleagues in the Alliance and other MPs 
oppose it.  We speak against that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to conclude by saying that this is always a difficult 
issue.  I do not enjoy being in a position where I have to vote 
on my own wages.  MPs are fundamentally in a conflict of interest 
position.  It is impossible for us to disentangle our personal 
interests from public policy.  I am grateful that because of the 
recommendations this will be, I hope, the last time we have to 
deal with this for a long, long time, perhaps ever.  I hope that 
is the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strongly condemn the government for meddling in this process. 
We had the chance to bring down a set of recommendations from an 
independent third party that really would have given the 
appearance that this was an arm's length set of recommendations. 
That has been sullied now by the actions of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just so I am clear, I want my constituents to know and I want 
Canadians to know that I will support Canadian Alliance 
amendments to substantially alter this legislation.  If they do 
not pass, I will vote against this legislation.  Like many of my 
colleagues, I believe that Alliance MPs should be paid as much as 
other MPs because we believe that we do the same amount of work 
and we should receive the same pay, so we will opt for that as 
well. 
<P><A NAME="LINK194"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it might not come as a great shock to people but I have been 
actually advised by some people, as we all seek advice, that I 
should not talk about this issue. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1700"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT76"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strongly disagree.  I am prepared to stand here, talk about 
the issue and defend why I am prepared to vote for the bill.  I 
will do it in this place, in my office in the Confederation 
Building, in my office in Streetsville and in my community.  I am 
prepared to be held accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not prepared to say what I have heard others say and what 
the previous speaker said.  I will not say that unless I get what 
I want I will vote against the bill but that because I am worth 
the same as every MP I will also accept the pay increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not parliamentary to use words like hypocrisy, so I will 
not.  However that is the most astounding position a 
parliamentarian could take.  Members should have the courage to 
be accountable for the decisions they make and make the decisions 
they think are just and fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was first elected municipally in 1978.  I served for almost 10 
years as a municipal councillor in the city of Mississauga.  One 
of the issues we dealt with in the early years was the rate of 
pay.  It was a job that changed dramatically from 1974 when the 
city was created to the early eighties when the rapid growth of 
wards and constituencies turned it into a full time job with 
tremendous pressure.  It was a seven day a week job.  It was not 
uncommon to work 18 hours a day.  We needed more staff, more 
resources and better equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly the councillors in those days deserved a pay increase 
and we went through one.  It was horrific.  It was very difficult 
to sit there and have people scream at us that we did not deserve 
it.  People said it should not fall to elected representatives to 
make the decision and that someone else should vote on it.  They 
said there had to be a better way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I went through the reverse when I was elected an MPP in the 
province of Ontario and we took a pay decrease.  Let me say how 
many phone calls came in congratulating me for reducing my pay by 
5%, the taxable portion, from $45,000 down to roughly $42,000.  I 
am quite sure no one remembers that occurred and yet we had to 
vote on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If one must vote on a decrease I suppose one must vote on an 
increase.  I have the greatest difficulty with the misinformation 
being perpetrated and bought, by and large, by members of the 
public. They are calling it an opting out clause.  We could take 
that literally as we did with the pension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know what happened to the Canadian Alliance members who 
wore pigs on their lapels, made grunting noises in this place and 
said they would never come to the trough and take the pension. 
They turned around and opted back into the pension just in time. 
I never opted out.  I have always thought a pension was fair for 
a legislator or member of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know what happened over there.  They can heckle if they wish, 
but we have in the bill an opting in provision which is 
substantially different.  Once the bill is passed all members in 
this place on all sides would have a period of 90 days to inform 
the payroll department whether they wish to accept the increased 
pay.  Members who fail to do so would not receive the increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another interesting point about the opting in provision is that 
it is private.  It is between members of parliament and the 
payroll department.  It is not between members of parliament and 
their constituents.  It is between members of parliament and 
their consciences.  If members vote against the pay raise they in 
good conscience should not opt into the plan and accept the 
increase.  That is accountability.  Let us understand that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear crying from across the way that it is unfair, that it is 
the Prime Minister being a bully.  It is nothing of the sort.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is nothing of the sort.  Members in this place who believe 
the bill is wrong because of the timing, the amount or any of the 
issues involved have an obligation to their constituents and to 
their own consciences to vote against it.  I have no difficulty 
with any member on any side of the House voting against the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have grave difficulty when members grandstand in this place or 
in their constituencies, condemn the government and say the bill 
is awful, vote against it and then opt in.  Members will not be 
in a position to sit back and allow it to happen automatically. 
They must physically do something to obtain the raise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time we looked at what has happened with public wages and 
turned it around to all areas.  What has happened to teachers and 
nurses is unconscionable.  It is time to end it.  Why has it 
happened?  It has happened because all of us, on all sides of 
this place and in all legislatures of this great country, have 
worshipped at the altar of tax cuts to the point where we have 
gutted the public service.  We are all culpable and we are all 
responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>PSAC is currently negotiating with the treasury board for an 
increase.  It is time we were fair.  It is time we looked at 
increases for people who do the important work of the public.  I 
have listened for years to the denigration of public servants, of 
those who work for the people of Canada.  They deserve to be 
paid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the limited time I have I will touch on another issue.  It is 
the height of twisted logic for the leader of the fifth party to 
stand in this place, shaking à la John Diefenbaker, and tell us 
his caucus will vote against this dastardly pay raise while he 
continues to receive a supplement from his own party of $200,000 
per year in addition to his pay as a member of parliament.  For 
the member to stand in his place and pontificate while he accepts 
$200,000 a year from his own party, when the party is in debt by 
over $6 million, must turn people like Mr. Diefenbaker over in 
their graves. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. I am trying to listen to my colleague and I do not even 
know what the topic of debate is.  I cannot tell what topic he is 
addressing.  I would like there to be less provocation and more 
indication of what the subject is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> With all due respect to the hon. member, 
this is not a matter of a point of order, it is debate. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know it upsets people, 
but let us put the facts on the table.  When a member in this 
place accepts a stipend of an additional $200,000 because he 
wants to make close to what he was making in the private sector, 
and then instructs the rest of his caucus not to vote for the 
raise, it is unconscionable.  It is nothing more than 
grandstanding by the leader of the fifth party.  The Canadian 
people will see through that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Turning back to the issue at hand, the timing of the legislation 
is such that Canadians are left to wonder why we would do this in 
the dying days of parliament.  Why are we embarking on aid to MPs 
and not aid to farmers or individuals in the health care or 
justice systems?  Why are we doing this now? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what is so distasteful and reprehensible to Canadians. 
This is hush money for the backbench and blood money for the 
opposition.  This is about telling members of the House of 
Commons that if they do not jump in line and play ball with the 
Prime Minister they will pay a price.  They will take a personal 
penalty.  It will affect their financial well-being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Putting that clause in the bill clearly drives a wedge.  It is 
there to single out individuals and put them into the books of 
Canadians who are looking for someone to champion a cause and yet 
make them pay a penalty for standing and saying that they did not 
ask for this and that they do not see it as a priority or as the 
direction in which the House should be going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are very good recommendations in the report.  The Lumley 
report clearly outlines that this is not an issue we should need 
to deal with in future parliaments.  It says that we should tie 
it into the Judges Act.  It talks about compensation being 
reasonable and tied into another sector.  It talks about the 
necessity of collapsing the tax free allowance that has in 
essence tried to hide the salaries of members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are certainly elements of the report that we can embrace 
but the bill goes beyond the pith and substance of the Lumley 
report. The attempt to somehow deal with it in this parliament is 
inappropriate.  The Progressive Conservative Party is trying to 
be consistent by suggesting that it would be much more appropriate 
to vote on a bill that would take effect after the next election. 
It should also be a bill that we could say with pride would 
enhance parliament and help future parliamentarians rather than 
ourselves.  Those are the horns of the dilemma on which members 
of parliament find themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to change the pay schedule let us do it for a future 
parliament and let us do it in a way that is more palatable not 
only to members of parliament but, more important, to our 
constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment put forward is one we should ponder and take time 
to support.  We should recognize the provocative and laughingly 
arrogant insertion of a clause that says that if one has the 
audacity to stand and oppose the government and the Prime 
Minister's own bill one will pay a price.  That is what is taking 
place.  It is an attempt to bully not only backbench members of 
the government but, more important, opposition members who might 
take umbrage with the suggestion that we should take the money, 
shut our mouths, go away and be happy about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have great difficulty with that.  Members routinely come into 
the Chamber and, on behalf of their constituents and for all 
sorts of reasons, decide not to support government legislation 
and do not pay a personal price for it.  This is taking it to a 
whole new level.  This type of tactic is offensive to the 
democratic principles of parliament.  It is intended to distract 
from the real issue.  Canadians know that the real issue is that 
we are getting money by increasing our salaries.  The Prime 
Minister is in a different category.  After his pay raise his 
salary will be double that of other members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in an incredibly difficult and tight situation.  We are 
between the proverbial rock and the hard place.  We either be 
quiet, bend down, kiss the Prime Minister's ring, take the money 
and sign off, or we just go away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take this moment to move a subamendment to the amendment 
before the House.  I move: 
<A NAME="LINK196">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the amendment be amended by inserting after the words “the 
spirit of pay equity by establishing a two tier” the words “and 
retroactive”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Receiving the money is one thing but to actually take money for 
work already done increases the audacity and the incredible 
affront to people's sensibility.  I therefore move the 
subamendment subject to it being ruled in order by the Chair.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The Chair has reviewed the 
amendment to the amendment tabled by the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough and it is in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish at this moment to make a brief statement on the manner in 
which proceedings will be conducted tomorrow during consideration 
of Bill C-28 in committee of the whole pursuant to special order 
adopted on Monday, June 4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To ensure that proceedings will be conducted in an orderly 
fashion, the Chair wishes to clarify some of the provisions 
dealing with debate and the putting of questions in committee. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first point concerns the procedure by which hon. members may 
propose an amendment in keeping with the order in question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The order has nothing to say about the way this is to be 
applied, but I encourage hon. members to submit their amendments 
to either Journals Branch staff or to the clerk at the table, 
here in the House, at the very latest, by the end of Statements 
by Members, at 2.15 p.m., on Wednesday afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will allow enough time to check whether the motions in 
amendment are in order, to put them in the correct order and, 
something that will be of great use during the deliberations, to 
get copies made and distributed to members of the committee of 
the whole. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would therefore be greatly appreciated if notice could be 
provided as soon as possible, given the work which must be 
completed to ensure an orderly debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the committee's consideration of the bill the 
Chair will put the question on all motions proposed, as well as 
those duly tabled and circulated to members.  Amendments not yet 
proposed or tabled, according to the usual practice in committee, 
will not be put to the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Proceedings on this portion of debate will come to a conclusion 
no later than 15 minutes prior to the ordinary time of 
adjournment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Chair puts all questions necessary to dispose of 
committee stage at 6.15 p.m., a division may be requested on each 
of the questions, that is on the adoption of each clause and each 
amendment thereto.  The committee will report the bill back to 
the House and a non-debatable motion to concur in report stage 
will be proposed. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I trust that all hon. members have a clear understanding of how 
the deliberations will proceed tomorrow, and I thank them for the 
opportunity to make this brief statement. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It being 5.19 p.m., pursuant to order made on Monday, June 4, it 
is my duty to interrupt the proceedings and put forthwith every 
question necessary to dispose of second reading stage of the bill 
now before the House.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>NATIONAL AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY RELIEF COORDINATION ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK203">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC)</B> moved that Bill 
C-263, an act to establish a national committee to develop 
policies and procedures to ensure coordination in the delivery of 
programs by governments in the case of agricultural losses or 
disasters created by weather, pests, shortages of goods or 
services or market conditions, and the coordination of the 
delivery of information, assistance, relief and compensation, and 
to study the compliance of such programs with World Trade 
Organization requirements, be read the second time and referred 
to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak to my private member's 
business with respect to Bill C-263. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I would like to acknowledge the fact that the bill is not 
a votable bill.  It will not receive second reading.  It will not 
go any further than this one hour of debate this evening, which 
is very unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like it recognized that there is an opportunity to 
change the rules of this parliament and this House by deeming 
that all private members' business which comes forward will be 
deemed votable and that each member, whether they be on the 
government side or on the opposition side, be given the 
opportunity to put forward their own opinions as to what should 
be done with respect to legislation for this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin the debate today with an excerpt from a letter that 
was sent to the minister of agriculture on February 15, 1999, 
from the national safety nets advisory committee during the 
negotiations surrounding the infamous AIDA program.  The excerpt 
states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The majority of the National Safety Nets Advisory Committee would 
like to express its disagreement with Agriculture Canada and 
provincial governments regarding the changes they intend to make 
to the Farm Income Disaster Program.  The committee does not 
support the program as it is currently designed—We are 
seriously concerned about the precedents which these decisions 
set on for the next round of the Safety Net negotiations.  The 
program as designed now no longer provides sufficient support to 
farmers facing a crisis. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If only the minister of agriculture actually had listened and 
acted on the words of the committee perhaps he would not have 
faced the severe criticism he had with respect to the AIDA 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister dropped the ball on the design and delivery of the 
AIDA program so badly that the producers and the producer groups 
have completely lost trust and faith in the minister and this 
government's commitment to agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, an advisory committee can work in the future 
if it includes representation from all three levels, federal, 
provincial and stakeholders, and is given more power in the 
decision making process.  Bill C-263 would do exactly that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether it is the ice storm of January 1998, the floods in 
Manitoba in 1997 and in 1999 in my area the Saguenay, the 
droughts in Nova Scotia, or the potential droughts in Alberta, 
any of those should have assistance attached to them in some form 
of a disaster program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When natural disasters occur through weather, pests, or 
agricultural losses through falling commodity prices, the federal 
government must take a more proactive rather than reactive 
approach and start developing policies in advance which would 
benefit our producers in good times and bad, not the ad hoc 
programs that we have seen come from this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of my private member's bill is to help the 
government in doing just that.  The bill would create a committee 
that would assist the minister of agriculture in developing 
policies and procedures to ensure the co-ordination between 
different government authorities with respect to the delivery of 
information assistance, relief and compensation.  The committee 
would monitor situations on an ongoing basis and discuss what 
income protection measures are available to farmers in the event 
of disaster or unusual conditions caused by weather or pests, 
taking into account such areas as crop insurance, flood and 
drought protection programs and NISA. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1815"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT86"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee's mandate is expected to monitor the effects of 
low commodity prices on the agricultural industry and the primary 
producers' farm income as well.  The committee would also 
investigate and advise the minister on the compliance of any 
income assistance programs with the WTO requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee, with some teeth, would consist of 21 members. 
Three members would be nominated by the Minister of Agriculture 
and Agri-Food.  One member would be nominated by the agriculture 
minister in each province.  Five members would represent farmers 
and would be nominated by organizations representing farmers. 
Three members would represent the industry related to agriculture 
products and would be nominated by organizations representing 
those industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members are aware, a national safety net advisory review 
committee exists right now.  My bill is an extension of that 
committee.  It would expand the role, power and membership of the 
committee and give the committee more teeth and more power.  It 
would create a more permanent committee rather than simply ad hoc 
committees that are created at the whim of the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-263 also speaks to more transparency and disclosure of 
information on safety net agreements.  The bill specifically 
calls for all reports to be laid before parliament, not simply 
hid in the minister's office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important that we emphasize the word consistency when 
we talk about co-ordinating assistance programs.  The committee 
would work toward alleviating any problems with achieving 
consistency in the delivery and co-ordination of assistance 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The biggest issue we have right now with any type of disaster 
program is that there is no consistency.  When we talk about the 
ice storm in Quebec, a whole different set of rules and criteria 
are put forward by the ministry when it deals with those kinds of 
problems and disasters.  When it deals with the Red River flood, 
programs that nobody knew about came out of the woodwork because 
it was an election year.  Programs simply materialized. When I 
had the disaster in my area there were no programs but it was not 
an election year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What disturbed my constituents the most was not the fact that 
the government forgot about them but that there was no 
consistency.  If it had been an election year we would have had a 
different program as opposed to a program for a not very high 
profile disaster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Southern Alberta has had absolutely no rain and is suffering 
from drought but that is not considered to be a high profile 
disaster.  I suspect the programs that will come forward from the 
federal government in this instance will not have the same 
consistency as what was delivered to the Red River Valley or, for 
that matter, when the ice storms hit Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There must be consistency in determining the level of 
assistance.  It should not simply be based on the amount of 
publicity a disaster gets.  With the environmental and climatic 
changes that the country and the world are undergoing, it is 
vital now more than ever to monitor these issues on an ongoing 
basis and develop consistent policies that would help farmers 
deal with these changes both financially and socially. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be able to take a program off the shelf and develop it 
in committee.  When it is developed and it describes and defines 
a disaster, we can make sure it also defines the programs that 
are associated with that disaster.  We would make sure the 
definition matches and the program is in place.  There would be 
no inconsistency, no ad hoc programs and no changes from disaster 
to disaster or from region to region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that there is a tripartite working group, as 
Bill C-263 suggests, to have input and share ideas on income 
protection for the farming community.  What is needed now is 
federal leadership on this issue to ensure that this equity and 
fairness is achieved when we shape our future safety net 
framework. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a meeting today in committee that was attended by the 
agriculture ministers from Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. 
They reached consensus on 90% of what they had to say.  They did 
not agree on some issues concerning the Canadian Wheat Board and 
on transportation but we will not go into that.  However, what 
every one of them did agree on was that we need a long term, well 
thought out safety net program.  I heard the same thing four 
years ago.  The Manitoba agriculture minister said that we need a 
long term, well thought out program.

<A HREF="#LINKT87"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I asked the question of those ministers and suggested that 
maybe it should be based on a GRIP model, they agreed.  That is 
the model, by the way, that the government destroyed in 1995. The 
government took it away from farmers.  Were it in place now, it 
would certainly be a different situation in the agriculture 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also said to a person that they would like to show the 
model of the ASRA program in Quebec, that they would like to 
start it as the model and build from that.  When I suggested that 
there is quite a substantial amount of provincial expense 
associated with that program, they said to start with the model 
and then try to get the political will from the government to 
contribute to that model so that we could go forward with a 
safety net program that would actually work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would allow that to happen— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I want to apologize to the hon. member.  There is some 
ambiguity apparently with the Table as to defining whether the 
time of the vote on the motion tomorrow is 5.15 p.m. or 6.15 p.m. 
I just want to inform the House that the intention was 5.15 p.m. 
so as to preserve private members' hour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had consultations with all other House leaders to ensure 
that this is in fact what the intention was and I thought I would 
take this opportunity to inform the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. House 
leader for putting that information forward.  It is very 
important that we can vote on that particular motion an hour 
earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dealing with my bill now instead of the government's bill on pay 
raises, I would suggest that the agriculture ministers who were 
appearing before the committee all agreed that a safety net 
program should be put together.  Dealing with that issue with 
respect to the committee I am proposing, with the committee being 
made up not only of farmers, producers, industry people and 
government people but also of people from the provinces, we would 
then be able to have a group get together to put in place the 
right process, the right model, and then take that forward, and 
not just to the minister because unfortunately the minister loses 
those recommendations on a fairly regular basis.  I do not think 
anybody, including the minister of agriculture, could have 
possibly put forward a worse program than the AIDA program and 
could have possibly put forward a worse implementation than the 
AIDA implementation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my constituency office about 50% of my time and my staff's 
time is devoted to trying to find out the status of AIDA claims. 
That was supposed to be finished by now.  We had a safety net 
program called AIDA that was supposed to put dollars in the 
pocket immediately.  As a matter of fact I heard the minister say 
at one time that the AIDA program was bankable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have great difficulty in suggesting that any producer 
could go to any bank in the country and generate a loan based on 
the criteria of AIDA.  That producer would be laughed out of any 
financial institution, because there was no understanding at all 
of what kind of financial compensation producers would get when 
they applied to AIDA.  Producers spent a lot of money at their 
accountants for the information, applied to AIDA and had a number 
that was generated from the criteria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Applications to AIDA went through a bunch of processes.  In some 
cases producers were told what the number would be and when they 
ended up with the cheque it was totally different and always for 
less than what the original application was for.  In some cases 
it was up to 50% less.  In some cases after they made their 
application based on information developed by their accountants, 
the government came back and said they would get nothing out of 
the AIDA program.  Is that bankable?

<A HREF="#LINKT88"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I am trying to make is that if this committee were in 
existence it could put forward its model and the implementation 
of its model as well.  Everybody would live happily ever after 
except of course for the government because it might finally have 
to do something right with respect to agriculture.  That would be 
a terrible divergence from where it is now.  If it actually did 
something right for producers and agriculture, producers would 
not know what hit them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the legislation is non-votable.  It is an issue 
that is very dear and close to my heart and to the hearts of the 
people I represent in my rural area.  Unfortunately a good safety 
net program will not come forward.  The new CFIP has been 
extended for two years and it is very underfunded.  I do not 
believe the government has the political will to put forward the 
necessary programs to keep agriculture prosperous in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would appreciate hearing from the parliamentary secretary who 
probably does not understand the issue very well.  However I am 
sure he has some notes that have been made for him, so I will sit 
back and listen. 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry McCormick (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have not 
been insulted.  If my colleague was not saying that in jest, I 
would be insulted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have just heard from one of our valuable members of the all 
party Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food.  I heard 
one of my colleagues in the Canadian Alliance say in the last two 
weeks that we were the committee on the Hill that gets along 
better, for all the right reasons, than any other committee. I 
believe we have good people sitting around the table. We do not 
always agree.  I am certain that we will hear the ideas of the 
hon. member for Brandon—Souris in the near future and when we 
visit his community in the fall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate is very important.  The importance of being prepared 
for an agricultural disaster cannot be overemphasized.  I thank 
the hon. member for raising the profile of the issue. However the 
government cannot support the bill for very obvious reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague knows that first and foremost Agriculture and 
Agri-Food Canada is already responsible for developing policies 
and procedures in case of agricultural losses or disasters. There 
is no denying the importance of our agriculture and agri-food 
sector.  It is an integrated and complex $130 billion a year 
chain.  It is the second largest manufacturing sector and the 
employer of one out of every seven jobs in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current system allows the government to develop positions 
regarding agricultural policy that are consistent with the 
national interest.  It includes accounting for what is the best 
for the country as a whole, for both rural and urban Canadians. 
The proposed bill would not allow us to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Legislating the committee's mandate and membership structure 
would reduce the government's flexibility to consult more broadly 
on different and evolving issues.  To develop programs and 
policies for the sector, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada 
consults with a wide range of stakeholders.  These consultations 
are a valuable means of listening to Canadians and sharing ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>AAFC has a long history of consulting with national farm 
organizations, producers, processors, provinces and territories. 
The department is also reaching out to consumers, citizens, 
non-government organizations and civil society organizations that 
look to AAFC to provide safe food, a clean environment and 
products that improve the quality of life.  That is what we 
provide and Canadians do a great job of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government values opportunities to engage in informed 
discussion with people representing a broad range of opinions. 
The insights gained from these consultations are crucial to the 
department as it continues to serve the priority needs of 
Canadians.  By taking the views of a wide range of Canadians into 
account, the government is better positioned to ensure the 
agriculture and agri-food sector is competitive and innovative in 
the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take a few moments to review the safety net programs we 
already have in place. 
Last July, federal, provincial and territorial agriculture 
ministers signed a three year framework agreement on farm income 
safety nets worth $5.5 billion.  The federal government is 
investing up to $3.3 billion over the next three years and the 
provinces are contributing up to $2.2 billion. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1830"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT89"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to bringing more money to the table, the new 
agreement marked the first time ever that all the provinces and 
the federal government, including Manitoba, signed on to a common 
approach to delivering federal-provincial farm safety net 
programs, an approach which includes an ongoing income disaster 
program the Canadian farmers had requested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian farm income program, or CFIP, is a three year 
national disaster program designed to provide funding for 
agricultural producers here in Canada to address serious income 
reductions that are beyond their control.  The framework also 
provides the basis for federal and provincial core safety net 
programs, which include fall cash advances, NISA, crop insurance 
and province specific programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another reason why the government cannot support the bill is 
that agriculture disasters and farm income are not issues in 
isolation from all the others facing farmers.  That is why the 
government is going even further in domestic policy development, 
with the goal of greater security for this sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we are working on a strategy that includes income 
stabilization, adjustment and transition, food safety and 
environmental protection.  This strategy will provide producers 
with the appropriate tools to manage their individual situations 
with a market oriented, globally competitive industry.  To 
achieve that goal, we are broadening our understanding of risk to 
include the entire food chain, from field to fork, and to include 
not only price and yield risks but also environmental and food 
safety concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are helping the agriculture and agrifood sectors manage all 
of the risks that they face and respond to the growing 
expectations of citizens and consumers.  We are enhancing our 
already great reputation for being known throughout the world as 
a supplier of high quality and safe products.  We want customers 
to choose Canada because it sets the standard for food safety and 
for environmental responsibility in the production of our food. 
This strategy, not the bill put forward by the member opposite, 
will make Canada the world leader in using environmentally 
sustainable practices and in producing safe, high quality food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This approach builds on the advancements in science, 
particularly life science, the growing knowledge of living things 
and to facilitate sector growth.  Canadians are world leaders in 
agricultural research and development, with recognized expertise 
in areas such as sustainable farming practices, biotechnology and 
life science. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Life sciences, for example, are creating a whole new range of 
products and services based on renewable resources such as 
plants.  We are actively pursuing new and expanded uses for 
traditional agricultural commodities, including, for example, 
biodiesel additives that are made from canola, nutriceuticals 
from tomatoes and from flax, and the production of high value 
pharmaceutical proteins in plants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have many great possibilities staring at us in the immediate 
future.  We are also developing completely new crops in which to 
deliver viable chemicals to all kinds of applications.  Our 
farmers will have the tools that they need to produce products 
that are the number one choice of Canadian citizens and consumers 
around the globe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consumers will choose Canada because it sets the standard for 
food safety, for environmental responsibility and for innovation 
and because a Canadian product from the Canadian market is one 
that people can trust and believe in.  A Canadian product can 
always be believed in and we are very proud of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In turn, our producers in rural communities will reap the 
benefits of the new markets, economic growth and investment that 
are rightfully theirs.  We will provide them with a legacy and a 
future that is a source of national pride, an unbeatable national 
advantage that will support generations to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are producing products in a sustainable and environmentally 
responsible manner so that our natural resources are productive 
for generations to come.

backward, but I am sure my colleague will be back at another time 
to do a better job, with more research, and we will look at this 
issue again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to debate in committee tomorrow when in fact our 
guest speaker will be the Secretary of State for Rural 
Development.  It is worth noting that this is the first time in 
the history of the House of Commons there has been a minister 
responsible for rural development in Canada.  I am glad to say 
that the minister will be in front of our committee tomorrow. 
<P><A NAME="LINK206"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is interesting to listen to the 
debate that is going on today.  The last comment made by my 
colleague is also very interesting because the budget for that 
department is even less than that for the gun registry.  That is 
an indication that the gun registry is spending much more money 
than was first planned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my pleasure to speak to the bill today, which calls for 
the creation of a national committee to oversee programs in the 
case of agricultural losses, disasters or market conditions.  It 
is quite evident, however, that the current government is either 
not listening to farmers or is indifferent to their plight.  With 
net farm income in both Saskatchewan and Manitoba hitting record 
lows and input costs rising day by day, it is appalling to see 
how the government has brushed aside the Canadian farmer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In committee today we listened to three agriculture ministers 
from the prairie provinces.  Input costs have risen dramatically. 
The farm crisis in those provinces is deepening.  Farm income has 
gone up in other provinces, but the grain producing provinces are 
still in crisis.  A 15% rise in interest costs alone last year 
indicates that farmers are borrowing more money just to try to 
stay afloat.  There has been a 35% increase in fuel costs. 
Farmers find this devastating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line in all of this is that in my home province of 
Saskatchewan the average farm income is less than $7,000.  We 
were talking about salaries in the House today, but let us take a 
look at what many thousands of people who produce food for the 
country have to exist on.  That is something we need to address 
and need to address urgently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was clearly demonstrated on March 20 when we in the Canadian 
Alliance put forward a motion calling upon the government to give 
an additional $400 million in emergency assistance to Canadian 
farmers.  The motion was voted down by the government side, by 
the way.  If the government had been listening to farmers and 
farm groups, it would have known that the $500 million it put on 
the table was not enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead the government has said that programs like AIDA would 
help farmers get through their financial crunch, but with red 
tape entangling every farmer who applies it has become more of a 
hindrance than a help.  There are horror stories of farmers who 
applied and were assured that they would get money, so they 
borrowed money from their banks because they were told it was 
bankable.  Then months later they were asked to repay the amount. 
Farmers do not have money to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The horror stories are terrible.  I wish government members 
would go to my constituency, answer the phone sometime and listen 
to what farmers have to contend with as they apply for some of 
this government assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is extremely important for the government to receive 
information on how effective current safety net programs are and 
to take advice on how to improve the delivery of necessary 
financing for our farm families.  We have a committee in place 
that is called the national safety net advisory committee.  The 
problem is not a lack in the committee or lack of advice.  The 
problem is the minister of agriculture and the governing Liberals 
in general who ignore the advice they have received. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In committee this morning we heard again that all kinds of 
studies have been done on the farm situation.  We heard about the 
Estey report and the Kroeger report.  The results are virtually 
ignored.  There is no point in having all these studies and there 
is no point in setting up committees if the government does not 
follow up and do something about this issue.

<A HREF="#LINKT91"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give more examples.  Farm groups have shown consistently 
that the current AIDA program has failed to address the needs of 
grain and oilseeds producers.  The government has ignored this 
fact.  I have received letters and phone calls from disgruntled 
farmers who are trying to get through the red tape that is called 
AIDA.  Some farmers are still waiting for their 1999 claim.  That 
is two years after the fact.  Those who have qualified are at 
times waiting for their cheques after receiving notification that 
they will be receiving the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farm groups thought if they could give advice on how to improve 
AIDA, the government might listen, but the government has not. 
Agricultural producers said again and again that a minimum of 
$900 million was needed just to cover the losses they incurred in 
2000, but our Prime Minister allowed only $500 million to be 
given out.  Farm rallies and producer delegations have come to 
Ottawa and have all said time and time again that the $500 
million was not close to enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is quite evident.  The government refuses to listen 
even to a committee of its own creation.  Our party has done what 
the government has refused to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate what my colleague on the government side said about 
the agriculture committee.  Yes, we try to work together with 
government, we try to point out what is necessary for it to do, 
but it seems to fall on deaf ears. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year the Canadian Alliance went out to farmers and asked 
them what they would like to see the government implement. 
Farmers told us that assistance should be given out on time and 
should be targeted to those who need help the most and that any 
type of farm assistance program must be improved to provide long 
term stability to farmers instead of constantly created ad hoc 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those farmers came before the committee.  They gave reasonable 
solutions to the crisis we are facing in agriculture, but nothing 
happened.  That is what Canadian producers have told us.  That is 
what they have been telling the national safety net advisory 
committee, but the minister of agriculture and his colleagues on 
the government side refused to listen.  Would the creation of a 
new committee cause the government to listen when already it does 
not listen to a committee of the same nature?  That is highly 
doubtful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the motion.  I would do anything to try to help out 
our agriculture producers, but I do not know that another 
committee is going to really do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that the government side must be hard of hearing.  It 
seems to turn a blind eye to an industry that employs 1.7 million 
Canadians, has exports that total $27.6 billion and contributes 
$13.6 billion to our gross domestic product.  It is just 
unfathomable that the government would ignore this kind of 
industry.  It seems that the voice of the farmer no longer 
matters to the government.  I would ask the government to start 
listening and to spend more time with farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the coming months we may have a drought like we have not seen 
for over 130 years.  If the no rain situation continues in 
Alberta and western Saskatchewan, we will have a crisis that will 
be even more severe and will have more dimensions to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will the government do when the cattle are being shipped in 
order to find better pasture land?  What will the government do 
when the water levels drop to dangerously low levels?  Will the 
government begin to listen when it is too late?  Will it perk up 
its ears and start to lend an ear to agriculture producers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All I ask is that the government listen, not just to me but to 
producers.  I ask the government to listen to their problems.  I 
ask the government to listen to their advice and use it to help 
them in troubled times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning we had three ministers of different political 
stripes before the committee, three ministers who agree that 
something has to be done.  When we have a problem of this 
dimension on the prairies, we must take it seriously.  When the 
cutbacks were made in 1993 the prairie provinces were expected to 
take a much greater hit.  That is one thing that all the 
ministers before the committee this morning agreed on.  They 
agreed that they were treated differently, that they had taken a 
much greater hit than the rest of the agricultural sector. 
Would we then conclude that the government, by cutting back in 
these areas and not allowing enough time for the change has 
actually, created the crisis in western Canada?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give an example.  The Crow rate was a transportation 
subsidy that western Canadian farmers had for almost a century. 
It was suddenly removed.  We said at that time that 90% of that 
money should be taken and rolled into a program that would 
compensate them for the adverse effects that they received from 
other parts.  That did not happen.  If that would have happened 
at that point, we would have had enough money accumulated now to 
deal with this crisis because, as was explained in committee 
today, this crisis has come about because of the farm support 
programs in other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on and on, however if we need another committee and 
if that committee is going to help, I will support it.  However, 
the bottom line is we have to make sure that whatever happens, 
farmers are listened to and their needs are addressed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise to discuss a concern that 
should affect and seriously grab the attention of all Canadians, 
and that is our agricultural crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There probably was not a sadder day for our primary producers 
than the day the Prime Minister country said, and I believe I am 
quoting verbatim, “I don't understand the problem in 
agriculture, it is not showing up in the polls”.  Imagine a 
farmer struggling in the fields of Saskatchewan, or the Annapolis 
Valley, or Manitoba or wherever hearing the Prime Minister issue 
a statement of that nature?  It was because of that type of 
response by the Prime Minister that I entered politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In November 1996, on national television, a woman from Quebec 
asked this same Prime Minister a question.  By the way, that was 
his last televised town hall meeting.  Imagine how nervousness 
she was, bearing in mind that he had been a member of parliament 
for 33 years and was the Prime Minister of the country.  She 
asked him what he or his government could do to assist her to 
search for gainful employment?  He could have and should have 
said that she had brought up a specific case and if she cared to 
meet his officials after the show, they would be happy to talk to 
her.  However, he did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What he said changed my life and got me into politics.  He said 
“Well Madam, in life some people are lucky, some are not.  You 
may have to move”.  I was so upset by our Prime Minister when he 
said that that I decided to enter the political world, and here I 
am today.  Years later, he said that agriculture was not showing 
up in the polls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, the member for Palliser who through his efforts 
has not only kept the caucus abreast of the agricultural issues, 
but has raised these issues in the standing committee and in the 
House of Commons.  He deserves a wonderful warm round of applause 
for his continued effort to bring the issues of agriculture to 
the forefront of political debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Brandon—Souris is asking that a committee be 
struck to look into the issues that severely affect our farmers 
and their families of today, be it weather, pests, shortages of 
goods or services, market conditions, delivery concerns, et 
cetera.  He is asking the government and opposition members to 
show a little forward thinking in terms of the needs of our 
agricultural producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not long ago a group farmers and their families spoke to our 
caucus about their concerns and the agricultural crisis they were 
facing at home in the prairies. 
We should bear in mind that 22,000 families left the farm in 
1998-99.  If that is not a crisis, what is it?

</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked a young man from Saskatchewan who was about 12 or 13 
years old if he would go into the agriculture industry when he 
became older.  He said that his father and his grandfather did 
but he would not.  Then I asked him if his classmates in school 
would go into the agriculture industry and become farmers, and he 
said no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question that begs to be asked is:  Who will be the 
agricultural producers of tomorrow?  Will it be the family farm 
or will it be the multinational corporate farm?  Is the family 
farm dead and finished?  If it is, the government should have the 
courage to say so, but that is not its initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from an area of the world where a lot of fishing takes 
place.  The loss of independent fishermen in the nineties and 
what happened to their families is exactly what is happening to 
farmers of today.  It is inexcusable that the government just 
sits back and twiddles its thumbs and allows this crisis to 
happen.  It is almost like the government does it deliberately. 
It is almost like it wants multinational corporations to take 
over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mark my words, Mr. Speaker.  We may eventually lose our 
agricultural sovereignty in Canada, which means that we will have 
to rely on other nations or other corporations governed by other 
nations to feed us.  That will be a sad day.  We should be world 
leaders and we are falling further behind.  We are telling our 
farmers that we do not care and that parliament is too busy to 
deal with their issues.  All my colleague from Brandon—Souris 
asked was that a committee be struck to look at the issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is incredible that government members will not accept that 
argument but it is understandable.  A good idea from the 
opposition is rarely accepted by the Liberal Party.  It is 
unfortunate the Liberals cannot get their heads out of the clouds 
for one moment and accept good and reasonable debate. There was a 
time when the Liberal Party of Canada would have done so, but it 
does not do it now.  If an idea does not come from that bench, it 
certainly does not go anywhere.  That is a disgrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of farmers and on behalf of the New Democratic Party 
from coast to coast to coast, we thank the member for 
Brandon—Souris for his initiative.  We would have liked to see 
it votable, but unfortunately it is quite obvious that the 
Liberal government would not see that happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry McCormick:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I heard my hon. colleagues on the other side say that we 
have no committee and that we are stopping a committee.  We have 
a committee—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am not here to quote the member for 
Brandon—Souris.  While the Chair is not here to agree or 
disagree, the member certainly has a point that this matter is

Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern Shore time to conclude 
his remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  My remarks will be very clear.  I 
personally thank all farmers and their families across the 
country who toil in the fields and in the factories in order to 
provide us with the best food in the world.  On behalf of the

them Godspeed in their future deliberations.

the country.  I look over there and pretty well all of them are 
disinterested in what we are doing today.  That is very 
unfortunate because it is a matter of great importance.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make a few comments about the importance of 
agriculture.  It goes far beyond the fact that I grew up on a 
farm.  It goes far beyond the fact that I still have relatives in 
Saskatchewan and Alberta.  I do not have any farming relatives in 
Alberta, but I have farming relatives in Saskatchewan.  I have 
many farmers in my riding for whom I feel an obligation to speak 
up on an occasion like this one when a motion was presented by a 
member of the Progressive Conservative Party which talked about 
the crisis in the agricultural industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada, in conjunction with the provincial 
governments, has a large duty in the agricultural community which 
has gone unfulfilled.  It is more than just a crisis of lack of 
rain, pests or the usual things farmers have contended with all 
their lives.  It is a crisis in marketing their commodities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want all Liberal members to hear that there are problems which 
have been produced by the government.  It is curious to me that 
members of the Liberal Party are basically saying there are so 
few voters on the prairies it does not matter whether or not they 
look after them because they will not lose many votes and will 
still keep power.  It seems that the Liberal government is all 
words, all committee and no action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I hesitate to interrupt the hon. 
member for Elk Island, but it seems to me that a few voices of 
members opposite in particular seem to come to my attention.  I 
know they would love to speak to this motion once more but they 
already have done so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask and beg their indulgence to allow other members the same 
privilege.  I would love to hear the hon. member for Elk Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate your comments. 
Certainly the House should be a place of dialogue and not just 
verbal jousting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers in my riding are having trouble these days.  It includes 
drought, and with drought comes another problem.  One farmer in 
my area this week lost his home.  It was so dry around his place 
that unfortunately a fire started, the grass burned up to his 
house and took his house down.  That is a calamity in that 
family. Everything was lost due climate over which farmers have 
no control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is maddening is when farmers have problems over which they 
have no control but which the government could change.  That is 
the source of the agricultural crisis.  For example, I know a 
farmer who sells seed grain.  Seed grain is not covered by the 
wheat board.  The wheat board will not market it.  All it markets 
is the usual grain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The farmer is wanting to market his seed grain.  The wheat board 
demands that it be sold through him.  It will not take it. That 
does not make any sense.  What a frustration to a farmer who 
wants to make enough money to look after himself and his family, 
to pay his bills, his increasing energy bills, and all other 
bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis:</B>  Blame the Alberta government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  I would blame both governments.  I blame 
members of the federal government because when there was a vote 
on rules for the wheat board they all stood even though none of 
them, or I should say very few of them, represented ridings in 
the prairies.  They had the gall to set up a wheat board that 
applies only to the prairie provinces and does not apply— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I beg your indulgence.  I stayed here because I had an interest 
to hear, but I am not really hearing what this debate is all 
about.  If we could get back to the subject matter I would like 
to hear it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  If the hon. parliamentary secretary 
would give the hon. member for Elk Island a little more time, I 
am sure he would find the pertinence and relevance he is seeking 
right before his eyes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B> Mr. Speaker, the Progressive Conservative 
member's bill deals with times of crisis in agriculture and 
attempts to take a farmer through those years when family and 
farm income is very low or zero.  For the member who is listening 
so carefully, which I appreciate, I simply am drawing the picture 
that some of the reasons for a reduced or zero income for farmers 
are due to climate, such as dryness. However some reasons are 
government induced for which we should have solutions but we do 
not because the government is unresponsive to the needs of 
prairie farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned the seed farmer.  I have talked to other farmers who 
are very frustrated.  They have products in their bins which they 
are ready to sell.  They even have buyers but they cannot sell to 
them.  They have to take the product to the wheat board.  Then if 
they want, they can buy it back at an inflated price.  No one 
else does that.  I do not know of a single other industry where, 
in order to sell one's own product, one first has to sell it to a 
government or an agency of the government and then buy it back at 
a higher price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a farmer in southern Alberta who has been actually 
doing that.  He markets his product in the United States because 
he has a customer there who buys it.  This is so absurd that I 
must relay it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He takes his grain from his bin to his truck, which he drives 
over to the grain elevator.  He gets his truck weighed then dumps 
the grain so it can weigh the truck again.  The difference is the 
weight of the grain.  Then they load the grain back up again. He 
sells it to the wheat board, then writes a cheque for something 
more than what he pays for it, including costs of dockage and a 
proportional cost of transportation for which the wheat board is 
responsible.  He does it himself but he has to pay for it.  Then 
he takes that product across the border and sells it to the 
person who wanted to buy it from him in the first place.  He is 
still making money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the effectiveness of the wheat board?  Part of the farm 
crisis is that there are rules and regulations which affect 
farmers and which are induced by inaction or wrong action on the 
parts of governments.  If the wheat board is so good for Alberta, 
Manitoba and Saskatchewan, then why is it not good for Ontario 
and Quebec?  Why is it not good for the Atlantic provinces?  Why 
do they not have to sell their products through a marketing board 
controlled by the federal government?  That is an area that has 
been overlooked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To have an agency which looks at all of these different areas 
and helps to provide a way whereby farmers can, in those bleak 
years, weather the storm and carry on with their businesses 
instead of going bankrupt is so important.  I do not think people 
who have never gone through a bankruptcy know how devastating it 
is, especially when a family loses a farmland which has been in 
the family for 50, 80 and 100 years.  That is totally devastating 
and it is about time that something be done about it.  Therefore, 
I commend the member for the bill and I am very pleased to 
support it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will 
close the debate and will be brief.  I thank the hon. members for 
being in the House this late and speaking to an issue, which 
means a lot to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituency consists of agriculture.  My economic base is 
agriculture.  I believe very strongly that anything we can do in 
the House to assist the agricultural industry to get through 
these difficult times is important for us all, whether we are on 
the opposition side of the bench or on the government's side of 
the bench.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to suggest that the parliamentary secretary spoke 
very eloquently.  However when I listened to his speech, it 
seemed he was saying that everything in agriculture was just 
hunky-dory and that it had all of those wonderful programs 
associated with it, which could help agriculture get over this 
terrible speed bump.  That in fact is not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from a constituency that has had a double whammy.  It had 
the double whammy of a natural disaster in 1999, when 1.3 million 
acres were not sown.  The next whammy were the crops that were 
generated in the 2000 crop year and put in this year.  They are 
generating commodity prices so low this year that producers 
cannot pay back all the losses they incurred for the 1999 crop 
year.  So things are not hunky-dory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason for this bill was to suggest that a committee be 
struck and be charged with the responsibility of coming forward 
to the minister, then to the government and to this parliament 
with a safety net program that absolutely would work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, we have models in this country, particularly 
the ASRA program in Quebec and perhaps the MRI program in 
Ontario.  If we could get a committee that would bring together 
all stakeholders and put forward the right safety net program and 
model and have it come to fruition with the proper financial 
resources coming both from the federal and provincial 
governments, then maybe we would not have to stand in the House 
over and over again trying to make sure the government recognizes 
there is a very serious problem in agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank the House for its indulgence. 
Unfortunately the AIDA program is an unmitigated disaster.  The 
CFIP program will be an unmitigated disaster.  If there is a 
disaster caused by weather in Alberta this year, the federal 
government will not be there to help and assist.  If there is 
another weather disaster, whether it be in Nova Scotia or in the 
southeastern portion of the province of Manitoba, where we are 
suffering through a similar fate as I did in 1999, the federal 
government will not be there.  If it is, it will be an ad hoc 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It absolutely amazes me that the government does not have the 
ability to put forward what I believe are the right programs. 
That can be developed.  However the political will is not there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the House for its indulgence, and hopefully next time we 
can get this voted on.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to elaborate on a 
question I raised in the House last week pertaining to mercury in 
fish.  In fact I raised several questions last week as a result 
of an indepth investigative report done by the Ottawa 
<I>Citizen</I>, backed up by independent laboratory testing, which 
showed that mercury levels in several species of fish available 
in the marketplace today, including shark, swordfish and fresh 
and frozen tuna, were twice the limit set by Health Canada, if 
not more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The news that was generated from that story was greeted with a 
less than positive response by the government.  I was shocked 
that this finding was not treated more seriously by the 
government of the day.  I had fully expected that the 
parliamentary secretary or the Minister of Health would have 
stood in the House and said that the findings concerned them and 
they would investigate and take appropriate action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead the response of the government was as follows.  The 
suggestion was that these fish in fact were gourmet fish and 
therefore were eaten in such limited quantities that the impact 
on human health was negligible.  This statement was made despite 
the fact that there are no studies or findings to determine 
levels of consumption of those species of fish in Canada today.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government then suggested, and the Minister of Health in 
particular, that Canada's limits were so prudent that we could 
afford to take a risk with high levels of mercury in certain 
fish.  The Minister of Health suggested that our limits were 
twice the limits set by the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out that the limit set by Canada, which is 0.5 parts per 
million of mercury in fish, is a limit that is genuinely accepted 
across the board in numerous countries.  According to the 
government's own information and statistics, Canada is not 
dissimilar from many other countries and in some instances is 
less prudent than other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also it is important to point out that when it comes to the 
United States, which is often cited as an example of having a 
less than cautious regulatory approach, the real level used that 
helps consumers make decisions is on par with those of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our concern in raising this question is not scaremongering or 
fishmongering, as the Minister of Health so foolishly suggested 
in the House.  It is to require the government to take the 
necessary steps to ensure consumers are protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask again if the government is prepared to issue warnings to 
all consumers so that they are aware of the levels of mercury in 
fish and so that pregnant women in particular can take necessary 
precautions.  I also ask the government to issue an advisory to 
all fish sellers across Canada asking them to provide some 
notification to consumers purchasing these products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the absence of government action and leadership, fish 
retailers and wholesalers across the country are making decisions 
on their own.  They are in a quandary as to what to do.  They 
expect and demand action from the government.  I think it is a 
reasonable request and I would ask the government to respond 
accordingly.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, for some time now, a Health Canada 
directive has provided for a tolerance of no more than 0.5 ppm of 
mercury in fish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some species are not covered by the directive: swordfish, shark 
and both fresh and frozen tuna.  These are large predatory 
species that tend to accumulate mercury and therefore have higher 
levels of it. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than preventing perfectly wholesome and nutritious foods 
from being available in the marketplace, a strategy to protect 
health in the case of exempted species was warranted.  Contrary 
to recent media reports, Health Canada did not instruct CFIA to 
exempt these fish from testing or other surveillance activities. 
In fact fish are subjected to regular inspection by CFIA.  The 
agency enforces the guideline and monitors levels of mercury in 
these fish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998 Health Canada issued an advisory recommending 
consumption of no more than one meal per month in the case of 
women of child bearing age and children, and one meal per week 
for the general Canadian population.  This advisory was reissued 
last week. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure everyone understands that, when it comes to health 
protection, the same strategy cannot be employed in all 
circumstances.  While laws and directives are useful in the 
production and sale of foods, there are other situations where it 
is just as legitimate to use strategies based on the use of 
information or, as in this case, consumer advisories.  In this 
instance, the advisory to limit consumption seems the best 
strategy. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other jurisdictions have also exempted species.  The European 
Union, for instance, has a 0.5 ppm limit for the mean total 
mercury content of fish and exempts many more species than does 
Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I maintain that Canada can proudly take its place in the world 
as a nation that acts responsibly to protect groups sensitive to 
mercury in fish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is not at all imprudent in the case of mercury, and, in 
some instances, it is even more prudent than others in its 
recommendations.  The directive in effect and the advisories 
issued should be seen as strategies that both help disseminate 
important health information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The motion to adjourn the House is now 
deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly, this House stands 
adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 
24. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 7:15 p.m.)
