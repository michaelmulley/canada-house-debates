	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-54, an act to amend the 
Foreign Extraterritorial Measures Act, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to seek the unanimous consent 
of the House that the first 40-minute time slot accorded to the 
government, notwithstanding the standing orders, be split between 
two members as opposed to one speaker as is normally the case. I 
believe you will find unanimous consent for that proposition.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the courtesy of the members of the opposition 
allowing leave for a joint presentation of this legislation by myself 
and the Minister for International Trade.
<P>
	In the last several months Canadians have been heavily engaged 
in a variety of debates about the imposition of the Helms-Burton 
law by the United States Congress.
<P>
	The legislation being presented to the House today at second 
reading is basically a defensive measure to allow Canadians to 
protect themselves against parts of that act and to demonstrate that 
we will provide a basic tool kit for Canadians to ensure that their 
interests are protected. In the amendments there are a number of 
technical features with which the minister of trade will deal.
<P>
<B>(1005)</B>
<P>
	At the outset I want to address the fundamental principle that is 
at stake in the legislation. The Helms-Burton bill is an attempt by 
the United States Congress to unilaterally decide the rules of the 
game for other countries. That runs counter to the basic principles  
on which an international economy or an international society can 
work.
<P>
	We have debated in the House in the past weeks the importance 
of a fundamental rule of law to govern the actions between 
individuals. The rule of law is also important in governing the 
relationships between nations if we want to develop an open 
international economy for trade, investment, telecommunications, 
commerce and culture. We have learned our lessons over the last 40 
or 50 years that the best way to do that is to come to an agreement 
on basic laws that we agree to, basic principles that we adhere to. If 
there are to be changes to those, nations come together to negotiate 
and discuss them and arrive at some consensus.
<P>
	The minister of trade has been actively involved in the 
development of a World Trade Organization. It is an enormously 
important development for the world. The whole premise is that 
there have to be rules by which countries abide. If one country, 
especially an extremely powerful country, perhaps the most 
powerful country in the world, begins to adopt a unilateral 
approach that it can declare on its own, without any consideration 
for the rights of other individuals or states, then it begins to break 
down the international system that we have laboured so diligently 
in the last half century to build.
<P>
	It is ironic that the United States has over that 50 years been a 
leader in developing those rules. Not only has it been a leader, but it 
has been a beneficiary. Perhaps no country in the world has gained 
more of its economic strength by helping to open up the 
international system. Yet at the very time the rhetoric and the 
pronouncements in various fora around the world by United States 
representatives of a need to put rules into globalization and ensure 
that we expand and augment our openness, its Congress passed a 
law which basically tells Canadians: ``We will decide for you what 
your policy will be in relation to a third party. And if you do not 
adhere to what we decide is right, then we will penalize your 
companies and your individuals''. It makes absolutely no sense. It 
is totally contrary to the interest of the international community 
and is certainly contrary to the interests of Canada. I would dare 
say, it is contrary to the interests of the United States.
<P>
	It is interesting that in a recent Angus Reid poll which was done 
in the United States, 64 per cent of Americans who know about the 
Helms-Burton bill support the right of Canada to have its own 
independent policy vis-à-vis  Cuba. That has been our point. We 
have not argued the question of whether the United States policy 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4486"> 4486 </A></B>
<P>
toward Cuba is right or wrong. We do not agree with it. We have a 
different approach. But it is certainly their right how they want to 
deal with another country.
<P>
	We will use all avenues and venues to talk with the United States 
and other countries about how we can work together to improve 
and make the system in Cuba more open. For the United States to 
tell us how to carry out our policies and if we do not agree with 
them, to impose a penalty, is an enormous step backward both in 
our relationships and also in terms of the wider international 
community.
<P>
	Therefore, it is important that the House in the legislation send a 
message that Canadians will not accept that kind of unilateralism 
and that we will stand firm to protect the interests of our 
companies, the interests of our citizens and the interests of Canada 
to be able to maintain its independent sovereign right to decide how 
to do its international business.
<P>
	I say that in the confidence of knowing that on both sides of the 
House there has been basic support for this approach. It is a good 
example of how, when we unite as a country on a matter of 
fundamental importance, we can speak with a very strong voice.
<P>
<B>(1010)</B>
<P>
	One of the most important developments during the debate on 
the Helms-Burton legislation is the way that not only has the 
country united-provincial governments have been in support, the 
public has been in support, members of this House on both have 
been in support-we have been able to mobilize a very active and a 
very effective campaign to counter Helms-Burton.
<P>
	The United States has become virtually isolated on this. In the 
Caribbean, in Latin American countries, in Europe and in Asia 
there is total condemnation of the bill. That is due in some large 
part by the leadership shown by Canada.
<P>
	The Prime Minister started that when he went to the Caribbean 
nations just weeks after the imposition of Helms-Burton and was 
able to get full agreement from the Caribbean countries. The 
Minister for International Trade has been working actively with his 
colleagues in Mexico and other members of the trade organization, 
in NAFTA and WTO.
<P>
	Our secretary of state for Latin American affairs was an effective 
floor manager at the OAS at which time a resolution was passed 30 
to 1 condemning the United States for its actions. Those of you who 
are historians of the OAS would know that is a very unusual 
happening and one that was taken notice of by the United States 
because it demonstrated that the United States had stepped across 
the boundary of what is a fair, equitable and useful system.
<P>
	As a result of our unity in this matter we have been able to 
provide real leadership in the international community and to 
provide a very strong message. I think the message has been 
received.
<P>
	One of the things we can take some satisfaction from is that in 
title III, which is the part of the Helms-Burton bill which gives the 
right to U.S. companies to sue foreign companies that they believe 
may have been involved in confiscated property in Cuba, the 
United States president has deferred the implementation of that 
part of the act as he has a right to do under the legislation. He has 
not totally deferred it.
<P>
	Canadian companies are still accruing liability under that portion 
but a deferment on a six month by six month basis is not good 
enough. The act has to be changed to eliminate that position 
altogether. One of the very effective ways of doing that is by this 
House passing this legislation. It will demonstrate that any 
American action in U.S. courts, first, will not be recognized by the 
our authorities, and, second, give the right to Canadian companies 
to counter sue. We can go into more details on that and I know the 
minister of trade will deal with that extensively.
<P>
	That is the reality we will now put in our arsenal, the right to 
counteract. It will provide as well a further signal to the 
international community that other nations will do the same. Our 
friends in Mexico have already proposed similar legislation. 
Certainly Europe is considering similar legislation. Once there is in 
effect an international alliance in which the legal instruments are at 
hand to enable companies to provide that defensive responsive 
posture, I believe that once the U.S. election is concluded and 
things settle down and they begin to review these matters, then the 
United States administration and I trust that Congress will take 
another hard, second look at Helms-Burton and realize just what a 
serious mistake they have made.
<P>
	We welcome the points of view of our various members but this 
legislation is a very important and very significant statement on 
behalf of Canadians and also a very significant statement on behalf 
of other countries around the world. The direction to become 
unilateral arbiters of what is right and wrong is not given by divine 
right to one state alone. We must begin to work in the area of 
co-operation, consensus building and rule making in the 
international community. That is how countries like us survive and 
that is how the international community will survive.
<P>
<B>(1015 )</B>
<P>
	Before I turn this over to my colleague, I want to make one other 
important observation. We do not simply by our opposition to the 
Helms-Burton bill in any way ignore the responsibilities of 
Canadians to begin to conduct our relationships with Cuba in a way 
that will promote and encourage a more open system. I can say to 
the House we are actively engaged in developing  discussions, dia-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4487"> 4487 </A></B>
<P>
logues and initiatives that down the road we believe will help to 
work in that country, to have a more open market system 
economically and a system of government that will provide more 
transparency and accountability.
<P>
	We in no way withdraw from our responsibilities as a member of 
the international community to help promote human rights, 
democratic development and more accountability particularly in 
our own hemisphere. We happen to believe that our approach of 
engaging in that kind of active involvement with the Cuban people 
and the Cuban government is a much more effective and useful way 
to proceed.
<P>
	It is not simply a matter of Helms-Burton by itself. It is also the 
right to maintain, develop and promote a more active engagement, 
to build bridges with the Cuban government and the Cuban people. 
In that way we can help make transitions in our own hemisphere 
and promote the fact that we are able and willing to work with our 
fellow countries in this hemisphere in the promotion of a better 
system of government, better economic development and a system 
in the hemisphere that will recognize the rule of law.
<P>
	I strongly recommend these amendments to the House. I am very 
pleased to turn the debate over to my colleague, the minister of 
trade, for his comments. I hope we can quickly conclude this 
debate and send the kind of statement and message which I think 
Canadians would like us to do.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there are certain pieces of legislation that one 
would prefer not to be putting forward and this bill falls into that 
category. However, Canada has been compelled to strengthen the 
provisions of the Foreign Extraterritorial Measures Act because of 
the actions taken by the United States in passing the Helms-Burton 
law.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	No one is looking for confrontation, no one wants to take the risk 
of aggravating the dispute.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	But certain fundamental principles must be respected. The 
freedom to maintain our own foreign policy and trading 
relationships is one of them, as my colleague the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs has so correctly pointed out. Canadians have the 
right to expect that their government will act to respond to threats 
to our sovereignty and this government is fully prepared to accept 
that responsibility.
<P>
	Helms-Burton is wrong on many levels. I will deal with a few of 
these today. At the most fundamental level it is objectionable 
because it attempts to enforce uniformity of approach and to deny 
the freedom to other nations to make up their own minds and 
implement their own  policies. It says: ``Our foreign policy must be 
your foreign policy; our trade relations, your trade relations; our 
friends, your friends; our foes, your foes; and if you do not agree, 
our laws become your laws'' .That is wrong.
<P>
	Many years ago President Kennedy said of the relationship 
between our two countries: ``The geography has made us 
neighbours, the history has made us friends''. That is true. We 
welcome that relationship. We welcome that friendship. History 
has indeed made us friends, but it has not made us the 51st state. 
We are not subject to American laws and we are not obligated to 
follow their rules. Our foreign policy and our trade policy are made 
in Ottawa, not in Washington. That is something this nation has 
always declared and is something this government will always 
defend.
<P>
	Both Canada and the United States are trading nations, not only 
with each other but with the world. The Americans have always 
played a key role in promoting and supporting freer trade around 
the world. That commitment stretches as far back as President 
Woodrow Wilson and was reaffirmed as recently as 1994 by 
President Clinton at the Summit of the Americas in Miami. There, 
led by the host the United States, we launched the free trade 
agreement of the Americas which seeks to build bridges to the 
newly emerging economies of Central and South America and the 
Caribbean.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	Americans know that trade is bringing the world together as 
never before. With the free exchange of goods and investment 
comes a greater openness to new ideas and new approaches. Again 
and again history has shown us that closer trade links lead to closer 
relations between nations. So freer trade and a clear system of rules 
to enforce it are important objectives and ones that this government 
is fully in support of. However, recently we have seen disturbing 
indications that the American commitment to freer trade may be 
flagging. First there was the isolationist rhetoric which 
reverberated throughout the American presidential primaries and 
now there is Helms-Burton.
<P>
	Those of us who are committed to tearing down barriers and 
opening up opportunities cannot be selective in our approach. We 
cannot defend this principle and then defy it in practice. As the 
leader of the movement to freer trade, the United States cannot say: 
``The world should follow this path except when we tell them not 
to''. It cannot oppose a system that it says is closed and 
anachronistic by passing laws which imitate that system. It cannot 
oppose isolationism by isolating selective adversaries.
<P>
	Canada and the United States no doubt share a common 
objective in Cuba and that is in democracy, economic reform and 
respect for human rights. The difference is in the best way to 
achieve the result. The Americans believe in isolating Cuba; we 
prefer to engage Cuba. History will have to judge which approach 
is  better. I would only note that the American policy has been in 
place now for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4488"> 4488 </A></B>
<P>
30 years. Presidents Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, 
Reagan and Bush have all come and gone but Fidel Castro remains 
in power.
<P>
	Why this particular approach to Cuba? The United States has 
profound differences with China and some other countries as well, 
but that does not stop them from doing billions of dollars worth of 
trade with China. No one would suggest that because the United 
States carries on trade with China they disapprove any less of 
certain Chinese policies. So why this double standard with respect 
to Cuba? The confusion does not end there.
<P>
	On June 21 the state department's co-ordinator for Cuban affairs 
said that Helms-Burton is designed to discourage foreign 
investment in Cuba. That is what he said. It was a candid, 
straightforward statement of fact. Yet just last month the 
president's special envoy to Cuba told an Ottawa press conference 
that the United States was in no way telling Canadians to stop their 
trade or investment with Cuba. There was no gun to our head. 
Rather, he went on to say that Canadians should invest in a strategic 
way that would help to advance democracy in Cuba.
<P>
	It would seem that trade and investment with Cuba are okay as 
long as they meet U.S. approval. This is what happens when policy 
is made on the run in response to election year pressures. It is no 
way to conduct sound long term policy. It is a throwback to the old 
days when governments believed that trade should be controlled 
according to circumstances and not according to agreed upon rules. 
It is a look back, not a step forward.
<P>
	There is another aspect of this legislation which is troubling in 
that it affects both friend and foe alike. Helms-Burton has taken a 
U.S.-Cuba problem and made it a much broader international trade 
and investment issue. Two sections of the act are particularly 
offensive. Title III allows U.S. citizens with claims on expropriated 
property in Cuba to sue foreign nationals, such as Canadians, in the 
United States courts. If the company has no assets in the United 
States that it can seize upon, an American could try to come to the 
Canadian judicial system and ask the courts to enforce the ruling 
and seize assets here. Two months ago President Clinton suspended 
this right to sue for six months. He can change his mind though at 
any time. As long as Helms-Burton is on the books, the threat of 
lawsuits exist.
<P>
<B>(1025 )</B>
<P>
	Title IV of the act allows the U.S. government to deny entry to 
executives of companies which the U.S. state department deems to 
be trafficking in property subject to a U.S. claim. This ban extends 
also to the families, the children of these executives.
<P>
	The special envoy said that there was no gun to our head. 
However, it seems to me that there are two guns: one is title III and 
the other is title IV. Both are fully  loaded but one of them, title III, 
has the safety catch on until it is decided by the Government of the 
United States to release it.
<P>
	Helms-Burton is also regressive in other ways. At a time when 
our hemisphere is coming together as never before, Helms-Burton 
seeks not to integrate but to isolate. With initiatives such as the 
Miami summit and the free trade area of the Americas, we have the 
chance to tie the disparate elements of this hemisphere into a new 
relationship, one built on openness and the free exchange of ideas, 
individuals and products. Helms-Burton runs counter to this 
impulse and would erect barriers, not bridges, create resentments, 
not relationships and introduce tensions, not trusts.
<P>
	Finally, Helms-Burton is unacceptable because it flouts long 
established international legal practices for settling disputes 
between nations regarding claims by foreign investors who have 
had their property expropriated. These established practices have 
served the world well in the past. By choosing to ignore them now, 
Helms-Burton sets a dangerous precedent.
<P>
	If the U.S. behaves in this way today, what is to stop other 
countries from adopting similar measures tomorrow? If such an 
international free for all ensues, we will undo much of what has 
already been achieved in bringing trade under international rules.
<P>
	For all of these reasons, Canada has objected to Helms-Burton. 
We have raised this matter to the highest levels of the American 
administration. I have met with my Mexican and American 
counterparts for consultations under chapter 20 of NAFTA.
<P>
	Canada has also raised this matter with other trading partners 
both within the World Trade Organization and the Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development. In fact in the current 
negotiations going on at the OECD on the multilateral agreement 
on investment, we are seeking protection against just this type of 
measure. We are certainly not going to be letting up on our efforts 
there.
<P>
	Led by Canada's opposition to Helms-Burton, both the European 
Union and Mexico are drafting legislation which is similar to these 
FEMA amendments. Other nations are considering doing the same.
<P>
	Nor is the criticism and concern just coming from outside the 
United States. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the U.S. 
National Association of Manufacturers have urged the President 
not to implement title III of Helms-Burton. The United States, they 
said, benefits as much as anyone-which is true-from strong, 
stable and reliable rules regarding trade. In other words, even the 
business associations which represent many of the companies that 
might be able to sue under title III are opposed to its applications. 
They know the dangers. They know what is at stake.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4489"> 4489 </A></B>
<P>
	All of this pressure both from within the United States and 
abroad helps, but there is still more we can do on our own which 
is to make the changes that are necessary to the Foreign 
Extraterritorial Measures Act.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We believe the amendments before this House are an appropriate 
response.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The amendments that we are proposing will strengthen FEMA in 
two ways. It will permit the attorney general to block any attempt 
by a foreign claimant to enforce a judgment under a law such as 
Helms-Burton, and it will give Canadians recourse to Canadian 
courts if awards are made against them in American courts. In 
other words, Canadians can apply in our courts to recover or claw 
back from the American claimant an amount equivalent to that 
awarded against them by the American court.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	Let us take the example of a U.S. national that wins a suit under 
Helms-Burton against a Canadian in an American court. The 
Canadian has no assets in the United States. The U.S. national 
would have to ask a Canadian court to enforce the judgment. The 
Attorney General of Canada would now be able to issue an order 
blocking this process under the amendments we propose. If the 
American court ordered the Canadian to pay damages, he or she 
could sue the American in the Canadian courts to recoup the full 
amount of the award. This amount plus costs in both countries 
would be applied against the American assets in Canada.
<P>
	One of the problems we have encountered in the past is the 
refusal by Canadian companies to comply with FEMA because the 
penalties from the foreign country are higher than those extracted 
by our own law. In order to increase the chances of compliance we 
are increasing financial penalties under the act from a maximum of 
$10,000 to $1.5 million.
<P>
	The amendments would also allow the attorney general to place 
foreign laws that he considers objectionable on the list under 
FEMA. This listing would give the government greater flexibility 
and would provide for a quicker response time in defending 
Canadian interests.
<P>
	All of the amendments we are proposing are moderate and 
defensive in nature. It is our hope that they will never need to be 
employed. They are a reactive antidote if we need them, but it is 
vital that they be available to Canadian companies in order to do 
the best we can to help them protect themselves should this ever be 
required.
<P>
	I call again upon the United States to remember the principles 
for which they have fought and through which such progress has 
<P>
been achieved. I ask them to remember the benefits that freer trade 
has brought them and others  in the past, and the still greater 
promise of freer trade in future.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We have come too far and made too much progress to stop now.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We have broken down too many barriers to begin constructing 
new ones. We must not sacrifice those principles to expedience. Let 
us work together to expand the circle of opportunity by expanding 
the benefits of freer trade. Let us work together to engage, not 
isolate, Cuba and all the other Cubas around the globe so that the 
freedoms, the hopes and the opportunities of freer trade will be 
brought to all people in all parts of the world.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today in this House to participate in the debate at 
second reading of Bill C-54, an act to amend the Foreign 
Extraterritorial Measures Act, which has been a while in coming.
<P>
	By finally introducing Bill C-54 after months of stalling, the 
Liberal government is again putting up a smoke screen by trying to 
prove to Quebecers and Canadians that Canada will defend their 
freedom to invest and trade anywhere in the world.
<P>
	I say ``trying to prove'', because what is both laughable and sad 
in this extraterritorial measures saga is that the carelessness and 
wait-and-see attitude the Liberal government stubbornly clung to 
in the several months preceding the introduction of this bill could 
have been more costly for our business people. This situation is 
very troubling, because the Liberal government let way too much 
water flow under the bridge before responding to a law with 
extraterritorial implications passed by a foreign country but 
directly affecting our business people.
<P>
	And this foreign country is not an obscure, little known nation 
led by a dictator or located far away from Canada, but our main 
trading partner and international ally, the United States of America.
<P>
	The U.S. government, which bills itself as the champion of free 
enterprise, will always amaze the international community by 
enacting laws such as the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity 
Act, better known as the Helms-Burton law. What is surprising 
though is that this is not the first time that the U.S. has passed this 
kind of legislation and that we have to react to it.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	In 1985, to impose an embargo against the small central 
American country of Nicaragua, the American government passed 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4490"> 4490 </A></B>
<P>
legislation with extraterritorial implications that could have 
adversely affected the interests of Quebecers and Canadians.
<P>
	The Republican administration claimed that the American 
legislation would apply to any foreign company whose operations 
might have repercussions in the U.S. or on American companies.
<P>
	In response to the American embargo against Nicaragua, in 
which the U.S. wanted to involve the international community, 
Canada passed Bill C-14, an act respecting foreign extraterritorial 
measures.
<P>
	Note that the provisions of this act were never used, which may 
well be the case again with Bill C-54 to amend the Foreign 
Extraterritorial Measures Act in response to two new pieces of 
American legislation.
<P>
	Under conservative pressure from the Republican majority in 
Congress, the Democrat administration just approved two pieces of 
legislation allowing Americans to sue companies in Quebec, 
Canada or anywhere in the world. The first one is commonly 
known as the Helms-Burton law and is designed to extend the 
embargo against Cuba, while the second one is the Iranian and 
Libyan economic sanctions law of 1996.
<P>
	As the Minister of Foreign Affairs indicated earlier, the U.S. is 
certainly quite free to impose sanctions on any country if it deems 
it appropriate to do so, but we will not permit a country, any 
country, to pass extraterritorial legislation affecting companies 
operating out of another sovereign state.
<P>
	In the present case, we must recall the context in which this 
American legislation was passed. The Helms-Burton law is the 
political expression of the American response to the Cuban air 
force shooting down two small American civilian aircraft for 
presumably violating Cuban airspace.
<P>
	As for the legislation imposing sanctions on Iran and Libya, two 
countries suspected of supporting international terrorism, it was 
passed after a TWA airliner mysteriously crashed just after taking 
off from New York, this summer.
<P>
	However, regardless of how justified the American 
administration might be in adopting sanctions against these 
countries, we cannot accept that the United States, or any other 
country, can unilaterally pass laws affecting Canadian businesses 
and nationals outside their boundaries.
<P>
	The Helms-Burton law and the legislation seeking to extend 
sanctions against Iran and Libya not only violate every 
international agreement on trade liberalization-including the Free 
Trade Agreement, NAFTA and the Uruguay Round agreements 
establishing the World Trade Organization-they also do not 
promote the type of harmonious, productive and positive relations 
that close allies such as Canada and the United States should 
maintain.
<P>
	As the Minister of Foreign Affairs said earlier, we cannot accept 
that the Americans can go ahead and use international trade 
agreements when it is convenient to do so, while adopting 
unilateral measures such as these when it suits them.
<P>
	It is as much a matter of principle as it is an economic issue, 
given that Canada's economic relations with Cuba are relatively 
limited. In 1995, imports from Cuba totalled $320 million, while 
Canadian exports to that country reached $250 million.
<P>
	Obviously, such an arrogant and authoritarian attitude on the part 
of friendly countries is not conducive to a relation based on trust 
and dialogue. This is why we feel that these two new American 
laws are totally unacceptable.
<P>
	The U.S. government seems prepared to risk offending friendly 
countries for the sole purpose of destabilizing the Cuban, Iranian 
and Libyan regimes. We are always surprised to see how relentless 
our American neighbours can be when they target certain members 
of the international community, on the grounds of noble and 
generous principles that they conveniently forget in other 
situations.
<P>
	For instance, the United States is much more permissive with 
China and Vietnam where democracy and human rights are 
concerned than with Cuba. But China and Vietnam are, need I 
remind you, growing markets, which make principles that more 
flexible.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	On this issue, I must say that the Canadian government is 
marching to the beat of the same drummer as the American 
administration. However, lamentable cases like that of Trân Trieu 
Quân, a Canadian citizen sentenced to hard labour in Vietnam, 
must continue to make us aware that an increase in trade does not 
necessarily entail more respect for human rights.
<P>
	Anyway, upon closer examination, you realize that there are two 
sections at the heart of the Helms-Burton law. First of all, section 3 
permits American nationals to prosecute in the American courts 
any foreign corporation which has benefitted from real estate or 
facilities that used to belong to these American citizens and that 
were confiscated by the Cuban government following the 1959 
revolution.
<P>
	It is as if, when they left the country, those corporations retained 
a right to their properties and facilities in perpetuity ensuring that 
no one else could ever benefit from them.
<P>
	And then there is section 4, which denies entry into the United 
States of managers or majority shareholders of foreign 
corporations along with their spouses and under age children 
allegedly trafficking-as the law defines it-in U.S. property 
confiscated by the Cuban government.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4491"> 4491 </A></B>
<P>
	The problem with Bill C-54, which the House is debating today, 
is that, on July 15 of this year, the American president exercised 
his discretionary power to suspend title III concerning legal 
proceedings. He can renew this suspension every six months if 
he deems it to be in the national interest of the United States.
<P>
	Therefore, Bill C-54 is nothing more than a symbolic measure 
for the time being since its sole purpose is to neutralise the effects 
of title III. This way, the Canadian government can have the 
impression that it bared its teeth, that it stood up courageously for 
businessmen from Quebec and Canada, but this unexpected show 
of courage came only after the government had made sure the 
Americans did not intend to enforce this provision.
<P>
	However, it is revealing as well as disturbing to see that title III 
of the Helms-Burton law banning people from travelling to the 
United States is in force and that the Canadian government has not 
included any protective or retaliatory measures in the bill before us 
today.
<P>
	The federal government is giving the impression that it is 
reacting strongly and diligently when it knows its actions are of no 
consequence, but it continues to show the same lack of courage 
when effective and significant measures need to be taken.
<P>
	It is therefore very surprising to see that the Liberal government 
waited for the American president to exercise his discretionary 
power to suspend title III for a period of six months before going 
ahead with Bill C-54.
<P>
	When it announced last June 17 that it was going to table a bill to 
amend the existing Foreign Extraterritorial Measures Act, the 
government already knew that the president was going to suspend 
this title.
<P>
	I was happy to hear the Minister of Foreign Affairs saying earlier 
that suspending the application of Title III was not enough for 
Canada, that what Canada was calling for was no less than the 
amendment and even the outright withdrawal of this legislation and 
of Title III, which more particularly concerns us.
<P>
	But something has been overlooked. Title IV of the 
Helms-Burton legislation has prevented a number of Canadian 
nationals from entering the United States since August 1. To date, 
at least seven people, essentially members of the management of 
Sherritt International Corporation, have been affected by the 
application of this title. And what is the federal government doing 
about it? Nothing, absolutely nothing. It waits for the other shoe to 
drop and ceases all action, probably for fear of ruffling the feathers 
of our American neighbours.
<P>
	This Toronto based Canadian company holds shares in Cuba in 
the nickel mines, in petroleum development, and in the agricultural 
and tourist sectors. Its completely respectable commercial 
activities have made the directors of this company persona non 
grata on American soil. Yet, these people have never committed 
any crime, either in Canada or in the United States. They have no 
criminal  record. They are simply guilty of having invested and 
conducted business in Cuba.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	For example, how would the U.S. government react if the 
Canadian government decided to apply this type of legislation to 
American nationals?
<P>
	Even if it is not always in agreement with the United States' 
political and trade choices and priorities, the Canadian government 
has never gone so far as to consider American nationals as 
criminals on its territory solely on the grounds of nationality. Bill 
C-54 is, therefore, incomplete because it counteracts only one 
portion of the Helms-Burton law, which is currently inoperative. 
The step that now becomes necessary, if the Canadian government 
really intends to protect the interests of Quebecers and Canadians, 
is to call for the striking of a special group to settle the dispute 
under NAFTA.
<P>
	Even though in recent months a number of federal departments 
have made strong representations to protest the consequences of 
the Helms-Burton law, even though the American president has 
suspended for six months the right of American nationals to 
institute legal proceedings under Helms-Burton, and even though 
the Liberal government is proudly presenting Bill C-54 today, the 
Helms-Burton law is still in existence, nevertheless, and is causing 
serious harm to citizens of Quebec and of Canada, and is liable to 
cause still more in the coming months.
<P>
	What is the government waiting for, under these circumstances, 
before bringing this dispute before NAFTA?
<P>
	Even if Canada has risen to object to the Helms-Burton law in 
such international fora as the World Trade Organization, the 
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and the 
Organization of American States, it still must take concrete legal 
action.
<P>
	Canada has some formidable allies in its fight against the 
Helms-Burton law. Mexico, for example, also a signatory to 
NAFTA, is equally affected by application of this act. Already the 
Mexican telecommunications group Domos has seen five of its 
directors refused entry into U.S. territory because of its 
investments in Cuba, which are in excess of $700 million.
<P>
	We urge the government to submit the Helms-Burton act to 
competent authorities under NAFTA, in association with Mexico 
which is also affected by this legislation.
<P>
	Frankly, I must admit I have doubts about the determination of 
the government to protect efficiently the interests of Quebecers and 
Canadians. We may actually have before us a bill aimed at 
protecting their interests but we have reasons to believe that it will 
probably never be used.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4492"> 4492 </A></B>
<P>
	Indeed the Minister of International Trade himself has candidly 
admitted in the House, on June 18, that the legislative measures 
proposed by the government would only be used as a last resort 
and that he hoped he would never have to use it.
<P>
	By seeking to avoid a confrontation with the United States at all 
costs the Liberal government will hurt Canadian citizens.
<P>
	However, we do support a clause of Bill C-54 which requires 
Canadian businesses to abide by Canadian laws. In a news release 
dated September 16, the Department of Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade announced, and I quote: ``The Government is 
also amending FEMA to update penalties so that Canadians will be 
less likely to abide by objectionable foreign laws and more likely to 
follow Canadian law''.
<P>
	We have already mentioned in this House the case of a company 
operating on Canadian territory which scrupulously applies the 
American embargo against Cuba. I am referring to American 
Express, whose case has already been mentioned to the Minister of 
International Trade. The Canadian branch of American Express has 
violated Canadian law for many years, since it still follows the 
guidelines of its head office which prohibit doing business with 
Cuba.
<P>
	We have a letter sent by American Express to a resident of 
Quebec. In that letter, the addressee is informed that the American 
head office and all subsidiaries throughout the world abide by U.S. 
government regulations. I will read you part of this letter:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
``We regret that you are unable to use travellers cheques in Cuba. 
This is due to U.S. government regulations prohibiting the 
exportation of goods and services in Cuba. These regulations apply 
to all companies incorporated within the United States and their 
foreign branches and subsidiaries''
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Minister of International Trade said previously in this House 
that he would look into the case of American Express, and the 
official opposition is still waiting for him to do so. It is shocking to 
see that subsidiaries of American companies established in Canada 
abide by laws and directives emanating from a foreign government.
<P>
	Under the amendments proposed in Bill C-54, a company 
located in Canada that observes the law of a foreign jurisdiction 
instead of Canadian legislation may be liable to financial penalties 
in excess of those prevailing today. Penalties that before were 
about $10,000 could now be as high as $1.5 million. In similar 
cases, the United States imposes fines of up to one million dollars 
in U.S. currency.
<P>
	Passing legislation alone is not enough. It must also be enforced. 
If companies located in Canada do not abide by Canadian law, then 
we must make sure that law is enforced.
<P>
	In concluding, the Bloc Quebecois agrees with the position taken 
by most of our foreign partners who are opposed to the 
Helms-Burton law and the law imposing sanctions against Iran and 
Libya. We believe that the Canadian government should stop 
claiming it maintains its independence vis-à-vis our main ally if it 
is not prepared to act accordingly.
<P>
	Since the government proposes to authorize non-recognition of 
foreign judgments against companies or individuals in Quebec and 
Canada, and since it suggests increasing the penalties for observing 
foreign laws instead of Canadian legislation, we do support the bill 
to amend the Foreign Extraterritorial Measures Act.
<P>
	However, we feel that we should go one step further by asking 
for a special dispute settlement panel under NAFTA. The Minister 
for International Trade told us last March that Canada would ask 
for a consultation under Chapter 20 of the North American Free 
Trade Agreement. By pursuing this, the government will ensure the 
invalidation of legislation that contradicts all the efforts deployed 
in recent years to achieve free trade.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to begin my speech on Bill C-54 by stating that the Reform 
Party will support this legislation, although I believe it is only a 
half measure to resolve this dispute.
<P>
	My advice when this matter first arose was to take this to a 
dispute resolution panel under NAFTA and get the Helms-Burton 
act overturned. Had we moved on this quickly we would be well on 
our way to settling this dispute once and for all. A dispute 
settlement mechanism was negotiated in NAFTA. It is in place and 
we should not be afraid to use it.
<P>
	It is clear that Helms-Burton is in contravention of the NAFTA 
agreement with United States. Helms-Burton is also an affront to 
Canada's right to set its own foreign policy and to continue trading 
and investing in Cuba. We cannot allow this American act to go 
unchallenged. Passing Bill C-54 is one more defensive action that 
we can take, but a much more effective one would have been to 
take the Helms-Burton bill to a dispute resolution settlement under 
NAFTA. I repeat that this should be done immediately, not after the 
American election in November.
<P>
	The Minister of Foreign Affairs said that under the 
Helms-Burton bill liabilities continue to accrue. This is a stopgap 
measure, we support it to that extent, but we believe that it should 
be settled once and for all.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4493"> 4493 </A></B>
<P>
	We must take a firm stand. We cannot allow the United States 
to push us around as it has on softwood lumber, as it has on wheat. 
Now it is telling us where to invest and do business. If we keep 
letting the Americans get away with these bullying tactics we will 
only encourage them to keep threatening us.
<P>
	Just two days ago there was another report in the press that the 
acting American trade representative and the agriculture secretary 
had issued a joint statement that they were going to use U.S. trade 
laws to keep our wheat exports from growing. Canada capitulated 
to the Americans in 1994 and agreed to caps on wheat exports, at 
1.5 million tonnes. Things have been quiet this past year because 
U.S. wheat supplies grew and Canadian prices were no longer 
competitive. Clearly that action is contrary to the free trade concept 
that Canada wants to establish throughout the world, a market 
economy.
<P>
	We have been one of the forerunners, and rightly so, in 
negotiating free trade deals and I believe that we have to ensure 
that countries play by the rules. This year we have a bumper crop 
and the Americans are afraid that our wheat will once again 
become attractive. Various American interest groups have seen us 
buckle time and time again. That is a very bad precedent and 
encourages only further strong arm tactics. I believe we have to use 
whatever avenues we can to fight Helms-Burton and other attempts 
to fetter free trade.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	Bill C-54 makes certain amendments to the Foreign 
Extraterritorial Measures Act which allow the Canadian 
government to stymie some of the more aggressive aspects of the 
Helms-Burton act. They are good as far as they go.
<P>
	I would like to get into the specifics of the Helms-Burton act and 
how the proposed amendments to FEMA will help defang that 
legislation. The Helms-Burton act allows U.S. nationals who have 
claims on expropriated property in Cuba to sue Canadian 
companies and people who traffic in that property. Trafficking is 
defined quite broadly in the act to include things like holding an 
interest in confiscated property, engaging in commercial activities 
using confiscated property or participating in profits through 
another person who is trafficking in that confiscated property.
<P>
	Under Helms-Burton a U.S. national who has a certified claim to 
expropriated property can start an action in a U.S. court under title 
III. U.S. officials have said that almost 6,000 claims of 
expropriation have been recognized by Washington as being 
legitimate. Of those, about 800 were above the threshold of 
$50,000 in commercial value in 1959 when Fidel Castro took 
power. Many of these are not subject to claims by U.S. nationals 
any longer.
<P>
	It is true that President Clinton has waived until January certain 
provisions allowing suits against foreign  firms. We cannot take for 
granted that he will do so again. The legislation is there and it is 
there to protect ourselves. Further, we should start an immediate 
action under NAFTA to resolve this issue once and for all. As we 
heard earlier liabilities continue to accrue.
<P>
	Under Helms-Burton, once court proceedings begin and a U.S. 
court is presented with a certified claim it can award up to three 
times the damages claimed by the U.S. national. If the Canadian 
company refuses to pay the damages that are awarded the 
Helms-Burton act allows the U.S. national to ask Canadian courts 
to enforce this judgment.
<P>
	Here is where the amendments to FEMA kick in for the first 
time. The new and improved FEMA will allow the attorney general 
to declare such an order cannot be recognized or enforced in 
Canada. That is a step in the right direction.
<P>
	If the Canadian company has assets in the United States, 
Helms-Burton allows the U.S. court to seize and sell those assets 
and pay the awarded damage to the U.S. national. Here again the 
strength in FEMA will step in. It will allow the Canadian company 
to recover in Canadian courts any amounts that have been awarded 
in the United States.
<P>
	However, a glitch in all of this is that the U.S. national would 
have to have assets in Canada to be counter seized. I do not know of 
many U.S. nationals who can sue under Helms-Burton that would 
have assets in Canada, certainly not a whole lot. Therefore we are 
going to be questioning this and making some recommendations in 
committee on how this may be improved.
<P>
	Helms-Burton is meant to intimidate foreign individuals and 
companies from investing in Cuba and carrying on any business 
activities there. Here again an amendment to FEMA shows the 
Americans that the Canadians have backbone. We are going to raise 
these penalties from $10,000 to $1.5 million on Canadian 
companies that refuse to trade with Cuba for fear of U.S. sanctions.
<P>
	For instance, if a company was planning a business venture prior 
to the passage of Helms-Burton but got cold feet later, it could be 
fined for allowing the American legislation to influence its 
decision. I have read that the RCMP has conducted about two 
dozen investigations of complaints that subsidiary companies in 
Canada were violating earlier provisions of FEMA not to let 
American head offices influence their trade with Cuba. I 
understand that there have been no prosecutions to date.
<P>
	It is easy for a subsidiary to say that it walked away from a sale 
to Cuba for valid commercial reasons that have nothing to do with 
Helms-Burton. That is why I believe that making these 
amendments to FEMA, although good, are only a stop gap 
measure. We must try to get Helms-Burton overturned.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="4494"> 4494 </A></B>
<P>
	The aspects of Helms-Burton that Bill C-54 does not address 
is that provisions for barring entry into the United States of senior 
officials of selected Canadian companies. Clearly these are in 
contravention of NAFTA. Article 1603 of the NAFTA trade 
agreement specifically states that each party shall grant temporary 
entry to business persons who are otherwise qualified for entry 
under applicable measures relating to public health and safety and 
national security. What is happening here is that the senior 
officials of these Canadian companies would not be in 
contravention of NAFTA and we should make that case very 
clearly.
<P>
	Does the United States have the right in the wake of NAFTA to 
stop healthy law-abiding Canadian business people from entering 
that country? I do not think so. Not after we signed NAFTA. It is 
clear that it does not.

	This means empowering that level of government closest to the

smaller federal government of 250 MPs, not expanding it to 301. It 
means less duplication and overlapping and red tape of federal and

commercial signs in Ottawa, which has an impact not only on the 
francophone community in Ottawa but also on national unity.
<P>
	Must we always remind the stubborn people on both sides of the 
linguistic war that Canada is a bilingual country with two official 
languages? Ottawa business people are certainly not required by 
law to put up signs in French. Still, simple courtesy requires them 
to put up signs in both French and English, just as Montreal shop 
owners ought to have signs in both official languages as they are 
allowed to under the law.

sovereignty''.

According to her press release, a video camera will transmit images 
of the Parliament buildings on the World Wide Web 24 hours a day.

	The minister justifies this expenditure by arguing ``that the 
Peace Tower is one of the most widely recognized symbols of 
Canada, just like the beaver and the maple leaf''. Perhaps she 
wanted to announce the imminent appearance on our screens of 
interactive maple leafs and beavers.
<P>
	What the minister is not telling us is the number of loonies 
taxpayers will have to shell out to promote the beaver. This new 
web site is nothing more than another element in the strategy of her

artificially and at great cost a feeling of belonging among

	This government continues to pay lip service to encouraging

Atlantic Canadians to pay $15 on a $100 science textbook.
<P>
	In twisted logic, to further promote literacy, the government will 
be collecting GST on special 50 cent stamps being sold by Canada

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="AUDITORGENERAL">AUDITOR GENERAL</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday the Minister of Finance seemed proud of the 
Liberal majority report on the family trust scandal, a report he said 
he applauded. However, the former auditor general, Mr. Dye, 
maintained that Liberal members failed to understand the 
watchdog role of the auditor general, and the auditor general 
himself stated this week, after the report was published, that his 
position had not changed. Thank goodness, because that is what he 
is there for.
<P>
	I have this question for the Minister of Finance. Although it is 
obvious that Liberal members made a terrible mistake in this report 
by attacking the auditor general, why does the Minister of Finance 
insist on endorsing the report? And I repeat the question that was 
asked yesterday: Who is this government trying to protect?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
the majority report is very favourable. Actually, there are plenty of 
very favourable comments on work done by the auditor general. I 
admit that they disagree with the auditor general on one particular 
point.  However, a standing committee of our House has the right to 
criticize or to disagree with an employee of Parliament, whether, as 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4498"> 4498 </A></B>
<P>
I said yesterday, he happens to be the Prime Minister, the Minister 
of Finance, the Governor of the Bank of Canada or the auditor 
general.
<P>
	The hon. member asks me why we endorse the majority report. It 
is because the report endorses the vast majority of remarks and 
comments made by the auditor general. That is why.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, to say that a committee has the right to express its views 
does not prove anything. After all, in a democracy we have the 
right to be wrong. It is not a sin.
<P>
	We know the government is wrong, but we are asking whether it 
could act responsibly to do something. Because as far as important 
issues go, it is no accident that all editorial writers, at least those in 
the French newspapers, are saying this does not make sense.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	The former auditor general says it does not make sense, and the 
current auditor general says so too. The consensus is growing. And 
of course we agree. ``On a minor point'', the Minister of Finance 
says. Actually, on May 9 this year he said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-we certainly said clearly when we came to office that there were weaknesses in the 
taxation system that needed to be corrected. We have supported the actions of the 
auditor general in this area and will continue to do so.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is what we are asking the government to do. What we are 
asking is this: Once again, whose interests are they protecting by 
not responding to the judgment made by the auditor general? They 
say it is only a minor point, but we think they disagree on the main 
point made in the auditor general's report.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
the auditor general's main point is that the problem today is how to 
treat capital gains when someone, an immigrant, a person, a trust, a 
company, or partnership wants to leave Canada.
<P>
	That was the auditor general's main point, and the majority 
report endorsed it, saying that action must be taken. We agree, and 
we intend to take that action.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the loophole is still there. The auditor general said so and 
they are trying to rap the knuckles of the auditor general because he 
did. They are telling the auditor general: You should have left that 
alone.
<P>
	I have the impression that the Minister of Finance took 
Camouflage 101 with the Minister of National Defence. They are 
sitting side by side, and I am sure they are comparing notes. I want 
to ask him why he endorsed what the committee had to say about 
the auditor general. Who gave the order to cover up this scandal? 
The Prime  Minister or some generous party supporter who might 
want to use this loophole?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
this is ridiculous. The government asked the Standing Committee 
on Finance to consider the auditor general's report and to give us its 
opinion on the main point: How do we treat capital gains when an 
immigrant wants to leave the country?
<P>
	The majority report was very thorough in the way it dealt with 
this point, and the government intends to take action. It is certainly 
not our policy to cover up the situation. We wanted to shed some 
light on the matter, and the majority report did so, and we intend to 
act.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Finance asked the finance committee to 
look into the problem but not to take a partial look. When will the 
Minister of Finance start looking out for all Canadian taxpayers, 
not just Canada's ten wealthiest families.
<P>
	In its report, instead of plugging the tax loophole that allowed $2 
billion to be transferred out of Canada tax free, the Liberal majority 
on the finance committee throws the door wide open for wealthy 
Canadian families. It concluded that this scandal was legal, thus 
upholding a decision made by Revenue Canada that may cost 
Canadian taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. Does he recognize 
that his acceptance of this report, yesterday and again today, flies in 
the face of the recommendations of the auditor general and allows 
huge assets to be transferred out of the country by wealthy 
Canadian families that end up not paying taxes in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there is no doubt that capital gains considerations may be a concern 
for wealthier families. But they can also be of concern to families 
with lower incomes.
<P>
	I mentioned yesterday the case of the widow of an immigrant, 
who decides to go back home. If she happens to be a shareholder in 
a small private company, she too will be affected because, in every 
case, the question is: How do we deal with capital gains when an 
individual, any individual, leaves the country? It could be a retiree 
who moves to Florida, as many do. That is the question, a very 
serious question that must be considered thoroughly.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	The hon. member raised the issue of loopholes. I have a list three 
pages long of loopholes that we have closed since taking office. 
The point of the matter is: how to ensure that the tax system is fair. 
That is our objective. I wish the opposition would at least 
contribute to the debate.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4499"> 4499 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister referred to tax planning and forward 
averaging. We have nothing against that. We have a problem 
however with such vehicles and provisions of the Income Tax Act, 
which the minister refuses to change, being used to transfer 
millions of dollars to the U.S. or elsewhere tax-free. Something 
is wrong. Everyone has to pay taxes to Revenue Canada, but when 
it comes time to deal with the rich friends of the Liberal Party, 
nothing is done. Something is wrong.
<P>
	My question to the minister is as follows: Is this report not being 
concurred in to protect the interests of those in high political 
circles, with the approval of the Minister of Finance?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (LaSalle-Émard):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the three years 
we have been in office we have closed more loopholes, more 
openings in the tax system than any previous government. As a 
result of our actions the tax act is more fair. Wealthy Canadians are 
paying far more taxes. I have three pages of measures which we 
have taken to deal with this.
<P>
	This issue is not one that only applies to rich Canadians. It 
applies to Canadians of very ordinary circumstances who for one 
reason or another decide to leave the country, whether it is to retire 
in another country or return to the country of their birth. These 
people ought to be treated fairly. They ought to be treated in a way 
that does not deprive the state of taxation.
<P>
	At the same time we have tax treaties with some 60 countries. 
We are operating in a way that the OECD has established. Our 
system is tighter than the vast majority of other countries. I am sure 
members opposite do not want us to act in a way that would be 
unfair to ordinary Canadians. That is why we asked the finance 
committee to look at the issue and they did. That is why we have 
said we are going to act quickly on their recommendations.

	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, double standards and conflicts of interest abound in 
the Somalia inquiry. The defence minister is interfering with the 
inquiry at every turn. He has allowed General Boyle to receive 
preferential treatment by giving the government's own dream team 
of lawyers' access to confidential military police reports and, 
possibly the biggest conflict of interest of all, the designing of the 
Somalia inquiry mandate.
<P>
	Will the defence minister confirm that General Boyle played a 
part in the drafting of the mandate and the terms of reference of the 
Somalia inquiry?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the terms of 
reference for that inquiry originated in my office in consultation 
with departmental officials.
<P>
	They were amended by me at a late stage to ensure certain things 
were put in which I thought were germane to the efficacy of the 
inquiry. The terms of reference for the inquiry are mine and I take 
responsibility for them. I think they have been widely 
acknowledged as being comprehensive, all encompassing and they 
will get to the bottom of the matter.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the minister again for not 
answering my question. I wanted to know if General Boyle was 
involved in the drafting of the mandate and terms of reference.
<P>
	Not only is the government hiding behind the inquiry, it is 
interfering with it at the same time. The Prime Minister attacked 
the inquiry in the most flagrant fashion. His next barrage went to 
the noble members serving in the Canadian Armed Forces who 
choose to leave. These men practice leadership and responsibility 
with accountability. The Prime Minister attacked them. Does the 
Prime Minister think it shows moral fibre to attack retired generals 
who were honourably serving this country?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if anyone has 
been interfering with this process it is the hon. member and his 
colleagues. As I said yesterday to his colleague from Beaver River, 
they have reflected on evidence, impugned motives of individuals, 
and made all kinds of wild accusations in the House.
<P>
<B>(1130 )</B>
<P>
	This demonstrates the reason why we had to have the inquiry in 
the first place, to take it out of the partisan atmosphere of the House 
of Commons, to put it in a judicial setting, an impartial setting so 
that everyone could be heard fairly and all the evidence could be 
examined clearly and thoroughly.
<P>
	The hon. member is the best advertisement for the reasons why 
we set up the inquiry: to take the partisan aspect out of it. All the 
hon. member and his colleagues have done in the last number of 
months is to turn this into a partisan issue. I do not believe that the 
people of Canadian appreciate that very much.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the people of Canada will judge the government on 
this issue.
<P>
	The minister would have us believe that the cuts to national 
defence have caused the low morale in the forces. It was not budget 
cuts that shredded documents. It was not budget cuts to that lied to 
the military police. It  was not budget cuts that broke the Access to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4500"> 4500 </A></B>
<P>
Information Act. It was General Boyle and this minister and this 
government approves of it.
<P>
	Why will he not admit that it is the Liberal government's lack of 
integrity and lack of ethics, not the lack of money, that is hurting 
our Canadian Armed Forces?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it seems quite 
obvious that as the days go by, the hon. member is becoming more 
and more hysterical about this problem. We prefer to deal with 
things in a calm and rational way and let the inquiry do its work.
<P>
	He talks about the people of Canada judging us. Mr. Speaker, if 
you look at the opinion polls, the people of Canada have judged his 
party already and they have found it totally wanting on just about 
every issue that affects Canadians and it will be the same thing on 
this problem.

<P>
	Yesterday, the Canadian Judicial Council voted unanimously in 
favour of removing from the bench Mr. Justice Bienvenue, a judge 
of the Superior Court of Quebec. Last July 5, the justice minister 
indicated clearly that he was awaiting the council's

Bienvenue.

the recommendation of the Canadian Judicial Council that Mr. 
Justice Bienvenue be removed from the bench?

<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the board of inquiry recommended that Mr. Justice 
Bienvenue be removed from the bench, and now the Canadian 
Judicial Council has endorsed this recommendation. What is the

	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General

<P>
	The terms of reference which I tabled in March 1995 were a 
reflection of the government's thinking in trying to get to the 
bottom of this. A number of people, a number of officials, worked 
on these terms of reference in conjunction with the deputy minister

reference belong to the government. They reflect the government's

	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is for the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	The Minister of National Defence has been asked very clearly 
whether General Boyle was involved in drafting the terms of 
reference for the inquiry. The minister has  not indicated the names 
of any officials who were involved. By inference General Boyle 
was involved in drafting the terms of reference.
<P>
	Would the minister confirm that, if not, confirm very clearly that 
he was not involved?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have great 
respect for the hon. member for Lethbridge. He should know after 
all his years in government something about parliamentary 
democracy in this country.
<P>
	There is ministerial responsibility. We do not attack, we do not 
berate public servants on the floor of the House of Commons, no 
matter who they are.
<P>
	Questions are asked of the government. The government is 
accountable for all of the actions within the respective 
departments.
<P>
	I have answered the question two or three times. I, and I alone, 
take responsibility for the terms of reference on behalf of the 
government. I consulted cabinet colleagues and it was a 
collaborative effort in that particular-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hart:</B> Then he'll have to go.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Cover up, cover up.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hart:</B> Resign.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Collenette:</B> -it was a collaborative effort on that particular 
score. In a parliamentary government the ministers and the 
ministers alone take responsibility. Those terms of reference are 
comprehensive, they are thorough and they will get the answers 
Canadians want.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
say very clearly to the Minister of National Defence that by not 
answering the question there is a cover-up.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, we must not impute motive in our 
questions. I would ask the hon. member to withdraw the word 
``cover-up''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, I withdraw it in that 
context.
<P>
	My question is very straightforward to the minister. Will the 
minister table the names of those officials who were involved in 
drafting and recommending the terms of reference for the inquiry 
so that it is clear to the Canadian public who is involved and so that 
we clarify the matter that there was no conflict of interest and that 
there was no inferred, assumed or perceived cover-up in any way? 
Would the minister table those names next Monday in the 
Parliament of Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and

responsible government in the parliamentary context. I would 
invite him over the weekend to go back and look at some textbooks

for the actions within their own department. I and I alone am

	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The latest in a long list of scandals involving the armed forces 
was made public yesterday on TV. Several senior officers at the 
Valcartier base have developed a system involving embezzlement 
and kickbacks. Worse yet, it is alleged that this practice, which has 
been going on for at least 15 years, is common place in several 
other military bases across the country.
<P>
	Given the fact that this kind of systematic fraud is part of the 
already long list of scandals we know about, what is the Prime 
Minister waiting for to clean up the armed forces command, 
starting with the defence minister and his protégé, the chief of 
staff?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, these 
allegations of fraudulent practices at CFB Base Valcartier have 
been known for some time and have been the subject of some 
investigations. A number of people have been charged and other 
charges are pending.
<P>
	Again, we have to let the investigative and judicial processes 
take effect. Obviously we are concerned when anything of this 
nature occurs, especially since the allegations are that these 
practices have been going on at least for ten years.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this latest 
scandal, which is costing taxpayers a fortune, is in fact part of the 
ongoing waste of public funds in the department nine months after 
the appointment of General Boyle. For instance, over $31 million 
are literally squandered every year as the result of an inefficient 
pay system.
<P>
	Can the Prime minister not see that this is the direct consequence 
of his insistence on keeping General Boyle? The armed forces are 
floundering while the general is wasting time fixing up his blunders 
with his lawyers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr.  Speaker, as I have said in 
answer to earlier questions, this is a department that needed much 
<P>
reform in its administrative practices. Apparently now we have had 
allegations of fraudulent practices which obviously cannot be 
accepted and cannot be tolerated. They have been investigated. 
There are charges that are about to be laid and some that have 
already been laid. Actions have already been taken against at least 
one individual.
<P>
	The key thing is that once the information comes to light, no 
matter how disquietening, one must act and act with alacrity. That 
is what the department is doing in this particular case.

our position will be on the continuing commitment of Canadian

<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and

	The Canadian government's position has always been that we 
want stability in that region. That is why we committed 1,000

some continuation of the force will be required once IFOR's

something about the mentality of the members of the Reform

<P>
	The mentality of the Reform Party is not to stop with the

These people want to attack public servants who are doing their

Canadians every single day.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this minister talks 
about ministerial responsibility. He also talks about accountability. 
He also talks about perception. Right now it is perceived by all 
Canadians that we now have a conflict of interest in the very terms 
of reference of the Somalia inquiry.
<P>
	Why will this minister not answer, yes or no, was General Boyle 
involved in setting the frame of reference for the Somalia inquiry?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and

a perception of the Reform Party as one that does not understand 
parliamentary traditions. It does not understand that public servants 
work for the government and do not have the right to defend

	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of the Environment.
<P>
	Last week, we learned that there are still large amounts of 
PCB-contaminated sediments on the site of the <I>Irving Whale</I> 
wreck. Before the operation to lift this barge, concentrations of 400 
to 900 parts per million had been found in contaminated samples.
<P>
	Given the substantial and troubling presence of PCBs, what does 
the minister intend to do in the very short term to correct this 
situation, which directly threatens all the fishery resources in that 
part of the Gulf of St. Lawrence?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, let me first thank my hon. friend for  the question. It is an 
issue that we are taking very seriously. As the member knows, 
there was overwhelming support from both the people of P.E.I. as 
well as Isle de la Madeleine in terms of ridding the ocean of this 
environmental hazard. There was overwhelming support for lifting 
the barge, as we did earlier this summer.
<P>
	Following the lifting of the barge a number of boats stayed for a 
number of days doing remediation in terms of the footprint area at 
the bottom of the ocean.
<P>
<B>(1150 )</B>
<P>
	We did take a total 20 samplings after the barge was raised, 35 
before, and in a number of small instances there were a number of 
samples of PCBs that were certainly of concern. Sampling 
continues to take place so that we can ascertain the extent of these 
samples with the possibility that there may be further remediation.
<P>
	Both my department as well as the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans are working on it. In the first days of October there may be 
further developments that if there needs to be further remediation 
that we do so before the winter season comes upon us.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are 
talking about a sediment contamination level of 10,000 parts per 
million. The situation is extremely serious.
<P>
	Can the Minister of the Environment assure us that the PCBs will 
be recovered before the winter so that the fishing industry will not 
be threatened next year?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as I mentioned, there were some 70 barrels of sediments 
around the footprint that were collected and brought into the 
Halifax port and are being destroyed. The sample which contains 
the 10,000 parts per million is one sample near that footprint area.
<P>
	We are talking to scientists as well as to technicians on it because 
we have to determine whether it is a small concentrated sample 
which is showing this 10,000 parts per million or whether it is a 
larger extended area.
<P>
	As soon as these officials from both my department and DFO can 
ascertain the extent of that sample, if it requires further 
remediation and bringing up further sedimentation, that is exactly 
what we will do. I have certainly given clear instructions that if that 
is an option we will do that before the winter comes upon us.

which is tough, tough for the government and tough for everybody. 
However, we see over there desperation politics. Their leader is

Mr. Speaker, the Reform Party is asking the questions that are on

do his job and accept ministerial accountability?
<P>
	If we were to find out that another person who was a witness in 
front of the inquiry wrote the terms of reference, the government 
lawyers would be screaming blue murder. Today we find that 
General Boyle has written the terms of reference for the Somalia 
inquiry at the same time that he is a witness before that very 
inquiry.

accepting ministerial responsibility. Accept ministerial 
accountability and do the proper thing for Canada, resign today.

	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General

communities. It targets adult offenders, those at highest risk to 
reoffend, sexual offenders. It empowers the court to impose a 
period as long as 10 years after the end of the prison term of 
supervision to ensure that those at highest risk to reoffend are under 
some degree of control in the communities.
<P>
	This regime would apply to a young offender transferred to and 
sentenced in the adult court. It does not apply in youth court. As the 
hon. member knows, the chair of the Standing Committee on 
Justice and Legal Affairs is now completing a comprehensive 
review of the Young Offenders Act.

<P>
	The worst thing our justice system can do is imprison someone 
for a crime they did not commit. Two and a half years ago, I asked 
the justice minister to examine the lengthy delays experienced with 
the processing of 690 applications which are based on evidence of 
wrongful imprisonment.
<P>
	The justice minister said at that time: ``We will be announcing in 
the next few months changes in the system to ensure that all such 
applications are dealt with fairly and as quickly as possible''.
<P>
	I have not heard any announcements in the last two years. Has 
the new system been put in place?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, following the question put to me on 
that occasion by the hon. member, the Department of Justice 
organized and then published a set of procedures governing section 
690 applications, making it clear to applicants what was required of 
them and also making clear the steps that would be followed inside 
justice in processing such applications. We have followed that 
procedure since and I think there has been a real improvement in 
the way they have been dealt with.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	I am very much aware that these applications have to be dealt 
with as quickly as possible. We are talking about people who are in 
prison, for the most part. At the same time, it is a personal 
responsibility of mine to read the file, to review the submissions 
and to come to my own independent judgment not only about what 
is to be done but the reasons for doing it because of the value of 
precedent these cases set.
<P>

provide the hon. member with a copy of the guidelines or the 
procedure we published, and I know he will have a continuing 
interest in these matters.

guaranteed a review of his parole ineligibility by this government 
while the Beaulieus and the McArthurs wait almost indefinitely at 
the pleasure of the justice minister in the face of evidence that a 
miscarriage of justice may have occurred.
<P>

their 690 applications?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General

in the case of Wilfrid Beaulieu was made about two years ago. 
However, that does not mean that much time has elapsed since we 
had all the material on which to base the decision.
<P>
	It was only earlier this year that I received the full report after 
the evidence was put in the hands of Mr. Beaulieu's lawyer for 
comment. It was only earlier this year that I received a draft from 
the counsel involved with recommendations. In the interim, I have 
reviewed that in detail. I have looked into further aspects of the 
matter about which I had questions, and I intend to deal with that 
matter in the weeks to come.
<P>
	I have taken on the practice when I release reasons in these cases 
to append a chronology so the public will know about the period 
since the original application was taken up. Often it is requesting 
additional information that we need, often it is awaiting responses 
from counsel for the applicant. All the time that has elapsed is not 
necessarily on the account of the Department of Justice.

	The hon. member is right. The number one priority of the 
government is giving Canadians jobs and a better standard of 
living. It is for that reason that interest rates are now down by over 
4.5 percentage points and since we took office we have created 
over 750,000 jobs.
<P>
	It is for that reason that we have an open skies policy which has 
brought in tourism and has created a multitude of jobs in imports. It 
is for that reason that we have lowered tariffs which have made the 
Canadian productive centre much more competitive. It is for that 
reason that our trade missions have been so successful. We have 
invested in technology.

<P>
	There is an urgent need for this type of legislation in Canada

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-54, 
an act to amend the Foreign Extraterritorial Measures Act, be read 
the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4508"> 4508 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, before 
we were interrupted for question period I was speaking about the 
aspects of Bill C-54 which do not guarantee the rights of 
Canadians and therefore the need to have a NAFTA dispute panel 
settle this issue once and for all.
<P>
	One important aspect was that Bill C-54 does not have any 
provisions against the Helms-Burton bill for barring entry of senior 
officials of selected companies doing business in the United States.
<P>
	Bill C-54 does not cover a number of questions and these are 
questions that need to be settled at a NAFTA panel. Does the 
United States have the right to seize assets of Canadian companies 
in the United States? Clearly not. Article 1110 states that no party 
may expropriate an investment of an investor of another party in its 
territory or take a measure tantamount to the expropriation of such 
an investment.
<P>
<B>(1215 )</B>
<P>
	Here is another NAFTA article to take to the dispute panel. 
Article 1105 states that each party shall accord to investments of 
investors of other parties treatment in accordance with 
international law, including fair and equitable treatment and full 
protection and security. No one can tell me that Helms-Burton is 
not in contravention of that provision of the NAFTA.
<P>
	I know that the officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs 
and International Trade have been looking at whether the Cuban 
legislation, the Helms-Burton legislation, is in violation of U.S. 
international trade obligations as they relate to the World Trade 
Organization. A senior American State Department official said 
last year that the bill essentially meant that the United States was 
asserting its jurisdiction over transfer between two non-U.S. parties 
of land or assets situated outside the United States. The official 
argued that went well beyond the accepted international practice 
and would be difficult to defend under U.S. law. I make the point 
that it would be more difficult to defend under the World Trade 
Organization.
<P>
	I am sure foreign affairs lawyers have advised the minister as to 
which dispute resolution forum is best. Let us go with it. Let us 
stop pussyfooting around on this issue and putting tit for tat 
legislation in place. Nowadays when a bully bullies us we do not 
have to put our tail between our legs and run. We do not have to get 
bloodied in the fight either. We can take that bully to international 
court. Let us take the Americans to court to see if we can get the 
Helms-Burton bill overturned.
<P>
	The United States is a very important trading partner of Canada. 
It is not only our trading partner, it is our friend. We have about $1 
billion in two-way trade per day crossing the 49th parallel. 
However, that does not mean the Americans can take their dispute 
with Cuba beyond their international borders. I make the point that  
the United States has every right to challenge Cuba and to put trade 
sanctions of a binational nature in place. However, it is simply not 
within the international parameters of good citizenship or 
international trade to take that outside its borders and apply it to 
countries such as Canada.
<P>
	I would like to talk a bit about our trade and investment relations 
with Cuba. Canada maintained full relations with CUBA after the 
1959 revolution which brought Castro to power. Even though the 
country has largely a state owned economy and cutting through 
paperwork is tiresome and frustrating we continue to do business 
there. Last year Canadian exports to Cuba amounted to $108 
million. This was mostly food products, chemicals, industrial 
machinery and transport equipment. Our exports were up more 
than 130 per cent last year. Imports from Cuba amounted to $194 
million. This is largely made up of sugar, raw nickel products and 
fertilizer.
<P>
	In all, 37 Canadian companies have offices in Cuba and 
Canadian businessmen are involved in as many as 30 joint venture 
projects with Cuban partners in areas ranging from minerals, 
petroleum, processed food and others.
<P>
	Canadian companies have arranged to build over 4,000 hotel 
rooms at 11 different sites in the next ten years. These are valued at 
over $500 million and will feature golf courses, riding stables and 
yacht berths. Of course, Cuba is a very important and favoured 
winter vacation location for about 120,000 Canadians who travel 
there each winter.
<P>
	There are continued prospects for Canadian companies to hunt 
for gold, drill for fertilizer and mine for nickel. A particularly 
interesting development is that Canadian firms are involved in 
biotechnology ventures with Cuban institutes.
<P>
	At the same time we are trading with Cuba, I believe it is 
incumbent on the Liberal government to work to help that country 
bring about democratic reform. It is interesting to note that 
although we have been trading with Cuba for over 30 years the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs said today that we need to encourage 
democratic reform. Where has been that effort in the past?
<P>
	The Minister for International Trade said that we should not have 
an isolationist policy like the United States does with Cuba; that we 
need to engage it. I concur completely.
<P>
	It seems strange that it takes a bill like the U.S. Helms-Burton 
bill to cause interest in Canada helping to bring about democratic 
reform in Cuba. We should be making every effort to work with 
Cubans very closely through our trade relationships to encourage 
them to work toward a more democratic country.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4509"> 4509 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	Trading with Cuba is good business for Canada and good 
business for Cuba. I also believe that keeping trade alive is the best 
way to promote democracy and human rights in Cuba. The trade 
policy we are following with Cuba is the same one the United 
States is pursuing with China. Keep trade channels flowing and 
eventually the political situation will open as well. I believe we 
should be doing more to encourage that. In any event, we insist on 
our right to make our own decisions regarding trade and 
investments with Cuba and any other country. The United States 
has every right to take action against Cuba but its fight must be 
maintained with Cuba and not with us.
<P>
	The Reform party supports Bill C-54 as a first step to repelling 
the Helms-Burton legislation but it is only a stop-gap measure. Let 
us take this to a dispute resolution under NAFTA. If we do not 
insist on our rights we will only encourage the Americans to keep 
pushing us around. It is time for Canada to test the United States' 
resolve. Will it be part of these international trade agreements and 
the rules that govern them or not?
<P>
	I also believe it is time to test this Liberal government's resolve. 
The U.S. is testing Canada at the World Trade Organization on our 
policy on split run magazines. It has tested us at NAFTA. What is 
this government afraid of? It is time to test this government's 
resolve. Does it believe in the trade agreements it has signed, 
NAFTA and the World Trade Organization? Is it prepared to see 
them through? It seems to me we have worked very hard. Canada 
has been a leader is setting international trade agreements in place 
and rules to settle these disputes. It is ridiculous that we do not use 
them to settle matters of this nature.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. LeBlanc (Cape Breton Highlands-Canso):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I have agreed to switch spots with my colleague, the hon. member 
for Terrebonne, so that he could speak now. I will speak after.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of 
all, I must say it was very kind of the parliamentary secretary to 
accept to switch spots with me. He agreed to do so for personal 
reasons and I am most grateful.
<P>
	Before commenting on Bill C-54, I would like to take a moment 
to commend the chamber of commerce of Bois-des-Filion, in my 
riding, for holding a conference breakfast that the leader of the 
Bloc Quebecois and myself attended this morning. As you can see 
we do get around quite a bit. A great deal of energy and 
professionalism went into organizing this event. I want to 
congratulate the president, Alain Éthier, and everyone involved in 
the operation of the chamber of commerce, for so successfully 
delivering the merchandise.
<P>
	Moving to the heart of the subject, that is to say Bill C-54, as 
presented by the Minister of International Trade and the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs. As you probably noticed from the previous speech 
made by a member of the Bloc Quebecois, we have no intention of 
stopping this bill from passing second reading.
<P>
	The reason for this is quite simple: the Bloc Quebecois is against 
this American initiative to limit Canadian and foreign companies' 
freedom of trade. It is illegal and it has prompted the Bloc 
Quebecois to ask over and over these past few months that the 
federal government take more vigorous steps than public criticism 
in the press in reaction to such an attempt by the U.S. to extend to 
Canada its embargo against Cuba.
<P>
	It is clear in our minds that it is essential to do everything in our 
power to protect Quebec and Canadian businesses trading abroad. 
This is why we will support Bill C-54. However, even if we do not 
oppose this measure, we have some reservations and we are 
somewhat puzzled about the efforts made so far by the government 
regarding the Helms-Burton issue.
<P>
	It is clear to everyone that the measures taken by the U.S. are 
totally reprehensible. The Cuban Liberty and Democratic 
Solidarity Act, better known as the Helms-Burton law, is 
unanimously condemned as unacceptable, both in Canada and in 
countries such as those of the European Union, the West Indies, the 
Caribbean and others from Latin America and South America.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	One would have expected the international community to react 
against this attempt by the U.S. government to subject the whole 
world to its foreign and trade policies.
<P>
	One would have expected greater leadership on the part of 
Canada to fight the actions of the U.S. government, first because 
our country is a major economic partner for Cuba, but also because 
of the strong economic ties between Canada and the United States. 
Instead, the Canadian government opted for the soft 
approach-time will take care of things-preferring to publicly 
condemn these measures, rather than take concrete and effective 
action.
<P>
	The action, or lack of, deemed to be the most effective by this 
government is an incomplete and, more importantly, tardy bill. 
Whereas under NAFTA, the government could have called a 
special panel hearing since July 29. In fact, I wonder if the 
government could even have used the NAFTA procedure from the 
very beginning, in March or April. But instead of using this option, 
the government preferred to wait and start reacting once the 
damage was done.
<P>
	Since the beginning, the Bloc Quebecois has strongly 
condemned this American legislative measure with its 
extraterritorial effects, and it has urged the Liberal government to 
take strong, quick and decisive action. However, the government 
has not met our expectations or answered our questions, far from it. 
It has been 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4510"> 4510 </A></B>
<P>
slow in taking action and the solutions proposed today are far from 
being complete.
<P>
	Let me briefly remind the House of the history and the basis of 
the Helms-Burton law. Following Fidel Castro's takeover in Cuba 
in 1959, the United States decided, in 1963, to impose an economic 
embargo against that country. From then on, it became illegal for 
American companies to do business with Cuba. Over the years, 
American economic sanctions against Cuba multiplied, until 
recently the American government passed a law preventing foreign 
companies from trading freely with Cuba, thus flouting 
international law and the sovereignty of states.
<P>
	In 1995, the American senate tabled a bill to strengthen the 
embargo's sanctions. However, in 1995, the presidential campaign 
had not begun, and agreement on the bill was far from unanimous. 
At that time, even the American president opposed it because, in 
his view, certain measures went too far, such as the ban on entering 
American territory, and the right to prosecute.
<P>
	The situation changed when two civilian aircraft belonging to 
Cuban exiles were shot down over the Straits of Florida. Following 
this unfortunate incident, the Cuban Liberty and Democratic 
Solidarity Act was passed by the American congress and signed by 
President Clinton on March 12, 1996. The act strengthened the 
embargo and imposed reprisals against all companies that do not 
respect the American embargo against Cuba, and that are using 
expropriated American property or interests, and this is after Fidel 
Castro's victory over thirty years ago, should anyone have 
forgotten.
<P>
	There are two titles worthy of note. First, title III entitled 
<I>Protection of property rights of United States nationals</I>. This title 
allows an American company to prosecute foreign companies 
profiting from investments expropriated by the Castro regime. The 
act permits the assets of such companies on American soil to be 
seized. Although this title was suspended by the American 
president on August 1 for a period of six months, before it could 
take effect, the fact remains that if the suspension is not renewed, 
this title could take effect in February 1997.
<P>
	It is important to remember that there is also title IV, which has 
been in effect since August 1. This title is entitled <I>Exclusion of 
certain aliens</I>, and makes it possible to bar the entry into the United 
States of company directors who have bought or invested in 
expropriated American properties and their families.
<P>
	Until now, directors of the Canadian company Sherritt 
International Corporation and members of their families have been 
barred from entering the United States. It should be noted that the 
President of the United States has the power to suspend titles III 
and IV, but has used his discretionary power only for the most 
controversial  measure, which is title III concerning the right to 
prosecute.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois has always believed that a strong reaction to 
the Helms-Burton law was called for, in order to send a clear and 
unambiguous message to the U.S. government that its behaviour is 
unacceptable and that we will not give in to its imperialism.
<P>
	Now, a few words about the extraterritorial legislation on Iran 
and Libya. Unfortunately, the Liberal government was not very 
vociferous in its opposition to the U.S. government's repeating the 
same offence by passing another piece of legislation with 
extraterritorial impact, this time blocking trade with Iran and 
Libya. On July 23, 1996, the United States Congress unanimously 
passed the 1996 legislation on sanctions against Iran and Libya. Its 
purpose is to discourage companies from making major oil and gas 
investments in Iran and Libya. The Canadian government ought to 
be opposed to this in principle, not its technical agreements but the 
principle.
<P>
	The Helms-Burton and 1996 laws on sanctions against Iran and 
Libya have a direct impact on the spirit of international trade 
agreements. These acts violate the principle of the sovereignty of 
states and their territories, recognized by international law.
<P>
	Although I am taking care not to oppose the federal 
government's attempt to counteract the effects of the 
Helms-Burton legislation, I feel that Bill C-54 can be summarized 
succinctly: too little, too late. Too late, because the Helms-Burton 
law has been in effect since March, and the government has waited 
until now to respond to the U.S. threat.
<P>
	Too little, also, because its effect is incomplete. First of all, it 
addresses only title III, with respect to legal proceedings. C-54 
does nothing about title IV, which means that at the present time the 
Canadian government is doing nothing about the only provision in 
the legislation which affects Canadian citizens, namely blocking 
their entry into the U.S. While it has had the possibility since July 
29, 1996, of calling a special committee under NAFTA, it has 
refused, for obscure reasons. Perhaps the parliamentary secretary 
will let us in on those reasons shortly.
<P>
	Bill C-54, which we have before us today, modifies an existing 
act, the Foreign Extraterritorial Measures Act. Let us touch briefly 
on that act. It came into effect 11 years ago, in 1985. It was enacted 
by the Mulroney government to respond to possible legal actions 
by foreign governments or tribunals in order to interfere in 
Canadian jurisdictions.
<P>
	It was amended twice: in 1990 and in 1992. In 1992, the act was 
amended in response to the US Torricelli law, which was 
extraterritorial in nature dealing with trade with Cuba.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4511"> 4511 </A></B>
<P>
	This act contains two parts, one dealing with legal actions and 
execution of judgments, the other one requiring compliance with 
Canadian laws over harmful foreign legislation and setting fines.
<P>
	It is very important to note that so far the current legislation has 
never been applied. And yet, since 1992, it has required Canadian 
corporations, including subsidiaries of US companies, to comply 
with Canadian laws and, therefore, ignore the US embargo on 
Cuba. On June 18, 1996, during Question Period, I put a question to 
the Minister for International Trade regarding American Express. I 
asked him then why he had not fined this corporation, since the 
legislation on foreign extraterritorial measures gave him the 
authority to prosecute Canadian companies and subsidiaries of 
foreign companies which comply with foreign legislation in 
contravention of Canadian law.
<P>
	American Express, in the United States, had given unequivocal 
instructions to its foreign offices, including in Canada, to honour 
the American embargo on Cuba. Even though officials at the 
Department of International Trade have been aware of the situation 
for two years, the international trade minister told us in June he 
knew nothing about it. And, as of last June, the government had 
taken no action against American Express.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	And what has happened since? The minister had three months to 
take action under the former act and he did nothing. Therefore, one 
wonders if the amendments proposed in Bill C-54 will serve any 
purpose. Is this yet another smoke screen?
<P>
	Since the act has never been used, we have every reason to 
believe that the legislation amended by Bill C-54 will also remain 
unused. The minister himself said this morning that the 
government hopes this legislation will remain unused. Moreover, 
given that the Helms-Burton law could become a dead letter after 
the American election, in November, Bill C-54 is definitely a case 
of too little, too late.
<P>
	In reply to my question on June 18, the Minister for International 
Trade said that the intent of the amendments he wanted to make to 
the Foreign Extraterritorial Measures Act was to neutralize the 
effects of the Helms-Burton law, adding that this was a last resort 
measure.
<P>
	The minister also said, like he did this morning, that he hoped 
Canada would never have to resort to this measure. The Canadian 
government gave itself time to see what it would do, before 
showing the true colours of its bill.
<P>
	The federal government repeatedly claimed that Canada strongly 
and vehemently opposed the Helms-Burton law, but it did not take 
any concrete measure. The Liberal government strongly 
condemned the illegal actions of the United States, but when the 
time  came to counteract the American government's measures, it 
never rose to the occasion. The government was just buying time.
<P>
	We will support Bill C-54 even though we have reservations 
about its usefulness. We will do so only because we want to protect 
Quebec and Canadian businesses. However, we want to put it on 
the record that we are not pleased by the Canadian government's 
lack of effective action.
<P>
	By not refusing to use the process provided under NAFTA to 
have the American law invalidated, this government is shamelessly 
hurting dozens of Quebec and Canadian companies doing business 
with Cuba. Canadians and Quebecers expect more strength on the 
part of their government.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I thank you and the hon. members for listening to 
my comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Francis G. LeBlanc (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
thank the hon. members of the official opposition and the hon. 
member of the Reform Party who spoke in support of Bill C-54 
today. This bill to amend the Foreign Extraterritorial Measures Act 
is part of the continuity of Canada's firm, active and measured 
campaign worldwide and in the U.S. to convince the American 
administration and the American Congress to withdraw the 
Helms-Burton law and to change the course of action they have 
taken with this legislation.
<P>
	Canada has lead this campaign in every international forum on 
this issue, at the World Trade Organization, the European Union, 
the Organization of American States and many other multinational 
organizations, where we have taken the lead in opposing this law.
<P>
	The bill we are introducing today is a further element in our 
campaign to convince the U.S. to reconsider and withdraw their 
law, which affects their trade relations with many other countries.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is indeed regrettable that these amendments are necessary. Our 
trade and political relations with the United States on the whole are 
very strong, but we cannot ignore the U.S. Helms-Burton act. It 
clearly interferes with business between Canadian companies and 
Cuba.
<P>
	Basic principles of international law are at stake here. In effect 
the U.S. is unilaterally extending its reach into business between 
other countries. We cannot accept that quietly. We have to respond. 
We must give Canadian companies the means to protect 
themselves. That of course is what we are doing in this legislation.
<P>
	I want to underline that this is responsive legislation. We are 
responding to a U.S. initiative that affects Canadians. We did not 
choose to start this quarrel.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4512"> 4512 </A></B>
<P>
	Someone might say that a clash was inevitable because Canada 
and other countries have followed a different path than the United 
States in dealing with Cuba. My answer is that disagreement with 
our Cuba policy does not justify Helms-Burton. There are other 
ways under international law for the U.S. to resolve its dispute 
with Cuba.
<P>
	Helms-Burton is indeed a disturbing development in U.S. 
foreign policy. I am aware that the U.S. administration had strong 
reservations about Helms-Burton before the shooting down of a 
U.S. civilian aircraft by Cuban planes in February.
<P>
	I am also aware that in July President Clinton did suspend the 
right of U.S. companies to sue foreign firms under the claims 
provision of Helms-Burton for six months. I note that the 
President's special envoy, Stuart Eizenstat, said in Ottawa that the 
U.S. is in no way telling Canadians to stop trade and investment 
with Cuba.
<P>
	But Helms-Burton remains a threat to Canadian businesses 
dealing with Cuba. The legislation is on the books. It does give 
President Clinton or his successors the power to permit filing of 
claims by U.S. companies against Canadian or other foreign firms. 
The U.S. has already informed some Canadians that they will be 
denied entry to the U.S. because of this law.
<P>
	It is also unfortunate that Helms-Burton is not an isolated case. 
The President has signed into law the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act 
which again thrusts the United States into the trading relationships 
of other countries. The details of the two laws are different but the 
principle is the same.
<P>
	Are these signs of a change in direction in U.S. foreign policy? 
Do they mean that the U.S. is ready to put aside the normal rules of 
international trade to achieve its own ends? I would like to answer 
no. I would like to say that the long U.S. tradition in support of 
open trade and internationally accepted rules is as strong as ever 
but I am not so sure.
<P>
	There are some good signs. President Clinton has publicly 
endorsed the World Trade Organization and the U.S. is using the 
WTO dispute settlement mechanism to resolve some trade 
disputes. It has participated actively in a number of international 
negotiations in such areas as telecommunications and financial 
services, and it continues to press for more open trade around the 
world.
<P>
	On the other hand, the U.S. has had a tendency to throw down the 
gauntlet in recent international trade negotiations. In some cases it 
has left the impression that it will not settle for less than the whole 
ball of wax. As well, the momentum of the free trade clause seems 
to have slowed, at least in the U.S. Congress. An example is last 
year's decision to refuse fast track authority to the president to 
negotiate admission of Chile to the North American Free Trade 
Agreement.
<P>
	I do not want to overstate this. The U.S. is one of the most open 
and generous countries in the world. More than 95 per cent of 
Canada-U.S. trade flows freely without any impediment. The U.S. 
continues to show in the G-7 and other international meetings that 
it wants to work jointly with its partners on economic and political 
issues. I am convinced that remains the wellspring of U.S. policy.
<P>
	But we cannot allow measures such as Helms-Burton to pass by 
without resisting. It is only by being firm and by working 
co-operatively with other countries that we can ensure 
Helms-Burton does not become a pattern. That has been a key 
element of our policy throughout the Helms-Burton debate.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	On the domestic side, we are introducing these FEMA 
amendments as our response to what is clearly an infringement of 
Canadian sovereignty. The main purpose of these amendments of 
course is to give Canadian companies the tools to defend 
themselves if U.S. courts rule in favour of American claimants who 
sue them under the Helms-Burton act.
<P>
	Under the FEMA changes, Canadian firms can attempt to recoup 
these damages by suing the American companies in Canadian 
courts. There are other changes which give the attorney general the 
authority to block application of unreasonable U.S. laws in 
Canadian courts. I hope these changes will help deter American 
firms from acting against Canadian companies under 
Helms-Burton. At least it will give them something to think about.
<P>
	We are not limiting our action to the domestic front. Canada has 
played a leadership role in developing a co-ordinated international 
response since the President signed the Helms-Burton act into law. 
The Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister for International 
Trade and the Secretary of State for Latin America have raised the 
issue with colleagues in other countries and in international 
organizations. It has been discussed with visiting leaders from 
other countries. This co-ordinated international action is having 
some effect.
<P>
	Mexico is introducing similar legislation to ours. The European 
Union is considering action through the World Trade Organization. 
The Organization for American States has asked the 
Inter-American Juridical Committee to investigate whether 
Helms-Burton is consistent with international law. These actions 
taken together may contain the damage of Helms-Burton. Beyond 
this my hope is that this experience will have an impact on 
legislators in Washington and that this will discourage such 
extraterritorial measures in the future.
<P>
	We cannot however rely on hopes. We must take concrete steps 
to protect our interests. That is the purpose of these FEMA 
amendments and that is why I support them.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4513"> 4513 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with 
pleasure that I speak to Bill C-54 which expands the FEMA 
legislation to give Canada the capacity to counter the 
Helms-Burton bill. I think we would all agree that the 
Helms-Burton bill is heavy handed, unilateral, coercive and 
indiscriminate. Helms-Burton breaks international law and it 
contravenes NAFTA.
<P>
	As the Reform Party foreign affairs critic I can state without 
reservation that our party's quarrel is not with the United States 
which is our friend, trading partner and ally, but it is only with the 
Helms-Burton bill itself. In fact, given Canada's tremendous 
relationship with the United States, it was surprising to all of us 
that Canada should be targeted as it was.
<P>
	I would encourage Canadians however to consider this more of a 
nuisance caused by the coming presidential election than any true 
reflection on Canada-U.S. relations. I think all of us and previous 
speakers have reviewed the history behind this: the killing of 
civilians, certainly the number of voters of Cuban descent that exist 
in Florida, and of course the Helms-Burton lobby that has gone on 
for a number of years in the U.S. It is also hopeful that after the 
election in the U.S. this annoyance will disappear.
<P>
	Nonetheless, as parliamentarians we cannot ignore the fact that 
Helms-Burton exists and remains a threat to Canadian sovereignty 
and trade. That is why we must take action. In the opinion of the 
Reform Party, the government should have already filed the 
grievances with the NAFTA dispute panel. Therefore I cannot say 
that we totally agree with the approach the government is using. 
However, we will be supporting Bill C-54 even though it seems to 
be a bit of a tit for tat and could even be questioned legally.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	My colleague from Peace River, who is Reform's trade critic, 
has already covered most of the specific elements of Bill C-54 and 
their objectives. I agree with the analysis of my colleague and 
instead of repeating the same points I would like to talk briefly 
about promoting democracy in Cuba which I believe is part of this 
and probably, had this been approached more strongly, the U.S. 
politicians might not have gone along with the Helms-Burton bill.
<P>
	One thing I would like to make clear is that Reform's support for 
Bill C-54 and our vocal opposition of Helms-Burton in no way 
signals approval of or support for Cuban dictator Fidel Castro. In 
fact, Reform shares the view that Cuba would be much better off as 
a democracy.
<P>
	We have to remember that Cuba is the last country in our 
hemisphere to reject democracy. Therefore, we should really 
channel more of our foreign policy efforts toward promoting Cuban 
democracy. Not only would we be helping the people of Cuba, but 
such a constructive approach would show our neighbours south of 
the border  that our goals are the same even if our methods are 
different from the ones they choose to use.
<P>
	I think again, as the foreign affairs department has indicated, that 
being involved is the best approach to having influence. Whether it 
be China or Cuba, I believe that to be true.
<P>
	I think as well however, when we hear people talking about 
Cuba, that we must remember the number of human rights abuses 
and the number of problems that do exist in Cuba. We cannot be 
selective about what we say about one country as opposed to 
another, which often is the case.
<P>
	If Canada becomes a leader in the fight for democracy in Cuba, I 
am very confident that Helms-Burton will cease to be a problem. I 
really believe that it is a rather extreme bill and it is put forward 
because of the extreme action that was taken by Cuba in the 
shooting down of the planes as was mentioned.
<P>
	Toward this end, Canada should assert itself in meetings of the 
Organization of American States and make sure that promoting 
democracy, institutional reform and human rights reforms in Cuba 
is the priority for the OAS. Let us face it, once Cuba becomes a 
democratic country it could be a very positive force within the 
Caribbean. I feel that Cuba has a great deal of potential, but in 
order to achieve this potential and direct it toward positive goals, 
the people of Cuba have to become their own political masters. 
Political change in Cuba will only spur economic revitalization.
<P>
	While Canadian-Cuban trade has continued despite the 
American embargo, I think the business opportunities in a free 
Cuba would far outstrip those which exist today. For example, the 
lifting of the U.S. embargo alone would allow for a rapid economic 
expansion in Cuba. As a country emerging from communist rule, 
Cuba will not only need Canadian consumer products and 
technology but our service sector will also prosper. The Canadian 
advantage in areas like banking, insurance, wireless 
communication and high technology will stand us in good stead if 
Cuba can modernize its economy.
<P>
	We need a vision of this sort of thing and I believe that this 
government does not have that vision going into the 21st century. I 
believe that causes all of us a great deal of concern with the status 
quo type of positions we seem to take. We basically feel we can 
solve our job problems simply by infrastructure programs. We do 
not really look to the tremendous number of jobs that would exist if 
we were promoting democracy and ourselves around the world.
<P>
	We should note as well that Cuba is beside Haiti, the other 
country in our hemisphere with the greatest social, political and 
economic problems. I cannot help but think that a prosperous, 
stable and democratic Cuba would help Haiti's long term 
development. Proximity makes Haiti and Cuba ideal trading 
partners. I would hope that  a democratic Cuba would also be able 
to shoulder some of the load that Canada has been forced to bear 
with respect to assisting Haiti these last several years.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4514"> 4514 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	All of these possibilities however require a political change in 
Cuba. Without democracy, Cuba will remain an international 
outcast and it will continue to earn the wrath of the Americans. We 
must always remember that Cuba is only 90 miles away from the 
U.S. border. Because of that proximity, the threat is obvious to all 
Americans.
<P>
	In conclusion, I do recognize the need for Bill C-54 and we will 
be voting for it. I do hope members of this House will agree with 
me that Canada should do more than just fight against the 
Helms-Burton bill. We should also fight against dictatorship and 
fight for building a democratic future for the people of Cuba.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roger Simmons (Burin-St. George's, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I was about to make an aside that my friends in the 
Reform Party are in good form as usual. It is always good to have 
their support for something like this, the Foreign Extraterritorial 
Measures Act, which I am pleased to support. I congratulate both 
the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister for International 
Trade on this particular initiative. It is an important one and one I 
can gladly give my support to.
<P>
	I think all of us were-chagrined is the nice word-disgusted by 
the Helms-Burton initiative of some months ago. Apart from the 
fact that it flies in the face of everything we understand about the 
rule of law, about the territorial integrity of sovereign nations, it 
also says volumes about the arrogance of the people who would 
advance that kind of legislation.
<P>
	I had the occasion fairly recently to be outside the country in 
Asia. There they cannot often tell the difference between an 
American and a Canadian, until they are told. They are anxious to 
know the difference. It is amazing and heart warming the reception 
one gets once they learn one is a Canadian and not an American.
<P>
	I am not on an American bashing initiative today. I just wanted 
to make that observation because I could make a long speech on 
how much I admire the aspects of the American system. I did my 
graduate work at Boston University many years ago and I have 
many good friends in the United States.
<P>
	At the same time I think all of us who have travelled 
internationally first of all are amused but second are puzzled that 
certain Americans so readily cultivate or lend credence to this aura 
of arrogance and that they know best. There are two sets of rules, 
one for the Americans and one for everybody else.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	The bill before us is intended to strengthen the act to allow 
Canada to respond to attempts by the United States  to infringe on 
our sovereignty. It is an objective which I believe will find support 
on all sides of the House. The amended bill will allow Canadian 
companies to oppose the financial claims aspect of Helms-Burton. 
It will allow Canadians to recover in Canadian courts any amounts 
awarded in Helms-Burton actions in United States courts plus any 
costs associated with both the Canadian and U.S. court actions.
<P>
	As my friend the Minister for International Trade was saying 
earlier today in his speech in this Chamber, we as Canadians share 
the objectives of the American government in so far as Cuba is 
concerned. Yes, we want to see democracy there. Yes, we want to 
see more respect for human rights there. So do the Americans. 
What we disagree on is the way to get there. The Americans have 
been trying the old isolation policy for at least 170 years, going 
back to the early 1820s, without much of a track record. It has not 
worked very well. It certainly has not worked in Cuba. One only 
has to look at the parade of American leaders who have come and 
gone since this policy was implemented. Mr. Castro still remains.
<P>
	One only has to look at the hypocrisy of the Americans in 
dealing with Cuba versus how they deal with other countries. 
Surely the Americans have a few axes to grind with other countries 
in the world. The U.S. has certainly made it known that it has a very 
big human rights axe to grind with China. However, we do not see 
the Helms-Burton initiative being taken, being advanced or being 
suggested in relation to that country.
<P>
	I have often felt that the American stance toward Cuba was more 
motivated by spite and by pride than by common sense. If it had 
been motivated by common sense I submit the policy would have 
been different. It would have been more effective in its results than 
it has been to date. The results show no promise of change. There is 
no indication that the American approach to Cuba is going to bring 
any more results than it has over the last 30 years.
<P>
	Even that comment is beside the point. It is not our role as 
Canadian parliamentarians, as Canadian citizens or as the Canadian 
government to tell the Americans what to do. We have not spent 
much time doing that. My comment a minute ago was not intended 
in that direction. I have no allusions they would listen anyway, but 
the fact is we should not be telling them what to do. That is the 
point. While we do not attempt to tell them, they think it is quite all 
right for them to tell us. They think it is all right for them to 
implement legislation which would seek to have impact beyond 
their borders. They can make whatever laws they see fit to regulate 
activities in their country and their citizens. That is what 
government is all about, what a good part of it is all about.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	The moment they step over the line, the moment they say 
``Canada, we respect your sovereignty only as long  as you do 
things we like'', that is the day we have to stand up and be counted. 
I applaud the ministers responsible and the administration for this 
amendment to the act which would give some teeth to our efforts to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4515"> 4515 </A></B>
<P>
respond to the Helms-Burton initiative and other initiatives should 
they come along.
<P>
	Let us have a quick look at what the minister and especially the 
attorney general will be able to do once this amendment becomes 
law, as I certainly hope it will. The attorney general will be able to 
issue so-called blocking orders declaring that judgments handed 
down under certain foreign laws will not be enforced or recognized 
in Canada if the attorney general believes the legislation violates 
international law.
<P>
	Second, once the amendment to the act is implemented, the 
attorney general will be able to allow Canadians to recover in 
Canadian courts amounts awarded under these foreign rulings, plus 
any costs associated with these court cases in Canada and the 
foreign country; a so-called clawback.
<P>
	Third, the attorney general will be able to issue and amend in the 
future with the agreement of the Minister of Foreign Affairs a 
schedule listing items of objectionable foreign legislation that in 
the opinion of the attorney general violate international law.
<P>
	It is a good piece of legislation and I am delighted to support it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Bloc 
Quebecois supports the principle of Bill C-54, which is meant to 
offset the extraterritorial effects of the Helms-Burton legislation on 
Canada and Quebec. In fact, we support the action by the Canadian 
government to protect businesses and corporations in Canada and 
Quebec, against retaliatory measures taken by foreign countries.
<P>
	Unfortunately, we see that our neighbours the United States 
resort more and more often to threats of retaliation against 
businesses in third countries, even against friends like Canada, in 
order to isolate countries they have differences with.
<P>
	The present case involves a political dispute between Cuba and 
the United States, which is deteriorating into a trade war with 
extraterritorial consequences. Furthermore, the Helms-Burton 
legislation could jeopardize the efforts of many countries, 
including the United States, to further free trade. Finally, we cannot 
tolerate any country dictating the foreign policy of another.
<P>
	Bill C-54 is certainly the first step in a reply to the American 
legislation, but the Minister of International Trade and the Liberal 
government still have a lot to do in this matter.
<P>
	Let us see what factors brought about Bill C-54 so that we really 
understand its scope, utility and shortcomings. The President of the 
United States signed the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity 
Act, commonly called the Helms-Burton legislation, into law in 
March 1996.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	This law is aimed at stopping foreign businesses that own or use 
American nationals' properties or interests that were expropriated 
by Cuba from doing business in that country, on pain of retaliation 
by the United States. Canada, as well as Quebec, and many 
countries and organizations such as the OECD, the European Union 
and the Organization of American States, have already positively 
opposed to this law, which imposes American jurisdiction outside 
U.S. territory on non-American businesses and people.
<P>
	The Helms-Burton law contravenes the principles of 
international law and the sovereignty of countries on their own 
territory. The Bloc Quebecois believes the American government 
would vehemently oppose any form of external interference in the 
conduct of its affairs. The same applies to Canada. It is therefore 
important to counter the Helms-Burton law so that the principles 
established by trade practice relating to disputes between states be 
respected.
<P>
	Through Bill C-54, the Liberal government proposes to amend 
the Canadian Foreign Extraterritorial Measures Act of 1985 to 
counter the effects the Helms-Burton law would have in Canada 
and in Quebec. But we must ask ourselves if this response will be 
sufficient. Will Canadians and Quebecers doing business with 
Cuba be able to find in it the means to protect themselves against 
potential American legal action?
<P>
	To answer this question, let me comment on the titles of the 
American law that are prejudicial to businesses in Canada and in 
Quebec, and the measures proposed in Bill C-54 to counter them.
<P>
	There are two titles in particular in the Helms-Burton law which 
affect Canadian and Quebec interests: titles III and IV. Title III 
allows American citizens whose property was expropriated during 
the Cuban revolution to bring legal action against anyone, 
American or not, who has invested in the properties they used to 
own in Cuba. This title was to come into effect on November 1, but 
the U.S. president has decided to suspend its application until 
February 1997. Nearly 6,000 lawsuits in this connection are 
already pending, a good number of them, no doubt, involving 
Canadian or Quebec companies.
<P>
	As for Title IV, which came into effect this past August 1, it 
blocks entry into the U.S. of any person who has invested in 
expropriated American properties in Cuba. In Canada, the directors 
of a Toronto firm, as well as their family members, have already 
been refused entry into the U.S. under this section.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4516"> 4516 </A></B>
<P>
	We feel that the problem lies in the fact that the amendments 
to the Foreign Extraterritorial Measures Act proposed in Bill C-54 
are not complete and are a bit late in coming.
<P>
	I have just referred to the fact that two specific titles of the 
Helms-Burton law threatened Canadian and Quebec interests: titles 
III and IV. Although Bill C-54 addresses the effects of title III, 
implementation of which is suspended until after the U.S. 
presidential elections, it proposes nothing to help the cause of 
Canadians and Quebecers affected by title IV, which is the one that 
has already caused problems to some Canadians.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois wonders why the Canadian government 
refrained from taking any action to deal with the ban on entry and 
residence in the United States, which, as you know, penalizes the 
executives and shareholders of these companies as well as their 
spouses and minor children. Why did the government fail to react 
to this section of the Helms-Burton law?
<P>
	We all condemn the U.S. Helms-Burton law and deplore the 
unfortunate impact it may have on the good relations we have with 
our U.S. neighbours.
<P>
	We must not forget, however, that this law was not passed 
yesterday, and that is the problem. It has been one year and seven 
months since the red flag went up, so the government knows what 
will happen if it does not act promptly.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	In February and in the fall of 1995, the Helms-Burton bill was 
introduced in the Senate and the House of Representatives. In 
March 1996 the Prime Minister finally expressed his opposition to 
this legislation, and it took six more months for him to transform 
his verbal opposition into a bill.
<P>
	We are familiar with the delay involved in the NAFTA process 
for dispute settlement. However, today it is clear there is no excuse 
for waiting any longer. That being said, the U.S. election should not 
prevent the government from taking action. That is why we urge 
the Minister for International Trade to ask for a special panel to be 
charged with settling this dispute under the auspices of NAFTA. If 
it refuses to take action to have the U.S. law invalidated under the 
auspices of NAFTA, the Liberal government will continue to 
expose Canadians and Quebecers to the adverse effects of the 
Helms-Burton law, especially title IV.
<P>
	After expressing its opposition verbally during the past six 
months, it is perhaps time for the Liberal government to starts 
some concrete action towards the invalidating the U.S. law.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the ten 
clauses making up Bill C-54 have been pretty thoroughly covered. I 
will therefore take the opportunity  provided by this bill to reflect 
on some of the important questions facing the international 
community.
<P>
	Since the fall of the Berlin Wall and the dismantling of the 
Soviet Union, a wind of liberalization and globalization of trade 
has swept the planet. And I imagine that, for the world's greatest 
economic power, the United States, it must be extremely frustrating 
to see that Cuba, a tiny country in Latin America, is standing in the 
way of this free trade movement.
<P>
	Cuba is to the United States as David was to Goliath. For over 30 
years, the Americans have tried by all the means at their disposal to 
bring down the Castro regime, but success has so far eluded them.
<P>
	They undoubtedly thought that the liberalization of trade 
sweeping the planet would also sweep away the dictatorship in 
Cuba. However, I think they are reading it the wrong way. Instead 
of applying an even tighter embargo against Cuba, if they had taken 
the opposite approach a number of years ago, the Cubans 
themselves would probably have taken steps to throw off this 
dictatorship.
<P>
	But the reaction of the Cuban people now that they are feeling 
oppressed by the United States is to stand behind their leader, and 
this is why the regime continues on, despite everything. It could 
have been completely different, of course. The whole Cuba-U.S. 
matter could have been different.
<P>
	I remember a television program reviewing some of the main 
failed appointments in the history of mankind. What happened 
between Cuba and the U.S. was one of these failed appointments. 
The host of the show pointed out that, months if not weeks before 
President Kennedy's assassination, a French reporter had been 
hired to act as an intermediary between Fidel Castro and President 
Kennedy in organizing what would no doubt have been a historical 
meeting, which would probably have led to the resolution of this 
huge conflict between the two countries.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	However, we know what happened in November 1963. President 
Kennedy was killed and the program host reminded us that Fidel 
Castro was crushed by this news, because he hoped the 
confrontation with the United States was coming to an end.
<P>
	Of course, there is a direct link between the Helms-Burton 
legislation and the election, we must not delude ourselves about 
that. Just as we can almost be sure that there is a link between the 
United States' recent intervention in Iraq and the upcoming 
American elections, and that is unfortunate.
<P>
	Obviously, this legislation is, or at least was, to strengthen the 
embargo around Cuba, in order to attract the votes of Spanish 
Americans.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
	Helms-Burton is an anachronistic measure since it goes against 
the tendency toward freer trade that has emerged over the last few 
years. Think about the length of the negotiations known as the 
Uruguay Round which led, in 1993, to the creation of the WTO. 
They lasted seven years. They were supposed to give us freer 
trade. Think about the NAFTA negotiations under the leadership 
of, if I am not mistaken, the United States. And here we are today 
faced with a piece of legislation that goes completely against this 
strong tendency toward freer trade.
<P>
	Helms-Burton is an example of the inability of the United States 
to accept the fact that smaller countries also have rights and 
privileges. After the free trade agreement was finalized, we had the 
case of Norsk Hydro, a Quebec company, when the United States 
tried in every way it could to counter the effects of free trade and 
was finally successful.
<P>
	We are all familiar with the softwood lumber story. The 
agreement was signed to promote free trade between Mexico, 
Canada and the United States and subsequently, the United States 
tried in every possible way, either directly or indirectly, to revise 
the content of the agreement. Finally, Canada was obliged to sign a 
schedule that would limit exports of softwood lumber to the United 
States for five years.
<P>
	I will finish with a fable by La Fontaine. If we look at the U.S. 
attitude to trade, it is just like the fable of the wolf and the lamb. A 
little lamb was drinking water in a river, and the wolf was drinking 
up river. The wolf accused the little lamb of making the water 
murky, and the lamb answered: How could I, since I am down 
river? The wolf answered: If you did not do it today, you did six 
months ago. The lamb answered: I had not been not born six 
months ago. The wolf added: If you did not do it six months ago, it 
must have been your parents. The fable ends with the wolf eating 
the lamb. I think this is a little like the attitude of the Americans to 
measures they themselves created. They are just sabotaging the 
agreements they signed of their own free will.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
understand that the hon. member Okanagan-Shuswap will be 
seeking the floor to make a speech.
<P>
<B>(1325 )</B>
<P>
	I think you would find unanimous consent that the House not see 
the clock at 1.30 p.m. to permit the member to make his remarks, 
within the 20-minute rule that usually applies, and that after that 
the House proceed with the question prior to going to private 
members' hour.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent to permit the 
member to speak for 20 minutes?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, relations between our southern neighbour and major 
trading partner, the United States and the small country 90 miles 
south of the United States, Cuba, have been a roller coaster for 
nearly 100 years. Ever since 1898 when U.S. forces invaded Cuba 
and forced out the Spanish, it has not been unheard of for Canada to 
have to ride that roller coaster.
<P>
	The legislation before us, Bill C-54, is needed because that roller 
coaster ride continues today. To put the legislation into perspective, 
I believe it is useful for us to look back briefly over some of the 
highest hills and deepest dives which that roller coaster has 
followed.
<P>
	For four years, from 1898 until early into this century the U.S. 
military occupied and ran Cuba. When the U.S. imposed the Platt 
amendment giving itself the right to dictate Cuba's foreign policy 
and to have the U.S. military intervene in Cuba's international 
affairs, that situation continued for more than a generation. Only in 
1934 did American President Franklin Delano Roosevelt give up 
the powers which the U.S. had given itself in the Platt amendment.
<P>
	Eventually both American corporations and U.S. organized 
crime had a strong base of operations in Cuba, until a bushy 
bearded revolutionary named Fidel Castro seized power in 1960.
<P>
	It shows Canada's special relationship with Cuba when we note 
that when Castro expropriated Cuba's banks at the start of his reign, 
he exempted just two, the Bank of Nova Scotia and the Royal Bank, 
both Canadian. Apparently a copy of the document by which the 
Cuban government bought ScotiaBank's Cuban subsidiary now 
reposes in the vaults of the Bank of Nova Scotia in downtown 
Toronto.
<P>
	In 1962 intelligence reports revealed that the U.S.S.R. was 
installing ballistic missiles in Cuba capable of hitting U.S. and 
Canadian targets. Then U.S. president John Kennedy announced an 
American naval blockade of the island.
<P>
	The Canadian government was asked with barely 90 minutes 
advance notice to move Canadian Armed Forces to an alert status 
called DEFCON 3. Our defence minister at that time, Douglas 
Harkness, quietly did so. But the Diefenbaker cabinet was torn and 
debate sizzled for a couple of days.
<P>
	However, Soviet ships approached the American imposed 
quarantine zone later in that week. Prime Minister Diefenbaker 
authorized the alert on October 24, and it was announced in the 
House on October 25, 1962.
<P>
	Many of us recall the international sigh of relief a few days later 
when the Soviet premier, Nikita Khrushchev, agreed to dismantle 
and remove those threatening ballistic missiles from Cuba. Many 
people feared that the world was teetering on the brink of nuclear 
war over the Cuban situation in 1962.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4518"> 4518 </A></B>
<P>
	In 1985, the Foreign Extraterritorial Measures Act, FEMA, 
became law in Canada. It was designed to defend Canadian 
interests against attempts by foreign governments or courts to 
apply unreasonable laws to Canada. FEMA currently gives the 
Attorney General the authority to prevent compliance in Canada 
with extraterritorial laws or court rulings which infringe on 
Canadian sovereignty. However, its penalties are lower than 
penalties threatened by new legislation in the United States for 
people doing business with Cuba.
<P>
	Since FEMA was passed, and especially over some 35 years 
since Fidel Castro tossed out a right wing dictator to take over the 
Government of Cuba, many thousands of Cubans have escaped Mr. 
Castro's communist dictatorship and have gone to live in the U.S. 
state of Florida. Some estimates place the total of Cuban exiles 
living in Florida as high as one million people.
<P>
	On February 24 of this year four people among those Cuban 
exiles, part of a group called Brothers to the Rescue, who were 
American citizens, were shot down by Cuban MiGs in international 
airspace and they died.
<P>
<B>(1330 )</B>
<P>
	About 50,000 Cuban exiles, many with pictures of the dead 
taped to their chests, filed into the Orange Bowl Stadium a few 
days later for a memorial service. There they heard an emotional 
speech from the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Madeleine 
Albright, who warned Cuba that the U.S. would not tolerate further 
attacks against Brothers to the Rescue.
<P>
	Among other things, Albright promised: ``America will protect 
its citizens in international waters and in international skies. We 
will tighten sanctions against the Government of Cuba and we will 
deploy every diplomatic means to bring democracy to the people of 
Cuba''.
<P>
	Despite the protest from Canada and Mexico, and from many 
others around the world, the Helms-Burton bill was signed into law 
by U.S. President Clinton on March 12.
<P>
	In protest, members of the European Parliament adopted a 
resolution that urged the European Commission ``to investigate the 
effects of the extraterritorial provisions of the bill on European 
businesses''.
<P>
	The resolution also urged the EC to strongly consider 
challenging the bill as ``a serious infringement of the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, World Trade Organization rules 
and international law''.
<P>
	Not long ago, officials of some Canadian companies which 
invested in Cuba received an official notice from the U.S. 
government that they and their families would not be welcome in 
the United States.
<P>
	In the months since the Helms-Burton law was passed, debate 
has raged in Canadian newspapers regarding what Canada's 
position should be concerning Cuba and the Castro Communist 
dictatorship.
<P>
	Many people point to the fact that Canada imposed sanctions on 
South Africa and that our current foreign affairs minister, the 
member for Winnipeg South Centre, proposed that economic 
sanctions should be imposed against the Government of Nigeria.
<P>
	Others have questioned why Canada has spent so much time, 
effort and money, including most recently sending in Canadian 
troops as peacekeepers in another Caribbean country, Haiti, to try 
to make and keep the peace upon the return of ousted President 
Jean Bertrand Aristide, and yet we are willing to do nothing to help 
defeat Fidel Castro.
<P>
	Is American policy regarding Cuba so different from Canadian 
policy about Haiti? I believe the answer must be no. Nevertheless, I 
also believe it is extremely important that this House pass Bill C-54 
to bring FEMA up to date after the passage of the Helms-Burton 
bill in the United States.
<P>
	My reason is one of pure Canadian patriotism, I believe, 
although others would no doubt call it plain being ornery.
<P>
	The fact is, as a proud, certified western Canadian or, as the 
Liberals like to call us, redneck, I do not appreciate another 
country's telling Canada how to run our foreign policies. I may not 
agree with Canadian foreign policy but that is for us, this House 
and the other place representing the Canadian people to decide. 
Canadian foreign policy toward Cuba or any other nation must not 
be dictated by another country and enforced by severe penalties by 
the legislators of another country. Therefore I urge my hon. 
colleagues to join me in voting for Bill C-54.

	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.)</B> moved that Bill 
C-261, an act to require a referendum on the restoration of the 
death penalty and to amend the Referendum Act, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the hon. 
member for Prince George-Bulkley Valley.
<P>
	Let us start on this bill by being very clear about Bill C-261 is 
about and what it is not about. It does not propose directly to 
reinstate capital punishment in Canada, nor does it propose that the 
death penalty be the only penalty for first degree murder. Let us be 
really clear about that.
<P>
	It does propose that the Canadian public be asked for its opinion 
on the subject of capital punishment. Let us ask the public what it 
thinks. Canada is our country. It belongs to the people, not to a 
political elite who know better than ordinary people.
<P>
	This bill simply says ``refer this matter to the electorate'', ask 
the public what it wants. I hope that is not asking too much of our 
parliamentary system. Ask the public what it feels.
<P>
	Bill C-261 says put the question to the public in a referendum. 
So that it is not too costly it proposes that this referendum question 
be put to the public at the time of the next federal election. In this 
way at the same time that a voter casts his ballot for a member of 
Parliament the voter can also express an opinion on the capital 
punishment question. What could be easier and what could be less 
costly? Referendums themselves can be costly but this way not so.
<P>
	Let us look at the question that would be asked in such a 
referendum. It would ask simply: ``Do you agree that if a person is 
found guilty of first degree murder the judge or jury should have 
the option of sentencing the person to life imprisonment or the 
death penalty?'' It is important to understand that an option is 
available.
<P>
	Obviously if there were any doubt whatsoever about guilt, even 
after a finding of guilty, the sentencing authority would err on the 
side of caution. On the other hand, in extreme cases and where 
there is no question whatsoever of guilt, for example in the Clifford 
Olson and Bernardo cases, the sentencing authority would have the 
death penalty option available.
<P>
	Who should decide this question, our leaders, our elites or the 
people? The resistance out there to even asking the question tells 
me two things. First, our leaders  and our elites in this country do 
not trust the judgment of ordinary people. Second, the elites think 
they know best. More than that, they are absolutely convinced they 
know best.
<P>
	During the 1993 election I had many constituents in my riding of 
Nanaimo-Cowichan discuss this subject with me on their 
doorsteps. They were concerned that if elected I might go to 
Ottawa and vote my opinion on this, as other subjects, rather than 
representing them and their opinions. These constituents cited the 
case of Tommy Douglas, a distinguished parliamentarian and one 
of my predecessors as the member of Parliament for my riding.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	Apparently a survey in Nanaimo-Cowichan and the islands 
found that over 80 per cent of the electorate favoured keeping the 
death penalty. Tommy Douglas, a respected man though he was, 
returned to Ottawa and voted for the bill which eliminated the 
death penalty because it went against his conscience. 
Understandable, perhaps, but it raises the question of an MP's first 
obligation.
<P>
	That is why the Reform Party has a policy on matters of morality 
or personal conscience. Our policy is that when such questions of 
morality arise our MPs should do three things. First, whenever 
asked, advise constituents of his or her personal beliefs. Second, 
ascertain the will of the majority of the constituents on that issue. 
Third, vote to represent that majority.
<P>
	It is because of this policy that I have taken concrete measures to 
find out what the majority of my constituents wanted in this case. 
Using a tele-vote system in this last year which allowed all 
constituents to register their opinion in a secret ballot, I found that 
the majority of my constituents, and I suspect this is reflected by 
the majority across Canada, favoured the return of capital 
punishment. That expression of opinion directly to me from my 
constituents is what has led to the preparation of today's private 
member's Bill C-261. That, ladies and gentlemen, is democracy in 
action. It takes us a step closer to some direct democracy.
<P>
	There are some in the House and some in the country and some 
in my constituency who do not like the concept of direct 
democracy. Perhaps some of these do not like democracy, period. 
But I think the majority of people do.
<P>
	Let us look at the educational benefits of having a question such 
as this decided in a referendum advertised well in advance. Unlike 
the United States we do not know the date of our election. That is 
another Reform matter that we should correct. Nevertheless, we do 
know there will be an election in Canada within the next two years. 
Passage of my bill in the House would mean that the public would 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4520"> 4520 </A></B>
<P>
have an indeterminate, because of our system, but nevertheless 
substantial period of time in which to debate the merits and 
drawbacks of capital punishment.
<P>
	I address this comment to the so-called elites. Passage of my bill 
would allow them ample time to put forth their point of view. There 
is no reason for them to fear the public. Get out and tell it your 
thoughts then listen to what it has to say. They might learn 
something and the public might learn something and I think all 
would profit. The more facts or even the more opinions we have, 
the better the quality of our decisions is likely to be. Education is a 
beneficial byproduct of all referenda and specifically a benefit of 
this bill.
<P>
<B>(1345 )</B>
<P>
	The public should be heard. Let us hear the views of those totally 
opposed to capital punishment and the views of those who would 
use it too freely. The public is not stupid; it is possessed of much 
common sense. The public can hear extreme arguments and find a 
middle road position with which it is comfortable.
<P>
	It is important that this matter get to a vote. I would like at this 
point to ask for the unanimous consent of the House to have this 
bill made votable.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent to have this 
made a votable item?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Obviously there is not unanimous 
consent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> Mr. Speaker, the nays from the Liberal side of the 
House indicate the problem we have with democracy in Canada in 
1996. It is a problem we have had for a number of years. The 
Liberals are afraid of allowing the public to express its opinion. 
They are afraid of members of Parliament expressing their own 
opinions rather than the opinion handed down by their elite, by 
their whip, by those who know best within the Liberal Party who 
say: ``That is not party line. Do not vote that way''. They are afraid 
of open votes.
<P>
	I will conclude on that note. Let us leave it open. We still have a 
few more minutes for debate. I hope that those on the other side of 
the House are listening and that they open their minds a bit. It is an 
important bill for Canada and for Canadians. We know pretty much 
where the majority opinion is on this issue.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Colleagues, the hon. member for 
Nanaimo-Cowichan indicated at the outset of his remarks that he 
wished to share his time with the hon. member for Prince George 
George-Bulkley Valley. I do not believe there is a provision in our 
rules for the proposer of a private member's bill to do that. 
Therefore, it will have to be done by unanimous consent.
<P>
	Is there unanimous consent that the hon. member for 
Nanaimo-Cowichan be permitted to share his time with the hon. 
member for Prince George-Bulkley Valley?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak to this bill.
<P>
	Prior to the election in 1993 when we were going through the 
exercise of getting to know everyone, there was one thing I made 
sure I did. There was a certain number of issues which could be 
considered moral issues or personal issues. I felt the obligation as a 
candidate to ensure there was no doubt where I stood on things.
<P>
	One of the issues was the issue of capital punishment. I made it 
very clear to my constituents that I, as a candidate for the Reform 
Party, personally favoured the return of capital punishment. I told 
everyone who asked. I even made an effort to publicize it so there 
would be no confusion as to where I stood. I was elected. I was not 
elected on that issue, but on the excellent platform which was put 
forward by the Reform Party.
<P>
	At the end of the day, it is not what the member for Prince 
George-Bulkley Valley believes in which should be the main 
determining factor of how I vote in Parliament or how I debate, it 
should be that of the people who elected me.
<P>
	I have done poll after poll in my riding on various things. One of 
the polls asked the question: Would you favour a binding national 
referendum on the issue of capital punishment? In my riding 71 per 
cent said yes, 17 per cent said no and the balance was unsure. 
Seventy-one per cent said yes. It gave me a good indication that my 
constituents for the most part, a huge majority, agreed with my 
personal opinion on the subject.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	It is interesting to note that just recently I gave an interview in 
my riding. We were talking about Clifford Olson and his being able 
to apply for early parole, something the Liberals have allowed to 
happen. Let that be clear to Canadians watching today. Clifford 
Olson, this mass murderer is eligible to have a hearing on early 
parole. He is able to do this because of the Liberal government and 
the Liberal governments that preceded this government, whose 
philosophies are supported by this government and the Minister of 
Justice, and the member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce who was the 
Minister of Justice back in the government that allowed Olson to 
have this opportunity.
<P>
	Let us never forget where this Liberal government and its 
predecessors stand on the issue of crime and punishment. No 
matter what the Minister of Justice is putting through in this House 
with bill after bill that tinkers with the justice system, the Canadian 
people will not be fooled as to the philosophy of this Liberal 
government.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4521"> 4521 </A></B>
<P>
	Getting back to what I wanted to say, we were talking about 
Clifford Olson and the fact that he can apply for a hearing. I made 
the comment that if I had my way, Clifford Olson should possibly 
get a suspended sentence, like at the end of a rope. My assistant 
in my riding office said: ``You can't say that''. I said: ``Why not? 
The vast majority in my riding thinks the same way I do''. He 
asked how I knew that and I told him we would do a little test.
<P>
	A person that I knew came in and I said: ``I think you are capable 
of doing a straw poll for me this afternoon, would you do it? Just go 
out and ask people, and do it demographically-young people, 
middle aged people, older people, men, women-this question: If 
you had the opportunity to pull the lever on Clifford Olson would 
you do it? Ask it in as unbiased, non-influencing manner as you 
can''. He asked 37 people just strolling up the street. Of those 37, 
31 said yes without hesitation; four said they agreed he should be 
put to death but they did not think they could do it; and two said 
they were not too sure about that. That is consistent with the 
thinking not only in my riding but in ridings all across the country.
<P>
	This Liberal government and the Liberal and Tory governments 
before it, despite the widespread call from Canadians to give us a 
vote on this subject, have refused to allow a referendum on it. How 
can a political party that forms a government, whether it be 
Liberals or Tories, sit in this House, meet in caucus knowing that 
Canadians want an opportunity to vote on this issue and arbitrarily 
and unilaterally make the decision not to allow the vote? That is not 
democracy. That is not what this House is all about.
<P>
	I understood, and maybe the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Justice when he speaks will correct me on this, but I 
always thought that we came here to represent the people of 
Canada. I ask him if he will address the question: Do we come here 
as members of Parliament to represent the people of Canada? I 
hope he will answer that question. If that is true, if that is why we 
are here, then why do we not have a national binding referendum 
on the issue of capital punishment?
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	The Canadian people over the years have responded an average 
of 68 per cent. Polls consistently taken since the 1960s show that 
Canadians favour the death penalty. Sixty-eight per cent of the 
population on average since the 1960s have clearly indicated that 
they favour the return to capital punishment.
<P>
	A much higher percentage of the Canadian people want at least 
the opportunity to vote on it. The Liberals will not give them that 
opportunity; they will speak against this. The Tories would not give 
them that opportunity. The Liberal government before them would 
not give them that opportunity.
<P>
	We get back to the question of why they came here. Did they 
come here to support some Liberal philosophy that they have 
created on how to deal with first degree murderers who commit 
horrendous crimes? Are they here to support Liberal philosophy on 
<P>
people who kill people, on premeditated, savage murderers? Is it 
Liberal philosophy that should determine how they should be 
punished? I do not think so. This government, as previous 
governments did, has an opportunity to support this bill and see 
what the Canadian people want to do.
<P>
	In closing, I ask for unanimous consent that this bill be sent to 
the justice committee.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent that the 
proposed bill be sent to the justice committee?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There is not unanimous consent. The 
member's time has expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am very pleased to take part in the debate on Bill C-261 which is 
sponsored by the hon. member for Nanaimo-Cowichan.
<P>
	As Canadians, we regard as abhorrent and feel the pain and 
suffering that the victims' families are forced to endure. While we 
are rightly revolted by murder, the case has not been made 
effectively to demonstrate that the public interest would be served 
by restoring capital punishment for murder.
<P>
	The public policy reality is clear. Since the abolition of the death 
penalty for murder, the murder rate has gone done and not up. In 
1975 before capital punishment for murder was abolished, the 
homicide rate was at a certain level. In the years following from 
1975 until 1994, the homicide rate never rose above that base rate 
in 1975. In 1994 the homicide rate was two-thirds what it was in 
1975.
<P>
	The issue of capital punishment has been thoroughly explored at 
the national level. In many debates in this House after extensively 
debating the question of capital punishment between 1966 and 
1976, the House of Commons on a free vote adopted a bill 
abolishing capital punishment for murder in 1976.
<P>
	The most recent debate in this House took place in 1987 when 
the government of the day honoured an election commitment to 
debate the reinstatement of capital punishment. After debating the 
question at length in the House of Commons, it was decided on a 
free vote that capital punishment should not be restored.
<P>
	The arguments for and against are really no different today than 
they were in 1987. Effective arguments can easily be mounted to 
oppose the death penalty. Such arguments have been made in this 
House over the years and I do not intend to repeat many of them 
here today.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4522"> 4522 </A></B>
<P>
	Perhaps one of the most effective arguments however is the 
concern about the possibility of wrongful convictions. Anyone 
who would choose to deride this concern, to put it down, to put 
it to the side, need only be reminded of two relatively recent cases 
of significance, namely the wrongful convictions for murder of 
Donald Marshall, Jr. and Guy Paul Morin.
<P>
<B>(1400 )</B>
<P>
	Our justice system is designed by human beings, operated by 
human beings and human beings, as we know, are prone to 
mistakes and mistakes happen. Innocent people could be convicted 
and sentenced to death.
<P>
	We have these brave Reformers suggesting that we have the 
death penalty. Is one of them ready to be the first mistake? Are they 
ready to have one of their children or their spouse be the first 
mistake? I know I am not ready for that and if I am not ready for it I 
am not about to impose it on others. When you make a mistake, 
oops just does not cut it. I am sorry is not good enough.
<P>
	The hon. member for Nanaimo-Cowichan indicated that if you 
have any doubt about whether somebody committed the murder 
then do not execute them. This just shows a profound ignorance of 
the criminal law because if you have doubt that the person 
committed the murder you would not convict him in the first place.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> Do you have any doubts about Bernardo?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kirkby:</B> This is typical of the Reform Party. Mistakes 
happen when you are dealing with criminal law and I do not believe 
that the Reform Party is taking that issue very seriously.
<P>
	Reinstating capital punishment in the Criminal Code is offered 
as a panacea by the Reform Party but it is hardly that. To focus on 
capital punishment as an optional sentence for first degree murder 
and to hold a national referendum on this issue really avoids 
grappling with the larger fundamental issue of how to promote the 
protection of society.
<P>
	I want to turn my attention to the referendum issue. The bill 
proposed that a referendum on the restoration of the death penalty 
for first degree murder be held concurrently with the general 
election that next follows the coming into force of these proposals.
<P>
	Federal elections are extremely important opportunities for 
Canadians to choose and elect their representatives and their Prime 
Minister. Holding a referendum concurrently with the general 
election could detract from the importance of the federal election. 
It is therefore not a practice in Canada. As a matter of fact, there is 
no procedure in place in the Canadian electoral system for holding 
a referendum concurrently with a federal election.
<P>
	The government was elected on a platform which did not include 
the introduction of referenda concurrently  with general elections, 
nor did it include a further consideration of the issue of capital 
punishment. While referenda are an important part of Reform 
policy, our platform focused on augmenting the role of MPs as 
decision makers on questions of public policy.
<P>
	The question of participatory democracy, including referenda, 
was addressed by a Commons committee not long ago. The 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs was 
mandated by the House of Commons to study various procedural 
matters, including the examination of measures to achieve more 
direct participation by citizens including binding referenda.
<P>
	However, according to Mr. Patrick Boyer, former MP and author 
of several books on referenda who appeared before the committee, 
the referendum process should not be considered for every issue 
that comes before Parliament. Although he argued that referenda 
should be expanded to allow referenda on non-constitutional 
issues, Mr. Boyer was of the view that some transcending national 
issue which is greater than Parliament's current mandate and has 
never been discussed in previous elections should be subject to 
referendum.
<P>
	What is the real reason for the referendum? Reformers say that 
the polls tell them that Canadians want the death penalty. 
Therefore, why would they ask for a referendum if they are so 
convinced that Canadians want the death penalty? I will tell you 
what the reason is. They are not prepared to be accountable for the 
decisions taken, to stand up on their own and say I am in favour of 
the death penalty. The reason they are not prepared to do that is 
because when a mistake happens they want to sit back and blame 
the Canadian public, play Pontius Pilate, wash their hands and say 
you asked for Barabbas. They want to sit here and say: ``You voted 
for it, Canadian public. The mistake, the innocent person who has 
just had his life shortened is not our responsibility''. We on this 
side of the House are prepared to take our responsibilities seriously. 
I would suggest that they not hide behind this sham of a referendum 
they are putting forward. If they want to change in the Criminal 
Code to include the death penalty, let them have the guts to stand 
up here and do it in this House.
<P>
<B>(1405)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a short point of order. I believe 
that the parliamentary secretary inadvertently used the 
unparliamentary term ``guts'' in referring to the Reformers and I 
would like him to retract that.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I do not believe the word ``guts'' is an 
unparliamentary word. I have not checked recently but I am quite 
certain that word is not on the list. If the hon. member for Elk 
Island, who is a fine scholar, could find the word ``guts'' as having 
been found unparliamentary before, I will be very pleased if he 
would. In the meantime we will carry on with the debate.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4523"> 4523 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as a matter of fact, I do agree with the government on this 
point. The death penalty is indeed an issue, a decision one must 
ponder very seriously.
<P>
	There are, however, many other very important issues. If we 
were to apply the principle developed by the Reform Party, should 
the government consult the public via a referendum on every 
important issue? For instance, abortion is a very important issue. 
Does the Reform Party favour a referendum on abortion? Does the 
Reform Party also want a referendum on how to reduce the deficit, 
on peacekeeping missions we are taking part in?
<P>
	Speaking of democracy, I believe that the voice of democracy 
was heard in 1993, and will be heard again during the next federal 
election. During an election campaign, we are asked what we think 
of a given topic. I remember very well that constituents would 
question me on the death penalty, in 1993, asking me: ``Are you for 
or against the death penalty, Mr. Bellehumeur?'' My answer was: 
``No, I am not in favour of the death penalty''. And I would then 
explain why I oppose this concept. And yet, constituents in my 
riding of Berthier-Montcalm voted for me. Therefore, today, I am 
in a position to rise and speak on behalf of my constituents on 
issues such as the death penalty.
<P>
	We do not have to hold a referendum on every issue on which we 
believe that the public may have a different view or, as the Liberal 
member mentioned, simply to wash our hands of it. We have been 
given the mandate, each one of us in our respective riding, to 
represent our constituents and express the opinion which we 
believe to be the majority's.
<P>
	The Reform's approach in several areas, including capital 
punishment, is, I believe, very simplistic. Once again, this past 
week, we saw Reform members choose the easiest way out. They 
do not like Bloc members, they find them too vocal, too intrusive, 
so they would like to take away their official opposition status.
<P>
	This past week, we heard them talk about dangerous offenders. 
They want to leave them in prison as long as possible, to let them 
rot in there. No matter what the minister suggests to strengthen the 
law, it is never enough for Reform members, they always demand 
more.
<P>
	Their attitude is the same in the case of young offenders. They do 
not know what to do with them, so they say: Let let us change the 
Young Offenders Act so that the age limit will be nine or ten. That 
is the easy way out. The same goes for first degree murders. What 
would be the easiest thing to do? Restore the death penalty to get 
rid of first degree murderers as quickly as possible.
<P>
	The purpose of Bill C-261 before us is not to determine whether 
we are for or against the death penalty.
<P>
<B>(1410)</B>
<P>
	All the Reform speeches I have heard show clearly that members 
of that party are for capital punishment. It is said very clearly, but 
they will not come right out sand say so.
<P>
	If we consider the whole issue of the death penalty closely, we 
have to admit that, in 1975-1976, when Parliament studied the 
question, it made the right decision and chose to abolish capital 
punishment as many other countries have done throughout the 
years. Several countries have abolished the death penalty and have 
come to some conclusions.
<P>
	Earlier, the parliamentary secretary read out some statistics, and 
yes, the figures are very positive. I have here a very comprehensive 
study, conducted between 1985 and 1996, which shows that, in 
Canada, after the death penalty was abolished, homicide, murder, 
manslaughter and infanticide decreased by 20 per cent. Therefore, 
those who think that the restoration of the death penalty will reduce 
the number of murders and other similar horrible crimes are wrong. 
That is for Canada.
<P>
	If we look at statistics for France, in the eighties, that country 
also abolished capital punishment and the figures there are similar. 
It is not because the death penalty can be imposed that crimes will 
automatically decrease and vice versa.
<P>
	What I often hear from Reform members and all those who 
advocate a return to capital punishment is the famous theory of 
deterrence, but it does not hold with the numbers we have before 
us.
<P>
	We also talked about the risks of convicting innocent people and 
involuntarily putting them in the electric chair or some other 
method of ending it all. This is one aspect must also consider. As 
regards the inequality of justice, we need only look at what is 
happening in the United States to realize that, when it comes to the 
electric chair, justice is not necessarily the same for the rich and the 
poor.
<P>
	The rich can afford lawyers and a multitude of legal experts to 
avoid the electric chair, while the most powerless before the system 
are even more powerless and, quite often, cannot present a fair 
defence, a defence that a rich person could have presented.
<P>
	One point that surprised me is the uncertainty a return to capital 
punishment would bring out in the justice system, and perhaps 
Reform members do not know that. Again, when capital 
punishment was abolished in 1960 and 1976, it was realized that its 
abolition had a direct effect on the conviction rate.
<P>
	Again according to statistics from Statistics Canada and experts, 
I will read to you what one of them, a certain Mr. Mackenzie, has to 
say. He says that in Canada, between 1960 and 1974, when capital  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4524"> 4524 </A></B>
<P>
punishment was in force, the conviction rate for a first degree 
murder was below 10 per cent and, after capital punishment was 
abolished, it increased to 20 per cent between 1976 and 1982, the 
study period.
<P>
	Why? Because the jury that hears the case knows that, if it 
decides that Mr. X is guilty or that Mr. X has committed a murder, 
he faces hanging, the electric chair or whatever. The members of 
the jury want proof beyond a reasonable doubt and even more, so 
that they often have a slight doubt about the individual before them 
who could be sentenced to death.
<P>
<B>(1415)</B>
<P>
	If the accused faced only a minimum sentence of 25 years, they 
would say that he was guilty, but with capital punishment hanging 
over him, they have doubts. They then decide that a unanimous 
verdict is impossible and the accused is set free.
<P>
	The numbers are there. Without capital punishment the 
conviction rate is 20 per cent, compared to 10 per cent with capital 
punishment. These figures must be considered. Obviously one does 
not launch a philosophical debate across Canada before a federal 
election without looking at these figures beforehand, without 
realizing-unless they are completely irresponsible, which I do not 
think is the case-that they did not consider these things before 
launching this debate, before asking the government to hold a 
referendum on this issue in the next federal election.
<P>
	If not, I urge them to do so. At some point we get into a vicious 
circle. The more we complain about a bad situation, the worse it 
gets. The more we talk about the murder rate, the higher it seems. 
We are creating a kind of public panic for no good reason. Yes, 
murders and other horrible crimes are being committed, but I think 
that the people of Quebec and Canada do not lean to the right as 
much as the Reform Party does.
<P>
	Reform members often claim to represent Mr. or Mrs. So-and-So 
who has gone through the terrible ordeal of losing his or her child 
and demands that the death penalty be reinstated.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to talk about Isabelle Bolduc, who was in 
the news over the summer. She was murdered by a killer on parole. 
But her father, Mr. Bolduc, clearly came out against capital 
punishment. He is working to improve rehabilitation and social 
reintegration for inmates.
<P>
	The problem may not be with capital punishment itself. The 
problem may be with the enforcement of the current regulations. 
That is what I want to say to the Reform Party today. I do not think 
most of the people listening to us in western Canada share the 
views of Reform members. I am convinced that only a minority 
think the way Reformers do on this issue.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Elk Island has 
brought a citation from Beauchesne's to my attention that the 
expression ``has not got the guts'' was found in May, 1959 not to be 
parliamentary. That is almost 30 years ago. He would have an 
excellent point but for the fact that he was not in his seat when he 
made the point.
<P>
	The good point would appear to be cancelled out by the fact that 
he was not in his seat. We will all, no doubt, take note of the fact 
that there is a citation, as only a teacher can remember, in 
Beauchesne's.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, from my 
understanding of the ruling, I cannot use the word ``guts'' in my 
speech. Is that true? Because it would fit nicely in my speech as I 
address some of the points we have heard from the other side.
<P>
	I rise today in support of my colleague's bill, the member for 
Nanaimo-Cowichan, private member's Bill C-261. Bill C-261 is 
about giving Canadians an opportunity to voice their opinion on 
one of the most contentious issues in Canadian history, the use of 
the death penalty for first degree murder.
<P>
	It is strange for me to hear my colleague from the Bloc who just 
addressed the House say he is in favour of the democratic process 
in their referendums, where the direction and the guidance and the 
operation of the country is done by the will of a majority when it 
comes to electing him to his seat in the House. But after he is 
elected to his seat in the House he is saying to 69 per cent of the 
people who are opting for a referendum or opting for a second look 
at the death penalty: ``You do not know what is in your own best 
interests, so you are going to have to trust me''. That is what the 
member from the Liberal side has been saying.
<P>
<B>(1420 )</B>
<P>
	They are saying to the people of Canada: ``You know what is in 
your best interest when you elect me to the House, but after that, on 
issues like capital punishment or other issues that impact on the 
individual from a moral point of view, you have to leave those 
decisions to me because I know what is best for you. You do not 
know what is best for you, your family, your community or your 
nation. That has to be left to the elites like us''. That is what this 
member is saying and that is what the Bloc member has been 
saying.
<P>
	I do not want to focus my comments on the point of capital 
punishment. I do not want to take up any more time of the House 
debating the pros and cons of capital punishment. I chose today to 
focus on the issue of democracy because this is the essence of my 
colleague's private member's Bill C-261.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4525"> 4525 </A></B>
<P>
	Bill C-261 is an act to require a referendum on the restoration of 
the death penalty and to amend the Referendum Act. I support the 
use of national  referendums to determine the will of the majority 
on issues of a moral or contentious nature. If the Liberal 
government believed in democracy, if it truly believed the majority 
rules in this country, it would support the use of national 
referendums and support this private member's bill.
<P>
	Liberal members would put aside their Liberal philosophies and 
personal biases regarding the use of the death penalty and they 
would allow Canadians through this democratic means to decide 
the fate of first degree murderers.
<P>
	The definition of democracy contained in the <I>Gage Canadian 
Dictionary</I> is not unlike those found in most other dictionaries:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>1) a government that is periodically elected and thus controlled by the people who 
live under it. Under a democracy, the people rule either by direct vote at public 
meetings or indirectly through the election of certain representatives to govern them;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>2) the ideals and principles of such a government, such as equality of rights and 
opportunities and the rule of the majority;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	A democracy is formed by the will of the majority, not by 
minorities, special interest groups or lobby groups. The majority 
elects a government to establish laws and programs that protect the 
lives and property, the liberties and the freedoms of all its citizens.
<P>
	The greatest guarantee to the individual of these fundamental 
rights and freedoms is found in the expressed will of a well 
educated and informed majority.
<P>
	Historically, these characteristics have formed the strongest 
stabilizing force within society. A group of nations, supported by 
their majorities, freed the world of the Nazi regime which denied 
millions their liberties, their freedoms and their very rights to live 
and own property.
<P>
	It was the will of a majority of Americans who demanded 
Afro-Americans have the freedom to vote over the objection of a 
minority. It was a host of nations, supported again by their 
majorities, that turned back the dictator Saddam Hussein.
<P>
	Although history may provide exceptions, the greatest violations 
of fundamental human rights have occurred at the hands of 
minority groups and elite groups like those represented by the 
voice over here. It has been nations governed by majority rule that 
have established and maintained to the greatest degree the 
fundamental rights of the individual.
<P>
	The leader of the federal Tories ignored the determination of his 
youth delegates on the question of capital punishment at their 
recent convention. The Reform Party believes this issue must be 
decided by the majority of Canadians in a free and open vote after 
all aspects have been fully debated.
<P>
	Our method is democratic. The Tory leader's method is not. 
Neither is the method of the Liberal Party so far heard expressed 
today in this debate.
<P>
	The top down, autocratic leadership displayed by the Tory leader 
and by this government is what gave rise to the Reform Party of 
Canada in the first place and is the type of leadership that leads to a 
violation of fundamental human rights.
<P>
	The previous Tory-Liberal governments' undemocratic form of 
leadership has plunged our country into a $600 billion debt hole. 
This debt has been created, at least in part, by the establishment of 
grants and programs aimed at special interest groups without the 
consent of the majority.
<P>
	The greatest threat to our social and economic stability of our 
families, individuals and our nation is the unlimited power of 
government to tax away our property and our wealth without our 
consent.
<P>
<B>(1425 )</B>
<P>
	The issue of Quebec sovereignty dominates in the provincial 
legislature to their economic detriment. The Bloc keep pressing the 
issue in the House despite the fact that the majority was heard, 
despite the fact that referendums on Quebec separation produced a 
no vote not once, but twice.
<P>
	The reinstatement of capital punishment cannot be determined 
by the Liberal government alone. We know only too well whose 
side the Liberals are on in this contentious debate on capital 
punishment. We know whose side they are on in the debate on Bill 
C-45.
<P>
	Unlike the Reform Party, the Liberal government and the leader 
of the Tory party are not on the side of the murder victims and their 
families. The Liberal government is on the side of the killers. This 
was evident in its opposition to the private member's bill repealing 
section 745 and in its support of Bill C-45 which continues to grant 
first degree murderers an avenue for early release.
<P>
	This was never more obvious than it was yesterday when the 
parliamentary secretary accused us of exploiting the families of 
murder victims, which, as I said in the House yesterday, was 
beneath contempt. The hon. member for Prince Albert-Churchill 
River accused us of exploiting the families of murder victims for 
political purposes. He said: ``The Reform are always interested in 
talking about the effects on the victims''. Yes, we are always 
interested in talking about the devastating effects of murder on the 
families of murder victims. We have a duty and a responsibility in 
talking about the horrifying trauma of victims' families knowing 
their son's or daughter's killer may be released early as a result of 
section 745.
<P>
	I will have the hon. member and his colleagues know that I have 
been contacted by families of murder victims.  They have thanked 
<P>

<B><A NAME="4526"> 4526 </A></B>
<P>
me and all colleagues in the House for telling their painful stories 
to Canadians and what section 745 means to them; for telling 
Canadians how section 745, the Liberal made glimmer of hope for 
the most sadistic people in our society, has made them relive their 
nightmares.
<P>
	If the hon. member for Prince Albert-Churchill River and his 
Liberal colleagues do not want to talk about the victims, if they 
want to remain in their ivory towers, oblivious to the real pain and 
suffering which is occurring in the country, then so be it. We will 
remain in touch with the people, the people's feelings and their 
concerns.
<P>
	In closing I say this: The reinstatement of capital punishment 
ought not to be determined by the House, a handful of politicians; it 
should only be determined by a majority of Canadians. This is the 
nature of democracy, a majority rule, which most citizens have no 
difficulty whatever in understanding.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first let me say that it gives me great pleasure to stand in 
support of private member's Bill C-261.
<P>
	I listened to the parliamentary secretary say that we did not have 
enough intestinal fortitude to stand to say that we are in favour of 
capital punishment. I am in favour of capital punishment for 
certain crimes and I am proud to say that. What I am not proud of is 
a government which refuses to give the Canadian people a say on 
this. I am not proud of that. That is lack of intestinal fortitude on 
that side of the House, not on this side of the House.
<P>
	When the parliamentary secretary stands up and says such 
things, I think of the hypocritical people who are involved. The 
hypocrisy has never been so great. Bill C-261 is not about my 
personal opinion; it is not about their personal opinions. It is an 
opportunity to give the Canadian people a say which will be 
binding on the government. It is a say for the Canadian people.
<P>
	If I had my way I would say capital punishment right now. But 
not this good government. Not this caring, sharing government that 
only worries about self-preservation and its pension plan. No, not 
this government. The Canadian people can stay out there and be 
told nothing but what the government wants them to hear. It will 
twist the facts. It will twist the statistics. It will come up with 
numbers that mean absolutely nothing in the real world.
<P>
	The worst of it is, there are many members on that side who 
think the very same as we on this side but they are being controlled 
from within. It is politics of the lowest degree in a country that is 
supposed to be democratically ruled. When we do not allow our 
populace to have a say in such matters, when we keep on shutting 
our eyes and letting our folks walk the streets in  fear because we 
have a government that has no intestinal fortitude to give the 
people a say, it is a disgrace.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	Members can sit there with smiles on their faces. Sooner or later 
the people of Canada will have their say. I hope it is sooner rather 
than later.
<P>
	This is good legislation. It should have been deemed votable. 
Government members can sit there and smirk all they want and 
say: ``No, not us. We won't give the people a say in this because we 
are here to rule. We are here to rule the people''. That is their 
agenda. They have lost the common sense of what government is 
supposed to be about. I am sorry the government has lost that. Like 
the Conservatives before them and the Liberals before the 
Conservatives, they think they are here to rule with an iron fist and 
say: ``You will do what we wish and not what you wish we would 
do to govern properly''. I find that outrageous.
<P>
	The Liberals stand here time after time and say: ``We listen to 
the people''. Hogwash. If they truly represented the people they 
would at least allow them a voice on this issue. It is not up to 
members of Parliament to force their morality on the people. It is 
up to the people to force their morality on us. Sooner or later 
Liberal members might learn that.
<P>
	You are just a hired peon in this place. You are hired by the 
taxpayers. You are hired to represent their wishes and their 
demands. You can say you are elected. They pay your wages, do not 
ever forget that-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. The hon. member, like all 
hon. members, will please address his remarks to the Chair, not to 
you on the opposite side or on his own side.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker, you are right.
<P>
	Members in this Chamber are hired. They are no better than 
anybody else who walks the street out there. The taxpayers pay our 
wages to represent them, not our wishes. That is where this 
government and governments before have gone wrong. It is time 
the taxpayers of this country demanded that politicians listen to 
what their concerns are. We are sick and tired of it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> We have a $600 billion debt.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> That is right. We have a $600 billion debt. We look 
after the criminals far better than we do the victims. It is a real 
shame. I know in other countries what would happen to politicians 
who think that they are better than the people.
<P>
	Private members' business is something where a lot of members 
go to a lot of work trying to bring a bill before this House which the 
government is not going to address. Our biggest mistake in private 
members' business is not allowing all bills drawn to be deemed 
votable. Let us get rid of the politics in private members' business.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="4527"> 4527 </A></B>
<P>
	Bill C-261 is living proof that when we came here one of our 
commitments was that we would give referendums to the people 
and we would abide by the people's decisions. That was a Reform 
commitment. Members of the government ask: ``How can you do 
that?'' They believe they are far smarter than the people and they 
are so wrong.
<P>
	When we came here after we were elected we all had these 
ideals. Somehow it has been beaten out of them on the other side 
and beaten out badly. They should remember. They still have to 
look at themselves in the mirror when they shave in the morning. I 
sometimes wonder how they can do it when they allow the things to 
go on in this country that they have.
<P>
	The right to give a referendum to the Canadian people always 
seems to be on the agenda. This is not the first time it has come 
before this House, nor will it be the last, until finally they are given 
their wish and they are allowed to vote on this. I hope this 
government at least gives them that right in the coming federal
