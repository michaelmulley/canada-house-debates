	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ) </B>moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House denounce the government for its massive cuts to the 
unemployment insurance system that limit access to the program and hit young 
people, women, seasonal workers and immigrants hard.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, it is with a sense of pride and with the 
greatest determination that I table this motion this morning. The 
official opposition is outraged by the fact that women, seasonal 
workers, newcomers, any person who is not already on the labour 
market and all those who are forced to look for work on what is 
called the new job market are dealt a direct blow by this UI reform, 
which was so long in coming and which the government did not see 
fit to make public before the Quebec referendum. In short, it hits 
anyone who does not have a secure job that pays reasonably well. 
We know that such jobs are becoming increasingly rare.
<P>
	That makes a lot of people. One thing is sure, within just a few 
years, hundreds of thousands of Canadians and Quebecers will be 
affected. For the hon. members' information, I should mention 
that, each year, one third of the workforce in Quebec relies on one 
form or another of UI assistance. Now this inequitable reform hits 
directly anyone who is not already a player in the system, any new 
player who might need the kind of collective support provided by a 
real UI program, as opposed to a bogus program.
<P>
	From now on, the first time someone apply for UI benefits, he or 
she will be required to have worked 26 weeks, 35 hours a week, 
over the previous 52 weeks to be eligible. Anyone who knows 
anything about the labour market knows how hard it is to meet 
these requirements. Anyone who has a child, brother, sister, mother 
or friend who is a newcomer knows how terribly difficult it is to 
meet these requirements in the world we live in.
<P>
	Seventy per cent of all part time jobs are held by women. And 40 
per cent of them are held by young men and women. In the future, 
910 hours of work will be required to qualify, or 26 thirty-five hour 
weeks, instead of 20 fifteen hour weeks. Let us look at what 910 
hours of work mean.
<P>
	Someone who works part time 15 hours a week can quite simply 
not meet the requirement over the year. It would take this person 60 
weeks, but there are only 52 in a year. On the other hand, if 
someone works part time 17.5 hours a week, by the end of the year, 
he or she could qualify. These figures show the scope of the 
change. This is a major change.
<P>
	In fact, as I said earlier, many women, young people and 
newcomers will be excluded. The government boasts that an 
additional 500,000 people will be covered by the UI system. This is 
a reference to all the workers who, until now, did not pay premiums 
and consequently were not eligible to UI benefits, because they did 
not work more than 15 hours per week.
<P>
	The truth is that, given the prerequisite, this measure, which, in 
other times, might have been an improvement, will in fact force 
these people to pay premiums, without actually being eligible to UI 
benefits.
<P>
	From now on, there will be two groups: those in the system and 
those out of it. This will create yet another obstacle for those who 
are excluded and who will often have to fall back on social 
assistance. Eligibility for UI benefits, when one is in the system, 
will also be based on a number of weeks of employment, which 
will vary from region to region. The minimum required will be 12 
weeks in regions with a high rate of unemployment. In Montreal, it 
is currently 14 weeks. So, under the new system, a Montrealer will 
have to work 14 thirty-five hour weeks, instead of 14 fifteen hour 
weeks.
<P>
<B>(1010)</B>
<P>
	What does this mean in the case of all the new short term 
positions and part time jobs? It means that it will take these 
workers longer to qualify. It also means reduced benefits, since it 
will take longer to qualify, but the entitlement period will 
ultimately be shorter.
<P>
	Once again, this is somewhat like a sure ticket, not to British 
Columbia, but to the welfare rolls. It must be understood, by the 
way, that the fact that this reform was carried out without any 
consideration whatsoever of the social assistance or other programs 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17426"> 17426 </A></B>
<P>
already in place has  resulted in a system that is not better adjusted 
and co-ordinated than before, but in some ways worse than before.
<P>
	For those who do not have jobs as stable as the hon. members 
here-relatively stable at least, for five years-we need to realize 
that life is not easy. Finding a real job is extremely difficult. This is 
the case whether a person has an education or not. I know 
numerous teachers with two master's degrees and a Ph. D. who are 
still muddling along as best they can, and have had to be on 
unemployment insurance temporarily in the past. Now they will no 
longer be eligible.
<P>
	The same is true for all those who are term employees. New jobs, 
even in the technology field, jobs with the Internet, in the graphics 
field and so on, are contracts for X weeks, often not very many. The 
person may make good money, but after that it dries up and another 
job is hard to find. That is how the job market is structured.
<P>
	These measures before us, however, instead of being tailored to 
the new job market, do nothing more than to take unemployment 
insurance back to the days when a person had a good job and a good 
boss, but expected a cycle of layoffs from time to time. Then 
unemployment insurance was around to fill the gap.
<P>
	This reform reintroduces, in another disguise, the two tier 
unemployment insurance scheme that had all of Canada up in arms 
during consultations on the so-called social program reform. 
Everyone, including the committee formed by the minister 
specifically for this, was against it.
<P>
	Now, with the penalty for ``frequent users'' as they are termed, a 
penalty which creates two types of unemployment ``pay'', 
depending on whether a person is one of the lucky ones with stable 
jobs-they have put effort into it too, but luck also enters into 
it-or one of the unlucky ones who have not managed to have 
stable employment, there will be two levels of benefits. Two levels, 
when all is said and done: 50 and 55 per cent. That means that there 
is constant pressure in favour of decreasing the general level of 
benefits, each year heading us closer to the U.S. level of 50 per cent 
of the industrial wage.
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	This is a regressive reform, that is to say instead of removing the 
limit on contributions so that people with high salaries, or those 
who do overtime, may help provide a bridge for those workers who 
are less fortunate-there was some suggestion of raising that 
ceiling in the other so-called reform of 1994-instead of going 
ahead with this, the government is backing away. This is even 
contrary to what the minister has said, in claiming it was a 
progressive step. The government is bringing the limit for 
contributions down to $39,000 per annum. Above that no more is 
paid into unemployment insurance.
<P>
	This has a serious economic effect. Let me tell hon. members 
right off that it is anti-employment. How so? This measure will hit 
workers and businesses in the so-called labour intensive sector. 
There will be a reduction in unemployment insurance premiums 
but also in the solidarity that unemployment insurance provides, 
since labour intensive businesses which pay high wages will still 
have an incentive to make their employees work overtime instead 
of hiring additional workers.
<P>
	That is not the only regressive aspect of this measure. There is 
more. Listen to this. The only tax reduction allowed by the 
government benefits businesses and employees earning a salary of 
more than $39,000. Until now, they had to pay unemployment 
insurance premiums but from now on that will no longer be the 
case. They stand to benefit from a tax reduction that will cost how 
much? $900 million. It will cost the unemployment insurance 
account $900 million. So who is going to make up the shortfall? 
Workers paying premiums for the first time. I did not say first time 
UI recipients but first time contributors. From now on, UI 
premiums will be paid on every hour worked.
<P>
	I explained earlier that this did not mean automatic eligibility. 
Far from it. But it does mean they will have to pay, those 500,000 
or so who are going to pay starting with the very first hour worked. 
Students who could be exempted previously will have to pay 
regardless and will not get their money back until they file their 
income tax return. People who earn less than $2,000 will get the 
money back when they file their return. Yes, it is easier to 
administrate but it does not make things easier for Joe Blow.
<P>
	So a tax reduction for people earning more than $39,000, and for 
the others a tax increase that will kick in from the very first dollar 
earned. This is a very regressive measure.
<P>
	And there is more. I did not mention annualization. What that 
means? It means that from now on, a young person who has a 
two-month design contract worth $10,000 will pay premiums on 
the full amount, but if he gets nothing else in that year, he is not 
eligible for unemployment insurance, although he paid the full 
premium on $10,000. Great. You know how much this will put into 
the UI account? One billion dollars. That is what senior officials 
came out and told us at our briefing session.
<P>
	So we can hardly call this reform employment insurance. 
Despite the announced employment benefits, it is the kind of 
insurance that will ensure that an increasing number of people will 
have no other recourse than to go on welfare.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunez: </B>It is poverty insurance.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde: </B>We could call it poverty insurance, and in the 
case of first time workers, that may well be the case.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17427"> 17427 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	Furthermore, in addition to the term employment benefits being 
a misnomer, they will merely replace a number of active measures 
that were given rather short thrift. They still exist but with a 
difference. Instead of being paid out of the general tax account, 
benefits will now be paid out of the unemployment insurance 
account.
<P>
	So the additional money that will be taken out of the pockets of 
the unemployed and businesses and workers earning less than 
$39,000 will be used to pay these new employment benefits but, 
instead of coming out of the general account, they will come out of 
the unemployment insurance account.
<P>
	The official opposition will do everything in its power to stop 
this reform.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde: </B>Yes, Mr. Speaker, we are going through difficult 
economic times. And that is why people with some economic 
imagination ought to know where the cuts should be made. They 
should not be made at the expense of the average citizen who is 
having enough trouble surviving as it is. There are many people 
having trouble keeping their heads above water. Unemployment 
insurance is supposed to be a life preserver. However, instead of 
helping people to survive-I am not saying the present system is 
perfect-the proposed reform is based on the wrong economic 
premise: it is anti-employment. It will generate insecurity and 
poverty.
<P>
	As for those described as abusing the system, one thing must be 
said-and this is something we learned from the economists long 
ago-no system can be set up without this happening, unless 
considerable thought is given to the way it will be used. Those who 
do not abuse the system will, as we say, get it in the neck.
<P>
	It is not surprising this measure was not revealed before the 
Quebec referendum. I would add, however, that workers in the 
Maritimes are also hit hard. I will say one thing, and I will repeat 
and repeat it: the approach of this government is to cut the number 
of workers in the labour market where jobs are not stable. It has 
nothing to do with the workers and everything to do with the labour 
market.
<P>
	Instead of looking for the economic means to transform the 
labour market, the government is penalizing people, particularly 
those people who live in the Maritimes and Quebec. Quebec is 
being further penalized because it has a bigger population. The 
announced cuts of $640 million are added on to the $735 million in 
cuts to be made this year and next.
<P>
	Even taking into account the supposed existing active measures, 
which will, under this program, this so-called reform, now come 
out of the unemployment insurance account, even here there are 
cuts of $400 million in addition to the $735 million. This means 
more than a  billion dollars in cuts for Quebec, not to mention the 
billions also cut in the Atlantic provinces.
<P>
	When the labour market fails to provide a job for everyone, 
people are not punished. What suffers is the economy and the 
development we are trying to work on.
<P>
	Yes, Mr. Speaker, I will stop now, but I promise that, though I 
stop now, I will continue to talk about this reform and do 
everything I can to block it. It makes no sense for a country like 
Quebec and for a country like Canada.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I was glad to hear the hon. member conclude her remarks by saying 
she had a lot more to say. That was certainly my hope because I did 
not hear very much that was worth noting.
<P>
	I have a problem understanding how a member of Parliament 
who was a very active member of the human resources 
development committee in which witnesses continually stated to us 
that they wanted a change to the status quo, could comment to the 
House of Commons that she still believes in the status quo. She still 
believes in the system which Canadians from coast to coast, 
particularly those who are unemployed, have told us is not 
working. It is simply unbelievable that at this stage of the debate 
the hon. member would not come up with any proposals that would 
speak to the modernization and restructuring of the Unemployment 
Insurance Act.
<P>
	It is also quite fascinating how the member and her party have 
spent the past two years advocating separatism. They have 
advocated the notion that Quebec on its own could actually be a 
more functional society but for some reason or other they have not 
mentioned that this type of political instability has resulted in job 
losses in this country. They do not talk about that because they are 
too busy trying to pretend they are the defenders of the less 
fortunate in our society.
<P>
	The hon. member also does not talk about the fact that 100,000 
jobs will be created as a result of the employment insurance 
changes the Minister of Human Resources Development tabled last 
Friday. She does not talk about that because it is good news. She 
cannot relate to positive change in people's lives.
<P>
	There are also some things she omits, such as the family income 
supplement where people with dependents will be able to earn up to 
80 per cent of average earnings. She does not talk about that 
because it speaks to helping people. It speaks to giving greater 
income security for people while at the same time providing them 
with the tools required to find work.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17428"> 17428 </A></B>
<P>
	She also does not talk about the progressive measures that 
anyone can access. The five tools of the human resources 
investment fund were outlined by the minister. Those who have 
had an attachment to unemployment insurance in the past three 
years, UI exhaustees who were marginalized and were excluded 
by the unemployment insurance program, will now be part of that.
<P>
	The hon. member does not want to hear the truth. She does not 
want to hear that we have worked very hard to build a better 
system. Bloc members do not want to hear the good news because 
their agenda is that they do not want success in this country. They 
want to break up the country. That is the reason.
<P>
	Canadians need to face the facts. They need to face the truth 
about who is sitting in front of us: separatists who are not willing to 
accept the fact that the employment insurance bill means positive 
change to people's lives; it means people will be given the 
opportunities to acquire the skills to re-enter the workforce. Bloc 
members do not want to hear that.
<P>
	In reference to sustaining the unemployment insurance program, 
a program that has grown from $8 billion to $18 billion in less than 
a decade, any rational human being will say that we simply cannot 
sustain the type of skyrocketing costs this program has put on the 
taxpayers, the employers and employees of this country. Those are 
the facts of life.
<P>
	It is a real shame that the Bloc Quebecois separatists cannot 
come to grips with reality as we get ready for the 21st century. 
They do not talk about the premium relief that is being given to 
employers and employees. They do not want to talk about that 
because it is good news. They do not want this bill. They do not 
want the new employment insurance bill to work. That would mean 
that Canada works. They have no interest in telling Canadians we 
are improving their quality of life. It is a real shame they cannot 
intellectually cope with the type of positive changes that are being 
implemented.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	My question is fundamental. Is the hon. member really serious 
when she says that the employment insurance bill is completely 
flawed? Why did she omit reference to the progressive measures 
which exist in the bill? Why did she do that? Is this part and parcel 
of the separatist plot?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would first say that, had the 
government tabled its bill on unemployment insurance before the 
referendum, you might not have had the displeasure of having to 
tell us we are bothering you.
<P>
	You did not dare, because all the improvements you are talking 
about are largely, and I underscore the word, eyewash. Sure, there 
are measures, and I mentioned them, but I did not mention the case 
of insurance, which  is supposed to be unemployment insurance, 
which is taking on airs of family policy and is out of touch with 
need.
<P>
	Furthermore, I-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bevilacqua:</B> What is your point?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Had you read our minority report, you would 
have seen that we had a point and you would have understood that, 
if the government had removed the ceiling for benefits, it could 
have cut contributions further for all business, including small and 
medium business, which creates jobs.
<P>
	Instead, the government chose to go with high salary employees 
and business, big business and high tech and capital business. So it 
could have helped create jobs, instead of having the imagination 
and the courage to create conditions to cut contributions without 
reducing the account.
<P>
	So, instead, it opted for a position that leaves contributions high, 
reducing them five cents per $100. Really, for small and medium 
business this means nothing and for big business and high salary 
employees it means they no longer contribute to the common good.
<P>
	I conclude by saying that the surplus in the unemployment 
insurance account is a hidden tax for those earning less than 
$39,000. They will have to pay a tax, which we might call a 
``special deficit reduction tax on workers earning under $39,000''. 
It would be the truth. This is where the truth lies, in our opinion.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I find it very interesting that it has taken the hon. member 
for North York two years to figure out that there are separatists 
sitting in the House. I congratulate him.
<P>
	Since the change in government in Quebec has unemployment 
gone up that drastically? From her speech I take it that it is running 
rampant in Quebec under the separatist government.
<P>
	I have listened to members opposite saying what a good job the 
government has done in addressing the unemployment problem. 
All the investigations I have done indicate that the greatest 
employment has been created through patronage appointments.
<P>
	There are two different seats of power in the country. I have not 
seen much of a difference in the unemployment rates. Young 
people in Canada are still searching for jobs. That has not been 
addressed. They say this tinkering will help. Since I have been here 
in Parliament I have noticed that when the government tinkers with 
programs, usually the situation gets worse.

<HR>

<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	My question to you is: What is the unemployment rate now in 
Quebec and what was it before the separatist government took 
over?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I ask all hon. members to please address 
their remarks through the Chair rather than to each other directly.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, I regret to inform the hon. member 
that the unemployment rate has dropped since the separatist 
government came to office. I also want to tell my hon. colleague 
that the history of poverty in Quebec is one of the main factors that, 
in the 1960s, made not-so-young people like myself worry about 
the fate of Quebec in Canada.
<P>
	I know that it would take much more time than I have to respond 
to this, but if my hon. colleague is interested, I would be delighted 
to show him that, as you saw during the referendum campaign, 
there is in Quebec an important consensus among the 
disadvantaged, the workers, the social forces that are progressive 
but largely in favour of sovereignty, because many people-it went 
up to 49.4 per cent, as you saw-feel that the only way they can 
improve their lot is by taking control of their own destiny.
<P>
	We know that the economic situation in Quebec has major 
advantages but also disadvantages that we want to deal with. We 
want to emphasize our assets. We want to work on eliminating our 
problems and we feel frustrated by government policies that do not 
meet our expectations in any way.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. In recognition of the way the Minister of Human Resources 
Development has been treating B.C. over the changes to the 
welfare rules, I would like to ask for the unanimous consent of the 
House, on behalf of the North Vancouver Riding Association, for 
me to present to the minister at this time its annual 1995 horse's ass 
award-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. I do not think that is a point 
of order. Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There is not unanimous consent.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate that the antics 
of a clown are allowed sometimes in the House.
<P>
	In reading the motion brought by the member for Mercier and 
listening to her remarks, I am reminded of the old line of Winston 
Churchill's that ``a fanatic is  one who can't change his mind and 
won't change the subject''.
<P>
	What we have seen today is the ultimate act of fanaticism. It 
showed a total lack of touch with reality, a total distortion of the 
facts and a total unwillingness to agree to an exchange of 
reasonable dialogue or exchange of views. It is a closed mind, a 
reactionary mind and in many cases a misinformed mind.
<P>
	That is unfortunate when one begins to talk about one of the 
most important and significant changes addressed in this House. 
The hon. member for Mercier seems incapable of dealing with 
legislation on its merits, on its measures, on its proposals but 
instead relies on the old rhetoric, the old speeches, the old lines 
without being in touch of reality whatsoever.
<P>
<B>(1040 )</B>
<P>
	An interesting judgment has to be made when listening to the 
remarks of the hon. member for Mercier. It is a line of thought that 
we have heard all too often in the remarks of Bloc Quebecois 
members over the last two years. They have become the party of 
exclusion. They keep people out. They have become the party 
which says it cannot bring people in or widen the boundaries but in 
fact wants to restrict.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois talks about exclusion. In fact, this bill is 
inclusive and fairer. While 93 per cent of the work force was 
covered under the old UI system, 97 per cent will be included in the 
new system. Because of the inclusion of the new formula many 
people will automatically be covered by the new employment 
insurance system.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	That is what is at the heart of this debate. To what extent do we 
provide good, effective coverage, real support for employment and 
a fair balancing of the need to create jobs and at the same time 
protect income?
<P>
	Let me deal first with the most important result of this reform, 
which is the part time worker. We listened very carefully during the 
public consultations and recognized that the labour force has 
changed dramatically. More and more people now work on a part 
time basis. They deserve the same protection as everyone else. 
They deserve the same maternity benefits, sickness benefits, 
income support, help in getting back to a job and the same security 
that provides.
<P>
	Under this program we are providing the formula that would 
allow half a million part time workers to gain eligibility and the 
Bloc is opposing it. They have taken a stand today against the 
rights and responsibilities of part time workers to have the full 
rights of every other Canadian. That is the basic position of the 
Bloc Quebecois. Keep half a million people out is the message 
from the member for Mercier. Half a million people will  be denied 
benefits. Half a million people will not be given the right to gain 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17430"> 17430 </A></B>
<P>
eligibility. It is incredible but understandable, considering the 
history of this party. It is an act of exclusion.
<P>
	Let me give a very practical example. The one thing the hon. 
member for Mercier seems incapable of offering is actual working, 
practical examples of how the new regime would develop.
<P>
	Today, under the existing regime, the basic rule is that if people 
work less than 15 hours a week they are excluded from the 
program. They have no opportunity to receive protection on 
income or maternity benefits. However, under the new regime, 
someone who works 14 hours a week over a normal work year 
period would amass a total of over 700 hours which would 
automatically bring that person into the scheme. It would 
automatically give that individual the right to maternity benefits, 
employment benefits and income security. The member for 
Mercier is opposed to those people being included. She is an 
exclusionist. She wants to keep people out.
<P>
	Therefore, all those people who have faced what they call the 
glass barrier, who have had an artificial roof which stopped at 15 
hours, under the prescription of this member, would be kept out. 
They would have no income security, no protection and no 
opportunity for re-employment. That is the reality and the truth of 
the hon. member. She is saying, time after time, ``keep these people 
out, exclude them, keep the parameters and boundaries restricted''. 
That is the true mind of the reactionary. That is the true mind of a 
person who cannot change. That is the true mind of the fanatic who 
is not prepared to give up her ideology for the sake of helping more 
people receive protection.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	Let me give another working example, the people who now have 
several jobs over a period of time. Under the old regime they get 
credit for only the first job. They cannot make a multiple claim. 
Someone who works 10 weeks at 14 hours per week and then finds 
another job for 35 hours per week would not be included. They 
would not qualify. They would not get the same kind of protection.
<P>
	Under our new proposal that person who has a series of multiple 
jobs, whether in construction or in the service industry or anywhere 
else, would be able to accumulate 700 hours because we are saying 
the key is every hour counts. As a result they would now be in the 
program.
<P>
	Now we have an hon. member from the Bloc saying keep all 
those people out. Do not give them any protection. Do not give 
them any income security. This fixation and fanaticism we hear on 
the status quo, the end result is to be discriminatory.
<P>
	The hon. member for Mercier is arguing for discrimination 
against a whole class of workers  throughout Canada. As a result 
many people who are working part time, who do not have that 
opportunity, would not be given the rights to become eligible and to 
get the protection.
<P>
	One thing the hon. member does not include is that under the 
new scheme if people do not get sufficient hours to qualify even 
though they have the right, they are entitled to a full rebate on their 
premiums. They do not pay it.
<P>
	The hon. member is deliberately giving misinformation in the 
House because she refuses to recognize that all those people under 
that new coverage would have full rights to a full rebate of all 
premiums. It is a really serious charge. People in the Chamber have 
to ask about the veracity and credibility of a member of Parliament 
who makes a claim without being prepared to say what is the case.
<P>
	That could only be a clear, deliberate, malicious, malevolent 
attempt at misinformation. Coming from that member, I am not 
surprised because she has been doing it for the last two years. That 
is the real example.
<P>
	Over 1.3 million people with part time attachment would be 
subject to a full refund of all the premiums. That would include 
people now who pay into the system and get no refund. Over 
900,000 Canadians who pay in and get no benefit would now be 
able to get a full refund of their premiums.
<P>
	All the nonsense we hear from the opposition, Bloc and Reform, 
simply means they have not read the act. They do not know how it 
works and they are deliberately trying to misinform people.
<P>
	There will be 32 per cent fewer people paying into the EI system 
than are paying now because of that refund program.
<P>
	Let me talk for a moment about seasonal workers. Again the 
member is deliberately and maliciously trying to misinform 
Canadians because by going to an hour system, by allowing every 
single hour to count, means many seasonal workers can qualify 
earlier than they can now.
<P>
	I was on a radio program yesterday and someone called from the 
construction industry. He said they work 50 or 60 hours a week. 
Right now under the old system all one does is get credit for a 
week. They get exactly the same credit as somebody who works 25 
hours that week. The person does not get claim for all those hours.
<P>
	Right now, if the person is working 60 hours a week, they could 
qualify under our program within eight, nine or 10 weeks to be 
eligible, and every single hour counts beyond that. Close to a 
quarter of a million seasonal workers will be able to extend their 
benefits several weeks longer as a result of the hour system than 
what they can do under the old system.
<P>

<P>
	Once again the hon. member for Mercier is arguing for a 
program that would deny those workers the right to have their 
season extended, to get better benefits and to be given the full 
credit for the work they do simply because it is the ideology that 
gets in the way of good, sound reasoning and practical common 
sense.
<P>
<B>(1050 )</B>
<P>
	That is clearly beyond the ken of the hon. member to understand. 
People should get full credit for the work they offer. They should be 
given the opportunity, the incentive, the reward and the credit when 
they work more hours to get full benefit as opposed to being denied 
that credit, as they are under the existing system.
<P>
	Those quarter of a million seasonal workers who will be able to 
get extended benefits is another demonstration of how we are 
including people, not excluding people, as the hon. member has 
argued to keep people out and deny them their rightful due and 
their rightful reward.
<P>
	May I also talk for a minute about the impact on families, 
women and children. It was interesting that the hon. member seems 
to have eliminated from her presentation one of the most important 
innovations of the program, the family benefit supplement. This 
ensures basic guarantee income protection for all those with 
families under UI. It is something that has never taken place 
before.
<P>
	This will automatically include about 350,000 Canadian 
families, about 115,000 alone from Quebec. It means they will be 
able to achieve up to 80 per cent of their insurable earnings. It will 
mean that on average a single mother with two children who now is 
under the old UI system, under the new system will be able to 
receive on average 10 per cent higher benefits. Yet the hon. 
member condemns in a blanket statement the opportunity for us to 
provide better protection for low income Canadians under this 
program.
<P>
	Furthermore, we have said in the new legislation this same 
worker could now work during her claim period on UI up to an 
additional $50 per week without having it in any way taxed back 
from the program. It means a person on claim can make another 
$50 and improve their income.
<P>
	As I said, the real issue for people is income, how much money 
they can actually get for their families. By offering the incentive 
again and be able to work while on claim without have any 
deduction up to $50 can add another substantial portion of income 
to low income people.
<P>
	The other exclusion put forward by the hon. member is that 
women who have taken maternity benefits under the old system to 
look after their children when they want to come back to work have 
no recourse. Under our new proposal they would be eligible for all 
the new employment benefits. They would be able to start their 
own business, have a training voucher, have a wage  supplement, an 
income supplement, work on a job core program. It is a major
<P>
assistance for women coming back into the workforce to get those 
employment benefits which up to now they have not had any access 
to.
<P>
	Yet the Bloc Quebecois is prepared to say: ``No, we do not agree 
with that. We do not want to help women coming back to the 
workforce. We do not want to give them a chance to get back into 
employment. We do not want to provide them with the kind of 
support they need''.
<P>
	That again is another act of exclusion by the hon. member for 
Mercier; deny women the right to get back in the workforce, deny 
women the right to have extra income protection for their families, 
deny women the chance to have an extra ability to make money 
while on claim. All those measures designed to improve the 
income base of women coming back into the program the hon. 
member for Mercier simply denies, excludes, rejects and 
demonstrates once again that ideology and fanaticism are her major 
problems, not the real point in this legislation. That is the real issue 
here.

a fanatic by my hon. colleague opposite. This has been going on for

withdraw the term under your direction and I will ask to have the 
matter checked and we will see whether it is properly within 
Beauchesne's.

<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The 
Minister of Human Resources Development was in the midst of 
debate. The member opposite rose. She did not rise on a point of 
order. She should not have been allowed to interrupt the minister. If 
she was allowed to interrupt, she should have very clearly put her 
point of order immediately and the Chair should have ruled 
whether it was a point of order.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I ask you to allow the debate to continue without 
interruption.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am amazed to see a female 
colleague stand up to support a minister who is telling women to go 
back to their kitchens.
<P>
	If this minister thinks he is Churchill, as he suggested a moment 
ago, let me tell you that he is so ridiculous that he is turning this 
House into a real circus, or rather a chicken coop.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I did not understand exactly the last point 
the hon. member for Mercier raised. I will have to check the blues. 
If indeed the comment was out of order, it will be dealt with later in 
the House.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> I must raise a point of order, Mr. Speaker. Thank 
you, Madam. I and every member of this House clearly heard the 
minister say something like: ``If she cannot take the heat, she 
should not be in the kitchen''.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I formally request that he take this back. It is highly 
insulting and unacceptable. All women should feel insulted by this. 
And if it takes a point of order to get my hon. colleague, who is a 
woman herself, and our male colleagues to support me in asking 
that the minister withdraw his statement, so be it.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is nearly time for oral questions. Does 
the minister have anything to add before we look into this matter?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to resume the debate. I remind the hon. member that if she 
were prepared to read history more often she would realize-

	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I take this 
opportunity to say that as part of the democratic process I will be 
conducting a public town hall meeting tomorrow with respect to 
the employment insurance proposals.
<P>
	This is a very important process for me and every member of 
Parliament to undertake. We as elected representatives must listen 
to our electorate and the concerns about legislation that will affect 
their lives directly and indirectly.
<P>
	I recognize there is some concern over the intensity of work rule. 
We as a government must show that we are willing to listen to new 
options and amend legislation accordingly.
<P>
	Public meetings also give us the opportunity to gauge what we 
are doing right. For example, the introduction of insurance benefit 
clawbacks for high income earners has been initially accepted and 
supported by various groups.

<P>
	I vigorously seek for all politicians to return to the people's

<P>
	Tony has assumed a great responsibility. The OFA is the voice of 
Ontario farmers. Supported by over 41,000 individual members 
and 29 affiliated organizations, the OFA presents farm family 
concerns to governments and to the general public. The OFA has a 
long history of advocating the interest of the Ontario farm 
community. Though constituted in its present form since 1970, the 
OFA can trace its roots back to the Ontario Chamber of Agriculture 
established in the 1930s.

	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the news is out. Canadian banks  have rung up more than 
$5 billion in profits for the fiscal year 1995. Last year, when the 
same banks recorded $4.2 billion in profits, the Minister of Finance 
imposed a one-time temporary tax that was expected to return $100 
million to the people of Canada.
<P>
	Canadian farmers, small business owners, workers, students, 
pensioners and the unemployed have all been asked to pay more 
with less return during 1995. The banks can be asked to do no less. 
Five billion dollars in profits taken from ordinary Canadians during 
difficult economic times must be treated accordingly.
<P>
	I call on the Minister of Finance to do as he did last year and 
impose an excess profits tax on the banks. The additional revenue 
gained in this way should be applied to job creation programs so 
that all Canadians, not just the banks, can share in whatever 
economic growth is taking place in Canada.

	<B>Ms. Beth Phinney (Hamilton Mountain, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
all members are aware, this week the crime bill received royal 
assent. On average one woman is killed every six days in Canada, 
often with a firearm at home by someone she knows. The weapon 
of choice in most cases is a legally owned firearm and 80 per cent 
of the time the firearm is a rifle or a shotgun.
<P>
	A study released this week estimated the economic cost of 
violence against women in Canada at $4.2 billion per year. The 
recent passage of new gun control legislation is an important step 
in dealing with the problem of violence against women.
<P>
	Mrs. de Villiers, the president of CAVEAT, has requested that I 
thank the Minister of Justice and the government for passing the 
gun control legislation despite the often hysterical and ill informed 
opposition.
<P>
	The new gun control legislation will help to reduce the scourge 
of violence against women. However it is only a first step. More 
needs to be done. The government has been providing valuable 
leadership but all parts of society must co-operate to eliminate 
violence.

years ago.
<P>
	While Parliament has taken an important step by strictly

this. Yesterday, he said: ``If that reality, namely Quebec's culture, 
is not recognized, then Quebecers are right to contemplate 
separating from the rest of the country''.

	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this morning 
we learned from a SOM survey that Quebecers are not swallowing 
the constitutional crumbs the Prime Minister is throwing them. 
Whether it is his feeble definition of distinct society, his veto right, 
which is not one at all, and his promise to make federal interference 
in areas of provincial jurisdiction more discreet, to Quebecers, it is 
nothing but the typical federal smoke and mirrors.
<P>
	Yes, two thirds of Quebecers are dissatisfied with the Prime 
Minister's proposals. The federal propositions are being rejected 
by Quebecers, regardless of their region. Quebecers are nobody's 
fools.
<P>
	This survey was carried out before the government's 
announcement that the number of regions to which the Prime 
Minister wants to give a bogus constitutional veto would be raised 
from four to five. This latest improvisation confirms the people of

the Prime Minister's handling of it clearly show that he has no plan. 
Everything from constitutional vetoes to distinct society status has 
been a stumbling, fumbling exercise in futility.
<P>
	The Prime Minister is telling Quebecers that his version of 
distinct society will make them unique and special, while at the 
same time he is telling the rest of Canada not to worry, that it does 
not really mean much. His performance reminds me of the movie 
``Batman Forever'', with the Prime Minister playing the part of the

The equalization payment program and the Canada assistance plan

Quebec this past year.
<P>
	It is, however, deplorable that the minister took advantage of her 
press conference to seek to downplay the value of those programs

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="QUEBECCULTURE">QUEBEC CULTURE</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, after watching the Prime Minister telling all and sundry 
that his resolution on Quebec's distinct identity would provide 
guidance for the government's actions and would produce tangible 
results, we saw the Prime Minister show his true colours on 
Wednesday, when, as if by magic, Quebec culture no longer 
existed.
<P>
	Considering the spontaneity of his statement on Wednesday, 
Quebecers were not fooled by his about face the next day. They 
know exactly what the Prime Minister is thinking.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister. 
Considering that the government deliberately ignores the fact that 
Liberal members on the heritage committee are hunting down 
heretics who mention Quebec culture, does the Deputy Prime 
Minister realize that by doing nothing, the government has become 
an accomplice to this witch hunt?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I think that this week the 
Prime Minister explained very well the nature and importance of 
Quebec culture, especially for  the survival of French culture in 
Canada. We are very much aware of that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it seems that the arts community, including Roch Demers, 
a diehard federalist who campaigned for the no side, does not 
understand the Prime Minister, or should I say, understands him too 
well.
<P>
	Earlier the Prime Minister explained that he did not intervene in 
the case of the heritage committee because he respected freedom of 
speech. That is what he said yesterday.
<P>
	What explanation does the Deputy Prime Minister have for the 
fact that in this case, the government respects freedom of speech, 
but when the Liberal member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce publicly 
challenged the Prime Minister, he was gagged by being forced to 
step down as chairman of the justice committee? Is there a double 
standard?
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, what I find rather surprising 
about the hon. member's attitude is that last week, the immigration 
critic attacked the Liberal government's immigration policy but 
remained silent about certain comments made by Mr. Bourbeau. So 
if he does not like certain comments, he should say so.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Deputy Prime Minister surprises me. Perhaps she 
should realize that Mr. Bourbeau is not a member of the Bloc 
Quebecois and that the member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, since 
we cannot refer to him by name, is a member of her party. It seems 
to me there is a difference, but perhaps it would be too much to ask 
the Deputy Prime Minister to make those distinctions.
<P>
	Since a substantial majority of Quebecers feel that the offers 
made by this government are clearly inadequate, will the Deputy 
Prime Minister admit that Quebecers have seen through these 
so-called promises of change and will not be fooled by cosmetic 
changes like the resolution on distinct society, which in fact 
changes nothing because it does not say anything concrete or 
practical or even theoretical, when it comes down to it?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, on the subject of criticizing 
the comments of others, I am still waiting for the members of the 
Bloc Quebecois to criticize what their own leader said about the 
role of women to bear white children in Quebec. That was never 
criticized by the Bloc members. When Liberal members make 
comments, at least we can say their leader did not decide to involve 
women in a policy to keep Canada white.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, recently the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage changed the  legislation governing 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17437"> 17437 </A></B>
<P>
his department. It now denies the existence of Quebec culture. 
Section 4(1) describes the minister's powers and clearly talks of a 
single Canadian identity and culture.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage. Given the 
government's claims that its resolution on Quebec's distinct nature 
will guide its actions, does the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
intend amending his department's legislation to contain reference 
to Quebec's culture?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we will have an opportunity on Monday, at our next 
meeting, to speak to the existence of a Quebec identity and a 
Quebec cultural identity, before the House of Commons. At that 
point I will look to see whether my colleagues opposite rise in 
support of the uniqueness of Quebec culture. They may remain 
seated; I shall rise.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are now 
used to the minister's contorted answers, but I must say this last 
one was a real humdinger.
<P>
	In refusing today to amend his legislation, is the minister not 
proving the emptiness of his government's motion on the distinct 
society and the fact that it is worth less than the paper it is written 
on?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, nothing could be clearer than a vote on a unique 
Quebec culture. I will see on Monday how my colleagues will vote 
in recognizing it. If they remain seated, it is because they do not 
recognize it. I will be voting in favour.

	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want 
to ask about the unique culture of the Liberal government. 
Yesterday morning the government's veto bill, Bill C-110, gave 
two provincial premiers a veto over the Constitution. This morning 
it gives four provincial premiers a veto over the Constitution.
<P>
	After limiting debate in the House on the first day of debate, 
after limiting committee hearings to two days and giving witnesses 
24 hours notice, the government now informs us it wants to make a 
major change.
<P>
	My question is for the intergovernmental affairs minister. Will 
the government admit that it should properly consult Parliament, 
affected parties, experts and Canadians and that the appropriate 
thing to do is to withdraw Bill C-110?
<P>
<B>(1125 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in fact  the government was 
listening to the advice of the leader of the Reform Party, who only a 
few days ago in the House said that we should extend a veto to the 
fifth region and that the fifth region should be British Columbia.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the 
government calls that listening, it was not listening very carefully. 
We suggested that it is the people of Canada who should have a say; 
the provinces already have a say.
<P>
	The government has just made a major change to a one clause 
bill. It has admitted that there are unclear legal issues surrounding 
the bill and it may be challenged in court.
<P>
	If the government will not withdraw Bill C-110, will the 
government at least commit to the House that it will not bring in 
further time allocation, not further limit debate and give Canadians 
a chance to consider these issues?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to restate the fact that 
when the leader of the third party gave advice to the House about 
the recognition of a fifth region for the purposes of a veto, a 
statement which he made on November 29, 1995, what the Prime 
Minister did was to respond to good advice from the leader of the 
third party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is 
an incredible exercise in the power of listening. I will say once 
again that what the Reform Party and the leader of the Reform 
Party said was that the government should consult the people of all 
the regions of Canada, not the legislatures and the premiers.
<P>
	The government has come up with a new definition of unity: We 
are going to unite Canadians by getting them all against something 
at the same time. The bill has been rejected by the Government of 
Quebec and in polls of the people. It has been rejected by the 
Government of British Columbia, even with the change, and by the 
Government of Alberta. It has created a firestorm across the west. 
Aboriginal representatives say they were not consulted. The 
Government of Saskatchewan said it was not consulted.
<P>
	Who exactly is it that the government believes it is pleasing with 
this legislation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I fear that the hon. member 
from Alberta is suffering some political amnesia. In the last seven 
days, in the course of this debate, the leader of the third party rose 
in the House to speak on this issue. I would like to read what he 
said into the record because I think the hon. member from Alberta 
is now-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tobin:</B> He is swallowing himself whole.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17438"> 17438 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> -swallowing himself whole, to quote another 
member of the government.
<P>
	The quote reads: ``The government has not given priority 
whatsoever to the concerns and aspirations of British Columbia, 
the third most populous province in the country. B.C. is not 
recognized by the government as a region in its own right. The 
government is prepared to recognize Quebec as a distinct society. 
When is the government prepared to recognize B.C. as an 
important province of Canada?''
<P>
	That is why the Prime Minister, following good advice which he 
received from the leader of the third party and good advice which 
he received from members of the Liberal caucus and others, has 
amended the bill to make it a better bill.

	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	On December 22, 1994, the heritage minister and his industry 
colleague issued a joint press release stating that a bill to amend the 
copyright legislation would be tabled in the House as early as 
possible in the new year.
<P>
	Could the heritage minister confirm that the copyright bill will 
indeed be tabled before the December 15 adjournment, that is to 
say within the next seven days?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, our colleague does not like to be kept in suspense. I 
indicated that the bill in question was on a critical path. It still is, 
and it is making headway. In due course, the bill will be tabled in 
the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
suggest that the minister is the one on a critical path.
<P>
	Does the minister not realize that, according to the Society of 
Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada, this 
regulatory vacuum resulted in losses of $300 million this year 
because of private copying and that his inaction is sending the 
message that the future of our artists is a matter of supreme 
indifference to him?
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, perhaps our colleague has closer ties to the arts 
community that I do, but I certainly get their message loud and 
clear. I do not need to go through him to consult with them. I hear 
them, I listen to them and we will act in their best interest.

	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate the Minister of National Revenue, our minister from 
British Columbia, on his new found influence with cabinet and the 
Prime Minister.
<P>
	Will he now try to achieve distinct society status for British 
Columbians?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am glad the member has 
acknowledged the very important work of the minister from British 
Columbia, working behind the scenes as we promised in the House 
he would do.
<P>
	I can understand the obvious embarrassment of the Reform Party 
because only about a week ago its leader was in the House seeking 
the right of veto for British Columbia, not for Alberta.
<P>
	In a very positive way we have tried to respond to his concerns 
and in particular to the very sound recommendations given by the 
minister form British Columbia to the Prime Minister, who 
ultimately is seeking the approval of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
think the non-answer from the non-minister will probably reflect 
the non-votes for the Liberals in the next election in British 
Columbia.
<P>
	My supplementary question is for the Minister of National 
Revenue. Given the short shrift British Columbians have had over 
the years with the closure of Royal Roads, the closure of base 
Chilliwack, the KAON project, the welfare fiasco of recent times, 
et cetera, will the minister with his new found influence try to 
move the government away from knee-jerk reactions toward 
meaningful action?
<P>
	The specific one is the west coast fishing strategy, fishing 
licences and fishing quotas. Will the minister move toward making 
them fair and non-discriminatory because he understands what is 
going on in British Columbia?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, when I hear the word knee-jerk coming from this 
member, the emphasis ought to be on the latter part of that 
description in referring to the member.
<P>

	<B>The Speaker:</B> I ask the hon. minister to withdraw that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tobin:</B> Mr. Speaker, absolutely.

answer the question?

<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	Yesterday in Vancouver in beautiful British Columbia, while the 
member was here trying to figure out ways to make the federation 
fail, we were meeting with 80 representatives of the British 
Columbia fishing industry, trying to work toward ensuring the 
federation succeeds.
<P>
	We believe that when people from coast to coast work together, 
speak together, listen to one another and build together, Canada is a 
better place. In working together, we will build the country. To the 
hon. member and his party, they cannot fulfil their political 
ambitions by trying to climb up on the broken pieces of Canada. It 
is time to stand up for the country instead of tearing it down.

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	As a result of the measures proposed in the minister's bill, UI 
coverage for workers will be reduced even further. In 1990, 77 per 
cent of unemployed workers qualified for UI. This proportion has 
since dropped to less than 50 per cent, and the minister's reform 
will reduce it even further.
<P>
	Does the minister not agree that, as the Canadian Labour 
Congress pointed out in its analysis of his reform, the new UI 
program will protect only one out of three unemployed workers?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, both the hon. member for 
Mercier and the CLC are dead wrong in their analysis.
<P>
	The proposed changes to the program substantially expand 
coverage. We will be expanding coverage for half a million people 
who are presently part time workers. We will be extending 
coverage for seasonal workers by using an hours system so that 
they can establish eligibility earlier and have longer benefits. We 
will be extending the coverage of employment benefits for people 
who have presently exhausted their programs so that they can get 
back to work.
<P>
	The net result is to give people a lot more opportunity to return 
to work, to get credit for the work they are doing and as a result 
achieve the most important objective, to give people real support in 
getting a job.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the 
reform did not include an additional major obstacle in that workers 
will be required to work a minimum of 910 hours in one year in 
order to qualify for UI, there could be a semblance of truth to what 
the minister is saying.
<P>
	Does the minister not agree that-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Dear colleagues, I would ask you to please choose 
your words very judiciously.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> That is very judicious.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, does the minister not agree that the 
main reason why 500,000 part time workers were included in the 
program is to require them to pay premiums even though most of 
them will never be eligible to benefit?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as we pointed out in an earlier 
exchange, the hon. member has omitted a very important part of the 
program. Those workers are also eligible for a major refund of all 
premiums if they do not become eligible.
<P>
	About 1.3 million part time workers are eligible for a full refund 
of all premiums paid. As a result, many will be paying less than 
they do now under the old system.
<P>
	Once again it points out that when simply trying to defend the 
status quo, they are totally immune and incapable of understanding 
the real positive pluses that come by making good, substantial, 
balanced, equitable reform.

quote a physician:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Governments which willing undertook the responsibility for funding 
medicare when there was political mileage to be gained are now reluctant to 
accept the concomitant financial burden. They try to weasel out of their 
promise.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The honest alternative would be for governments to confess to the public that 
they no longer can, or wish to fund medicare.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Those words should be eerily familiar to the parliamentary 
secretary. They are published words of hers in a 1990 B.C. journal 
of medicine.

	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	The economic and financial update released yesterday by the 
minister indicates that the government could have lowered UI 
premiums to $2.93 for every $100 of insurable earnings and still 
have collected the whole amount set in the 1995 budget. Yet, the 
government decided to set the premium at $2.95.
<P>
	Will the minister recognize that he could have lowered UI 
premiums to $2.93 and still have met his 1995 budgetary 
objectives?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, it is customary to do 
what we call a rounding off of these premiums. It is clearly the case 
here, given the minimal difference between $2.93 and $2.95.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, since 
the minister said in his document that these premiums could have 
been lowered to $2.93, I assume he could have done it. But given 
the minister's estimation that lowering premiums by seven cents, 
in 1995, would result in the creation of 40,000 jobs, will he 
recognize that, by refusing to lower these premiums by two cents, 
down to $2.93, he is sacrificing, based on his own calculations, 
12,000 jobs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, first, the Minister of 
Human Resources Development clearly said that it was our 
intention to build a reserve, so as to preserve jobs should an 
economic decline occur. Indeed, we are well aware that the worst 
thing that can happen in a period of economic decline is to be 
forced to raise UI premiums. This is why we are building up a 
reserve and why we put the UI fund back on its feet by pouring $6 
billion into it, over a period of just two years.
<P>
	The hon. member is absolutely right when he says that lowering 
UI premiums helps create jobs. This is why the minister lowered 
the rate, for a total amount of $1.25 billion. This is the way to 
create jobs.

	The banks have reported profits of over $5 billion. In that same 
period of time, they have raised service charges and also reduced 
the number of people that serve the general public. What is the

<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, that is a question in 
which a large number of Canadians have an interest.
<P>
	The government believes that consumers are best served by an 
environment where financial institutions compete for business and 
where consumers have access to adequate information.
<P>
	With regard to service charges, federal financial institutions 
have to disclose all fees applicable to an account at the time of 
opening an account. When there is a change in any fees they must 
give at least 30 days' notice. That is a requirement of federal 
legislation. I understand that Canadian banks charge substantially 
lower service changes than U.S. banks for comparable services.

Mr. Speaker, results of the Alberta plebiscite on wheat and barley 
marketing are crystal clear. Two-thirds of Alberta producers voted 
in favour of having a dual marketing system, with the freedom to 
choose to market through the Canadian Wheat Board or outside of 
the board.
<P>
	Would the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food tell the House

marketing of wheat and barley is a step forward? A yes or no 
answer would be appreciated.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and

more than one or two words. I hope the hon. member will bear with 
me while I respond to his question.
<P>
	As everyone knows, a plebiscite with respect to wheat and barley 
marketing was conducted recently in the province of Alberta. That 
plebiscite is not without some considerable controversy. I note that 
some farm leaders in Alberta, some agricultural reporters in 
Alberta, some pollsters in western Canada have all raised what 
appear to be serious questions about the process.
<P>
	Approximately 16,000 producers participated in the process, out 
of perhaps 30,000, 35,000 or 40,000 who might have participated 
in the process. I point out again that this single vote within one 
province, on an issue that affects all of western Canada and as 
many as 130,000 prairie farmers, is obviously not a process that 
can be definitive with respect to this issue across western Canada.
<P>
	The Government of Canada has established a process to deal 
with this issue in an orderly and logical way. That is the Western 
Grain Marketing Panel. It is very well known. I would urge all 
prairie farmers, including all of those in Alberta, to participate 
fully and fairly in the Western Grain Marketing Panel.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, farmers are not dumb. Maybe a lawyer thinks they 
are, but farmers understand very well what the question was and 
what it meant.
<P>
	The minister has been pinning all of his hopes on the Western 
Grain Marketing Panel. In a statement he has  slammed the 
producer vote as being merely academic. He has no respect for 
farmers who democratically expressed a common sense position.
<P>
	Why is the minister insulting the intelligence of farmers by 
thumbing his nose at the clear message he received from over 
16,000 plebiscite participants, 16,000 voters?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, again I point out to the hon. 
gentleman that those votes represent about 12 per cent or 15 per 
cent of the total number of farmers affected by this process.
<P>
	The arrangement that the Government of Canada has put in place 
in order for this issue to be fully ventilated in western Canada is a 
logical and orderly process. It will provide farmers through the 
Western Grain Marketing Panel with full, fair, balanced, accurate 
information about all of the issues respecting grain marketing in 
the west.
<P>
<B>(1150 )</B>
<P>
	It will also provide farmers with the opportunity to debate all of 
the issues related to grain marketing in a way that is totally 
transparent, with all of the facts on the table. They can consider not 
only the pros of the marketing debate but also the cons and the 
consequences so this issue can be dealt with fairly in the interests 
of all western Canadians.

question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	A Canadian citizen, Tran Trieu Quan, has been a prisoner in 
Vietnam for close to two years now, despite the fact that the 
Canadian government believes he is imprisoned on trumped up 
charges. The Prime Minister promised to look into the case 
personally upon his return from Vietnam in November, 1994.
<P>
	What explanation does the Deputy Prime Minister have for the 
fact, that more than a year after the Prime Minister's Asian 
mission, the situation remains unchanged, despite a recent 
commitment by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Mr. Tran Trieu 
Quan still remains a prisoner in Vietnam?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the treatment of the 
gentleman in question is, of course, unacceptable to the 
government of Canada. That is why the Prime Minister himself 
raised the issue, as did the Minister of Foreign Affairs. We continue 
to tell the government of Vietnam to respect the fact that this 
Canadian citizen must be released, because the present position of 
the government of Vietnam is not reasonable.

gave his word that he was pursuing this matter at the highest

	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, during my recent 
visit to Atlantic Canada I heard a lot of criticism of the Tobin tax. 
One criticism above all the rest is that fishermen are distressed that 
the licence fees are to be based on gross landed value rather than on 
net profit. The minister knows very well there is a large difference 
between gross and net profit.
<P>
	Is the minister going to listen to fishermen on at least this one 
small point and ensure that fees are based on net profit, not gross 
landed value?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, during the member's visit to Atlantic Canada he 
certainly was able to generate some reaction from the fishermen, 
there is no doubt about it.
<P>
	The executive director of the Maritime Fishermen's Union in 
reference to the member opposite said words to this effect: Please 
take your garbage back where it came from. We are not interested 
in your politics of division. The president the fishermen's union, a 
Newfoundlander, Earle McCurdy, in essence said to the member 
that they are not going to be fooled by these crocodile tears and 
they certainly will not accept a wolf in sheep's clothing.
<P>
	Yes, the member made quite an impression on the fishermen of 
Atlantic Canada and yes, they have an inordinate amount of 
common sense in dealing with the kind of nonsense proposed 
opposite.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is easy to see 
this minister gets high on his own exhaust.
<P>
	I have in my possession a Department of Fisheries and Oceans 
document which shows that not only is the minister proposing a 
$50 million tax grab in 1996, but more startling is planning to 
increase this by a further $20 million in 1997. This will mean that 
Canadian  fishermen will be faced with a $70 million tax bill in 
1997.
<P>
	When is the minister going to start listening to fishermen instead 
of the self-serving bureaucrats in his department who are 
advocating this tax so they can preserve their own jobs?
<P>
<B>(1155 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it takes a special kind of stamina, one that is clearly 
exhausting this member's credibility, to stand in the House to ask 
these kinds of questions.
<P>
	This is the party-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> You are exhausting.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> When are you going to take the billboards down, 
Brian?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tobin:</B> Listen up, fellows. You might learn something for a 
change.
<P>
	This is the party whose leader went to Atlantic Canada and said 
that it only takes 90 seconds of study to know that the fishery is 
finished. This is the party that complained about the EI reform 
which is now under way because the cuts were not deep enough. 
This is the party that said of the TAGS program, which assists tens 
of thousands of fishermen who have been hit by the fisheries 
failure, that the program ought to be cancelled. This is the party 
whose obvious lust at a shot in a byelection in Labrador has driven 
it beyond the bounds of decency and common sense. And this is the 
party that will be slam dunked in that byelection with the kind of 
negative results it deserves.

<P>

<P>

merchandise exports grew by 20 per cent, compared to the same 
period last year. Exports to the United States rose 17 per cent, but 
the United States is far from our fastest growing market. Sales to 
Latin America, including Brazil, have increased by some 29 per

	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Transport.
<P>
	On October 30, Canadian Airlines International stopped all its 
international flights originating in Montreal, preferring to 
concentrate its operations in Toronto. As a result, Montreal and its 
very substantial Italian community are deprived of direct 
connections with Rome. The minister's policy for awarding 
international routes prevents other carriers from offering this 
service.
<P>
	Since Canadian Airlines International no longer offers a service 
from Mirabel, would the minister agree that his policy for 
allocating international air routes is discriminatory, since it 
deprives Montreal of direct connections with all countries for 
which Canadian has been given exclusive access?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I agree that our policy for allocating international routes 
has had the exact opposite effect of what the hon. member wanted.
<P>
	I realize this is a drawback. The hon. member will probably say 
so in his supplementary. When Canadian Airlines International 
decided to stop their service from Mirabel, at the same time, and I 
am sure the hon. member was aware of this, Alitalia, the Italian 
airline, made the same decision. The problem at Mirabel is that 
there is not enough passenger volume to support a service either by 
Canadian Airlines International or Alitalia.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	What we are trying to do, and negotiations are now under way, is 
to see how we can solve the problem so as to provide an adequate 
service from Mirabel to Italy.

approach with the western provinces over the transfer of federal 
funds, it ignores the gross inequities it has created through the 
Canada-Quebec accord.
<P>
	Under the accord the province of Quebec receives $90 million a 
year, 35 per cent of all federal funds being  transferred for the 
settlement programs for immigrants and refugees when Quebec is 
currently only taking 12 to 13 per cent of the immigrants and 
refugees.
<P>
	If the government is going to continue the funding program, will 
it consider renegotiating the Canada-Quebec accord so that the 
money is going to the provinces that are receiving the immigrants 
and refugees?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Secretary of State (Parliamentary 
Affairs) and Deputy Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I want to thank the member for 
giving me the opportunity to say how our federal system works. 
The immigration accord between Quebec and Canada is proof that 
we can have agreements between provincial and federal 
governments to make this country work.

	Concerning the other provinces, the minister is open for 
discussions. There are discussions going on and I am sure that 
when the minister returns to the House he will give a detailed

	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	In the infamous red book there is a promise by those who were 
running for government that they would eliminate the GST. The 
Prime Minister last summer stated that in the February 1996 budget 
the government would outline a replacement for the GST. No 
mention was made on Wednesday by the Minister of Finance of 
GST reform in his finance minister's economic and fiscal update.
<P>
	Is it still the intent of the Minister of Finance to tell the people of 
Canada how he is going to recommend eliminating the GST?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the government's 
undertaking in terms of the GST is to obviously have a system that 
is fairer to consumers and which is easier to administer.
<P>
	The government has stated that following the desires of 
Canadians it is our wish to harmonize and to have a single tax, a 
single base. We are in the course of discussing this with the 
provinces. Undoubtedly it will come up at the meeting of the 
federal-provincial finance ministers next week.
<P>
	I would have been prepared to have discussed it in the fiscal 
statement. The purpose of the fiscal statement was to give an 
economic update on the state of the economy since the last budget 
which is why I did not deal with it and I was not questioned on the 
matter.

	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I wish to bring to the attention of the House a question 
asked earlier during question period by a member of the Reform 
Party, the member for Nanaimo-Cowichan, to the hon. Minister 
of National Revenue but in a different capacity.
<P>
	Citation 412 of Beauchesne's states quite clearly in regard to 
such questions:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A question may not be asked of a Minister in another capacity, such as being 
responsible for a province-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The question was asked in contravention of our rules and it was 
allowed to be asked uninterrupted. I realized that afterward when 
another member rose to ask a question which was similarly against 
our rules and that member was ruled out of order.
<P>
	I would want to report to the House and to suggest to Mr. 
Speaker that the question asked of the hon. Minister of National 
Revenue was equally out of order. Therefore it should have been 
indicated at that time so that all Canadians would know that the 
minister was unable to answer the question because of the rules of 
the House which specifically prevent him from doing so.
<P>
<B>(1205 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. government whip raises a perfectly valid 
point of order.
<P>
	In listening to the question and not to whom it was directed, it 
dealt with an issue that is seizing the House right now, the 
government veto, and I thought it was proper for that time. The 
hon. government whip did note that on another occasion I declared 
another question out of order. Because it dealt with the veto and 
because the Deputy Prime Minister in her wisdom thought she 
would like to answer it, I permitted it. However I take this under 
advisement. I thank the hon. government whip for raising the 
matter.

action by the member for North Vancouver before the Minister for 
Human Resources Development started speaking.
<P>
	I believe you will find that the member for North Vancouver 
used unparliamentary language. In addition, citation 501 of 
Beauchesne's states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Speakers have consistently ruled that it is improper to produce exhibits of 
any sort in the Chamber. Thus during the flag debate of 1964, the display of 
competing designs was prohibited. At other times boxes of cereal, detergent and 
milk powder have been ruled out of order.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Mr. Speaker, I think you will find and in fact I believe you 
observed that the member for North Vancouver produced a trophy 
of the rear part of a horse and presented it to the minister. At the 
same time he referred to the minister with the words referring to 
that part of the equine anatomy.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. My colleagues, the first point the hon. 
member brought up is the use of props. I have asked hon. members 
on numerous occasions to please not use props. I have asked this of 
members on all sides of the House. We are equal in here. We are 
members of Parliament.
<P>
	Once again I appeal to you that even though you quote from 
papers, there is no need to hold them up or shake them. I believe 
that our words stand on their own. I take the point and reiterate to 
the House, please do not use any props.
<P>
	With regard to the other point about the horse, forgive me but I 
did not see the use of the prop and I did not hear the words used. 
With regard to the words, I will check <I>Hansard</I> and if it is 
necessary, I will get back to the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I felt it 
was a perfectly reasonable point of order I raised earlier. All I 
asked for was the judgment of the House under the 
circumstances-

<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Read the book.
<P>

now. Are there any other points of order? There being no other 
points of order, we will proceed to the daily routine of business.

the minister was in the middle of debate on the motion before the 
House but was interrupted by a point of order and therefore did not 
complete his allotted time. I trust his time will not be diminished 
by the time taken for points of order and that he will be allowed to 
continue so that we may proceed to questions and comments.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am told by the Table the minister's time 
had expired for his intervention. Accordingly, we are into questions 
and comments.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Mr. Speaker, I request clarification as to whether 
the time allotted to the minister did include the interruptions for 
points of order or whether he had used the full 20 minutes to speak.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am reminded that if a point of order is 
raised during an intervention it is included in the 20 minutes.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup has the floor for questions and 
comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to comment on the minister's speech and, in 
particular, on his statement that 97 per cent rather than 93 per cent 
of workers will be eligible for the plan.
<P>
	The Bloc has never said it did not want people to be eligible for 
the plan. We have always said that unemployment insurance should 
be one of the tools for creating employment. The government has 
not offered any other, this reform is its only tool. I think some other 
tools are missing.
<P>
	There may indeed be more people paying into the plan, but I 
would like to know from the minister whether he has had estimates 
made of the number of new contributors who will be able to benefit 
from the plan. For people in the regions, where work is seasonal, 
working 910 hours in a year means working 26 weeks at 35 hours a 
week.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	Even if all the hours are counted, even if people sometimes work 
a 40 hour week, it will be very hard and will result in an exodus of 
young people. This will mean that many people will remain on 
welfare. What I have understood from the reform is that people will 
have a year to accumulate their 910 hours. The next year, it starts 
all over again, and we begin at zero. So, there are many people who 
today are getting unemployment insurance, because their job 
afforded them between 300 and 400 hours. Now they will have to 
do 910 hours before they are entitled to unemployment insurance 
benefits.
<P>
	In my opinion, this will mean the following: people who work 12 
or 13 weeks in the summer at 35 hours a week will end up with 
some 400 hours and then will have to leave the region to come up 
with the other 500 hours. They will have to look for jobs elsewhere. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17447"> 17447 </A></B>
<P>
Over three,  four or five years this will reduce the population in the 
region. This is a negative aspect of the reform.
<P>
	We are not saying unemployment insurance should not be 
reformed, we are saying that 910 hours is far too much for someone 
new to the system to accumulate right off in order to be entitled to 
benefits, it is inappropriate for our economy.
<P>
	There is one other point I would like to raise. When the minister 
terms it an equitable reform, how can he say it is equitable for 
seasonal workers when their benefits will drop from 55 per cent to 
50 per cent after about three years, when they will have used up the 
100 weeks after which the reduction kicks in? The people affected, 
therefore, are in seasonal industries, a sector where, through no 
fault of their own, they have to be on unemployment insurance year 
after year. They are not guilty of anything, so why must they be 
penalized? These are people who work in industries with 12, 13, 
14, 15 weeks of work a year. They cannot invent more work than 
that.
<P>
	So they are being told their benefits will be cut down to 50 per 
cent. After three years, they will be down to 50 per cent, and for no 
other reason except to penalize them and push them into other 
sectors where they do not necessarily have any expertise. Where is 
the other side of the coin, the assurance that there will be changes 
in their regional economy?
<P>
	Last year, everywhere we went with the Human Resources 
Committee the people in the regions said they were not opposed to 
change. They said they wanted assurance that there would be set 
transitional periods, possibilities of adjusting the economy, of 
bringing in aspects from new technology, all those things.
<P>
	But today, instead of a carrot and stick approach, only the stick 
has been brought out, with no carrot anywhere in sight. There is no 
sign from anyone in this government, particularly not the Minister 
of Industry, whose vision of the economy is a century behind the 
times. There is no vision here of what the positive aspects will be.
<P>
	I would therefore ask the minister to tell us what percentage of 
those now under the plan will be eligible under the new 
arrangements, and what percentage will never be eligible because it 
will be impossible for them to accumulate 910 hours at any time in 
their working lives. I feel that this is an important question, 
because making it so that more people contribute may be very 
attractive from a budget point of view, but from the human point of 
view it is equally important to see that people will have enough to 
live on.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has raised 
some very useful and important questions and I  would like to 
provide him with a detailed response. I hope hon. members will 
listen.
<P>
	In terms of the question being addressed earlier about part time 
workers, we estimate that 1.3 million people who have a minor 
work attachment will now be eligible for a total refund of all 
premiums paid. That includes 900,000 people who presently 
contribute benefits but receive no claim or eligibility because they 
do not have enough weeks.
<P>
	Those 900,000 people will now be able to receive a full refund 
on their benefits. In fact, 32 per cent fewer people will be paying 
benefits into the new employment insurance system than in the old 
system. Overall, part time and low income workers will be paying 
$14 million less in premiums in the new system.
<P>
<B>(1225 )</B>
<P>
	Those are hard figures. More people are covered but if they do 
not receive their full eligibility they get a refund of all their 
premiums, which means a $14 million saving in premiums for part 
time workers.
<P>
	I will deal with the second question the hon. member raised 
regarding the new entrance requirements for new entrants. I will 
quote to him because he has quoted back to me several times, with 
great support, the recommendations of the seasonal task force. The 
working group told us we should do something about eligibility to 
stop young people from leaving school to take advantage of the 
short term benefits of UI to the detriment of their future career 
prospects.
<P>
	That was a direct recommendation of the seasonal workers task 
force. It talked with seasonal worker groups right across Canada.
<P>
	I recommend the hon. member actually read the legislation 
rather than listening to his colleague, the member for Mercier.
<P>
	The new entrance requirement is only a first time requirement. 
In the second year, if they have worked 490 hours in the previous 
year, the entrance requirement goes down to the regular number of 
hours. In other words, if they simply get 490 hours in the first year 
they are not required to do 900 hours in the next year, as the hon. 
member asserts. They go down to the regular 420 required hours. I 
hope that provides some clarification.
<P>
	I will now come to a very important point. The hon. member 
made a very good case about the need to help change economies in 
parts of rural Canada, to help people redevelop new economies, 
recognizing there are problems.
<P>
	One of the major elements in the new program is a $300 million 
transition jobs fund that can be used for the investment in these 
areas to help small businesses with capital formation, to start new 
enterprises. It can used in terms of new training programs, new 
schools in those areas, if that is the choice of people in those areas.  
Investments can go into new infrastructure to attract new industry.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17448"> 17448 </A></B>
<P>
	I recall a discussion I had with people in Atlantic Canada. They 
were saying there was an enormous opportunity now with the new 
export potential for developing food processing, food value added 
manufacturing. They new substantial new sewage treatment plants, 
new water facilities. This new jobs funds will do that.
<P>
	I suggest to the hon. member that one of the responsibilities for 
him as a Member of Parliament is not to rely on the old system 
because he recognizes, as well as everyone else does, it has been a 
deterrent to jobs. It has stood in the way of developing new 
enterprise.
<P>
	Concerning the new methods we are bringing in, the new 
employment benefits, $800 million in employment benefits, 
creating over 40,000 jobs in Quebec at this time, plus the infusion 
of a new investment fund to start helping those regions to make 
changes, to adapt, to invest, to create new industries, surely if the 
hon. member is deeply concerned about people in his own riding 
would not object to having a new economic development fund to 
help create jobs and new enterprises in his area. That is what the 
reform is about, to assist people in that transition and that 
adaptation to a different kind of economy.
<P>
	We also do it over a period of time. We are not asking people to 
go cold turkey into this. We are saying there is a five-year 
transition. Also in the legislation is a clear requirement for 
monitoring the impacts, the results, the initiatives which will be 
tabled in Parliament and will be fully transparent. We will be able 
to ask in Parliament in 1998 what has happened, what adjustments 
have to be made, if they have to be made, and what kind of other 
tools can be used.
<P>
	This will be an opportunity for members of Parliament to engage 
in a very clear evaluation of what works and what does not work, to 
share information and to be part of a process of re-evaluation and 
monitoring. We are being very open and transparent and clear 
about it.
<P>
	Rather than engaging in the wild hyperbole I heard from his 
colleague earlier this morning, we are putting the onus on the hon. 
member and others to say let us get the real facts.
<P>
<B>(1230 )</B>
<P>
	Let us get down to what is really going to happen. Let us use 
these new tools for employment. Let us use the new investment 
fund. Let us use the new opportunities to extend benefits to part 
time workers. Let us use the opportunity to extend employment 
benefits to people who have exhausted their old UI benefits, who 
want to get back to work but have no assistance right now.
<P>
	He knows that in Quebec the provincial government has cut off 
major support for people to get back to work.  We are bringing 
them back in because we recognize that people who have exhausted 
benefits have as much a desire to go back to work than anybody 
else.
<P>
	We are now giving them the opportunity to start their own 
business, to be able to use a wage supplement with employers to 
have an income supplement, to have a training voucher if the 
province agrees, and I hope they will so that we can help people get 
upgraded.
<P>
	Employment benefits such as having a job corps in their area, 
doing reforestation projects, building new infrastructure projects 
are now available to the hon. member's riding as they are to people 
across this country.
<P>
	For the life of me, I find it hard to understand why someone who 
expresses a concern about jobs for his constituents totally rejects 
the opportunity of new investment, for new employment benefits, 
to extend benefits to those who have exhausted theirs, to provide a 
supplement for families to bring up their incomes, to provide an 
extension of coverage for part time workers.
<P>
	All those things are part of the new package. I would think the 
hon. member would be applauding, supporting and working with us 
to make sure that the full benefits of all the programs are shared by 
members of his riding.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
listening to the eloquent response by the minister of human 
resources to the question from the Bloc as to how much the 
government is providing to the province of Quebec and to other 
provinces in his vision of the reform of UI.
<P>
	The motion we are debating today is that this House denounce 
the government for its massive cuts to the unemployment insurance 
system that limit access and so on. It seems to me that this type of 
motion is in line with the pathetic attitude toward this House and 
this country held by the Bloc. We are trying to build this country 
and they are trying to destroy it. It fits right in line with all the 
things they have been doing along the way.
<P>
	If this is the type of leadership that the Bloc brings to this House 
I feel rather sorry for the people of the province of Quebec if the 
member for Lac-Saint-Jean moves over there and starts to lead that 
province. I feel that they are going to continue downhill rather than 
climb out of the lethargy of unemployment that currently exists in 
that province.
<P>
	I come from the west where Alberta is one of the have provinces. 
British Columbia and Alberta are a growth area where we are 
prepared to get up and get the job done. That is the important thing. 
It is not to sit around and denounce the government. While we do 
not agree with the way the government is trying to do things, let us 
acknowledge that it is trying.
<P>
	I find it rather disconcerting that this Bloc motion again today is 
to bring down, to denounce what the government is doing rather 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17449"> 17449 </A></B>
<P>
than putting forward any  constructive efforts to try to put the 
people of Quebec back to work.
<P>
	If they were to adopt the get up and get at it attitude that we have 
in the west, they would be a lot better off. The economy would be 
better off in the province of Quebec. The country would be better 
off because those people would feel better with a positive attitude 
rather than with a negative attitude.
<P>
	As part of the doublespeak of the Bloc Quebecois, two days ago 
there was the annual general meeting of the Interparliamentary 
Union in the West Block. This is an organization that I sometimes 
call the junket club and the travel club courtesy of the Canadian 
taxpayer. For $20 one can buy an annual membership in the 
Interparliamentary Union and the government throws in half a 
million dollars to top it up in order to cover the cost of travel 
around the world. I have been a little critical of the value we are 
getting for the money that is spent.
<P>
<B>(1235 )</B>
<P>
	As a result the Liberals and the Bloc typically have joined forces 
to change the constitution of the organization to say that only those 
who agree with the aims and objectives of this organization are 
allowed to sit on the executive. As I mentioned in the House 
yesterday, the communists handled it even better.
<P>
	The point I am trying to make today is at that annual general 
meeting the Bloc supported the Liberals in changing the 
constitution to deny accountability. We asked the members of the 
Bloc why they were supporting the Liberals on this issue. They said 
that they loved to travel around the world to promote Canada. We 
were shocked.
<P>
	What are they doing within Canada? They are destroying the 
country. I believe they should be held accountable for that. I 
thought it was absolutely disgraceful that they would take 
Canadian taxpayers' dollars that are paid in B.C., Alberta, 
Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and the four eastern provinces 
and run around the world courtesy of us, accomplish absolutely 
nothing, enjoy it, then come back and say ``we love to promote 
Canada''.
<P>
	However, as soon as they put their feet back in this country they 
are tearing it apart, knocking it down and trying to destroy it. Let us 
recognize where the Bloc is coming from. The attitude of its 
members is that anything which interferes with their opportunity to 
spend Canadians' money while they follow through with their 
objectives is to be applauded. I denounce them for that type of 
attitude.
<P>
	This motion is strictly for consumption in the province of 
Quebec. I listened to the debate by the Bloc member. Typical of 
their attitude, they want Canadians to pay more so they can receive 
more. In a totally lopsided argument they want to ensure that 
money flows one way  from the rest of Canada to them. Yet they are 
so spoiled that they want to break away and build some kind of 
sovereignty association that continues this idea, however false. It is 
totally false that we would think about supporting them should they 
ever separate from this country.
<P>
	During the referendum the member for Lac-Saint-Jean who was 
leading the yes forces said: ``Remember, they will punish us 
because we're the ones who are getting the unemployment 
insurance while all the rest are getting the investments credits''. I 
say to them now is the time to get off their posteriors and get back 
to work. They should not worry about unemployment insurance but 
think more about employment. That is what the rest of the country 
is doing.
<P>
	We have seen the Minister of Human Resource Development 
change the name of unemployment insurance to employment 
insurance. I do not think that words are going to do very much. 
However, perhaps the idea is a small step in the right direction.
<P>
	The UI reform that is being proposed is a continuation of this 
centralist, top down, one shoe fits all approach by the Liberal 
government. It is not going to work. More tinkering with the 
system is not what we need. There is nothing that is radically new 
in the bill brought down by the Liberals. There is nothing 
refreshing. There is no rethinking of UI. Yes, they have expanded a 
little bit. Yes, they are going to refund some premiums to some 
people. Yes, they are going to cover some more groups. Yes, they 
are going to do a few things.
<P>
	The Liberals have just massaged unemployment insurance 
around the edges. They have not said that for the past 20 or more 
years unemployment in this country has hovered around 10 per 
cent. It does not matter how much money is spent on the program. 
Unemployment seems to hover around 10 per cent. If we look 
around at other countries we find that unemployment is 
significantly lower. With our friends to the south of us 
unemployment consistently runs to about 3 per cent less than ours. 
We must spend more money to fix our problem and yet 
unemployment continues at 10 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	What is the problem? Perhaps the problem is that there is not 
enough incentive to work and there is too much incentive not to 
work. Why does the Minister of Human Resources Development 
not have a new approach to UI rather than just expanding it around 
the edges.
<P>
	I will give a couple of examples and perhaps the Minister of 
Human Resources Development can take notes. I was in Atlantic 
Canada last year talking to some good Reformers down there. 
There are lots of Reformers in Atlantic Canada. This particular 
Reformer was telling me that when she was young going to college 
there were all kinds of summer jobs in Atlantic Canada for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17450"> 17450 </A></B>
<P>
students:  in the hotels, in the restaurants. The tourist season was on 
and there were all kinds of opportunities.
<P>
	The last year she was in university the Liberal government, 20 
odd years ago, changed the rules to say: ``We will now pay 
unemployment insurance to seasonal workers''. Housewives came 
out of their homes, worked for four months, spent eight months at 
home. It absolutely destroyed the labour market for the kids 
coming out of university. That is a simple situation of cause and 
effect.
<P>
	I know there are many families in this country who depend on 
seasonal work and unemployment insurance for their livelihood. It 
is not that I am denigrating that, but when the rule was introduced 
20-odd years ago it should have been foreseen that not only would 
it cause dependency on UI in a seasonal environment but that it 
would destroy employment for university students who needed to 
make some money during the summer. We aggravated the 
situation.
<P>
	However, we keep tinkering to try to resolve the problems that 
we created, rather than looking back and saying: ``Look at the 
Pandora's box that we opened''.
<P>
	The young people in this country are motivated, enthused and 
they are want to work. They do not want UI. They want jobs. 
Remember the great theme of the government prior to the last 
election: jobs, jobs, jobs. They waved the red book and said: ``This 
is going to be jobs, jobs, jobs. Vote for us and there are going to be 
jobs everywhere''.
<P>
	The President of the Treasury Board is the minister in charge of 
doling out the $6 billion in borrowed money to try to create some 
jobs. He appeared before the government operations committee to 
explain the wonderful success of the jobs, jobs, jobs program and 
the wonderful success of the infrastructure program because now 
the country is $6 billion further in debt. We all hoped that we were 
going to get something wonderful for this significant investment.
<P>
	He told us the infrastructure program created 8,000 permanent 
jobs which is $750,000 of borrowed money per job. We would have 
been better giving the interest on the money to the people and 
telling them to stay home. They would have had a lot more money 
and we would have been a lot less in debt.
<P>
	Now we have the Minister of Human Resources Development 
tinkering to change the UI program to help those people who did 
not get a job even though they were promised one in the last 
election. There is something wrong here. There is something wrong 
with what the Minister of Human Resources Development is 
proposing. There is something wrong with what this government 
has proposed. By the way, it has not proposed very much in the last 
two years. However it did put us $6 billion more into debt to create 
8,000 jobs.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	Where are the young folk? Their hope is waning. Their 
motivation is waning. They are becoming discouraged, and the 
Minister of Human Resources Development says: ``If you get a part 
time job we will cover you with EI''. That is not what they want. 
They are motivated and they want to work.
<P>
	A constituent came into my office a few months ago. He was an 
enthusiastic young gentleman with a university education. He was 
willing to work. He had done all kinds of volunteer work. He had 
spent 600 hours a year volunteering to help the RCMP. He had a 
dream of becoming a mountie. Can he? No. He is a white male. 
Reverse discrimination has killed his dream.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development says: ``I have a 
program for you. It is not called unemployment any longer; it is 
called employment. Sit at home and we will send you a cheque''. 
He is a young intelligent fellow who wants to work and contributes 
to the country of his own free will by volunteering because he 
wants to get ahead. He wants to do the best he can for himself. He 
thinks he has a future ahead of him, but employment equity slapped 
him down.
<P>
	That is the type of thing at which the Minister of Human 
Resources Development should be looking. The young, the 
motivated, the intelligent and the educated should have every 
opportunity to get ahead. It does not matter who they are, what they 
are or where they are. If the minister would appreciate that, we 
would have a lot less need for the program changes about which he 
is talking.
<P>
	I talked about the need for some innovative thinking. Today 
when a person pays unemployment insurance the employer has to 
pay that amount multiplied by 1.4. There is a direct relationship 
between what the employee pays and what the employer pays. It is 
a total, fixed, absolute relationship.
<P>
	There are employers who on a continuous basis turn their 
employees over to the UI system. They are seasonal employers. We 
read about one of them in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> yesterday. General 
Motors uses UI when it shuts down the factories for retooling and 
so on. On a regular basis they are turning their employees out to the 
UI system, hoping it is okay, and hiring them back when they want.
<P>
	Why do we not recognize that some employers use the system a 
lot more than others and change the premium according to risk? It 
is a fairly simple situation. We could count the number of T4s 
issued at the end of the year, count the number of pink slips issued 
during the year, find the ratio, determine whether it is a high risk 
employer or a low risk employer and grade the premium 
accordingly.
<P>
	That would give the employer the incentive to keep staff during 
slack times. It might even give the employer  the incentive to create 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17451"> 17451 </A></B>
<P>
new work during slack times. The employer knows that if he uses 
his business experience to extend the employment of his employees 
he will be rewarded. That is what it is all about. Rather than a 
bureaucrat in Ottawa saying what the rules are, the decision making 
should be made on the shop floor by the manager.
<P>
	The same also applies to the employee side. What about the 
employee who loses his job, who is laid off for whatever reason and 
runs out to get a job right away? He is motivated. Then there is the 
other employee who will say: ``I am covered for a year. I will take 
three or four months off and then I will be slow about looking for a 
job''. He will be employed within the year, before his UI runs out.
<P>
<B>(1250 )</B>
<P>
	What about the seasonal worker who says: ``I am quite content to 
sit at home during the wintertime because I happen to be a greens 
keeper on a golf course?'' Since there is not too much grass to cut 
in the winter he is not required to look for a job in the winter. UI 
will carry him.
<P>
	Since this person is a frequent user of UI he should pay a higher 
premium than the other person who has stable employment or does 
not use UI very often even though he changes jobs. We could grade 
his premium to give him the incentive to stay employed rather than 
being on and off UI.
<P>
	It is a relatively simple situation. We grade people on income tax 
when the employer knows their deductions for income tax. I think 
the same type of situation could be used for UI. I throw that out for 
the minister's benefit. I am am talking about a new approach to UI, 
a decentralized approach to UI, something that merits being 
explored.
<P>
	While the minister may have taken a small step on UI reform, he 
missed the wonderful opportunity of taking a great step forward. 
Along with his colleagues he has totally and absolutely failed in 
delivering the electoral promise of jobs, jobs, jobs. This is why we 
still have a 10 per cent rate of UI and why his program, as changed, 
will not work.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened to 
the member's discussion. I found it odd what Reform Party 
members say on this issue. I remember when they first came to the 
House and how they were to make a positive contribution. They 
were to support the government.
<P>
	This piece of legislation is very important for the domestic 
economy and for making our manufacturing sector competitive 
within the world. The unemployment insurance rates in Canada are 
some of the highest in the western world. Many people feel that 
because of their attractiveness to some extent the rates have had a 
significant effect on our ability to compete.
<P>
	I recall in my own practice as an accountant dealing with small 
businesses. There was an ongoing problem of people refusing to 
take jobs at a time when they were already receiving 
unemployment insurance benefits because the cost of physically 
travelling to the place of employment or having to employ 
babysitters, et cetera, meant they would receive less than by sitting 
home and drawing benefits. In some ways this piece of legislation 
lowers those benefits in recognition that we have reduced the 
competitiveness of our labour force.
<P>
	I listened to Bloc members go on and on about the need for 
underpinning the social structure of the country and possibly 
workers in Quebec. The Quebec Manufacturers Association 
recently published a study showing that competitive labour rates 
within that province were some of the worst in Canada, which 
makes its ability to compete worse than that of many other 
provinces. As a consequence it creates a situation of continued 
unemployment.
<P>
	The hon. member said that we missed an opportunity. I also 
heard him say that he wanted to devolve. I think devolve is the 
operative word of the Reform Party today. Let us call devolve what 
it really is. It means to destroy or tear down a system which creates 
labour mobility and allows people to move from province to 
province to seek employment. Would he reflect on the history and 
recognize the positive initiative that has been taken by the 
government to increase our competitiveness in international trade, 
to keep the underpinnings of a mobile labour force and to recognize 
the object of employment is to get people back to work and to 
increase their skill levels?
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, the new buzzword is employment. 
Unemployment has gone away. This must be to hide behind the fact 
that the whole concept of jobs, jobs, jobs has failed and people are 
still unemployed.
<P>
	It would be wonderful if all the people who thought they would 
get jobs and voted for the Liberal Party because it promised them 
jobs had employment. However they do not and it is 
unemployment insurance we are talking about. It does not matter 
how they want to dress it up.
<P>
	I am glad the member recognized that perhaps our UI programs 
have been a disincentive and have hurt our competitiveness around 
the world.
<P>
	We are debating a motion put forward by the Bloc from the 
province of Quebec. I remember reading an article some months 
ago about MIL shipyards in the province of Quebec unfortunately 
running out of ships to build. The average wage in the shipyards 
was $34 an hour. They were not competitive and could not get any 
more orders. They wanted the federal government to give them 
some work, to build more ferries that we really did not need, until 
such time as they could re-engineer the  productivity of the factory 
to allow them to break into the international shipbuilding market.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17452"> 17452 </A></B>
<P>
	MIL Davie did not have a hope of breaking into the international 
shipbuilding market because it was paying its workers $34 an hour. 
They are now out of work. Where are they? They are part of the 
package of unemployed people the minister of human resources is 
trying to help.
<P>
	We have to provide incentives at the managerial level in the 
workforce. I did not say anything about devolution in this situation. 
I said we should put the incentives where they can be managed, at 
the managerial level of the workforce. I also gave a proposition on 
how we could look at it. I was surprised and disappointed that the 
member continued to hang on to the idea of centralist decision 
making: one shoe fits all; the people in the big wide world are 
incapable of making any decisions for themselves; it has to be done 
here in Ottawa. As a businessman I would have thought he would 
have realized that there is a great benefit in giving people control 
over their own lives and control over their own decisions. The 
whole government is missing that opportunity time, time and time 
again.
<P>
	That is the unfortunate truth and that is why we are in a mess.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened very 
carefully to my colleague from St. Albert. I wondered at the start 
whether or not he was talking about the motion before the House. I 
have lots of comments about that but I will only make one. He 
complained about the IPU and said that only people who agreed 
with the aims and objectives of the organization were permitted on 
the executive.
<P>
	My hon. colleague represents the party that is constantly 
pointing out that if hon. members representing Quebec and the 
Bloc Quebecois are here they are not following the aims and 
objectives of Parliament, which is obviously to do the best we can 
for the people of Canada. I am not sure how he can have it both 
ways. He also mentioned his vendetta against those members who 
travel on some of these things to learn about other parts of the 
world and so on. Yet I notice he is very interested in 
competitiveness around the world and Canada's competitiveness, 
providing jobs. I do not know how he thinks we are will achieve 
that by sitting at home in Prince Alberta and gazing at our navels.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	He has said all decision making is here in Ottawa and that the bill 
does not address that. The bill replaces 39 programs, which 
certainly suggests the people in Ottawa know best where each 
program should go with five which put a great deal of decision 
making with the local people. In my riding people are already 
taking advantage of this.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thought the member for Oxford 
had been around here for a couple of years. I have been around here 
for a couple of years. I thought he was elected the same time as I 
was.
<P>
	To think Bloc Quebecois aims and objectives in the House are 
the same as those of the rest of us, where has he been? Its objective 
is to destroy the country and the House, while I would hope the 
objective of the rest of us is to build the country and strengthen the 
House. Let us get that absolutely clear. If the member for Oxford 
has not realized that yet, please tell him to wake up, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	On the IPU, we have thought police in this town and the 
constitution of the IPU was changed by the Liberals and the Bloc, 
not by Reform. We voted absolutely against it. They voted to say 
only those who agree with the aims and objectives of the 
organization are allowed to sit on the executive. Who is to police 
this? I asked the chairman who is to police this. I guess it is 
something called osmosis or it percolates up to the top where your 
ideas are better than my ideas or you are right and I am wrong.
<P>
	The constitution does not say how the IPU is to police this new 
rule. I stand up for the taxpayers of Canada who are throwing half a 
million dollars into that junket club so these Liberals and Bloc 
members can run around the world and bring back pieces of paper 
to table in the House so they can collect some dust. They call that 
building on experience and improving our competitiveness around 
the world. Again I say to the member it is time to wake up.
<P>
	We cannot afford it. They should not be doing it. We have to get 
real in the House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as I begin my speech, and considering previous 
comments, perhaps it would be wise to repeat the text of the motion 
before the House today. The hon. member for Mercier moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House denounce the government for its massive cuts to the 
unemployment insurance system that limit access to the program and hit young 
people, women, seasonal workers and immigrants hard.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The word Quebec does not appear in this motion. The motion 
clearly includes all Quebecers and Canadians, especially the people 
in the Maritimes, and I will get back to that in a moment.
<P>
	First, I also want to say that my comments today also reflect the 
results of consultations I have conducted since last Friday in the 
form of a series of conferences, including three telephone 
conferences, mostly with people from my riding in the Gaspé. 
There is a consensus that emerges from these consultations which, 
in addition to the unions and workers, included employers, 
members of the Chambers of Commerce and people from all walks 
of life.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17453"> 17453 </A></B>
<P>
	Several aspects of the reform proposal have their merits. For 
instance, the fact that low-income families will have a chance to 
get higher benefits. However, there are major aspects that need 
changing, and they are part of the consensus I will share with you.
<P>
	First, the requirement of 910 hours of work for first-time 
contributors to the unemployment insurance plan. Previously, to be 
eligible, the maximum requirement for a first-time contributor was 
20 weeks, 15 hours per week, which adds up to 300 hours.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	Applying the same principle to these proposals, the government 
could have said 700 hours, the maximum for regions where the 
unemployment rate is not as high. But that is not what they did. 
They set the maximum at 910 hours, to be eligible for the plan.
<P>
	This means that someone who works 35 hours a week will have 
to work 26 weeks full time to be eligible, and this means in one 
year. If the following year you are back to square one, this means, 
as it says in our motion, young people and women-because in 
most cases women or young people who enter the labour market 
will be hit hard by this measure-seasonal workers, plus those who 
arrive on the labour market and immigrants getting their first job in 
Canada will all be affected.
<P>
	What was the rationale for setting this number of hours? How 
could Liberal members, elected on a platform that stressed jobs, 
have done that? The best way to get someone a job is to give him an 
incentive to work. The proposed system will ensure that people 
who have worked 600, 700 or 800 hours will have to go on welfare 
as a matter of course. That is not a big incentive to work.
<P>
	I think something should have been included to give people a 
taste for better benefits, something worthwhile. So, in addition to 
not providing any job creation program with the choices it made, 
and not proposing a way to transform regional economies, the 
government is waving a stick and telling workers they will have to 
work 910 hours; that is the way it will get them working longer. But 
first there have to be jobs.
<P>
	I think our motion constructively criticizes this position, and the 
government will have to fix up its requirement of 910 hours. This is 
the consensus of the people in a region such as eastern Quebec. 
Why? Because it will lead to an exodus of young people as well. It 
will swell the numbers of young people who have been leaving 
over the past 10 or 15 years.
<P>
	If somebody works 12 thirty-five hour weeks, he will have 700 
hours. He will be short 210 hours, but there is no work in his 
region. Where is he going to find work? He will have to move to a 
major centre. This will reduce the regional economy in a number of 
sectors.
<P>
	This measure severely punishes the regions, it is backward 
looking and must be withdrawn.
<P>
	Another point we agree on is the need to eliminate the penalty 
against seasonal workers. Give me one reason why employment in 
a seasonal industry, such as forestry, fishing or tourism, should 
result in punishment for the worker whose benefits will be reduced 
according to his use of the unemployment insurance plan?
<P>
	Why is it this way when it is not the case for workers in an 
industry that is not seasonal? This, to me, is totally unacceptable. I 
see it as rather an insult to Canada's regions as well, although their 
development of seasonal industry has been praised. Their 
contribution to the Canadian economy is readily accepted, and 
then, suddenly, the rules are changed and the people penalized and 
no job creation adjustment program is provided.
<P>
	This leaves a group of very perplexed members, including the 
Liberal members for the maritimes, members such as those from 
St. John's East, Annapolis Valley-Hants, Madawaska-Victoria, 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine in Quebec, all those who 
come from ridings hit hard by this policy, which offers no remedy 
to change the situation. I am willing to bet that, when the policy is 
reviewed in three years, as provided for in the legislation, it will be 
assessed as having a disastrous impact because there was no 
program to revitalize the economy of these regions as they were 
being penalized.
<P>
	It will have taken three more years to arrive at the same result. I 
think we might as well correct the situation right away.
<P>
	I would like to show you what this will mean for people, not in 
theory but in real life. Someone who works 12 weeks at an average 
salary of $500 a week can now receive benefits equal to 55 per cent 
of his or her salary, or $275.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	Under the new program, this person will have to work more 
hours per week for a longer period in order to qualify for benefits 
that will drop from $275 a week to $214. We in this House make 
good money. If our pay cheques were reduced by $50, it would not 
be so bad, we might be able to live with it. However, if someone's 
earnings fell from $275 a week to $214, he would wonder how he 
could feed his children every day of the month.
<P>
	This kind of money is on a par with welfare. You think this is an 
incentive to work? This is totally unacceptable and I think that the 
government should use the time when the bill is in committee to 
correct these problems. The people affected should be able to tell 
the government what it means in real life to go from $275 a week to 
$214, to make the government understand how the bill would affect 
them in real life.
<P>
	Especially since, with the reduction in the number of weeks of 
work required to qualify for UI, the end of the tunnel is welfare. 
What a great incentive.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17454"> 17454 </A></B>
<P>
	My arguments are not only those of someone from eastern 
Quebec. It concerns everyone in Quebec and Canada. Away from 
the centre every area will be affected by this and confronted to 
it. We must all join in condemning this government proposal and 
in seeing to it that changes are made.
<P>
	We could assume that, perhaps, the government had no choice 
but to go about it this way. Perhaps there are financial constraints 
holding it back. But now this: a lower limit. It makes no sense. In 
the past, the contribution limit was $42,000 in salary. In the future, 
the limit will be $39,000. This means that high paid workers, the 
higher middle class and high paid workers will be 
contributing-listen to this-$900 million less to the UI fund.
<P>
	This government claimed to be here to create jobs and help the 
jobless and those whose skills were not adequate for the labour 
market to find a job. So what did the government do? In its reform, 
one of its most regressive initiatives, it lowers the ceiling and, as a 
result, high paid workers will be contributing $900 million less to 
the plan.
<P>
	Do you know where the government will take the missing $900 
million? In the pockets of new contributors, those who did not 
make contributions before, who will now have to work for 910 
hours to qualify for benefits but who, while making contributions, 
if they work ten hours a week during 50 weeks, for a total of 500 
hours in the year, will not be refunded fully.
<P>
	These measures are unacceptable. The UI program may be in 
need of a reform. It might have been a good idea to set up an 
employment insurance system. The problem is that the government 
gave a nice label to a reform that only seeks to make cuts and help 
reduce the deficit. We are still wondering: if this is the contribution 
of UI claimants to help reduce the deficit, then what will others be 
made to contribute? What will be the Royal Bank's contribution, 
considering it made one billion dollars in profits last year. One 
billion is more than small change. It is more than the difference 
between weekly UI benefits of $275 and $214.
<P>
	The government will have to show that it is also going to get 
money from those people. In the meantime, it must amend its 
reform and it must do so urgently. One wonders what prevented the 
government from introducing, before its reform or at least at the 
same time, a job creation policy or a regional economic 
diversification initiative. What prevented the government from 
showing people that it was going to take positive measures to 
ensure that regions such as eastern Quebec can get on the new 
technology express and fully adjust. Why did the current 
government not take such action?
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	Why is it bent on targeting only the most vulnerable people? It 
would have been nice to hear something like:  ``As regards our 
young people, we will, in certain regions, set up job creation 
programs that will allow them to gain a first year of solid 
experience, to develop their entrepreneurship, and to see if they 
want to become entrepreneurs''.
<P>
	Let us look at one of the five aspects of job creation dealing with 
self-employed workers. Basically, it is a very good program 
permitting someone on UI to start a business. Interesting 
experiments have been tried under this program. But now, with the 
910 hour requirement for first time applicants, a lot of people are 
going to be left out in the cold. But, if these people were eligible to 
UI, they could put forward a business plan, start their own business 
and eventually take some pressure off the unemployment insurance 
system instead of remaining dependent on it.
<P>
	It seems to me that this reform lacks originality, initiative, and 
the new ideas which might have been put on the table and which we 
would have hoped to see in here, especially after nearly two years 
of consultation. This is another part of the reform that should 
scrutinized.
<P>
	Lat year, I toured Canada with the human resources committee. 
We went across Canada to find out what kind of reform people 
wanted. Nowhere did I hear: ``The number of hours to become 
eligible to UI benefits should be increased, seasonal worker 
benefits should be diminished''. Nowhere in Canada did I hear this 
kind of thing.
<P>
	However, I was told, for example: ``True, there might be some 
economic problems in certain areas; some things have to be fixed, 
and we must be given the means to do it''. But, do not present us 
with a fait accompli, as the government is doing.
<P>
	What kind of effect is this going to have on regional economy? 
Take the Maritimes, for example; those of you who represent 
ridings in Atlantic Canada, figure it out: three years from now, all 
your seasonal workers will be down to 50 per cent only. They speak 
in terms of 20-week periods. A 20-week period does not mean a 
reduction of one per cent a year, it means a reduction of one per 
cent of the salary each time one receives unemployment insurance 
benefits for 20 weeks. Therefore, in three years, there will be 5 per 
cent less benefits paid in the regions.
<P>
	The spinoffs of that will not be job creation but quite the 
opposite. When jobs are created, another more convenience store 
opens somewhere and another service job is offered to someone. 
But these cuts produce the opposite. There will be less money in 
our economy so there will be less jobs of that kind, there will be 
more people on welfare, through one program or another, and more 
people will leave the region.
<P>
	Instead of breaking the vicious circle that leads to an exodus 
from the regions, measures like this will tighten it  and the result 
will the opposite of what is expected. This reminds me of the 
disheartening experience I had last year somewhere in 
Newfoundland, in an employment centre, where I found a 
document in a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17455"> 17455 </A></B>
<P>
display case. It was a Human Resources Development Canada 
document that encouraged people to move, to give up and to go live 
somewhere else. That does not ensure the future of a country, be it 
Quebec or Canada. A healthy country is one which capitalizes on 
its resources and develops them and one which gives recognition to 
people who work.
<P>
	If seasonal workers are blamed for the situation their industry is 
in and for the fact that they cannot work for a longer period, the 
mid term consequence will be a lack of manpower in part time 
industries. The tourist industry already has that kind of problem. I 
can tell you the new plan will only make it worse and will further 
widen the incredible gap we have between available jobs and 
unemployed workers who do not have the skills and training to fill 
those jobs. The hon. member for Mercier has moved the motion 
before us because of this whole reform.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	The government, through massive UI cuts, limits access to the 
program and sets goals that are the very opposite of those we 
should have in a society such as ours and our society should be 
judged by, that is the best use possible of its human resources.
<P>
	The present Liberal government perpetuates the ways of the 
previous government it ousted. People voted for change, but the 
government has fallen back into the same old ways. It is high time 
you woke up, and swept out the bureaucrats that come up with such 
proposals for cabinet. You have to get rid of them, because the 
current government will be judged not necessarily on the way the 
richer people are allowed to prosper and the more talented are 
allowed to perform, but rather on the way it ensures that society 
reaches its full potential, that all Canadians can make a useful 
contribution and be proud of what they are doing in building 
something worthwhile together.
<P>
	If you continue to penalize the people in this way, you will 
achieve the exact opposite of what you are looking for.
<P>
	I challenge the government to let the Standing Committee on 
Human Resource Development travel to Atlantic Canada and 
throughout Canada, even to the large urban areas, to talk to the 
people and realize that seasonal workers are not the only ones who 
will be affected by the decrease in benefits. The government has 
now decided to clip the wings of the workers who in the 20 to 30 
year age group and who have not had the opportunities that we have 
had, and that is totally unacceptable.
<P>
	So, if the government wants to check if its reform makes a lot of 
sense and if it does not believe the points I  just made, it only has to 
talk to the people to find out what they think. You will see that it 
will come back with a totally different reform than the one now 
before the House.
<P>
	I hope that the Liberal government will take advantage of the 
holiday season to reflect on this, propose changes and ensure that 
Quebecers and Canadians can continue to be proud of the balance 
between the citizens, and realize that the future does not depend on 
development in big cities, on a lower unemployment rate in 
Montreal and Toronto, but on the premise that Canadians and their 
families from sea to sea to sea are satisfied and happy with what 
they are contributing to.
<P>
	I think the government has tabled something that needs to be 
reviewed. That is why the House should condemn the government 
for its cuts to the unemployment insurance program. This should be 
in particular the responsibility of the members, who might have 
reviewed the reform a little in their caucus and may have had the 
time to express some points. Today, we will see if the members, 
especially those from the Maritimes, stand for the Liberal Party or 
for the people they represent.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to question the statements 
made by the member to the House. I suspect he might have 
selectively read from the reform, rather than reading it from one 
end to the other.
<P>
	The hon. member asked a question about the whole issue of 
incentives for employment and for job creation. He indicated in his 
speech that he could not see any incentives. I want to ask him about 
that because I have difficulty understanding that he read this 
document.
<P>
	I see items such as $800 million being put into specific programs 
to encourage employment. I look at wage subsidies to encourage 
employers to hire people, particularly those who need to be trained. 
I look at earning supplements to top up wages to encourage people 
to get back into the workforce rather than having to collect 
benefits.
<P>
	The hon. member talked about the self-employment initiative 
program. That was in UI. It continues to be in the UI reform. It is an 
excellent program which is going to create a lot of employment. 
The hon. member suggested that people would not be able to use it 
because they would not be able to get onto the program. In fact, 
half a million people who were not eligible for the program 
because they were part time workers are now going to be eligible 
for the program.
<P>
	The member keeps going on that there are no incentives. People 
are going to be rewarded for every hour they work and for every 
effort they make. The benefits are based on hours worked, not on 
weeks. A whole series of things in this reform encourage people to  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17456"> 17456 </A></B>
<P>
work. It gives them the incentive to work. It gives them financial 
support to work.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	The hon. member totally ignores those things. He fails to look at 
those parts of the employment insurance reform which will result 
in opportunities for people to get a job. The fact is that this is all 
taking place within a financial context which he totally wants to 
ignore. He will not look at those things.
<P>
	My question to the hon. member is very specific. Why do you 
ignore those things in the UI reform? Why do you ignore the $800 
million which is being added to the $1.9 billion that already exists 
to create employment not only in English Canada but in your 
province of Quebec as well? Why are you ignoring those things? 
Why will you not talk about those things? Why will you not 
admit-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I would ask that questions be put through 
the Chair, not directly to the member.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, my first response to this remark is this, 
and I think it is important. The member asked me why we have not 
read the reform proposal from cover to cover, why we do not have 
all the details.
<P>
	There is a contradiction between the member and his 
government. The government has used closure to limit the debate 
to three hours on Monday. It is muzzling us because it does not 
want a real debate on this bill at second reading. It is doing that 
because it wants to hide this reform before the Christmas holidays, 
so that we will have to go home without having had the time to 
show Canadians that it is unacceptable.
<P>
	About the $800 million, it is obvious that it is not $800 million at 
all since it is just money being transferred from the consolidated 
revenue fund and the unemployment insurance fund. The 
government has tried all week to confuse us on this issue, getting 
quite confused itself in the answers of the various ministers. It is 
certainly not today that it will succeed in convincing us.
<P>
	I want to make a last comment. It is simple and obvious. Go back 
to your ridings to explain to the people that the 910 hour minimum 
requirement is reasonable. Ask your constituents if they think it is 
reasonable to require that people who participate in the 
unemployment insurance program for the first time work a 
minimum of 910 hours in order to become eligible. You will all 
come back with the same answer after the Christmas break, or 
maybe even next week.
<P>
	Is it reasonable to require that these new workers-I am talking 
about our young people, about women who enter the job market, 
about immigrants who come to Canada-work a minimum of 910 
hours when the previous requirement was 300 hours and when the 
highest requirement for people who are already  contributing to the 
program is 700 hours? Is it reasonable to impose a 910 hour 
minimum requirement to those people to whom we claim to want 
to give an incentive to work, when it is obvious that this kind of 
measure will do exactly the opposite? We will see within a year that 
a vast majority of people will be discouraged. This will stimulate 
the underground economy and force Canadians onto welfare.
<P>
	If the government has not understood that, it will have to make 
some adjustments; otherwise it will have to face a lot of angry 
people. As Gilles Vigneault once said, ``it will have quite a storm 
on its hands''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Murphy (Annapolis Valley-Hants, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have great difficulty understanding why the Bloc does 
not want to look at the initiatives surrounding employment which 
are being brought forward by these reforms.
<P>
	Are the Bloc members aware that the insurance program will 
cover 500,000 more people? Are they aware that the family income 
supplement will go to 350,000 low income families? Are they 
aware that 380,000 workers will have their premiums refunded? 
Some 2,700 workers will eligible for two additional weeks of 
benefit. About 45,000 seasonal workers who currently are not 
eligible for UI will, despite making payments, become eligible 
under this new act.
<P>
	Are they are not interested in putting people back to work? Do 
they not see that this reform of ours on the employment side is 
doing just that? I ask the hon. member to tell me and tell the House 
why he and his party cannot see that these changes on the 
employment side will be very beneficial for the whole country.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is asking the same 
question I asked the minister this morning. He said that there would 
be 500,000 more contributors to the program. We all know that 
there will be 500,000 more contributors, but what we want to know 
is how many of these 500,000 people will ever get benefits.
<P>
	How many will pay and never benefit from the program? I am 
very surprised. Many of the questions we would like answers to are 
like this. Before the referendum, the government did not want to 
introduce this bill, because it had to be looked at carefully. Today, 
they are in a great hurry. They want us to pass this legislation on the 
double.
<P>
	What is behind this new position of the government?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It being 1.30 p.m., it is my duty to inform 
the House that pursuant to Standing Order 81, proceedings on the 
motion have expired.

	<B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> moved 
that Bill C-323, an act to amend the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act 
(order of discharge), be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak on my Bill C-323. 
Prior to the last election I served as a probation officer and family 
court counsellor in the British Columbia provincial attorney 
general's ministry. I served for over 20 years. I spent each day 
working with the Canadian Criminal Code and I learned firsthand 
the system's weaknesses and strengths. I also discovered the 
loopholes that aided offenders to walk when they should have been 
properly held to account. Far too often I saw justice not being 
served. The criminals were benefiting and the victims were not 
served. There was little neglected victims to do. Advancing the 
plight of victims of crime is one of the motivations for me to serve 
in the House.
<P>
	When constituents in New Westminster-Burnaby elected me as 
their representative in 1993 I made a commitment to take a firm 
stand on behalf of the victims of crime. Whether changes to the 
Canadian Criminal Code or to some other statute, I promised 
something would be done to protect the public and to change the 
balance of the operation of the law to be more in favour of victims.
<P>
	On May 1 of this year I had the distinct pleasure to introduce Bill 
C-323. Today there is even a greater satisfaction that the bill was 
deemed a votable item with a chance of becoming law. Small 
changes such as those in Bill C-323 may not sufficiently change the 
overall system to the way we would like but it certainly represents 
a good start.
<P>
	Approximately a year and a half ago a Vancouver area lawyer 
approached me with a concern that a loophole in the Bankruptcy 
and Insolvency Act was enabling offenders to be relieved of their 
commitment to pay civil court judgments. It was a loophole that 
was causing victims further suffering. It was clear that a simple  
amendment to the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act would eliminate 
the possibility for a person to use personal bankruptcy to escape 
from any owed damages awarded in civil court. Thus I have been 
working to bring forward my private member's bill.
<P>
	When a person commits an assault or battery, a wilful act that 
harms another, the victims can sue for damages through a civil 
lawsuit. However, under the current BIA if the offender claims 
bankruptcy after being found liable in court the damages awarded 
to the victim are cleared, causing the victim to once again suffer 
hardship.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	Subsection 178(1) of the bankruptcy act lists various things an 
order of discharge does not release a bankrupt person from. The 
law has long recognized there are some things that cannot be 
forgiven and will remain. It takes into account alimony, 
maintenance and support of a spouse or child, debt arising out of 
fraud, embezzlement or a fine, penalty or restitution order imposed 
by a criminal court in respect of an offence.
<P>
	Therefore according to the way the act currently reads a bankrupt 
person cannot be relieved of paying a traffic fine yet can be 
relieved of paying damages for something like sexual assault. I do 
not think any member of the House would disagree the statute must 
be changed as soon as possible. We must provide some appropriate 
balance.
<P>
	In April I read an article in the Vancouver <I>Province</I> newspaper 
about Sherleen Hackett who was awarded $145,000 in damages for 
sexual abuse by her stepfather on June 28, 1991. Stepfather James 
Hackett was ordered to make payments of $500 a month. 
According to the article he made one full payment of $500, four 
payments of $100, and then filed for bankruptcy. It was as easy as 
that to turn the legal system on its head.
<P>
	Allow me to cite several other examples so those following can 
fully comprehend the severity of the fundamental flaw in this 
statute. Tammy Carr of White Rock, B.C. sued her stepfather for 
sexually assaulting her for six years and was awarded $42,513. Her 
stepfather, David Graham, filed for bankruptcy six months after the 
judgment. Payment to date: none.
<P>
	Cynthia Shefford of Alexis Creek, B.C. was awarded $357,743 
by a supreme court jury for the sexual abuse committed by her 
father, Leonard Klassen. The father was ordered to pay his daughter 
$500 a month for 12 years. Three months after the trial Klassen 
filed for bankruptcy. Payment to date: none. The amount of 
Shefford's award is the largest awarded in the country to date, but 
what good is it to have such a record amount if not a penny is 
received by the one who needs it most, the victim?
<P>
	My bill would make a simple amendment to subsection 178(1) 
of the act, as part (a) of the act currently says that an order of 
discharge does not release the bankrupt from  any fine, penalty, 
restitution order or other in similar nature to a fine, penalty or 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17458"> 17458 </A></B>
<P>
restitution order imposed by a court in respect of an offence or any 
debt arising out of a recognizance of bail.
<P>
	Bill C-323 would make an addition to this part:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>An order of discharge does not release the bankrupt from any damages in 
respect of an assault or battery awarded by a court pursuant to a judgment 
rendered in a civil proceeding and any interest on the damages before or after 
judgment ordered by the court or payable by law.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The amendment is a brief but fundamental change to the act. Not 
only would it strengthen the statute in legal terms, it would 
strengthen the public's view of the operation of Canada's justice 
system. Some of the imbalance and absurdity in law would be 
removed.
<P>
	I do not think many Canadians know debtors may currently 
avoid substantial payment on sexual assault judgments by making 
an assignment in bankruptcy. However, as more and more people 
file their cases in the courts, public awareness will increase. The 
more our legal system gives the offender a loophole, the more 
disregard will arise.
<P>
	If is nothing is done to such a small section of the Bankruptcy 
and Insolvency Act the justice system as a whole will be in danger 
of being viewed as completely in disrepute. The sad thing is 
Canadians already look at our justice system and think it is not 
reflective of them.
<P>
	One need look only at the Young Offenders Act to see examples 
of ineffectiveness. The government continues to claim what it is 
doing will save lives and make Canadians feel more safe. In the last 
two years the Liberal government has made several changes to the 
Criminal Code and the Young Offenders Act, and yet my 
constituents still complain to me they feel afraid to walk the streets.
<P>
	The government says these changes need time to be 
implemented but I believe it knows that all the time in the world to 
discuss and defer will make absolutely no difference to the crime 
statistics. The criminal law changes made so far by the government 
are anaemic and do not sufficiently respond to the desires of 
mainstream Canadian values.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	The situation is similar to that with intersections and street 
lights. Before a municipality will put up a street light at a busy 
intersection it waits for a certain number of serious accidents to 
occur. If no accidents occur, it is believed a street light is not 
needed. Usually someone has to die first.
<P>
	Therefore a responsible government would address a problem 
before it gets out of control. The amendment in my bill should have 
been introduced years ago or at least near the time that such cases 
were coming before the courts.
<P>
	This is the job of federal departments. There are legal experts 
who must know the bankruptcy act inside and out. They knew there 
were loopholes in subsection 178 for years but until now nobody 
has addressed them.
<P>
	In 1992 British Columbia's legislature took a lead with this issue 
by amending its own limitation act. The amendment removed any 
limitation period for bringing action for damages for sexual 
assault. This is interesting in that the issue was addressed in a 
provincial legislature in 1992 and yet it takes the federal 
government another three years to address it at the federal level.
<P>
	The government is not in the vicinity of the eight ball at all. It 
has not recognized as a matter of urgent priority those victims 
suffering because of legislative inadequacy.
<P>
	In 1994 an ad hoc committee of women for reform of the 
Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act submitted a discussion paper on 
why subsection 178(1) needs to be amended. I will summarize 
some of the benefits it believes will result by amending the act.
<P>
	It avoids a negative public perception regarding the impact of 
bankruptcy on sexual assault judgments and consequent disrepute 
of the act. It sends a clear message to sexual abusers that the act 
cannot be used to avoid payments as a result of judgments.
<P>
	It deters abusers by eliminating a means of escaping the cost to 
be paid for sexual abuse. It provides greater certainty for victims, 
the courts, trustees in bankruptcy and the superintendent.
<P>
	It provides a greater likelihood that victims who are able to 
realize civil judgments will be able to pay for their own treatment 
and will be less likely to be dependent on an already overburdened 
social services resources.
<P>
	It provides consistency with current federal initiatives to lessen 
the burden on the social safety net. Abusers will be made to bear 
the costs of the victims' recovery process rather than society as a 
whole or the victims themselves.
<P>
	A lawyer friend of mine who suggested the amendment has been 
pressing both the Minister of Justice and the Minister of Industry to 
make such changes that I have included in my bill.
<P>
	I will read a letter the Minister of Industry sent to my friend on 
April 6, 1995:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>My colleague, the honourable Minister of Justice, recently sent me a copy of 
your letter of August 16, 1994 recommending that the Bankruptcy and 
Insolvency Act be amended to include awards of damages in serious assault 
cases among those not released by a discharge in bankruptcy. I regret the delay 
in replying to you.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Your letter is quite timely, as I am now considering a number of possible BIA 
amendments to be included in a bill targeted for introduction later in the spring 
or in the fall. Among the amendments under consideration is one along the lines 
you have proposed. Your letter argues strongly in favour of such an amendment, 
and it will be given due consideration.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17459"> 17459 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Thank you for bringing your concerns to the government's attention.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	On November 24, 1995 the Minister of Industry introduced Bill 
C-109, which included amendments to the Bankruptcy and 
Insolvency Act, including a change to subsection 178(1). I applaud 
the minister for his recent initiative. I wish the change could have 
come about sooner, but I understand the minister wanted to make 
many amendments to the act besides my proposal.
<P>
	On page 61 of Bill C-109 and carrying over to page 62, there is a 
small section that reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Subsection 178(1) of the act is amended by adding the following after 
paragraph (a): (a.1) any award of damages by a court in civil proceedings in 
respect of an assault;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The minister's bill finally attempts to fill in the loophole, but I 
am suggesting my wording is better. The government bill deals 
only with the word assault, which is from the Criminal Code. My 
bill deals with both assault and the purely civil tort created from the 
historical term battery.
<P>
	It also deals with interest on moneys on such civil awards, which 
the government bill overlooks. I am also now suggesting that in 
view of further advice, the term interest on moneys awarded should 
apply to the whole section 178, not just to the assault award section 
as suggested.
<P>
	In addition, the bill should include the term wrongful death.
<P>
<B>(1345 )</B>
<P>
	Currently the government bill envisions that an assaulter will not 
be cleared of civil liability damages and bankruptcy, but if the 
assault is serious enough to eventually cause death then the 
offender becomes free. The inherent message is for the perpetrator 
to do more harm and actually kill the victim. Then the civil 
liabilities will not survive the bankruptcy. That angle must also be 
covered.
<P>
	I have discussed these provisions with the minister. I will be 
looking for some positive moves from him in the next week. He 
should publicly promise to approve the appropriate clauses of Bill 
C-109 so that perhaps I might find it acceptable to withdraw my 
bill and have the government fully take over my initiative.
<P>
	So far the minister has appeared co-operative and open to 
discussions. I compliment him for bringing Bill C-109 forward. It 
is a technical clean-up of many outdated sections of the old statute 
which was based on reviews and consultations that were started by 
the Conservative government of the last Parliament. The minister 
has appropriately built on that beginning and we look forward to 
speedy passage. I hope I will be able to report to Parliament that as 
legislators we will get this thing done.
<P>
	Victims of crime should wear no political label. I 
commemorated again for our party on December 6 the national 
tragedy of the murder of the 14 women from Montreal. The 14 
roses on display in the Commons lobby on December 6 were a 
sober reminder of the obligation of Parliament and what it owes to 
victims of all kinds from every region of the country.
<P>
	The platitudes have reached high levels in the House for years 
now about the remembrance of December 6. Yet little in actual 
legislation has been passed that directly uplifts the plight of 
victims. However, with my bill we have a practical and concrete 
chance to act positively. We will see if the Liberals social 
philosophy can measure up to the expectations of mainstream 
Canadian values and the hopes and aspirations of Canadians even 
from an ignored British Columbia.
<P>
	I am being very direct in my comments, for the hopes of hurting 
children and grandparents were dashed by uncaring Liberals on the 
justice committee this week when a private member's bill from the 
member for Mission-Coquitlam granting grandparents legal 
standing in divorce courts was summarily dismissed. It was shot 
down by the government after many brave Liberal backbenchers 
dared defy cabinet signals on the bill and actually vote for change. 
They voted for the real people's agenda. They voted for the people. 
Then the top down Liberal mindset took over and the old style 
political games were played by the government against the hopes 
of ordinary people.
<P>
	Here we have it again: Liberal members not supporting victims. 
They cannot deny it. Their jaws are quivering, but their votes are 
now forever part of the parliamentary record. The pattern runs deep 
with them. It has been allowed to run too long for our country's 
well-being.
<P>
	Can one wonder when I reflect the cynicism about government 
from my constituents? They feel government is something done to 
them rather than for them. In mock amazement the justice minister 
said to me on national television that I was too cynical when I 
recounted to him a few of the missed justice system reforms that he 
as the minister had chosen not to pursue. I cannot be too hard on 
him. After all he has an educational handicap in that he is a lawyer.
<P>
	Here is another initiative placed right in the lap of the Liberals, 
private member's Bill C-323. This measure is not supposed to be 
handled in a partisan manner. The country is watching. I hope the 
House will get it right this time and fully support the kind of 
initiative I have brought forward to help victims of crime and have 
perpetrators pay for and restore what they have done. Let us have 
offenders directly accountable to victims.
<P>
	I am encouraged that uncharacteristically of Liberals the 
Minister of Industry might not be as misguided as the justice 
minister when it comes to being in touch with mainstream 
Canadian values. We all know how good  people can become rather 
strange when they acquire an extensive legal education and then 
call themselves 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17460"> 17460 </A></B>
<P>
lawyers. This minister seems reasonable enough to spread the 
credit around and advance the people's agenda rather than merely a 
Liberal agenda. In view of the early signals I have received from 
the Minister of Industry, I am hopeful that my bill, or more 
correctly the people's measures, will get to the next stage.
<P>
	I urge members to dig deep, overcome themselves, be generous 
of spirit and support a good idea. I am also calling upon the 
Minister of Industry to give the proposals most serious 
consideration.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise to speak on Bill C-323, an act to 
amend the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.
<P>
<B>(1350 )</B>
<P>
	It has been two weeks since the Minister of Industry introduced 
Bill C-109, an act to amend the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, the 
Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act and the Income Tax Act.
<P>
	The bill contains more than 70 amendments to the BIA. The 
amendments fine tune the laws regarding commercial bankruptcy 
and introduce new features involving consumer bankruptcy. The 
legislation has been designed to assist Parliament in its three-year 
review of the BIA.
<P>
	The House welcomed the opportunity to look at the bankruptcy 
laws in more detail. After all, Canada's bankruptcy laws must 
protect the interests of borrowers, lenders, insolvent practitioners 
and government. These interests are so varied and complex that 
over the decades bankruptcy laws have been very difficult to 
reform.
<P>
	Bankruptcy laws are an integral part of the framework 
legislation that established the rules of the marketplace in which 
buyers, sellers, lenders and borrowers can make transactions with 
confidence that the law will treat them fairly.
<P>
	Among the issues covered in Bill C-109 was the treatment of 
court fines in assault cases in the event of bankruptcy. The 
government proposed that people who had been accused of sexual 
or physical assault should not be able to turn to bankruptcy as a 
way of avoiding penalties imposed by the civil courts. Fines for 
physical or sexual assaults become non-dischargeable in the event 
of bankruptcy under Bill C-109.
<P>
	The legislation is now before the House and when it is in front of 
the committee, the committee will have the opportunity to study it 
in detail and to make appropriate amendments.
<P>
	One such amendment should be the proposal before us today, 
that section 178 which lists non-dischargeable debts also includes 
the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-any damages in respect of an assault or battery awarded by a court pursuant 
to a judgment rendered in a civil proceeding and interest on the damages before 
or after judgment ordered by the court or payable by law.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The key difference between Bill C-109 and Bill C-323 is the 
addition in the hon. member's bill of including interest on damages 
as part of the non-dischargeable portion of a bankruptcy debt. This 
is an excellent amendment. I commend the hon. member for New 
Westminster-Burnaby for it.
<P>
	I would like to see the same principle applied to all categories 
listed in section 178, not just the assault cases. I would prefer to see 
the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act amended so that either the 
interest issue is addressed specifically in each category or, 
conversely, have it addressed generically so that it is clear that it 
applies to all categories listed in section 178.
<P>
	I do not believe debate on a private member's bill is the most 
appropriate place to make these changes. All of us are concerned 
about the efficient allocation of House time and I would rather see 
the issue discussed in committee when it reviews Bill C-109. That 
being said, I congratulate the hon. member for his worthwhile 
contribution to the amendment of Canada's bankruptcy laws.
<P>
	Too often in the House we fail to acknowledge the 
perceptiveness and integrity of suggestions that come from the 
other side of the floor. Perhaps this is one reason Canadians have 
become impatient and cynical about politicians. They see us 
perform during question period. They are witness to the bickering 
and sniping that show politics at its worst.
<P>
	What Canadians do not see in the clips from question period that 
make the nightly TV news is that behind the scenes and in 
committee there is a common purpose among members of the 
House. We are working hard to make things better for Canadians.
<P>
	Perhaps we ought to make more of an effort to congratulate one 
another in public. Behind the curtains we often have a kind word 
for our colleagues on the other side of the floor. Sometimes we will 
ruefully congratulate them on a political point well scored. The 
time has come for us to acknowledge without shame when 
members across the floor come up with good ideas that ought to be 
a part of government policy.
<P>
	This is one such occasion. I commend the hon. member for his 
work on bankruptcy reform. I look forward to hearing what he will 
have to say to the committee if he agrees the committee is a more 
suitable forum for his ideas to be discussed.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome 
this opportunity today to speak to the bill introduced by the hon. 
member for New Westminster-Burnaby.
<P>
	I listened carefully to the hon. member's arguments. Members 
with whom I spoke in the Bloc Quebecois, and I personally, are in 
favour of this amendment. It is clear that individuals who are 
ordered in civil court to pay damages in respect of an assault or 
battery or any another act that could lead to a conviction in civil 
court, should not be able to shirk their responsibilities by declaring 
bankruptcy.
<P>
	Like our government colleague, I think this amendment to the 
Bankruptcy Act is admissible and useful.
<P>
	There is also the aspect of interest payments which may be 
useful in an amendment to the bill introduced by the minister on the 
same subject.
<P>
	However, I was less inclined to appreciate the arguments 
presented by the hon. member to justify his amendment. I agree 
there is a problem. In Canada, individuals convicted in civil court 
of causing damage as a result of violent acts or sexual abuse should 
not be allowed to escape the consequences of their actions. 
However, I think the hon member-and this is just a 
comment-was putting his amendment in a rather negative 
context.
<P>
	There was a lot of talk about crime, a list of people convicted of 
sexual abuse or acts of violence was mentioned, cases were cited, 
and so forth. Perhaps the climate in my riding, in my region, and 
even elsewhere in Quebec is not quite the same, but I have not met 
many people in my area who are afraid to go out at night for fear of 
being assaulted or abused. These things can happen, of course, but 
they are not so widespread that they can be used as arguments to 
justify otherwise quite worthwhile amendments.
<P>
	The hon. government member also noted that, last November, 
the Minister of Industry tabled in this House a bill to amend the 
Bankruptcy Act. This bill is much broader than the amendment 
proposed by the hon. member because it kind of overhauls the 
Bankruptcy Act. Like the hon. member who spoke before me, I did 
notice that there is an identical clause in the bill introduced by the 
Minister of Industry and in the bill presented by our colleague from 
the Reform Party today.
<P>
	I even think that, had it realized this sooner, the committee in 
charge of determining which bills shall be considered as votable 
items might have decided that this bill was redundant in light of the 
minister's bill.
<P>
	When I went over clause 105, a little paragraph further down 
caught my eye. It has nothing to do with this  debate, but I know, 
Mr. Speaker, that you are quite lenient on the issue of relevance. I 
do not know if my colleague from the Reform Party saw this 
paragraph that makes it more difficult for students who are out of 
school but are unable to find a job to declare bankruptcy.
<P>
<B>(1400)</B>
<P>
	They are told they cannot do so within two years of finishing 
their courses. This is, I feel, an aspect which merits attention 
perhaps. I wanted to bring it up here in the House, and my party 
will debate it when the time comes. I believe that, after all of the 
Reform member's justifiable severity concerning people getting 
out of their responsibilities after a civil judgment, he ought to focus 
the same amount of energy on the student situation in order to 
determine whether there is a problem. We know that in Canada, and 
in Quebec, my region in particular, getting into the work force is a 
huge problem for students.
<P>
	I feel therefore, that in the bill to be introduced by the 
Minister-I know I am not in order, but I feel this will have to be 
examined carefully. It is all very fine to want to be strict, to want to 
see people pay their debts, but one still needs to have a proper 
understanding of the situation. My colleague has justifiably 
pointed out that people found guilty in civil suits ought not to be 
exempted.
<P>
	Looking at the student situation, however, we become aware that 
the minister's bill is very severe, considering that at the present 
time the job market for young people in Canada is very bad, and 
when it comes right down to it, one realizes the amendments 
proposed by the minister are unfavourably biased against students. 
A student who is unable to pay his debts after graduation is judged 
initially as in some way guilty of fraudulent intent in not wanting to 
repay his government loans. This is, I feel, not the case for the large 
majority of students. The bulk of young people forced to declare 
bankruptcy at the end of their studies do so because they really 
cannot pay.
<P>
	Certainly there are some people who will take advantage of such 
possibilities to commit fraud. However, as was said this morning 
concerning the whole unemployment insurance question, when a 
system is put into place there are always some people who will try 
to cheat, but it is my belief that not everyone using the system 
ought to be tarred with the same brush as the dishonest few.
<P>
	I hope that the government will take this into consideration when 
the time comes to examine this legislation, particularly since the 
unemployment insurance reform will mean that students who have 
terminated their studies will be hit hard by that as well. We realize 
that a student completing school and finding a first job will have to 
work 910 hours in order to qualify for unemployment insurance.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17462"> 17462 </A></B>
<P>
	Lots of students today are on contract, and it is rare that anyone 
gets 910 hours in one go. Young people will not qualify. If they 
cannot qualify, they cannot pay their student loans. If they cannot 
pay their student loans, they will have difficulty meeting their 
obligations. Under the amendments to the Bankruptcy Act the 
minister has tabled, young people will not be able to pay and 
therefore will not be able to declare bankruptcy and will be unable 
to pay. It is not clear where they will end up.
<P>
	In any case, I hope that, when the committee studies the 
legislation, it will look carefully at the amendment the member 
proposed, because I think it is acceptable, but I hope it will also 
look at other aspects of the legislation, which are tightening and 
toughening up the system. Basically, Canada's entire social system 
is becoming harsher. It is our whole way of looking at our young 
people in school and people having difficulty finding a job.
<P>
	Our whole approach, that of Canadians and of Quebecers, is 
getting tougher. We accept the situation, because it is always being 
presented in the light of our difficult economic situation, but still, 
in such a situation, things have to be taken into account, as I 
suggested my colleague have done in connection with the whole 
issue of crime and its control through more severe measures.
<P>
	I think we have to take things into account as well in our attitude 
toward Canadians and Quebecers who need a little more support 
from the government in a time of greater economic difficulty. I 
thank you for having tolerated my wandering slightly off the topic 
of debate.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to rise on behalf 
of the people of Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt to speak in 
support of Bill C-323, an act to amend the Bankruptcy and 
Insolvency Act (order of discharge).
<P>
	I begin my remarks by congratulating my Reform Party caucus 
colleague, the hon. member for New Westminster-Burnaby, on 
the fine job he has done in bringing this legislative proposal 
forward for the consideration of the House. In my view, all 
members of the House should be quick to rally in support of this 
bill.
<P>
	Very simply, the changes to the bankruptcy laws being proposed 
by my colleague would prevent persons from declaring bankruptcy 
in order to escape paying civil damages for an assault or battery 
they have been found to have committed by a Canadian court. 
Clearly, Canadians want the members of the House to support 
changes in our laws that will protect the victims of crime in our 
society.
<P>
	Canadians have demanded measures that will address the 
damage done by violence in our homes, our streets  and our 
playgrounds. We on this side of the House were elected on a 
mandate to bring changes to the criminal justice system. The wave 
of support for the Reform Party of Canada which swept across the 
west in the last election is based on the demand by the Canadian 
electorate for changes in the way our society deals with crime and, 
in particular, violent crime.
<P>
	I take this opportunity to give fair warning to the Liberals that 
this wave of support for the Reform Party of Canada will sweep 
across the nation in the next federal election. I have no doubt about 
it.
<P>
	The efforts of my colleague will not go unnoticed by Canadians. 
He has introduced a private member's bill which seeks to add civil 
damages awarded in respect of an assault or battery to the debts 
listed in the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act which cannot be 
released by the act. Again, I congratulate my fellow British 
Columbian for his efforts on behalf of all Canadians and the 
Reform Party of Canada.
<P>
	Canadians know that the Liberals have proposed changes to the 
bankruptcy laws of our country. Canadians are aware of the gutless 
and poor legislation the Liberal Minister of Industry has presented 
in the House. In true Liberal Party fashion the government is 
ramming the changes to the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act 
through the House on a fast track like it has with so many other 
bills.
<P>
	Bill C-109, the weak and cowardly Liberal government changes 
to our country's bankruptcy laws, was introduced and read for the 
first time on November 24, 1995. It was read the second time on 
November 28, 1995. That is four days later, for the Liberals across 
the floor who are counting the days on their calendars. Bill C-109 
will become another bright light on the Christmas tree of Liberal 
red book broken promises. Bill C-109 will be rocketed through the 
House like a missile, with no debate, or as little as possible, no 
amendments, no regrets and no apologies.
<P>
	Bill C-96 creates a new department for the federal government. 
The creation of a new department is a far cry from the demands of 
Canadians to reduce the size of government. The new department is 
exempt from having to submit an annual report. The books are 
being hidden by the Liberals.
<P>
	Bill C-101 is another bill debated in the House. It was a 
collection of weak and ineffective changes to the Railway Act. That 
bill was so far from what stakeholders in the industry wanted that it 
was worthless.
<P>
	Bill C-107 was another great debate for the Liberals. It was cast 
in stone. It could not be changed, not one word. There was nothing 
to debate. The Liberals passed it in a matter of days, patted each 
other on the back and congratulated the Minister of Indian Affairs 
and Northern Development for all the hard work he had done to 
steer the bill through the House.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17463"> 17463 </A></B>
<P>
	Canadians are absolutely amazed by Bill C-62. It is so seriously 
flawed the Liberal minister is scrambling to make changes to the 
bill even before it gets sent to committee.
<P>
<B>(1410)</B>
<P>
	If the Liberals care to pay any attention to my warning of their 
fate in the next election then they should endorse my colleague's 
bill. Bill C-323 will go a long way in fighting violent crime in our 
society. The victims of these crimes need the resources it takes to 
recover from the violence that has been committed against them. 
The perpetrators of these violent acts are using the country's 
bankruptcy laws as a convenient tool to get away with their crimes.
<P>
	Do the Liberals really want to be known as the political party 
that stands 100 per cent in support of the segment of society that 
uses violence as a response to events in their lives? Do the Liberals 
really want to be known as the political party having the guts to 
stand up to the perpetrators of violence? Or do members of the 
House want to be known for saying to perpetrators of violence: 
``You cannot hurt someone and just walk away''. This has to be said 
to those who beat up on women, to those who punch smaller 
persons, to those who sexually violate another human being, 
including children.
<P>
	That is what Bill C-323 is asking us to do. It is asking us to deal 
with bullies. It is asking us to stand up for those who have been hit 
by a bully. This is elementary. This bill is trying to put on the 
statute books something that we all learned in the school yard.
<P>
	The Liberals have already chosen not to do what this bill is 
asking. I hope that people watching me right now will pick up a pen 
and write down on a piece of paper Bill C-323, then go to their 
phone book, look up the phone number of their Liberal member of 
Parliament and phone him or her. Tell them that you want to 
register your vote as a yes for Bill C-323 on your behalf. This is to 
make sure that bullies are punished.
<P>
	I am willing to put politics aside on this one. We need to protect 
the people in society who have been victims of violence. We are 
talking about violent acts which have been proven to be committed. 
Courts have decided how much the person perpetrating the 
violence owes the victim. The aggressor laughs at the court order, 
declares bankruptcy and walks away from the terrible damage done 
by the violent action. The victim who is probably already paying 
high medical bills, losing time off work or is being affected in any 
number of sad, tragic ways, can do nothing. They are stripped of 
their ability to recover because some smart lawyer has figured out a 
way to exonerate the client from having to pay for an act of 
violence.
<P>
	I cannot believe that on behalf of my constituents I am standing 
here today and literally begging the Liberals to  listen. I am asking 
them, on humanitarian grounds, to support something that is so 
basic that any Canadian with an ounce of morals or integrity would 
support it.
<P>
	Most Canadians would be surprised to know that those 
committing violent acts can get off scot free through the 
bankruptcy laws. Any self-respecting Canadian would say: ``Let's 
put a stop to that today''.
<P>
	Canadians cannot believe that the Liberals ignored the chance to 
do something about this situation with the proposed changes to the 
bankruptcy laws. The Reform Party's private member bill, C-323, 
has been on the Order Paper since last spring. The Liberals knew it 
existed. They chose not to include this idea in their amending bill 
introduced just last month. This is shameful. This is embarrassing. 
Canadians are very disappointed.
<P>
<B>(1415)</B>
<P>
	I am the national defence critic for the Reform Party of Canada. I 
have served in the Canadian Armed Forces. As a matter of fact I am 
still on the supplementary reserve list.
<P>
	The Canadian Armed Forces is famous throughout the world for 
standing up to bullies. We did this for 30 years in Cyprus. We are 
peacekeepers. We are known for having a fair and just society. We 
are admired for our willingness to take our notion of right and 
wrong to virtually every corner of the planet and assist in keeping 
peace, preventing bullies from hitting on people and getting away 
with it.
<P>
	I am proud to support Bill C-323. The Reform Party of Canada is 
proud of my colleague's bill. The people of 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, whom I represent, are proud 
to have me speak in favour of the bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Raymond Bonin (Nickel Belt, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, thank 
you for the opportunity to speak to the private member's bill put 
forward by the hon. member for New Westminster-Burnaby.
<P>
	This legislation is a clear example of a good idea whose time has 
come. In fact, the idea of amending the Bankruptcy and Insolvency 
Act so that people who have been accused of sexual and physical 
assault cannot use bankruptcy as a way of avoiding penalties 
imposed by the civil courts has also been raised by government 
legislation.
<P>
	Bill C-109 was introduced a couple of weeks ago. Under it, fines 
for physical and sexual assault become non-dischargeable in the 
event of bankruptcy. The legislation before us takes this idea one 
step further and I think it is a good step. Under Bill C-323 the pre- 
and post-judgment interest on awards would also be 
non-dischargeable. I want to commend the hon. member for New 
Westminster-Burnaby for his foresight in closing this loophole. 
This is an excellent amendment to the laws regarding bankruptcy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17464"> 17464 </A></B>
<P>
	The hon. member's bill inadvertently opens another loophole. 
Section 178 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act refers to a 
number of instances where debts are non-dischargeable. Among 
them are alimony payments, child support and fraud.
<P>
	In cases where the courts award pre- and post-judgment interest 
in these other circumstances, I do not think the bankrupt should be 
able to escape these obligations simply by declaring bankruptcy. 
Nor do I think this was the intention of the hon. member when he 
tabled this legislation.
<P>
	The bill after all seeks social justice. It is an endeavour to make 
sure that those who have incurred debts and interest charges by 
order of the court cannot escape their obligations by declaring 
bankruptcy.
<P>
	I am certain that if the hon. member had the opportunity to 
redraft the legislation, he would do so in a way that would close 
down the loopholes for the bankrupts listed in section 178. I would 
suggest to him that the surest way of having his recommendation 
adopted would be to withdraw Bill C-323 and resubmit his 
proposal as an amendment to Bill C-109 now at second reading.
<P>
	I am convinced that the amendment will be welcomed by the 
committee. We have already heard expressions of support from 
both sides of the House. We all know that the hon. member for New 
Westminster-Burnaby has hit upon an excellent idea and a worthy 
amendment and we all want to see it incorporated in law as soon as 
possible.
<P>
	That is why I support the principle of Bill C-323 but I cannot 
support the bill as it now stands. I encourage the hon. member to 
withdraw Bill C-323 and present its substance as an amendment to 
Bill C-109 at committee. There it will be incorporated into a bill 
that has been designed to address the broad spectrum of both 
consumer and corporate issues that relate to bankruptcy.
<P>
	Many of the amendments to the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act 
contained in Bill C-109 are aimed at redressing an imbalance 
between consumer debtors and their creditors. The legislation puts 
more pressure on debtors to rehabilitate and to act more 
responsibly by repaying their debts. For example, as we have 
discussed in the House before, most consumer bankrupts are 
discharged nine months after bankruptcy. Even if they start 
obtaining surplus income, it is costly for creditors to get back what 
they are owed.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	Under Bill C-109 consumer debtors will be required to remit a 
portion of their surplus income, the income which exceeds the 
minimum cost of living. The creditor will not have to go to the 
courts to receive his due.
<P>
	The legislation also covers student loans. Some students have 
declared personal bankruptcy upon graduation as a means of 
discharging their student loans.  Under the new law, students will 
continue to be able to declare bankruptcy but their student loans 
will not be discharged for another 24 months.
<P>
	Under the new amendments, insolvent spouses may submit a 
joint proposal for bankruptcy. This will help save time, cut costs 
and streamline the process. Former spouses will no longer be able 
to use the bankruptcy laws as an easy way to get out of making 
support payments. Spousal and child support payments become 
provable priority claims.
<P>
	The legislation also contains measures to ensure that low income 
families will not lose their GST credit refunds. Such refunds will 
be exempted from seizure in the event of a bankruptcy.
<P>
	All these are good amendments. Among the good amendments is 
the proposal to ensure that people who have been accused of sexual 
or physical assault do not use bankruptcy as a way of avoiding 
penalties imposed by the civil courts.
<P>
	The hon. member has added a very useful amendment to this last 
provision. I look forward to discussions in committee on it if he is 
willing to withdraw his bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, all laws passed by Parliament are designed to deal with 
inefficiencies and injustices created by free and voluntary 
interactions among people. Canada's Bankruptcy and Insolvency 
Act is no exception.
<P>
	People dealing honestly and with the best of intentions borrow 
money from others in order to establish businesses or carry them 
over periods of temporary insolvency. In this world of uncertainty, 
occasionally the best made plans of borrowers go wrong. They are 
unable to meet the repayment schedules to which they have 
committed themselves.
<P>
	Historically, creditors used to have powerful instruments of 
coercion to assure that debtors make every effort to repay their 
debts. The stories of debtor prisons are the stuff of Dickens' novels. 
They have done much to influence our thinking about the injustices 
involved in the old, harsh methods of dealing with debtors.
<P>
	These attitudes are that debtors unable to pay their debts are in 
trouble for reasons beyond their control. They typically are poor 
and need to be protected from rich creditors. Moreover, it is not in 
the interests of society that individuals who have hit a streak of bad 
luck should be stigmatized for life and forever unable to get back 
into business or even just mainstream life. The conditions 
described in Dickens' novels were that the poor were stripped of 
everything. They were stigmatized. Indeed those were bad times 
and some changes were needed.
<P>
	The existing Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act reflects social 
attitudes. It makes it possible for individuals to  declare bankruptcy 
to escape the social and economic penalties that historically were 
imposed on debtors. In Canada and in most industrialized countries 
today, debtors can clean the slate, walk away from past mistakes 
<P>

<B><A NAME="17465"> 17465 </A></B>
<P>
and start all over again by the simple act of asking courts to declare 
them bankrupt.
<P>
	Canadians believe generally that these rules are desirable and 
create a better society. They also believe that bankruptcy itself and 
the stigma attached to having declared bankruptcy are sufficient 
deterrents to abuse of the privileges granted under the law.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	I might note that there are significant differences between 
countries. I understand that in the United States, some successful 
businessmen who today are millionaires brag about the fact that 
they have been bankrupt at least two or three times. One of the 
significant cultural differences in the United States, Canada and 
Europe is the fact that we typically do not have these kinds of 
entrepreneurs that go around saying it was quite all right to have 
been bankrupt a couple of times.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Forseth:</B> They have no shame.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> My colleague whispers into my ear that they have 
no shame. I personally think this is reflective of a more dynamic, 
risk taking society which has all kinds of benefits for creating 
wealth and generally raising the income of citizens. However, there 
are always excesses.
<P>
	As is the case with so many well-intentioned laws, this law on 
bankruptcy has been shown to have a number of unintended 
consequences. This law is subject to increasing abuse, especially as 
the memory of the disgrace of debtor prisons and social ostracism 
are receding from the public conscience.
<P>
	Bill C-323, the amendment to the bankruptcy act introduced by 
my Reform Party colleague from New Westminster-Burnaby, is 
aimed at curbing one of the unintended consequences of what 
otherwise is a well-intentioned good act. If accepted it would 
reduce the ability of individuals to escape responsibility for the 
payment of fines which have been imposed by civil courts in 
response to damages caused by violence, typically against women.
<P>
	The intention of the existing legislation clearly was not to open 
bankruptcy as an avenue which could be used by violent offenders 
to escape the penalty which society through court actions has 
imposed on them. This private member's bill is consistent with 
public sentiment on this subject. I support it and urge members of 
this House to pass it.
<P>
	The proposed legislation continues to protect innocent victims of 
bankruptcy from the historic, often unjust and socially undesirable 
consequences of excessive penalties. Making sure the perpetrators 
of violent acts against people are duly convicted in a court of law 
and required  to pay a fine is not equivalent to bringing back debtor 
prisons. It is a necessary and in my view highly desirable act that 
would restore equity and would close a loophole in the existing 
law.
<P>
	I have every confidence in the ability of those entrusted with 
carrying out the intent of this act to distinguish between cases 
where bankruptcy is designed to escape responsibility and where it 
is the result of genuine bad luck. The risk of mistakes in such 
decisions is worth the social benefit in terms of greater equity 
envisaged by the designer of this bill. I urge that his ideas receive 
the assent they deserve.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I wonder if we might agree not to see the 
clock until the next member has finished his submission. Is there 
unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
intently to the speech of the hon. member for Capilano-Howe 
Sound who said how different our culture and our attitudes are 
toward bankruptcy. I do not believe that is the case.
<P>
	For example, members of the Reichmann family, in the pursuit 
of some of their objectives not only within Canada but also 
internationally, used the protection of chapter 11 of the United 
States and also our own creditors arrangement act. Many of our 
countrymen are alarmed and curious to understand how it was 
possible, after all the smoke had cleared from that period of time in 
our history, that over 2,500 employees of the Canadian Imperial 
Bank of Commerce had lost their jobs, but at the same time many 
of the executive staff were promoted and that today the Reichmann 
family still has partial ownership of Canary Wharf. These are the 
people that my Reform colleagues would like to support, I suppose.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	I will now move into the area of this bill. It was a very 
honourable presentation by the member for New 
Westminster-Burnaby. Rather than take the time of the House 
today, I can state that it was never the intention that this act be 
abused by people trying to escape societal obligations. I believe it 
is very appropriate that the member bring forward this legislation 
at this time.
<P>
	The question seems to be whether it is appropriate that this bill 
go forward. Another bill is currently being debated, Bill C-109, a 
government bill, which overlaps and has some similarities to this 
bill. When I try to compare these two bills, I discover that their 
differences are twofold. One is that the member's bill talks about 
assault and battery, whereas the minister's bill talks simply of 
assault.
<P>
	My reading of the word assault would include the definition of 
the word battery. I do not believe that is a significant difference 
between Bill C-109 and the private member's bill.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="17466"> 17466 </A></B>
<P>
	The other difference, as I understand it, is that the hon. member 
includes the concept of interest related to awards or judgments in 
the area of assault and battery. That would be different from the 
existing bill of the minister.
<P>
	I am not a lawyer, but I understand in law that when we specify 
in one aspect of the bill a specific such as interest, that by definition 
a judge will assume that we meant interest only in that particular 
area and that some of the other areas of the bill would not have 
interest judgments attached to them. As a consequence, I believe 
we need to either amend the existing legislation in Bill C-109 
which talks about interest, so that we are clear that interest is 
included in all the categories, or we need to delete the interest 
adjustment aspect from the member's bill.
<P>
	The bill presented by the member is a good one and deserves the 
support of the House, but it is a matter of time allocation. This 
House is very busy. We have been putting through a lot of 
legislation recently and I am sure the government has much more 
legislation to present in the new year. We have to find a way in 
which we can do this efficiently.
<P>
	It seems to me that the most efficient way to handle the matter 
would be for the member to move an amendment to Bill C-109 at 
committee stage. Indeed, I would be happy to support the member 
in that initiative.
<P>
	Today I would have to say that I have to oppose the bill, not 
because I oppose it in principle, not at all. I support the initiatives 
of the member. I would oppose it simply on the grounds of time 
allocation.
<P>
	I believe there are many members on this side of the House that 
would support the initiatives of the member to bring forward 
amendments to Bill C-109 during committee stage, dealing with 
the aspect of interest.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The time provided for the consideration 
of private members' business has expired.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Pursuant to Standing Order 93, the order is dropped to the 
bottom of the order of precedence on the Order Paper.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It being 2.35 p.m., the House stands adjourned until Monday at 
11 a.m.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 2.33 p.m.)
