	He said: Mr. Speaker, in presenting this motion the 
government is continuing to fulfil its commitment to strengthen 
public confidence in the institutions of government.
<P>
	Earlier in this Parliament we revised and strengthened the 
conflict of interest code for public office holders and buttressed 
that new code through the appointment of an ethics counsellor 
for cabinet ministers and order in council appointees. We also 
proposed amendments to the  Lobbyists Registration Act de-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11966"> 11966 </A></B>
<P>
signed to move the lobby industry out of the shadows and 
backrooms and into the light of public scrutiny.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Having done this, we will now concentrate on adopting a code 
of ethics for members of the House of Commons and senators. 
We hope that the process triggered by this motion will be based 
on consensus and co-operation, because this issue affects all 
parliamentarians in both the House of Commons and the Senate, 
whatever their political allegiance. That is why this government 
proposes that this important task be assigned to senators and 
members of the House of Commons rather than to the 
government itself. This is further evidence that the government 
really cares about strengthening the role and effectiveness of 
Parliament.
<P>
[English] 
<P>
	We look forward to the deliberations of the committee and we 
hope that in these deliberations all parties will work together 
toward preserving the integrity of Parliament. We all have a role 
to play, a responsibility for ensuring that Parliament, this most 
fundamental instrument of our democracy, remains an 
expression of the collective values of all Canadians and one in 
which they can justly take pride.
<P>
	What Canadians have made clear is that they want 
parliamentarians to institute clear rules consistently applied 
governing their standards of behaviour.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The public's political expectations and values have undergone 
enormous changes over the years.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	For example, in the 1950s there was little concern about 
conflicts between private business and public responsibilities of 
elected officials. I understand that at that time many ministers 
directly owned securities and shares of all kinds, without 
concern about things like blind trusts and so forth, and even held 
corporate directorships without causing any public concern. 
Today that would be out of the question.
<P>
	Over the years the public has developed much higher 
expectations. As the art of governance has become more and 
more complex and intermediaries, advocates, and lobbyists of 
varying stripes have become increasingly present, successive 
federal, provincial, and even municipal governments have 
enacted increasingly rigorous measures to meet evolving public 
expectations about integrity.
<P>
	Depending on their province of residence, Canadians have 
witnessed the development of everything from informal 
guidelines to formal codes of conduct for elected officials and 
other public office holders. They have seen the appointment of 
myriad ethics committees or commissioners with varying 
degrees of impartiality, independence, and powers of 
investigation. They have seen politicians subjected to new 
requirements for  disclosure and divestiture. They have seen 
enacted numerous access to information regimes designed to 
provide the transparency required for citizens to better examine 
the activities of public officials.
<P>
	While the emphasis of these measures has tended to focus 
primarily on rules of acceptable conduct for the executive, 
recent trends suggest a growing interest in extending the 
application of such measures to all public office holders, 
including those parliamentarians who are not ministers.
<P>
<B>(1205 ) </B>
<P>
	At our national level, here in the House of Commons alone, 
over the past eight years no fewer than four conflict of interest 
bills for members and senators were introduced and died on the 
Order Paper. That they met such a fate is instructive. It 
underlines just how difficult the task is of effectively 
reconciling the right of individual parliamentarians and their 
families to privacy and to private life with the public's right to 
expect the highest standards of conduct from those they elect. 
The balance will not be an easy one to achieve.
<P>
	Today we are proposing that there be a special joint 
committee on a code of conduct for parliamentarians structured 
along the same lines as the highly successful special joint 
committees that reviewed Canada's foreign and defence 
policies. That is, we are proposing that fourteen members of the 
House of Commons and seven members of the Senate form this 
committee. In addition, we are proposing that the present 
members of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs be appointed to act on behalf of the House as members of 
the new special joint committee.
<P>
	The special joint committee's task will be a challenging one: 
to propose a code of conduct to guide senators and members of 
the House of Commons in reconciling their official 
responsibilities with their personal interests, including their 
dealings with lobbyists. The special joint committee will be 
directed to consult broadly and to review the approaches taken 
with respect to these issues in Canada and in other jurisdictions 
with comparable systems of government.
<P>
	I alluded earlier to the fate of the past four attempts to develop 
a code of conduct of this sort. Those bills did not die on the 
Order Paper because there was serious doubt of the need for such 
measures; they died because there were fundamental 
disagreements on the specific measures being proposed.
<P>
	As parliamentarians, we all know how difficult public life can 
be. Ministers in particular already undergo a daily scrutiny that 
most Canadians would find unacceptable if it were applied to 
them. It is important that the new special joint committee be 
sensitive to this fact throughout its deliberations. I say this 
because if our democracy is to flourish we must all be concerned 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11967"> 11967 </A></B>
<P>
about attracting the best people to public life. I believe that an 
effective code of conduct can and must take this into account.
<P>
	For example, as public office holders all members of this 
House are potentially exposed to allegations that in carrying out 
their public responsibilities they could be improperly furthering 
their private interests. Not just ministers, but all 
parliamentarians must confront this in light of recent changes 
we have put forward to reinforce the role of both standing 
committees and private members.
<P>
	As long as parliamentarians have private interests and have 
responsibilities to consider, review, or propose legislation that 
may eventually further those interests, this is a reality we have 
to face. That is why the challenges facing the new special joint 
committee promise to be daunting.
<P>
	Consider the principle of transparency. Few could dispute that 
accountability without transparency is of dubious value. It is 
therefore scarcely surprising that disclosure has been one of the 
common threads running through each of the four previous 
attempts to define a code of conduct and that the disagreement 
over the scope of disclosure that would be required contributed 
to their foundering.
<P>
	Are the disclosure provisions in the conflict of interest code 
for ministers, which the present government updated in June 
1994, a good model for all members and senators, including 
those who are not ministers? There is a difference in 
responsibilities.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	What differences should there be, as a result, in the rules? Just 
how rigorous should disclosure requirements be for members 
and senators who are not ministers? Should they apply to them 
alone? To their spouses as well? To their immediate family 
members? To whom should disclosures be made and when? At 
what point does disclosure become intrusive? In short, where 
should the balance be placed?
<P>
	Similarly, a revised conflict of interest code for ministers 
specifies what ministers can and cannot hold by way of assets. It 
provides clear rules concerning divestiture, either through arm's 
length sales or by setting up blind trusts. There are also rules in 
place in cases where assets are not tradable, such as ownership 
of a private company.
<P>
	Should some or all of these rules also apply to members and 
senators who are not ministers? Should these rules apply 
retroactively or should they be grandfathered? Again, where 
does the right balance lie?
<P>
	All members would doubtless agree that principles, no matter 
how resounding or how inspiring, must be grounded in concrete 
requirements and must apply clearly to day to day activities if 
they are to be meaningful and effective.
<P>
	If the committee eventually recommends a set of principles 
for parliamentarians regarding potential conflicts of interest 
that are similar to those in the conflict of interest code for 
ministers, then several questions would arise. Should the system 
be based on a self-assessment peer review or scrutinized by an 
independent third party? How far can or should power to 
investigate be extended? Should there be an ethics counsellor 
similar to the one established for ministers? How should this 
regime mesh with the Criminal Code and the Parliament of 
Canada Act? Should sanctions be included in a new code for 
parliamentarians? If so, who should be responsible for their 
enforcement? Indeed, what legal standing should those 
sanctions have, if any?
<P>
	Ultimately, public accountability of elected officials is 
achieved through the electoral process, through elections. What 
happens to those who abuse the system or inflict damage to its 
credibility between elections? What of senators who are not 
subject to the discipline of the ballot box? How are they to be 
held accountable on an ongoing basis?
<P>
	Yet again, the issue comes down to one of balance.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	At the end of the day, the committee will have to assess the 
degree to which the public has the right to be informed about the 
private business of elected officials and appointed senators. 
These issues will not be easy to settle.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I say to all Canadians that by adopting this motion, members 
of the House of Commons will be signalling their determination 
to establish standards for ethical conduct for parliamentarians 
that are second to none, standards in which all Canadians can 
take pride.
<P>
	Therefore, I ask the House to give early and full approval to 
this motion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
motion presented by the government House leader with respect 
to a code of conduct for Canadian parliamentarians is not 
something new in the history of parliamentary government, let 
alone democracy in the West. This government's proposal to 
appoint a special joint committee of the Senate and the House of 
Commons to develop a code of conduct is in keeping with the 
Liberals' habit of acting as if they had a clear conscience in front 
of the people while at the same time continuing to scheme 
behind their backs.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	Before looking at what this Liberal code of conduct is really 
about, I would like to draw the attention of the House to specific 
points of the government motion presented by the government 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11968"> 11968 </A></B>
<P>
House leader. This motion provides for a committee made up of 
eight members of the Senate and fourteen members of the House 
of Commons, as well as the members of the Standing  
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. This is absurd, in 
my opinion.
<P>
	We, Bloc members, suggest that the membership of this 
committee be reduced to three members of the Bloc Quebecois, 
two members of the Reform Party and seven Liberal members of 
Parliament. Twelve elected representatives should be plenty to 
examine the professional ethics of the members of this House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> What about the senators?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bélisle:</B> I was getting to them, if the hon. member will let 
me continue. As for the senators, they are living proof of the fact 
that, historically, the Liberal and Conservative commitment to 
developing a code of conduct that would truly be enforced is 
really lip service. We suggest that senators not sit on this 
committee but set up a Senate committee to develop their own 
code of conduct.
<P>
	Another concern is quorum. We object to a quorum which, as 
the notice of motion stands, does not ensure participation from 
the official opposition. This principle is not reflected in the 
wording of the government motion, which states that a quorum 
of the committee be 12 members. In our view, this wording 
needs to be changed.
<P>
	Time and time again over the past 30 years, through all kinds 
of committee reports and bills that died on the Order Paper, one 
government after another tried to regulate the conduct of 
parliamentarians to prevent conflict between private interests 
and democratic duties. The conflict of interests issue is the most 
important aspect of parliamentary ethics. I will therefore focus 
on this aspect and show that there is no real political will behind 
this government motion.
<P>
	In theory, the purpose of a code of conduct for elected 
representatives is of paramount importance. The public expects 
these people to be able, to the extent that it is possible, do as they 
please as concerns their economic interests. However, it also 
expects that, in the performance of their duties, public office 
holders will not become involved in business in which they have 
a personal economic interest. It goes without saying that 
conflict of interest rules must be based on the principles of 
impartiality and integrity.
<P>
	Decision makers cannot be deemed impartial and honest if 
they personally profit, or can profit, from decisions. Most 
conflict of interest rules governing parliamentarians are 
incorporated in three acts of Parliament, namely: the Criminal 
Code, the Parliament of Canada Act and the Canada Elections 
Act. For example, the Parliament of Canada Act prohibits a 
parliamentarian from receiving any outside payment for 
services performed regarding any issue reviewed by the House, 
the Senate, or the committees of the House or of the Senate.
<P>
	The same act also provides that a person cannot be elected to 
the House of Commons if this person has, directly or indirectly, 
a contract with the government which involves public money. 
The case of a parliamentarian who does not receive public 
money but is entitled to other benefits under a contract, is 
probably not covered by that provision, but this issue is far from 
being clear.
<P>
	Moreover, if a parliamentarian is a shareholder of a 
corporation which was awarded a government contract, the ban 
only applies if the contract concerns the performance of public 
works. Consequently, a parliamentarian could invest in a 
corporation and thus avoid the ban. This, you will agree, is quite 
a loophole.
<P>
	There is of course no obligation to divulge one's financial 
interests. However, Standing Order 21 of the House of 
Commons provides that no member is entitled to vote on any 
question in which he or she has a direct pecuniary interest, and 
the vote of any member so interested will be disallowed.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	I am only reminding the House of these rules of conduct for 
Canadian parliamentarians because the events of the past few 
years, and in particular this government's conduct, have made 
people rather sceptical about the Liberal government's political 
will to set a code of ethics to make public affairs fully 
transparent.
<P>
	The two parties which have been in power over the past 30 
years have pussyfooted around this crucial issue and have 
lacked the political will to introduce a serious law strictly 
governing their own conduct as parliamentarians.
<P>
	In 1973, the federal government published a green paper 
called ``Members of Parliament and Conflict of Interest''. A 
brief summary of what has transpired over the last 30 years is 
that the two parties which have held power, the Liberals and the 
Conservatives, have never really had the political will to set a 
code of ethics for the elected.
<P>
	The document I just mentioned proposed consolidating and 
widening the scope out the rules already in effect. The House of 
Commons Standing Committee on Privileges and Elections and 
a Senate committee reviewed the green paper and made many 
recommendations. On June 10, 1975, the standing committee 
introduced its report on the green paper, which, in general, 
approved its contents and recommended a few changes.
<P>
	Two years later, on June 26, 1978, Bill C-62, the 
Independence of Parliament Act, along with new Rules for the 
House and the Senate, was introduced in the House of 
Commons. This bill died on the Order Paper when the session 
ended on October 10, 1978.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11969"> 11969 </A></B>
<P>
	However, on October 16, 1978, a slightly modified version of 
the same act was introduced as Bill C-6. The accompanying 
Rules for the House and the Senate were tabled in the House on 
October 30, 1978. The bill was referred to committee on March 
8, 1979, but there was no ensuing action and the bill died on the 
Order Paper when Parliament was dissolved on March 26, 1979.
<P>
	At the end of the Liberal's term of office, on July 7, 1983, a 
federal study group was set up to examine the principles and 
rules governing conflict of interest and their evolution and to 
decide whether the issue should be dealt with differently. The 
report did not appear until May 1984. It was entitled ``Ethical 
Conduct in the Public Sector'' and was known as the 
Starr-Sharp report.
<P>
	With a new government, there were new political practices. 
On November 15, 1985, the Conservative government asked the 
Standing Committee on Management and Members' Services to 
consider the appropriateness of setting up a register of 
members' interests. As part of its work, the committee was to 
decide whether it was appropriate to disclose the remuneration 
members received for sitting on the boards of directors of public 
or private firms or for performing other duties or occupying 
other positions in various organizations.
<P>
	After consulting the members of all parties, the committee 
concluded that there was no need to set up such a register and 
that existing legislation on members' conflicts of interest was 
sufficient. And the saga continues. In February 1988, Bill 
C-114, Members of the Senate and House of Commons Conflict 
of Interest Act, was given first reading.
<P>
	In September 1988, the legislative committee on Bill C-114 
met three times, but was unable to finish considering the bill 
before Parliament was dissolved, on October 1, 1988.
<P>
	In November 1989, the scenario was repeated with the first 
reading of Bill C-46, Members of the Senate and House of 
Commons Conflict of Interest Act. This bill was essentially the 
same as Bill C-114, with a few minor changes.
<P>
	This bill died on the Order Paper when Parliament was 
prorogued on May 12, 1991. November 1991 marked the first 
reading of Bill C-43, Members of the Senate and House of 
Commons Conflict of Interest Act. This bill was almost 
identical to the bills I have already mentioned: Bill C-114 and 
Bill C-46.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	Incidentally, the bill was immediately referred to a Special 
Joint Committee of the Senate and the House of Commons.
<P>
	In March 1993, first reading of Bill C-116, the Conflict of 
Interests of Public Office Holders Act, which included 
amendments to the Parliament of Canada Act. Finally, in June 
1993, a report from the Special Joint Committee of the House of 
Commons and the Senate recommended  that Bill C-116 be set 
aside. The same day, a similar report was tabled in the Senate. 
Bills C-43 and C-116 died on the Order Paper, upon dissolution 
of the 34th Parliament on September 8, 1993.
<P>
	This whole process, illustrating how the issue of a code of 
ethics for Canadian parliamentarians has been dealt with, is a 
political masquerade. All to make the Liberals feel good about 
themselves and rationalize the federal view of democracy in 
Canada.
<P>
	Throughout the election campaign in the fall of 1993, the 
Liberal Party of Canada maintained that ethics would be an 
important aspect of its mandate. In the Speech from the Throne 
in January 1994, the government said that integrity and public 
trust in the institutions of government were essential. It would 
therefore appoint an ethics counsellor who, it was hoped, would 
be a symbol of government integrity and a guarantee of public 
trust.
<P>
	However, as far as the most important aspect of the code of 
ethics-conflict of interest-is concerned, the ethics counsellor 
appointed by the federal government continues to report to the 
Privy Council and has no independent powers of investigation. 
He continues to report to the Prime Minister himself.
<P>
	The Liberal Party's red book pointed out, and I quote; ``The 
integrity of government is put into question when there is a 
perception that the public agenda is set by lobbyists exercising 
undue influence away from public view''.
<P>
	Recent events have shown that the whole Liberal strategy of a 
code of ethics for parliamentarians, as confirmed in the 
government motion before the House today, is just another way 
to deceive the public.
<P>
	For instance, the provisions of the Broadcasting Act, which is 
the responsibility of the Minister of Canadian Heritage, do not 
mean much when faced by the powerful lobby of Power 
DirecTv, headed by André Desmarais, the Prime Minister's 
son-in-law. The Liberal government has even stooped to defend 
concepts dear to the hearts of Mulroney Conservatives and is 
now singing the praises of competition on a North American 
scale.
<P>
	Reading the orders from the Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
we get the impression that Power Corporation is calling the 
shots and we can kiss democracy goodbye, in a federal system 
where capital is still king. We should be concerned about the 
narrow view taken by our institutions and our political 
representatives in this case. The government not only ignored its 
own legislation and the CRTC, which is responsible for 
implementing that legislation, it also introduced retroactive 
measures that will prevent Expressvu from launching its service 
next September. And all this in the name of competition. 
Meanwhile, the red book's ethics counsellor is camping in the 
Prime Minister's waiting room.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11970"> 11970 </A></B>
<P>
	And what about a recent trip to Los Angeles by this same 
minister of Canadian Heritage, to meet the leaders of the US 
film industry, at the very moment that the Seagram consortium 
was acquiring MCA. At issue is the fact that MCA had a 
Canadian subsidiary, Cineplex Odeon. Investment Canada, 
which reports to the Minister of Industry, will have to determine 
the nationality of Seagram. If this company turned out not to be 
Canadian, the Department of Canadian Heritage would then 
have to issue a notice of validity for the takeover. Obviously, the 
real reason the Minister of Canadian Heritage travelled to Los 
Angeles was to assure the Liberals' friends at Seagram that 
Ottawa would give favourable consideration to the deal.
<P>
	While the Government House Leader is tabling a motion 
calling for the establishment of a special committee responsible 
for developing a code of conduct for parliamentarians, behind 
the scenes this very government is flouting the most basic rules 
of democracy by favouring the friends of the Liberal Party and 
governing on behalf of the financial establishment and those 
with big money in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	Before closing, I would like to go over in this House some 
elements of the Bloc Quebecois's dissenting report on Bill C-43 
to amend the Lobbyists Registration Act.
<P>
	As I said, conflicts of interest and lobbyists' activities are the 
main issues to be addressed in developing a code of ethics 
governing the activities of parliamentarians in modern 
democracies.
<P>
	Western democratic institutions are currently facing a public 
credibility gap, as you will agree. A good example is the 
percentage of people who voted in the last presidential election 
in the U.S. Clearly, it has now become necessary to restore the 
public's confidence in government. If this goal is to be achieved, 
public policies must be discussed, debated, amended and, above 
all, set openly and publicly. This concern is at the heart of the 
society we plan to build in Quebec. Among other things, we 
want to leave the federal political scene because it has been 
dominated for too long by the Liberals' political scheming.
<P>
	As we have seen, once in office, this government considerably 
watered down the commitments it had made in its red book 
during the fall 1993 election campaign. This about-face has 
raised in the people's minds legitimate questions regarding the 
Liberal government's real desire to develop a code of ethics for 
parliamentarians. Given the gap between election promises and 
concrete legislative measures, we can only conclude that the 
final version of Bill C-43 was probably dictated by lobbyists.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois feels that, to restore the integrity of our 
democratic institutions, we must first do away with the futile 
commitments of the last 30 years, which mislead voters. We 
must also ensure that the administration of government business 
is as open as possible, in order to eliminate grey areas and assure 
the people that policy decisions are consistent with the general 
interests of the population and not those of powerful lobby 
groups.
<P>
	After only 17 months in office, this government already has a 
long record attesting to its lack of openness. In addition to the 
examples mentioned earlier and to the damning legislative 
record with respect to a parliamentary code of conduct, we will 
recall that, on September 26, 1994, Canadian Press reported 
that, according to documents obtained under the Access to 
Information Act, lobbyists had met repeatedly with government 
members in the months leading to the tabling of the current Bill 
C-43 and others had threatened to take their case to court if the 
legislation required them to disclose their political ties. That 
takes some doing, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	In that case, as in many others, lack of transparency made it 
impossible for the public to know the nature and extent of 
lobbyists' efforts regarding Bill C-43. Ironically, lobbyists have 
managed to influence the development of legislation designed to 
limit their influence. Let us face it, as it stands, Bill C-43 is of 
no use to prevent the kind of troubling events surrounding the 
privatization of Pearson Airport or the matter involving the 
heritage minister himself.
<P>
	What is worse, according to Mitchell Sharp himself, the 
Prime Minister's senior counsellor on matters of ethics, even if 
Bill C-43 had been in force at the time the discussions 
concerning the privatization of terminals 1 and 2 at Pearson 
Airport took place, the public would not have been better 
informed. The majority report on Bill C-43 tabled by the 
government members on the committee is a timid attempt to 
regulate the activities of lobbyists and ensure transparency in 
the management of government.
<P>
	Again, the government's attitude in this matter shows that 
what the Liberals say about ethics has no foundation. They are 
only trying to soothe their consciences and look good in front of 
the electorate.
<P>
	The business of the letter in support of an application for a 
licence that the Minister of Canadian Heritage wrote to the 
CRTC, a supposedly independent agency under his authority, 
brought to light the flaws of Bill C-43 with respect to the role of 
the ethics counsellor himself. We will recall that the Prime 
Minister delayed seeking the counsellor's advice on this thorny 
matter for more than three weeks.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	By waiting so long and consulting the ethics counsellor only 
at the last minute, after he had made his decision, the Prime 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11971"> 11971 </A></B>
<P>
Minister showed his lack of consideration for  the ethics 
counsellor. The head of the Liberal government simply wanted 
to add another adviser to his staff. The appointment of an ethics 
counsellor, following a commitment made by the Liberals 
during the election campaign, was only a ploy designed to give 
to the public the impression that the government was taking 
concrete measures to ensure the integrity of Canadian 
institutions. The Bloc Quebecois believes that the issues of 
ethics, transparency and public confidence in democratic 
institutions and management of government business are not the 
prerogative of a political party, a government or a Prime 
Minister but, rather, of democratic institutions as a whole.
<P>
	This is why, in its dissenting report, the Bloc recommended 
that the ethics counsellor be appointed by Parliament for a 
period of seven years, during good behaviour.
<P>
	The Pearson airport scandal, in Toronto, provided a clear 
example of the laxness of the current disclosure rules 
concerning the activities and dealings of lobbyists. In its report, 
the Bloc insisted that lobbyists must disclose the 
representations they make to federal officials regarding 
legislative proposals. The Bloc essentially recommended that 
all lobbyists be forced to disclose the contracts for which they 
try to influence the federal administration.
<P>
	We tabled over 20 amendments in committee regarding Bill 
C-43. All were rejected by government members who, in 
several cases, were not present when testimonies were given, 
and who did not take part in the discussions in recent months. 
We were hoping that the new rules, or at least the direction and 
commitments of the Liberal Party of Canada, would ensure full 
dress debate of such a vital issue for a democracy. The motion 
tabled by the Liberal government to appoint a special joint 
committee of the Senate and the House of Commons to develop 
a code of conduct is just another measure following many others 
which never helped change political habits in this country.
<P>
	The Liberals' intentions regarding the development of a code 
of conduct, which reflect those of the Seagram family and Power 
Corporation, are only intended to fool the public and give the 
government good political conscience.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to table an amendment to the 
government's motion. I propose, seconded by the hon. member 
for Bellechasse:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) by deleting, in the first paragraph, the words ``Special Joint'', ``of the Senate''

<BLOCKQUOTE>(f) by deleting the thirteenth paragraph.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The Chair will take this amendment 
under advisement and rule accordingly later today. Resuming 
debate. The hon. member for Elk Island.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a delight 
to be here this morning to address the motion before us. The 
question of ethics and conduct of members of Parliament and the 
Senate is a very important issue to Canadians.
<P>
	I regret that almost immediately after I became a member of 
Parliament people began attributing to me characteristics I did 
not possess. Immediately they said because I was now in politics 
I must be such and such. They made all sorts of allegations and 
accusations which are not true. I like to think that having 
become a member of Parliament has not immediately blighted 
my character. The question of how we deal with perception of 
Canadians on ethical matters is of great importance.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	I applaud the government for at least having the courage to 
begin the debate. I also have a fear that in this debate as in others 
we may have more smoke and mirrors, more symbolism than 
substance. We must have a mechanism which will satisfy the 
anxieties of Canadians when they feel their politicians are not 
behaving correctly.
<P>
	The Order Paper indicated the committee producing this code 
of conduct is comprised of eight members of the Senate and 
fourteen members of the House of Commons. The solicitor 
general indicated there were to be seven members of the Senate. 
I presume seven is the correct number since that is what he said 
and the Order Paper must have been changed. Perhaps we could 
get clarification on that in the future. Whether there are seven or 
eight is irrelevant to my debate, and so I do not need that answer 
immediately. We will want to get that clarified.
<P>
	In my previous profession I was a mathematics teacher in high 
school for four years and then at a technical institute for 27 
years. Very early in my teaching career at high school some 30 
years ago I had a debate with my students. The question was why 
should they respect me.
<P>
	I still remember the essence of that debate. It helped me then 
to solidify a principle which I have kept all my life up to this 
point. I appealed to my students. I said let us start off with the 
premise that because of my position I am worthy of respect, 
instead of the one that I am not worthy of respect.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11972"> 11972 </A></B>
<P>
	Then I said: ``Let us not leave it there. As you get to know me 
better as I work as your teacher I hope I will be able to earn your 
respect. You will find I know my subject well, am able to 
communicate it and that I am fair in my marking''. In all these 
different aspects of a teacher's life there would be a 
development of a respect which was earned.
<P>
	With all due respect to the government's intention of having a 
joint committee to form a code of conduct the bottom line is, has 
been and will continue to be that those of us elected to public 
office will have to earn that respect. To a large degree that is an 
individual effort.
<P>
	Some people, whether there is a code of conduct and/or a code 
of ethics which is greatly detailed, will not live up to it. They 
will lose the respect of the voters in their constituencies and 
probably throughout the country. Others, whether there is a code 
of conduct or a code of ethics or not, will generally behave in an 
honourable way. I like to think that will be the majority of us.
<P>
	Allegations of dishonesty and others against politicians are 
the attribution I believe of the characteristics of very few to the 
greater number. In a way that is most regrettable, but it is an 
opportunity for us to take some action to correct the 
misperceptions and incorrect behaviour.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	The purpose of the committee is to produce a code of conduct 
to guide senators and members of the House of Commons in 
reconciling their official responsibilities with their personal 
interests, including their dealings with lobbyists. The motion 
has come out of Bill C-43 to amend the Lobbyists Registration 
Act. These items are tied together.
<P>
	I have a substantial question. How did it ever happen that we 
need to address this question? Most lobbyists do not waste too 
much time with members of Parliament; they go to the the loop 
of power. They will go to deputy ministers and cabinet 
ministers. They will try to influence the Prime Minister. They 
will probably try to influence anybody who has the power or the 
authority to make decisions.
<P>
	We now have need for a code of conduct that will address the 
question of what kind of activity or what kind of dialogue is 
morally acceptable between a lobbyist and a person in a position 
of power.
<P>
	Our democracy has gone awry. If these matters were working 
correctly we would have each member of Parliament faithfully 
and dutifully representing the wishes of his or her constituents. 
There would be open debate in this place and in committees. 
There would be freedom from coercion from the party. As a 
member of Parliament I would have freedom to express in both 
the debate and in the vote the wishes and aspirations of my 
constituents.
<P>
	We have lobbyists who try to influence public policy, which is 
an aberration of the democratic process. I applaud the process. It 
is necessary given the way things work around here. It should be 
unnecessary because we would not even contemplate permitting 
special interest groups and lobby groups to be the sole 
determiners of public policy.
<P>
	We also have the question of procurement, which is probably 
the larger one. The government is the largest doer of business in 
the country. To be successful in an enterprise often means being 
successful in gaining government contracts. In some instances 
individuals basically get set up for life because they were 
successful in that regard. To be able to get a government contract 
we have the scenario of lobbyists affecting the decision maker.
<P>
	It seems there are two levels of lobbying. I may be wrong. I 
am relatively new here but I have done some study of it and I 
have kept my eyes and ears open. There are two levels on a 
continuum. At one end end of the spectrum we have totally 
legitimate representation of what a firm or company can do. We 
have its track record in producing what it contracted to produce 
and the quality of the product or the service. It is straight 
information gathering. If procurement in government were 
handled correctly, they would be part of the conditions of 
contracts when bids are let, and I believe they are. That 
information goes on the public record as part of the decision 
making in letting a contract.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	Another kind of lobbying is the one we need to address. It has 
people, and rightly so, greatly upset. I am referring to the 
mechanism whereby the subtle pressure or influence is probably 
not deep enough to warrant a judicial investigation: ``You are 
my friend'' or a friend of a friend ``and we would like to be given 
special consideration because of that''.
<P>
	I do not think it happens a great deal, but there are certainly a 
lot of suspicions about it happening too often when we consider 
the reaction of Canadians and talk about the issues with them. I 
cannot help but think of some specific instances in the area for 
which I am critic. It is very negative that allegations are even 
made.
<P>
	We always get the message that the situation has been 
misunderstood, that we do not have the facts and that the 
allegations are false. We have not had it in the past and I regret 
that with the changes in Bill C-43 and with the motion we are 
not likely to have a mechanism with the authenticity to satisfy 
the questions Canadians have.
<P>
	As I said in my speech on Bill C-43, we have two kinds of 
problems. One is where there are allegations of wrongdoing and 
the allegations are accurate. We need to have a mechanism to 
identify the allegations and bring the responsible people to 
accountability. I do not believe Bill C-43, the present Lobbyists 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11973"> 11973 </A></B>
<P>
Registration Act or the motion and the possible outcome of the 
committee's work will actually answer that question. It should 
but I do  not think it will. I ask the House to pardon my 
scepticism.
<P>
	Then we have the other problem which is just as important. It 
has to do with the basic principles of law. I have had a lot of 
opportunity to discuss matters of government and related issues 
with students, especially with respect to the Young Offenders 
Act. We often get quite distinct overreactions to how harsh the 
law should be.
<P>
	I had a discussion with some students not long ago. We came 
to the conclusion that the law had two functions in which it must 
be very accurate. It must accurately declare innocent the people 
who are truly innocent. It is not acceptable in our legal system to 
declare people guilty who are truly innocent. We must declare 
them innocent if they are. That is mostly done and is an aspect of 
the motion that I think is being missed. If an allegation is made 
that has no basis in fact, we do not have the mechanism to 
declare in a persuasive way that things are well. That is the 
missing element.
<P>
	I have already mentioned the other part: if an allegation is 
made and there is guilt, the process of law, if it is court or this 
process here, should accurately declare guilty the guilty people. 
I am more concerned about allegations toward innocent people.
<P>
	There have been cries from the government in the last several 
weeks on the issues we have brought forward. Allegations are 
being made and the government keeps saying there is nothing 
wrong and that nothing has gone bad. Can we believe that? We 
do not have an independent person, an independent ethics 
counsellor who can be trusted because he is at a reasonable 
distance from the government.
<P>
<B>(1255 ) </B>
<P>
	I would like to say something peripherally. Last weekend I 
was talking to some constituents back home. Their concerns 
have to do with much broader issues than even the points I have 
been making so far. The Solicitor General mentioned one of the 
concerns in his intervention. He wants to remove from people's 
perception that public office holders are able to use their offices 
for their own advantage.
<P>
	With great concern several people in my constituency raised 
the issue of the MP pension plan. That is probably the greatest 
private interest exercised by members of the government. It is 
an instance where every one of them benefits from his or her 
position. They are in positions as members of Parliament to vote 
themselves an outrageously excessive pension plan compared to 
private industry. It is outrageously excessive compared to what 
is allowed in the Income Tax Act for private citizens. If that is 
not conflict of interest I do not know what is, but we have no 
mechanism to deal with it. That is a little aside from the main 
thrust of what I am speaking about today.
<P>
	I have another concern with regard to the committee. It has a 
fair number of members. It is directed to consult broadly and 
review the approaches taken with respect to the issues in Canada 
and in other jurisdictions with comparable systems of 
government.
<P>
	I am to be asked by my party to be one of the representatives 
on the committee. Frankly I have a bit of fear that for some 20 
members plus staff this spells travel all over the world. The 
committee will probably want to go to Australia to see how it is 
done there. Maybe it will want to go to Singapore to see how it is 
done there. Maybe it will want to go to Thailand, England, 
Germany, France, Spain and Italy. It will go on and on; it will 
have to travel to a number of the states of the United States to 
investigate fully and consult broadly.
<P>
	I am prejudging but it has happened so often that when a 
committee is struck its travel and expenses escalate right out of 
sight. I do not think Canadian taxpayers have the stomach to foot 
$20 million or $30 million for the study of something so 
self-evident that it should not be necessary. Here we are doing it 
and giving broad ranging rights or commitments to the 
committee that it have all these powers.
<P>
	I urge the government at some stage before we are asked to 
vote to say that it will limit the expenditures of the committee to 
a stated figure. Why do committees not have a budget they have 
to live within? That is a missing element.
<P>
	Other clerical points are stated. I would comment on them but 
I am running out of time. I want to state one more issue with 
respect to whom we will hear from. I am afraid the committee 
will listen primarily to us, that is we shall listen to ourselves. 
Once again we will have the fox proclaiming he did not eat the 
chicken. We need to ensure the witnesses at the committee 
present broad points of view and not just listen to MPs and 
senators who are primarily affected by the rules and the code to 
be produced.
<P>
<B>(1300 ) </B>
<P>
	We need to listen to Canadians. We need to listen to the 
taxpayers and wage earners. For example, this past weekend I 
talked to one young couple who are on UI. They have no 
reasonable hopes for a job. They are paying the bills. Those are 
the people we should be listening to on this matter, to see what 
expectations they have of public office holders.
<P>
	It is mandatory that we have input from ordinary Canadians 
on issues such as this. They are continually left out of having 
influence on these decisions. They are not asked. They are given 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11974"> 11974 </A></B>
<P>
no choice. They are told to pay the bills and are coerced to do it 
through taxation.
<P>
	I strongly recommend that if the committee does its work and 
does it well and there could be an independent ethics counsellor 
to enforce it, then there would be some gains. This committee 
should do its work very thoroughly. Because of the lack of an 
independent ethics counsellor, the work of this committee is 
ever so much more important.
<P>
	It is pivotal that this committee do good work to come up with 
a very clear, well defined code of conduct. I would like to see it 
get into some of the ethical matters as well. It helps to 
deteriorate the respect of government when members of 
Parliament and senators break laws which are part of the 
Criminal Code with increasing frequency. That issue is not 
being addressed. We need to address it in a very emphatic and 
strong way.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roger Simmons (Burin-St. George's, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I too have a few words to say in support of the motion 
put forward by my friend and colleague, the government House 
leader and solicitor general. It is a very good government 
initiative. I want to respond ever so briefly to my two colleagues 
who just preceded me, the gentleman from Elk Island and the 
gentleman from La Prairie.
<P>
	I heard my good friend the former high school teacher, as I 
am, talk about stereotyping politicians. I could not agree with 
him more. As an educator, like him I am sure, I had some 
standing in education before coming into politics. I found that 
the morning after, all the people who had previously sought my 
opinion on education matters had no interest at all in my opinion 
even on education matters.
<P>
	There was a stereotyping, as he said. There was the suggestion 
that he had acquired some new characteristics simply because he 
had been labelled as an elected politician. I identify very much 
with what he said on that issue.
<P>
	I say to him kindly that he should not fall into his own trap. He 
should not do what he, in the previous mouthful, condemned 
others of doing. I identify with him that the stereotyping is 
unfortunate. In his very next sentence he proceeded to say: ``I 
hope this government does not do what all the other 
governments have done''.
<P>
	I ask him to allow the same suspension of judgment on this 
issue that he asked people to accord him as a newly elected 
politician. This is a newly elected government. It was elected 
the same day he was elected. I think he understands exactly what 
I am saying.
<P>
	I identify also with the comment he made about no code. A 
code cannot be written tightly enough or properly enough to 
address the situation in its fullness. Finally one comes back to 
the respect that people must earn. I would like to elaborate on 
that a little later.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for La Prairie expressed some 
concerns about the quorum of the special joint committee. I am 
sure the hon. member knows perfectly well that what he is 
suggesting does not even exist in the case of the House, and for 
good reason.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	My friend from La Prairie suggested that the proposed 
committee ought to have the provision that the opposition would 
have to be present for a quorum to be in effect. He should think 
about that for a moment. I am sure he means well, but he should 
really think about it. He is asking that the committee have an 
authority that no other committee of the House has, nor does the 
Chamber, and for very good reason. Just think about it for a 
moment.
<P>
	Let us apply it to the Chamber. If the Chamber had the 
requirement that we could do not do business unless there was a 
member of the opposition present, we would then give to the 
opposition, the minority in normal times, the right to boycott 
business. Therefore, it could prevent business from taking 
place.
<P>
	The framers of the provisions that make this place function, 
and in Westminister and elsewhere, wisely saw the trap of that 
kind of proposal. That is why in the Chamber technically we can 
do business with only the government party present, provided 
there is a sufficient number of people in the House, that a 
quorum is present. That is the way it ought to be. Technically 
that is the way it can happen, but it very rarely happens that way.
<P>
	As my friend from Elk Island is anticipating by his comment a 
moment ago, committees are the masters of their own rules. 
There is nothing in this resolution before us now to prevent the 
committee from setting out certain ground rules as to how it 
operates, who shall be present for taking of evidence, what 
members should be present for making decisions and so on. In 
that context, the committee itself can address the issue my 
friend from La Prairie has raised.
<P>
	Let me appeal to members of the House to first demolish the 
very prevalent myth that what is seen on the television news 
every evening and what is heard on the radio news every day is 
typical of what happens in this House. That is a very big myth.
<P>
	I will put it into terms for the people who do not sit here. 
Imagine for a moment that you had a camera on you for every 
hour of your eight or ten hour working day in your own life as a 
housewife, carpenter or teacher. Suppose you had a camera on 
you for every moment of the day. Would you be deadly serious 
for all of those eight hours? Would there be times when you 
would be less committed to your immediate objectives than at 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11975"> 11975 </A></B>
<P>
other times during the day? Would there not be times when you 
might show a little fatigue or a little annoyance  if you had a 
camera on you every minute of your working day? That is the 
way it is in the Chamber.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	Couple that fact with another. Members of the news media are 
not paid to report the mundane. Something they see here may be 
quite effective and quite productive, but if in their 
characterization it is mundane or run of the mill and ordinary, 
they are not going to report it.
<P>
	What makes the evening news is the atypical, the stuff that 
does not represent the cross section of what goes on here. What 
goes on here to the outsider is by and large fairly boring, I have 
to admit. It is fairly mundane. If they were to report that as a 
matter of course, the news media may well lose their positions in 
the ratings. I understand why certain things are reported on the 
evening news. I understand that well and I do not debate it. Do 
not be hoodwinked by the myth that what is seen on the evening 
news is representative of what goes on here. Anyone who sits 
here knows it is not representative.
<P>
	Let us deal with the myth that histrionics and theatrics are 
somehow evil tools in the conduct of public business. Mr. 
Speaker, you and I in our family situations, in our social 
situations, in our church situations use theatrics and histrionics. 
It is part of our stock and trade. How mundane would life be if 
we felt the need to speak in unmodulated monotones all the 
time?
<P>
	The idea that somehow to make a point here we should not get 
the fellow's attention first is an idea that runs contrary to the 
way we operate when we go into the salesroom to buy a car, to 
make a purchase or to deal with our neighbour about where his 
fence should not be. It is part of our nature to use histrionics. Do 
not ask me to shake off my basic nature when I come in here.
<P>
	The 90,000 people in Burin-St. George's who elected me 
elected me for a number of reasons. I say me. We can extrapolate 
that and say any member in the Chamber. I assume they elected 
me because of what I am and who I am, warts and all. Maybe 
they saw some assets in some of the warts in terms of their 
capacity to be represented, for me to be their voice here. They 
did not tell me to become a robot, a voting machine. They told 
me: ``Go up and show them some of your guts. Tell them what 
you feel about rural Newfoundland''. That is called theatrics. 
That is called expressing it from the gut. Take that out of 
Parliament and we can write all the codes of conduct we want 
but we will not have a very effective Parliament.
<P>
	Accountability is central to the functioning of this place. 
Accountability to the people of Canada. I will fill in the blanks 
for the member for Elk Island if he is not sure of what I am 
saying.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> Why?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> I say in fairness to my good friend from Elk 
Island that we can do this one of two ways: question and answer, 
or the way I did with him which was to listen to what he had to 
say. If he has some questions, there is a 10-minute period after 
and he can ask me all the questions he wants to ask. I do not mind 
the other way because I like the thrust of spontaneous debate. I 
have a certain train of thought going and I would like to keep it 
going for at least one minute. My attention span is not very long. 
It gets even shorter when I get intelligent fellows like the 
member for Elk for Island picking on me.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	Accountability to the people of Canada is central to the 
functioning of Parliament. If the histrionics and theatrics are 
removed, we lessen the chance of accountability. Any prime 
minister or minister, of whatever party stripe, can craft a good 
neat answer that will cover his or her rear end if there is time to 
do it. But use the element of surprise, use some theatrics and 
histrionics during question period and we will get the 
unvarnished truth sometimes. That is why we have question 
period, so we can have some of that unvarnished, unrehearsed 
accountability.
<P>
	Members may ask what this has to do with the motion that 
there be a committee to look at a code of conduct. It has 
everything to do with it. I have a particular fear about this 
committee. I support the motion wholeheartedly. It is a good 
idea, but I fear that when the committee sits down to do its work, 
it might get over-anxious about its mandate or misinterpret its 
mandate or go beyond its mandate altogether.
<P>
	The committee should keep in mind it is not dealing with a 
bunch of angels here, nor should it be. It is dealing with people 
who represent a cross section of Canada. Canadians for all their 
goodness by and large are not angels. Do not try to write a code 
of conduct that would do credit to the angels.
<P>
	As my friend from Elk Island said, using other words a little 
earlier, the ultimate functioning of this place is predicated, as it 
ought to be, on the integrity of those elected to serve here. Those 
who abuse the trust given to them by the electorate will be dealt 
with not by any committee, not by any code of conduct. They 
will be dealt with by the electorate as they ought to be.
<P>
	At the same time the proposed code of conduct is needed and 
must have teeth. I do not want a lot of flowery expressions, 
however laudable, from this committee about what I ought to be 
doing here. I have a fairly good idea of what I ought to be doing 
here. I would rather have some provisions that would help me to 
ensure that I do the right things and if I stray from the narrow 
path, will discipline me for doing so.
<P>
	The practice of parliamentary immunity is one that we need. 
We want to allow freedom of expression in the Chamber. I want 
to be able to say everything I need to say on behalf of the people 
who sent me here without fear of being dragged into a court of 
law. That is why we  have parliamentary immunity. The flip side 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11976"> 11976 </A></B>
<P>
of the coin is that the irresponsible person can use parliamentary 
immunity as a shield for irresponsible behaviour. It has been 
done.
<P>
<B>(1320 ) </B>
<P>
	In the context of this proposed code of conduct here is what I 
suggest. This is just by way of example. I suggest that the code 
include a provision that if a member stands in his or her place 
and makes an allegation which is subsequently established to be 
unfounded, that the member be disciplined, with the caveat that 
if the person did it unwittingly and it could be demonstrated that 
he or she did it unwittingly, then it is a different issue.
<P>
	There are many examples. I have seen in the Chamber, and in 
the other chamber in which I had the privilege of sitting in 
Newfoundland, members rise to espouse positions, to make 
allegations and to enter into character assassinations and smear 
jobs using information which they knew to be blatantly false. 
They had it both ways. They said it in the chamber and, 
therefore, they could not be taken into a court of law to prove the 
allegation. It would be reported by a press person in the gallery 
what was alleged and the damage was done.
<P>
	Therefore, I appeal to the committee to ensure that whatever 
code of conduct it crafts it be one that has some teeth in its 
enforcement.
<P>
	I have had much pleasure in supporting the motion, not as my 
hon. friend from Elk Island implied because I have been told to, 
but because I have great faith and a great belief that it is the way 
to go.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I really 
enjoyed the intervention of the hon. member for Burin-St. 
George's, as I always do. He speaks with eloquence and with 
humour, which is a very good mixture.
<P>
	He talked about how often allegations are made which are 
unfounded. That is the point we are failing to address. When 
someone in the government is accused of something, rightly or 
wrongly, it is the mechanism of government that comes to his or 
her defence. We must have the independence of the auditor 
general in the body of the ethics counsellor so that he or she is 
seen to be totally independent of any influence and can put the 
right spin on the investigation. That is the missing link. I believe 
that is the Achilles' heel of Bill C-43 and this motion.
<P>
	I ask the hon. member to expand on his remarks on 
accountability to the Canadian people. I know what he will say, 
so I will anticipate that and ask the second question.
<P>
	He will probably say that every time there is an election the 
people of his constituency and every constituency across the 
country have the right to turf out their MP in favour of another 
MP, another party or whatever. That is the usual stock answer we 
receive. How does the Canadian voter ever get to vote on issues 
which were not a part of the election campaign? They have no 
input.
<P>
	I observe there is a great deal of party discipline. People vote 
not the way their constituents tell them to vote but the way they 
are told to vote. It is obvious to me and I wonder whether it is not 
also obvious to the hon. member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. friend from Elk 
Island.
<P>
	Without instructing the committee on what it should do, I am 
hoping that it will look very hard at the idea of an independent 
ethics counsellor. It should be an ethics counsellor separate 
from the one that advises the government. In my view they are 
two distinct entities. A person trying to do both would be in a 
conflict of interest. I would like to see an independent ethics 
counsellor under the aegis of the mandate of this committee.
<P>
<B>(1325 ) </B>
<P>
	The member is in danger of getting into circular arguments 
about consulting the electorate. I consulted the electorate in 
October 1993 when I was elected. It just so happened we did not 
have in front of us the 1,017 items we are going to deal with. 
Therefore I could not ask them to vote 1,017 times for this and 
against this. I am glad we did not because that is not the way 
Parliament operates.
<P>
	They did not elect me to come to Ottawa to vote for or against 
gun control or anything else. They elected me on the basis of my 
being able to use my best judgment and being accessible to them 
to ensure that my judgment is influenced by what they think on 
particular issues. That means I have to be accessible.
<P>
	I was in my riding in Newfoundland this past weekend, the 
weekend before and I will be there four days from now. I cannot 
do any more unless I spend all my time there and no time here. I 
have to speak for me only. I am very accessible to the people I 
represent. I know their points of view and I believe I relay them 
faithfully.
<P>
	If we carry this idea to the extreme we will not need members, 
we will just need 27 million buttons where everybody pushes a 
button next to where they operate the electric can opener or 
microwave. It will be a parliamentary button saying how they 
will vote. Today they will vote on taxes, tomorrow on paved 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11977"> 11977 </A></B>
<P>
roads and the next day on something else. It might be a workable 
system in some ways but the system we have is also workable. I 
advocate continuing with the one we have rather than the push 
button next to the microwave.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with a great deal of interest to what the hon. member for 
Burin-St. George's had to say. Nevertheless, I want him to 
know that when I decided to go into politics at the federal level, I 
faced even more resistance from members of my immediate 
family, especially my eldest son, when he came home with a 
copy of the <I>Journal de Montréal</I> that contained certain polling 
results.
<P>
	People were asked to rate various professions according to the 
degree of confidence they had in these professions. 
Unfortunately for me and for all here present, we ranked 27 out 
of 28, just ahead of used-car dealers. So my son told me: ``Dad, 
if you go into politics, if you are ever elected, I am afraid you 
will become a-'', and I will let you fill in the word my 22-year 
old son used.
<P>
	If I am not mistaken, the hon. member for Burin-St. 
George's voted against the motion moved by the hon. member 
for Richelieu-if I am wrong, I am sure he will say so-since the 
major problem for politicians is money. Remember what 
happened to Pearson airport in Toronto. The Bloc Quebecois 
forced a major debate on the issue in this House, and it is not 
over yet. The matter is still before the Senate.
<P>
	So wherever money is concerned, people often tend to cheat. 
The Bloc Quebecois, through the hon. member for Richelieu, 
presented a motion in the House proposing that, like the system 
in the Quebec legislature, party fundraising would be a very 
democratic process, in which only individual voters would be 
able to donate funds to political parties. So ``Power steering'' 
Seagram and the banks would not be able to donate a single 
penny to political parties. And making fun of this very common 
sense approach suggested by the hon. member for Richelieu, a 
Liberal backbencher moved that no voter be allowed to donate 
more than one dollar, and government members voted in favour 
of that.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	When the hon. member for Burin-St. George's said 
parliamentary immunity should be maintained and that his 
constituents voted for him because of his qualifications-he had 
some faults but they were negligible-he never mentioned the 
need for above-board fundraising. I think it is nice to visit our 
constituents and ask them for financial support so that we can 
continue our work. And then when they put a hand on our 
shoulder and say: ``Chrétien, you are doing a good job, keep up 
the good work and here is $25'', that is encouraging. I would 
rather get $25 from one of my constituents than $25,000 from 
the Royal Bank of Canada, which would make me totally 
dependent on the bank.
<P>
	In this House I am a free man, and when I feel like criticizing, 
I go right ahead and do it.
<P>
	So I would ask the hon. member for Burin-St. George's what 
he would suggest in the way of no strings attached fundraising to 
his colleagues in caucus. You know, when a party is in power, it 
may develop some very good ideas, as the Parti Quebecois did, 
but often they are put on the backburner.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roger Simmons (Burin-St. George's, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I can identify with the comments of my colleague for 
Frontenac about the survey on the level of people's trust in 
politicians. At the same time, however, I believe that the 
impressions were created by the politicians themselves. This 
morning, in the House, for example, we heard comments and 
allegations about politicians' reputations.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	If we as politicians spend all our time telling the public what a 
terrible bunch of people we are, we should not be surprised if 
they begin believing us. We can only change that by example.
<P>
	In my last election campaign the largest contribution I 
received from anybody was $1,000. I have refused large 
amounts of money over the years for leadership campaigns. I 
refused a $15,000 contribution on one occasion for a leadership 
campaign, and that refusal I have documented if members would 
like to see it.
<P>
	I believe, as the member does, that if persons and companies 
give you large sums of money it is not because they like you, it is 
because they would like to rent you. I do not think we should be 
in that business.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Before we go on, I must inform the 
House that the motion of the hon. member for La Prairie is 
admissible.
<P>
	We will therefore now continue the debate on the amendment 
to the motion with the hon. member for Chicoutimi.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank 
you for having allowed the motion of my colleague for La 
Prairie. The Bloc Quebecois will support the motion.
<P>
	For as long as the members opposite have been in power, 
Canadians and Quebecers alike have helplessly watched as 
political scandals teeming with conflicts of interest have 
unfolded with every passing week and month right before our 
eyes, without the government, currently sitting on its majority, 
revealing any pangs of conscience.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11978"> 11978 </A></B>
<P>
	By stating on the weekend in Trois-Rivières that he had 
succeeded in restoring honesty and integrity in Ottawa, after 
only 18 months in power, the Prime Minister simply added fuel 
to the fire. Did he not have to defend his own actions last week? 
Did he not come to the defence of his Minister of Canadian 
Heritage, who, for the second time in recent months, found 
himself in a conflict of interest situation by attending a dinner 
given by an American film giant? Integrity and honesty here 
border on scandal.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	I would like, if I may, to refer to the red book, which the 
Liberals were forever brandishing about during the last election 
campaign. I note in passing, however, that we hear less and less 
about it, since the government is unable to deliver the goods, 
that is, jobs. This government deserves its title of government of 
unemployment and poverty. The red book refers to integrity in 
chapter 6, on page 90, in the following terms:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The most important asset of government is the confidence it enjoys of the 
citizens to whom it is accountable. If government is to play a positive role in 
society, as it must, honesty and integrity in our political institutions must be 
restored-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	A little further on, at page 91, we have the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If government is to play a positive role in society, as it must, honesty and 
integrity in our political institutions must be restored.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Once again, this is wishful thinking, but it is no longer enough 
these days.
<P>
	Let us be realistic about these things. Conflicts of interest are 
not new, they have always been with us. However, in recent 
years, such conflicts involving those in public office have 
caused a lot of concern in the public. Not surprising, then, that 
the public gives politicians the lowest approval rating.
<P>
	Clearly, even the slightest hint of a conflict of interest causes 
the public to lose confidence in the integrity of public office 
holders. Need I even mention the cavalier and scandalous 
behaviour of certain ministers and of those working closest with 
them, most often relatives, which has made the need for this 
code of conduct greater now than ever before.
<P>
	The code of conduct we are demanding would distinguish 
between MPs, Cabinet members and their staffs. The Bloc 
Quebecois is against creating a joint committee of senators and 
MPs. In our opinion, only the elected should be able to 
deliberate on this issue. Members of the other place do not 
represent the population and, hence, cannot take part in 
decisions which are the sole responsibility of those who must 
answer to the electorate. Furthermore, their reputation has been 
more than tainted recently, by their own actions, behaviour, 
words and the high-budget foreign trips which some members 
of the other place have taken. I will not name any names. And, in 
reality, the issue that interests us is ethics in Parliament, so, let 
us directly address it.
<P>
	According to Mr. Justice Parker, who presided over the 
inquiry into the alleged conflict of interest in the case of the hon. 
Sinclair Stevens a few years ago, there are several kinds of 
conflicts of interest. For example, a real conflict of interest 
occurs when a minister is aware that a personal financial interest 
is great enough to influence the exercise of his or her official 
functions and responsibilities. This definition should be noted.
<P>
	In addition, according to Mr. Justice Parker, a potential 
conflict of interest always exists when a minister ends up in a 
situation in which a personal financial interest could influence 
the exercise of official functions and responsibilities which 
were not yet exercised. A potential conflict of interest becomes 
a real conflict when the minister does not dispose of the holdings 
in question or does not resign from public office. These are the 
issues which the committee should be examining.
<P>
	Mr. Justice Parker also stated that an apparent conflict of 
interest occurs when a reasonably well informed person has a 
reasonable doubt that a conflict of interest exists. This happens 
almost daily in this House.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	Impartiality and integrity underlie any conflict of interest 
rules. Decision-makers cannot be regarded as impartial and 
upright if they benefit or might benefit personally from their 
decisions. The members opposite have learned this the hard 
way.
<P>
	Government's actions over the past 18 months have seriously 
shaken public confidence in government institutions. We need a 
code of conduct to restore public confidence and improve the 
government's image, especially as certain types of conflict of 
interest are unavoidable. This is the case of inherent conflicts of 
interest, which are due to the fact that parliamentarians are also 
members of society, and as such are either landlords, parents or 
consumers.
<P>
	Also, there are unavoidable sources of conflict because 
parliamentarians represent constituents with whom they share 
common private interests, be it farming, fishing or natural 
resources development.
<P>
	Family business raise a particular issue as this category 
generally covers a whole array of assets, debts and financial 
interests. It is usually at such interests that the conflict of 
interest legislation is aimed as they may have a significant 
impact on the independence of lawmakers.
<P>
	The most common interests that may put lawmakers in a 
conflict of interest situation are the following. First of all, 
investments; then, debts which can be a source of conflict; also, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11979"> 11979 </A></B>
<P>
as managers, they must act in the best interests of their 
companies, whereas, as members of Parliament, they have an 
obligation to the public; offices held in companies may be a 
source of conflict.
<P>
	Another potential source of conflict is other positions or 
professional activities. Let me give you a definition. To what 
extent should parliamentarians be allowed to practise law, act as 
consultants or hold any other kind of position? A lawmaker 
might attract more clients if they believed the lawmaker could 
increase their influence on the federal government.
<P>
	There is also lobbying. It is absolutely normal for legislators 
to deal with government officials on behalf of their constituents, 
but what about MPs who take advantage of their positions to 
promote their own interests, or one who is paid to act for a third 
party? Conflicts of interest can also arise, in the case of 
government contracts. To what extent should members of 
Parliament have the right to own shares in companies that get 
government contracts?
<P>
	Gifts and fees are another element. Should a member of 
Parliament be authorized to accept free trips, vacations and 
other gifts from acquaintances or foreign governments? Can 
fees be considered as gifts in disguise?
<P>
	Information obtained in the performance of one's official 
duties can also cause conflicts of interest. Must we implement 
control measures to prevent legislators from using such 
information for personal purposes?
<P>
	Finally, what about spouses and children? To what extent 
should the interests mentioned earlier be controlled if they 
belong to relatives of a member of Parliament? This is no small 
issue. MPs could be influenced just as much by interests owned 
by their families as by their own. Out of politeness, I will not 
insist on that point; it would simply be too easy to do so.
<P>
	As you know, all of us here are governed by statutory and 
parliamentary rules. However, there are some contradictions in 
the legislation. It prevents some public office holders from 
being candidates but does not prevent members of Parliament 
from accepting those same offices once they have been elected.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	Another example comes from the fact that the Parliament of 
Canada Act states that a person cannot be elected to the House of 
Commons if he or she holds a government contract providing for 
the expenditure of public moneys. However if a member of 
Parliament does not receive public money, but benefits 
otherwise from such a contract, he probably will not fall under 
this provision, but that is far from being clear, and this is the part 
that hurts the most. That is far from being clear.
<P>
	Finally, a parliamentarian who is a shareholder in any 
company having a contract with the government is covered by 
this provision only when the contract is for the building of 
public works, which seems to allow the parliamentarian to 
invest in a company and thus avoid this requirement, which, you 
will agree, constitutes a huge loophole.
<P>
	In 1973, the federal government released a green book 
entitled: ``Members of Parliament and conflict of interest''. In 
1978, once again, the government moved the bill on the 
independence of Parliament, which would have expanded the 
measures proposed in the green book. In 1979, after its second 
reading, the bill died on the Order Paper. In November 1985, the 
House Standing Committee on Management and Members' 
Services was to examine the appropriateness of establishing a 
register of members' interests. Four bills aimed at governing 
federal legislator conflicts of interest were tabled during the 
33th and 34th Parliaments.
<P>
	In 1991, it went on. The government tabled its third bill on 
conflicts of interest, Bill C-43. In 1992, the Special Joint 
Committee on Conflict of Interest tabled its report. The 
committee members' views differed in many respects from the 
policies reflected in Bill C-43. In March 1993, the government 
tabled its fourth bill on the same subject, Bill C-116, and again, 
in June 1993, the Speaker of the House of Commons reported to 
the House, recommending that Bill C-116 be put aside. And in 
1993, once again, the Liberal government stated that ethics was 
a significant part of its mandate. It still has not done anything.
<P>
	This is of great importance since we know that in the last 20 
years, millions of dollars were spent on consideration of these 
bills, on the establishment of parliamentary commissions or 
joint committees on conflicts of interest, or on the development 
of ethics codes for members of Parliament. Yes, millions and 
millions of dollars were taken from the pockets of taxpayers 
from Canada and Quebec. This has to stop. I want action on this, 
once and for all. We must stop fooling the people and act on the 
problem.
<P>
	Government leaders must do everything they can to change 
the public's perception of parliamentarians. They must stop all 
this protecting each other, stop trying to dazzle us with all this 
fancy footwork to cover things up, and simply be ready to admit 
that some government member is in conflict of interest. It is 
often said, and rightly so, that it is up to leaders to set a good 
example. That is why I support the amendment of my colleague 
for La Prairie.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I found the remarks we just heard from the hon. 
member opposite very disappointing. He has made assertions 
without giving any proof, and he has stated things that, to remain 
within the bounds of courtesy and parliamentary language, I 
would describe as rather far removed from the truth.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	An hon. member said that bills introduced in the House have 
cost millions of dollars in tax money. Taking a bill and printing 
it in a subsequent session under a new number-one does not 
need to be a great expert in parliamentary procedure to realize 
that it is easy to renumber a bill and reintroduce it-may be an 
indication  of some weakness on the part of the previous 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11980"> 11980 </A></B>
<P>
government. I would not deny that, because we all know the 
former government was not convinced of the need for such a 
bill.
<P>
	Some members opposite have been Conservative members 
and supporters of a former prime minister. Some of them even 
sat on the executive of a former prime minister's riding 
association. They must be offended by those remarks about their 
former boss and mentor, Brian Mulroney.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sauvageau:</B> He was not a liar.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> I did not say that.
<P>
	We have before us today a very good bill introduced by the 
present government to fulfil another promise in the red book. It 
will be one of the many achievements flowing from the red 
book. Last Friday, the House discussed Bill C-43 on lobbyists 
registration. Unfortunately, that debate was not completed. That 
is another commitment of the Liberal government, among many 
others. Today, we keep another promise. This time, it is about 
setting up a parliamentary committee to prepare a code of 
conduct for members of the House and members in the other 
place.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I want to take a moment to talk about the issue of why we need 
a code of conduct for both Houses, as opposed to just one.
<P>
	For the life of me, I have some difficulty understanding the 
amendment that is now before the House, the amendment by 
which senators will not be subject to a conflict of interest code 
that will apply to MPs. Why not? Why do some members across 
the way not want senators to have to live with the conflict of 
interest rules like we do? What is the objective of that?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The reasoning put forward by the mover of the amendment is 
more or less the following: since only members of Parliament 
are elected, they should be the only ones subjected to these 
rules. There is something wrong with that logic. Electors put 
pressure on their members of Parliament to remain honest; all of 
us feel this pressure and need it; this is what democracy is all 
about. If even with such democratic pressure, we still need a 
conflict of interest code, I think that a chamber not under this 
kind of pressure needs such a code at least as much as us and 
maybe even more. Yet, the Bloc members want to see to it that 
senators are not subject to conflict of interest legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> They are honest.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> I wonder, Mr. Speaker, how can one explain 
such reasoning. The member opposite just said that senators are 
honest. I believe that parliamentarians in both chambers are all 
basically honest and that all of us who have been sent here by the 
Canadian people have an interest in doing what is best for our 
electors.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The member who spoke before me made certain accusations 
and he referred to the powers at the top and the family of those at 
the top. It was quite obvious that although he perhaps did not 
have what I would qualify as the fortitude of naming him, he 
wanted to describe the Prime Minister. He wanted to make-and 
he did, albeit in a less than totally courageous way, which he did 
not have the wherewithal to raise-accusations against the 
Prime Minister.
<P>
	I want to bring to the attention of members an editorial in 
today's Toronto <I>Star</I>. The Toronto <I>Star</I> states: ``Phoney scandal 
over satellite TV''. This is the issue the member wanted to bring 
across.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	In Ottawa, the opposition parties, with an almost audible cry 
of ``gotcha'', think they finally have a winning issue, one that 
will stick to the Prime Minister's teflon hide. It is not gun 
control, deficit, social spending cutbacks or Quebec. No, it is 
direct-to-home satellite TV.
<P>
	The Liberals overturned the CRTC decision last summer 
granting an effective monopoly to one company, Expressvu, to 
bring satellite TV to people's homes. The commission decision, 
made without a public hearing, had prompted howls, not only 
from the competition, Power DirecTv, a subsidiary of Power 
Corp., but also from consumers and editorialists.
<P>
	In response, the Liberals established a panel of three people of 
impeccable credentials, all former deputy ministers, to review 
the CRTC decision. They concluded that the CRTC had goofed, 
and called for an opening up of direct-to-home satellite TV to 
competition. The cabinet concurred.
<P>
	The opposition complaint is not with the substance of the 
government's decision; rather, it is that Power Corporation's 
president, André Desmarais, is the Prime Minister's 
son-in-law.
<P>
	I will read the last line as we approach question period. It 
states: ``The cabinet's authority to overturn CRTC rulings in 
cases such as this was specifically envisioned by this legislation 
introduced by the Conservative government, of which Bouchard 
was a member. As for the Prime Minister's own role, he declared 
a conflict and stayed out of the decision.'' Case closed.
<P>
	There have been no fewer than four such editorials. Did 
members across outline this? No. They continued today to make 
what I would qualify as less than honest comments impugning 
the integrity of the Prime Minister.

	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in the House today to acknowledge a special 
undertaking in my riding of Parry Sound-Muskoka.
<P>
	The community of Bala, which is well known for its annual 
Cranberry Festival, is once again proving that its citizens have 
what it takes to launch worthwhile community initiatives.
<P>
	This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Bala and District 
Lions Club, an organization that time and time again has 
contributed to the positive development of this close-knit 
community.
<P>
	Now, to commemorate its 50th anniversary, the Lions Club 
intends to build an open-sided community pavilion at Jaspen 
Park in Bala for use by families and groups who spend time 
enjoying the park. Fundraising has begun in earnest and a 
concept drawing has been prepared by local artist and historian 
Lorne Jewitt.
<P>
	I congratulate the Bala and District Lions Club for this 
welcome and generous initiative. I applaud the Lions members 
for the warmth and spirit behind this move, because when it 
comes right down to it these are the gestures that truly define our 
communities.

able to attend the festival ``Vues d'Afrique'' and present her 
movie ``Le Démon au féminin'' in which she decries the 
intolerance and abuses of fundamentalism in Algeria.
<P>
	The Minister of Immigration initially refused to grant an 
entry visa to Ms. Koudil despite having approved a special visa 
for a right-wing American activist one week earlier. Following 
vigorous pressure exerted by cultural and women's groups, 
supported by the official opposition, the minister finally granted 
the required visa.

	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this statement is inspired by the passionate and entirely justified 
complaint of Bruno Epp of Calgary.
<P>
	Bruno, along with thousands and thousands of other 
Albertans, is fed up with decades of federal tax unfairness that 
has resulted in the following inequity. From 1961 to 1992 
Albertans per capita and per year paid out over $2,000 more tax 
to the federal government than they received in services. The 
only other province whose citizens got less than they paid was 
Ontario.
<P>
	This trend will only worsen now that the finance minister 
decided in his last budget to disproportionately punish Alberta 
for its fiscal responsibility. There is a basic injustice here that is 
not being ignored in Alberta.
<P>
	Why should the citizens of one province pay out for three 
decades running billions more than they received? The country 
has taken Alberta for granted. Bruno Epp and thousands of other 
Albertans want Ottawa to know they have had enough.

<P>
	A Liberal government led by Lyn McLeod at Queen's Park 
will help get Ontario back on track. The performance of the 
current NDP government, including its obstructionist, 
unco-operative dismissal of federal-provincial relations, has 
left Ontario with uncontrolled government spending, rising 
debt, a stalled economy and one in nine Ontarians on welfare. 
Clearly the time for a change in government is now.

and as a result we now have a remarkable partnership. The Brant 
Waterways Foundation, the Grand River Conservation 
Authority and the city of Brantford have all joined together to

the hero of the east coast. At the other end of the country the 
B.C. fishery has taken a beating and, according to British 
Columbia's fisheries minister, 1995 will be no different.
<P>
	Along the Quesnel River the chinook salmon run of 1994 was 
down 75 per cent. The Quesnel River hatchery released over 
200,000 fish to support these levels but it is threatened with 
imminent closure.
<P>
	Its last release scheduled for this month will consist of 
200,000 one-gram chinook babies who only have a one in 
one-thousand chance of surviving because of their age and size. 
They are being released a whole year early. These fish are not 
crying out, ``someone reach out and save us'', like the minister 
quoted the turbot as saying in New York. After all, these chinook 
are not old enough to talk.
<P>

conservation seriously. It is time for him to show his

	<B>Mr. Simon de Jong (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the National Capital Commission has a proposed 
master plan for the development of a high tech park in the 
greenbelt area in Nepean. There already exists a high tech 
district in Kanata which is under utilized and ready for business.
<P>
	Is it necessary to build when the infrastructure already exists? 
Is it necessary to destroy a green area when other areas are 
already serviced and desperate for business? Would more stable 
employment not be generated faster if the existing infrastructure 
were used?
<P>
	Furthermore, the NCC's plans are bitterly opposed by the 
neighbourhood. Most residents of Crystal Bay have signed 
letters protesting the proposal. Earlier in March a public 
meeting was held and the residents clearly stated they wanted 
the greenbelt green, not paved.
<P>

frugal in its spending. The Liberals say they are committed to

	One of the most vivid images of this decade and the most 
haunting is one that we have seen on the covers our our national

	In Canada, as in the United States, we are proud of our

line every time they go to work. Firefighting is one of the 
nation's most dangerous occupations, and the men and women 
who enter this profession do so in service to all Canadians

Iqbal Masib, who was campaigning against the use of children in 
Pakistani carpet factories. Although his protest campaign 
resulted in the closure of several factories, it also led to his death 
at the hands of killers.

only because they have small fingers but also because they do 
not complain about abuse and constitute a source of cheap 
labour for employers. That is very, very sad.

	Canada must be vocal in its denunciation of child labour in all 
its forms. We must convince governments with existing

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in his speech to the Liberal party faithful in 
Trois-Rivières yesterday, the Prime Minister accused the 
Government of Quebec of ignoring poverty, adding that Quebec 
had more poor people than anywhere else in Canada.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Acting Prime Minister, and I 
imagine it will be the Minister of Human Resources 
Development.
<P>
	Would the minister agree that it takes a lot of nerve to accuse 
the Government of Quebec of neglecting the poor, when his own 
government, in its first two budgets, launched an attack on the 
poor and the disadvantaged in Quebec and Canada, thus putting 
thousands of people on welfare?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I certainly share the 
public's concern about poverty, and especially child poverty.
<P>
	However, our government has taken a number of steps to 
respond to these serious problems. For instance, we created 
thousands of jobs across Canada, and especially in Quebec, 
where we created 110,000 permanent jobs, including 73,000 in 
Montreal alone during the past year.
<P>
	The best way to deal with poverty is to help people get a job. 
This year, the government's record on job creation has certainly 
been the best of any western country.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, 40 per cent of new welfare recipients in Quebec are 
unemployed workers who have exhausted their unemployment 
insurance benefits. Who is to blame? Blame the man who 
launched those tirades on the weekend.
<P>
	How can the federal government accuse the Government of 
Quebec of ignoring poverty, when the federal government, 
through cuts in unemployment insurance under Bill C-17 and 
reductions in federal transfer payments for social assistance, has 
aggravated the circumstances of thousands of people who, in 
Quebec, are already living below the poverty line?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is important to point out 
two very important figures. During the past year 86,000 fewer 
people applied for unemployment insurance as a direct 
consequence of improved job creation and employment 
development. In other words, the number of people applying for 
unemployment insurance has fallen drastically. The number of 
people  who have exhausted their benefits has fallen by almost 
25 per cent.
<P>
	To say, as the hon. Leader of the Opposition tried to do in his 
statement yesterday, that the consequence of the problem is 
because of people exhausting UI benefits is simply not borne out 
by the facts.
<P>
	We understand and certainly share a very strong concern 
about long term unemployment problems. They are faced by 
every country. There are major changes in the workplace. That is 
why we want to bring in reforms to our social, training and 
development programs. To go around pointing the finger, as the 
hon. member did, and saying that is the problem simply is not 
borne out by the reality of the facts.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, job creation is the best way to fight poverty.
<P>
	That being the case, the federal government is hardly in a 
position to blame Quebec, when that same government refuses 
to get involved in the conversion of Quebec's defence industry, 
refuses to help MIL Davie, cuts off regional development 
assistance and manages to chop $200 million from the 
infrastructures program, the only tangible job creation measure 
announced by this government since it came to power.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have been through the 
discussion on MIL Davie. My colleague, the Minister of 
Industry, has dealt with it many times, pointing out that the 
major shareholder in MIL Davie is the Government of Quebec. 
If they are directly concerned about job creation then they have 
an opportunity to produce.
<P>
	I point out a further observation for the hon. Leader of the 
Opposition. Because of the direct efforts and initiative of the 
government, in addition to setting a different climate throughout 
the country for the 430,000 jobs that have been created, over 
120,000 jobs were created last year. There were infrastructure, 
new programs in internships and new developments dealing 
with applied programs for apprenticeships. Various kinds of 
direct initiatives have provided an additional 120,000 jobs for 
Canadians.
<P>
	That demonstrates we are taking our responsibilities 
seriously. We are doing what we can to respond. We simply ask 
that other governments take their responsibilities as well.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Industry stated last Friday in the House that he had 
kept the Prime Minister's senior policy adviser, Eddie 
Goldenberg, abreast of developments on the Power DirecTv file, 
in which the rather large Liberal family, including the Prime 
Minister's son-in-law, has a stake.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Industry. How can he claim 
that the Prime Minister remained at arm's length of the Power 
DirecTv issue, which has implications for his son-in-law, when 
his senior policy adviser was kept apprised of developments and 
intervened at every step of the process, until it culminated in the 
adoption of an order custom-made for Power DirecTv?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, as I explained in detail Thursday and Friday, I believe, 
the satellite broadcasting issue was handled transparently and 
was accepted by all independent parties concerned. I have yet to 
hear how the Bloc Quebecois would handle the satellite 
broadcasting issue, perhaps because they lack a policy on it. Our 
approach was to table a directive in the House of Commons, as 
provided for under the Broadcasting Act, which was tabled in 
the House when the leader of the Bloc Quebecois was a member 
of the Mulroney Cabinet.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, what 
gall! When the minister talks about transparency on this issue, 
the only thing that is clear is that the Prime Minister's 
son-in-law lucked out when this extraordinary, unprecedented, 
exceptional measure was implemented. That is the one thing 
that is clear.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That is what I call clear. That is 
transparent.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That is family spirit.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> Can the Minister of Industry actually be 
serious when he claims that Mr. Goldenberg was not involved in 
the Power DirecTv deal, when Cabinet made its first move in the 
company's favour, deciding to review the CRTC's order and to 
create a working group led by Mr. Goldenberg's former 
associate just days after the Prime Minister's senior policy 
adviser and the president of Power DirecTv met?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think the report of the committee speaks for itself. 
The committee proceeded in a transparent fashion. It received 
submissions from across Canada. It made them available 
publicly. The report of the committee has not been criticized in 
its logic or its substance by any member of the House, including 
the hon. member who posed the question.
<P>
	There is no basis upon which the government should fail to act 
to carry out its responsibilities in a way that responds to the 
interests of consumers and ensures a competitive structure for 
satellite broadcasting in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1425 ) </B>
<P>
	If there is any basis upon which the hon. member can suggest 
the government should not act or should refuse to act in the best 
interest of Canadians, let him explain it. He has the opportunity 
to do that during the course of review of the direction in the 
House of Commons.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
throughout the direct to home satellite debate the government 
has attempted to deflect criticism by portraying the Reform 
Party as anti-competition, and nothing could be further from the 
truth.
<P>
	The government has also said that we could not criticize the 
process. Wrong again. Not one part of the tainted DTH process 
was above board. Expressvu is loaded with CRTC insiders and 
Power DirecTv has stronger Liberal ties than Mackenzie King.
<P>
	The only thing that has been clear in all of it is that Canadians 
are paying the price for the government's lack of coherent 
cultural policy that favours true competition.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage. If the 
government truly wants competition, why will it not live up to 
its commitment to release a comprehensive cultural policy?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are making policy and this is what seems 
to be so irritating to the opposition. It is important to make 
policy for the information highway and the bottom line of it is 
Canadian content. The bottom line of Canadian content is the 
production of Canadian content. This is what we are doing.
<P>
	We are bringing the policy before the House through the 
direction. There will be opportunity for members of both 
opposition parties to express their views. This is also the reason 
why I have been investing time in the film industry, in order to 
make sure there is Canadian content.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
did not get a response to my question regarding competition. 
Policy is required but not the ad hoc weathervane approach of 
the government.
<P>
	One day the government is restricting choice and competition 
in the country music industry. The next day it is opening the 
doors for its Liberal friends in Power Corp and their American 
buddies to set up their satellite networks across the country. It is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11987"> 11987 </A></B>
<P>
no wonder the Minister of Canadian Heritage does not know 
whether he is coming or going.
<P>
	I have a supplementary question. Where does the government 
really stand on competition in cultural industries? Is the 
government for it or against it?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is very important to understand one thing. In 
pursuing the issue of how to move forward the satellite 
broadcasting file, the government has repeatedly restated its 
commitment to a competitive environment.
<P>
	I do not understand. Last Thursday quite properly Mr. Rick 
Anderson disclosed on national television that he had an interest 
in Expressvu. I would like to know, and I think Canadians have a 
right to know, whether the senior political adviser for the leader 
of the Reform Party has played a role in deciding what strategy 
members of that party were going to follow in pursuing this file 
because they are against competition and they are against 
consumers in the way they are conducting this file.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
that is the most ridiculous spin I have heard yet in the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage. The 
government's ad hoc approach to cultural competition cannot 
continue. Eventually the Liberals will have to get off the fence. 
The CBC is in disarray for the lack of a cultural policy. The 
Canada Council is in disarray for the lack of a cultural policy. 
We are crawling along the information highway at a snail's pace 
because of the lack of cultural policy.
<P>
	What is the holdup? Is the government waiting for the 
approval of Mr. Goldenberg, Mr. Desmarais or Mr. Bronfman?
<P>
	I ask again: When will the government release its long 
awaited cultural policy? We have been waiting for 18 months.
<P>
<B>(1430 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, before asking about Canadian cultural 
policy, our colleague should know about Canadian culture.
<P>
	The hon. member seems to have been fighting to bring 
American culture here by supporting some American interest in 
the Country Music Network rather than supporting Canadian 
interests. It is no wonder that through a lot of accusations which 
have nothing to do with policy she gets a wonderful quote in the 
<I>Globe and Mail</I>. The Saturday editorial in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> 
said: ``The public has a pretty good nose for a rat and this time it 
is not on government benches''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
Friday, the Minister of Industry acknowledged that Eddie 
Goldenberg, the Prime Minister's senior adviser, had 
communicated two things to him, and I quote: ``-that the Prime 
Minister did not want to be involved in any way in the matter, 
and neither did he''. Not long before, however, the Minister of 
Industry had said he had kept  Mr. Goldenberg informed of all 
developments concerning Power DirecTv.
<P>
	How does the Prime Minister explain the Minister of 
Industry's regularly informing his senior adviser, Eddie 
Goldenberg, of decisions concerning Power DirecTv, after Mr. 
Goldenberg had said he did not want to be involved in the matter 
in any way?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I find it peculiar that opposition members seem to think 
there is something wrong here when they cannot point to 
anything wrong either with the report or its implementation.
<P>
	I will restate that of course it is normal in important files that 
the Prime Minister's office would be informed of what was 
happening. However, I would also like to state as I have 
repeatedly that with respect to this file decisions were taken by 
the Minister of Canadian Heritage and myself. We were neither 
instructed nor requested either by the Prime Minister or by his 
principal secretary to do anything in particular on these files. 
The decisions we took were our own. As far as I am concerned, I 
have yet to hear any substantive criticism of any of them.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in view 
of the direct involvement of the Prime Minister's son-in-law, in 
view of the millions of dollars at stake and in view of the serious 
allegations as to the role of the Prime Minister's office in the 
Power DirecTv matter, will the Prime Minister agree to table in 
this House the memorandum in which he insisted he not be 
involved in this matter in order to avoid any conflict of interest 
given his son-in-law's interests in Power DirecTv?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this same question was put on Friday. There is no 
question of something being tabled. The Prime Minister made it 
clear in his only comment on this file in my hearing that he 
wanted nothing to do with it. He removed himself from cabinet 
when it was discussed at that time. There is really nothing there 
for the hon. member to ask for.
<P>
	It is more important to ask what exactly this is all about. I 
think that is a complete bankruptcy of policy in both of the 
opposition parties, neither of which has the faintest idea what 
should be done with respect to satellite broadcasting policy in 
this country.

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
government appears particularly sneaky. First it told Canadians 
that MP pension reform would save taxpayers over $3 million. It 
did not mention the fact that Canadian taxpayers would have to 
top up the trough annually to the tune of $7 million.
<P>
	The government told Reformers that we could opt out if we 
found the pension scheme a little too rich for our blood. What it 
did not say was that future MPs will be forced to join this 
obscene pension plan.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. Why has the 
government limited the opting out provision to current MPs 
only? How deep is this cabinet's commitment to real pension 
reform?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it was on 
February 22 that the President of the Treasury Board made the 
announcement with respect to MP pensions. A backgrounder 
was also available on that day indicating very clearly the 
conditions under which the legislation would come forth. It is an 
opportunity for people to opt in once the legislation is in. 
Everybody will be treated in a very similar way.
<P>
<B>(1435) </B>
<P>
	I might add that the member for Calgary West and the leader 
of the Reform Party were in attendance at the meeting. I do not 
know why there are any particular surprises. If there are 
suggestions to be made, they can be made in this House when the 
legislation is debated. They can also be made in committee.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
surprise stems from the fact that this government had the gall to 
actually introduce that legislation without making some kind of 
statement.
<P>
	Nothing has really changed. The MP pension plan is still 
astronomically rich. We will still receive twice the national 
limit. Those benefits are still indexed against inflation and there 
is no cap on ministerial pensions.
<P>
	Maybe the class of 1988 and the others who will choose to join 
me in opting out of this pension plan could change things from 
the inside. The legislation that was tabled is not acceptable.
<P>
	Why did the government rule out replacing the entire MP 
pension scheme with a more realistic private plan such as other 
Canadians receive, one dollar for one dollar?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
particular question shows very clearly the opportunism sought 
by the Reform Party. The red book made two promises. It said 
that the age of eligibility would be raised and that has been done. 
The red book also said there would be no double dipping and that 
has also been done.
<P>
	However, the government decided to go further. It said that it 
would contribute one-third less to MP pensions than it had in the 
past. It also said that MPs did not need to participate. It also said 
there would be 20 per cent less accrual rate for MPs. It went 
beyond what was promised. The Reform Party is trying to 
exploit this issue for its advantage.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the heritage minister claims that he learned of the 
takeover of MCA by Seagram only after getting off the plane in 
Los Angeles, adding that the transaction was highly secretive, 
when there had been reports about the imminent takeover of 
MCA by Seagram for weeks.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Canadian Heritage explain his 
travelling incognito to Los Angeles accompanied only by his 
chief of staff, without being given the usual pre-trip briefing 
that department officials always give their ministers before a 
trip abroad?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, such trips, this one in particular, are 
carefully planned. As I told the House before, I had taken the 
time to consult with several representatives of the Canadian film 
industry. That qualifies as preparation.
<P>
	Second, to keep travel expenses to a minimum, I do not travel 
abroad with an entourage of government officials unless I have 
to, and I dare anyone to come out and disprove it. I would also 
point out to our colleagues opposite that the our consul general 
in Los Angeles was with me at every meeting I attended. So, 
every single one of the allegations we have heard over the past 
few days is false.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister maintains that this visit had been carefully 
organized. If that is the case, could he tell us how he can 
continue to maintain in earnest that he knew nothing about this 
transaction until he got off the plane in Los angeles, when every 
major daily newspaper in Canada was reporting that a deal was 
imminent, as was confirmed by Mr. Bronfman himself the day 
before the minister arrived incognito in Los Angeles?
<P>
<B>(1440) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage,

listening to me. Of course, rumours had been going around for a 
few days and I am on record in <I>Hansard</I> as saying on April 28 
that I had heard a rumour to that effect a couple of days prior to 
the takeover.

have predicted exactly when the transaction would take place. In 
order to know, I would have had to be informed of what was 
going on. I did not learn about the transaction on the day it took 
place because, as I have been telling you repeatedly, no one kept 
me fully informed of this whole matter.

<P>
	When the finance minister brought down his budget in

pain equally, every region except metro Toronto apparently. 
Canadians were stunned to hear that under pressure from Liberal 
MPs, the federal government is restoring $4 million of federal 
funding to Harbourfront.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister justify giving Harbourfront $4 
million at a time when Canadians are being asked to tighten their 
belts even further?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am happy that the 
Reform Party has raised this issue. It underlines its fundamental 
support for cultural activities in this country.
<P>
	I am rather surprised that Reform members would be against 
Harbourfront receiving moneys in order that it can carry on its 
activities and contribute substantially to tourism in the province 
of Ontario.
<P>
	The hon. member should also know that the money which has 
been allotted to Harbourfront is not new money. It is a 
reallocation of moneys from the existing department, which 
goes a long way to providing much needed jobs in the city of 
Toronto.

his helmet for too long.

to consult with the parties and try to reach a compromise.
<P>
	I know that the opposition would prefer to take immediate 
action, without taking all necessary measures and without 
analyzing the situation. This government, however, wants to do 
the right thing for Canadians and Quebecers and will therefore 
make every effort required to achieve this goal.

	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
last Monday we were advised that the province of Nova Scotia, 
not the federal government, had decided to divert $26 million 
from the Wentworth bypass project in Nova Scotia to the riding 
of the minister of public works in Cape Breton.
<P>
	Richie Mann, an MLA in Cape Breton whose riding will also 
benefit from this diversion of funds has stated: ``Mr. Dingwall's 
role in this is that he talked to us about it and we talked to him 
about it and we all agreed it is a worthwhile project to do''.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services. Why did the minister put himself in a 
conflict of interest position when he talked to Mr. Mann about 
diverting the $26 million to a tourist road in his riding from a 
road that has claimed over 40 lives between 1986 and 1992, a 
road that will now have to be a toll road?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is an unusual situation when members of Parliament, 
and for that matter because of a previous incarnation when I was 
in the New Brunswick legislature, not to have politicians talk 
about roads, especially in Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	I can assure the hon. member that the discussion of the 
allocation of highway funds for Nova Scotia took place with the 
minister of transport for Nova Scotia. Those consultations are 
ongoing with Nova Scotia and other provinces.
<P>
	I am sure the hon. member recognizes that when members of 
the House have an opportunity to discuss with their provincial 
colleagues matters of mutual interest, it is certainly not a matter 
of conflict of interest, but a matter of doing their jobs. It is 
something of which the hon. member is not too aware, 
obviously, by the interest he has brought to this matter over the 
last couple of weeks.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this is the fourth time I have stood in the House and asked the 
question of the minister of public works, and I keep getting an 
answer from this fellow.
<P>
	Members on both sides of the House say misappropriation of 
funds has taken place. This is a classic case of conflict of 
interest. The Auditor General of Nova Scotia says that this is a 
serious case.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister call for an investigation by the ethics 
counsellor? If possible, I would like to ask either the Prime 
Minister to answer or the fellow who will not stand up here.
<P>
<B>(1455 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Usually, but not always, questions should be 
directed to a minister rather than this fellow because it confuses 
the Chair sometimes. The hon. Minister of Transport.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is very unfortunate that the hon. member does not 
understand that when agreements are made with provinces there 
is an ongoing process of consultation.
<P>
	The moneys that are going to be spent in Nova Scotia, as is the 
case with any other funds expended on behalf of the Canadian 
taxpayers, are subject to very stringent review both by the 
Auditor General of Canada as well as our department when we 
are reviewing those expenditures.
<P>
	I know the hon. member is new to the House. It is true he has 
been up three or four times-and it shows-but the problem he 
has is in addressing questions like this using words like 
misappropriation of funds. If the hon. member were a little bit 
more careful he would understand that misappropriation of 
funds has implications that go far beyond a simple renegotiation 
of a contract to allocate funds for highway construction in any 
province.
<P>
	Therefore, I ask the hon. member to reconsider that kind of 
insinuation.

<HR>
<B><A NAME="11992"> 11992 </A></B>
<P>
	My colleague is familiar with recent reports from the

<P>
	Could the parliamentary secretary tell the House what the 
government is doing to get at these problems to ensure that 
Canadians receive federal services in either official language 
where that is entitled?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
commitment and the resolve to ensure quality services in federal 
buildings under the Official Languages Act continues.
<P>
	The Secretary of the Treasury Board will be requesting action 
plans from all of those departments where performance was 
weak or where they were not investigated. Those plans will be 
brought forward by the end of September, will be put together 
and brought to the parliamentary committee on official 
languages for discussion. The degree to which the 
implementation has occurred will be reviewed in March 1996 
and every six months thereafter.
<P>
	Finally, a list of all of the buildings requiring those services 
have been updated and circulated. There have been over 700 
consultations in the regions to try to ensure that the service is 
improved.

question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	The minister recently published a brochure promoting 
National Volunteer Week. This brochure emphasizes the 
importance of volunteer work in our communities and pays 
tribute to the 13 million volunteers in Quebec and Canada who 
give their time to the disadvantaged, the needy and the 
neglected.
<P>
	How can the minister stress the merits of and need for 
volunteer work when the funds allotted to voluntary 
organizations have fallen from $1,066,000 in 1993-94 to 
$65,000 in 1995-96, a 94 per cent cut?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage,

go to volunteer organizations. I support their work because it is 
eminently commendable and because it furthers the

	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a

confirmed that the Reform Party has been right all along. It 
found, among other things, that the skill and language levels and 
ability to integrate of today's immigrants has declined as a result 
of the short-sighted family reunification and refugee policies of 
the government.
<P>
	In light of this study, will the minister of immigration 
immediately reconsider his 1995-96 do nothing immigration 
plan, a plan that makes no significant changes to the policies of

<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and

presented to the House of Commons was not only the work of the

talked and discussed with over 10,000 Canadians the kind of 
immigration policy that the country wants to have and what were 
their views on our position in the international community. The

commend him for it. He will remember that the bureau of

issue. The interdepartmental committees worked on contracting 
procedures and found that all of these procedures did comply 
with all aspects of competition law.
<P>
	A number of recommendations were made for increasing the 
competition and encouraging new companies to bid for this 
business. A number of measures were implemented in the past

out that both of the successful companies that won are run by the

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="GOVERNMENTRESPONSETOPETITIONS">GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 36(8), I have the honour to 
table, in both official languages, the government's response to 
no fewer than 90 petitions.
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="NUCLEARNON-PROLIFERATIONTREATY">NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION TREATY</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Raymond Chan (Secretary of State (Asia-Pacific), 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a few days from now representatives of 175 
nations, including Canada, will gather in New York to decide the 
fate of the most important international arms control agreement 
in force today, the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, NPT. Few 
agreements are as important to Canadian security as this key 
international agreement.
<P>
	Today I want to outline briefly why Canada supports the 
indefinite and unconditional extension of the NPT and the 
reasons we will be encouraging others to do the same at this 
important conference.
<P>
<B>(1505 ) </B>
<P>
	The nuclear non-proliferation treaty, of which Canada was an 
original signatory, entered into force in 1970. The NPT is 
important to Canada for three essential reasons. First, the NPT 
establishes a barrier to the further proliferation of nuclear 
weapons. This is the NPT's most fundamental purpose and its 
most outstanding success. By limiting the spread of nuclear 
weapons, Canada and the world are more secure as a result.
<P>
	Second, the treaty provides the framework for the peaceful 
uses of nuclear energy by establishing a system of effective 
international safeguards. These safeguards, implemented by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency, ensure that nuclear 
material is not being diverted to weapon programs. Canada will 
not sell nuclear technology to any nation that does not have a 
safeguard agreement with IAEA and has not signed the NPT or a 
regional equivalent. Our exports of nuclear technology under 
safeguard agreements have helped to sustain an industry that 
employs 20,000 people directly and another 10,000 indirectly.
<P>
	Third, the treaty commits all states to work toward 
disarmament, including nuclear disarmament. This unique 
binding legal obligation, particularly as it falls on the nuclear 
weapons states, firmly establishes our long term goal: the 
elimination of nuclear weapons.
<P>
	The decision we members of the NPT must make is whether to 
extend the treaty indefinitely or for a more limited duration. Our 
position is quite clear: we believe that Canadians and people 
around the world deserve an enduring commitment by their 
governments to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons 
and to pursue nuclear disarmament.
<P>
	Those who argue that the NPT should not be made permanent 
keep open the possibility of its disappearance at some future 
point. This is not in anyone's interest. We must once and for all 
close the door on that possibility.
<P>
	With the end of the cold war came an end to the nuclear arms 
race. It came to an end because of greater trust, openness, and 
cooperation between Russia and the west. That is the path to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11994"> 11994 </A></B>
<P>
disarmament: greater security.  The NPT is essential to work 
toward greater security and cooperation between nations.
<P>
	We cannot forget that 1995 also marks the tragic 50th 
anniversary of the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and 
Nagasaki. The great American statesman Adlai Stevenson once 
said that evil is not in the atom but in the souls of men. Do we 
need a better reason to co-operate, establish and defend 
international laws that curb the madness of those who would act 
to undermine international peace and security?
<P>
	The nuclear non-proliferation treaty has served Canada well 
for 25 years. It is now time to enshrine those benefits for future 
generations.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
behalf of the Bloc Quebecois, I am pleased to discuss the 
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, whose future is currently 
being decided in New York. The NPT is the most important 
international treaty on arms control.
<P>
	Last fall, the Bloc Quebecois had the opportunity to state its 
position on the issue of nuclear disarmament, when the joint 
committee conducted its review of Canada's defence policy. The 
emergence of new confirmed and unconfirmed nuclear powers 
makes the issue of nuclear disarmament more complex than 
ever.
<P>
	This is why the Bloc Quebecois strongly supports the 
indefinite and unconditional extension of the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty. We hope that its very wide 
membership will be extended even more. While more than 160 
nations have ratified the treaty so far, some countries which 
could conceivably develop such mass destruction weapons 
refuse to sign the treaty, thus jeopardizing the current 
foundations of international peace. It is important to ensure the 
continuity of the treaty and to improve its efficiency.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	It is possible to convince countries to do without nuclear 
weapons. In the past, at least four countries, namely Canada, 
South Africa, Brazil, and Argentina, made efforts to that end. 
Would it not be more efficient, and a lot more attractive for the 
world, to work on a multilateral agreement to eliminate such 
weapons, as was recently done for chemical weapons?
<P>
	While the Secretary of State, Asia-Pacific, was raving about 
the NPT and Canada, which was one of the first two signatories 
to that treaty, I could not help but wonder about this 
government's inconsistency in the conduct of its foreign affairs.
<P>
	It is a well known fact that the Canadian government is now 
only interested in its own commercial interests, at the expense 
of human rights, democracy, as well as international security.
<P>
	Indeed, how can the government explain the fact that it is 
about to authorize and to finance, to the tune of $2 billion, the 
sale of CANDU nuclear reactors to China? The Bloc Quebecois 
feels that the government should at least demand that China 
comply with the NPT, rather than violate the moratorium on 
testing agreed to by other nuclear nations.
<P>
	The sale of these reactors could undermine the international 
community's efforts to end nuclear proliferation.
<P>
	The Canadian government's behaviour is not any better, nor 
any more consistent, as regards the sale of CF-5 fighter bombers 
to Turkey. We know that Turkey is pursuing a military offensive 
in northern Iraq, against Kurds. We repeatedly, but vainly, asked 
the government to stop negotiating that sale with Turkey.
<P>
	I think you will all agree that this government is not very 
consistent in the conduct of its foreign affairs.
<P>
	The fact that it now supports the indefinite and unconditional 
extension of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty gives us 
some hope. But we urge the government to show more 
consistency. For example, Canada could adopt a much stricter 
policy on co-operation in the nuclear sector. As written, the 
present non-proliferation policy allows nuclear exports to 
non-treaty countries, as long as these countries promise not to 
use any material to produce nuclear weapons. There must be a 
stricter policy in this area, if Canada wants to be consistent with 
its interpretation of the nuclear threat and the outbreak of 
military conflicts all over the world.
<P>
	Canada could also innovate by suggesting strategies 
consistent with its interest in international peace. In this regard, 
for example, concrete measures could be taken. One, concerning 
the export of fissile materials on which Canada has a say, 
notably because of its radioactive material resources and its 
nuclear technology expertise.
<P>
	Two, Canada should submit to the international court a 
judicial analysis establishing the illegality of nuclear arms.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this year marks 
the 50th anniversary of the invention of the nuclear bomb and its 
first use on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as we have 
mentioned.
<P>
	These weapons created a new horror for humanity, the scope 
of which we have never known before. Upon witnessing the 
detonation of the first nuclear test explosion, Dr. Robert 
Oppenheimer, the director of the Manhattan project, in his shock 
and amazement at the devastation quoted an ancient Hindu 
scripture that read ``I am become death, the destroyer of 
worlds''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11995"> 11995 </A></B>
<P>
	It was true that for the first time in history man could destroy 
the earth, and nothing has been the same since. Not only did the 
atomic bomb magnify the horror of war, but it changed it 
fundamentally.
<P>
	Throughout the centuries, civilian populations were largely 
left beyond the battlefield. At the very least, a conqueror or 
destroyer would be forced to fight its way through a country's 
defences before they could do significant harm to civilians. In 
other words, there was always a defence and hope.
<P>
	With the creation of nuclear weapons, two things changed. 
First, civilians were no longer unintended victims; they were the 
primary targets, and they could be incinerated by the millions. 
Second, no matter how strong the country's defences were or 
how tough its army was it was still completely vulnerable to 
nuclear destruction.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	Responding to the threat that nuclear weapons would spread 
across the world, the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, the NPT, 
was negotiated in 1970 and has been strongly supported by 
Canada ever since.
<P>
	As the Minister of Foreign Affairs has already described its 
key features and advantages, I will not repeat them. However, I 
will say that the Reform Party will give 100 per cent support to 
the government in its efforts to negotiate an indefinite and 
unconditional extension of the NPT.
<P>
	For the future of our citizens and all the people of the world 
Canada must be a leading voice in the UN, calling for the total 
elimination of nuclear weapons. No good can come from such 
weapons of mass destruction, and their ownership should be 
negotiated away by all governments in good conscience.
<P>
	The Reform Party sincerely hopes that the NPT can be 
renewed indefinitely; however, if certain countries withdraw or 
fail to sign on we believe the government should take into 
consideration whatever action it can use to promote bilateral 
action against those countries.
<P>
	The time has come for the world to take a few large and rapid 
steps away from nuclear annihilation. The end of the cold war 
has made this possible, and now the unconditional and indefinite 
renewal of the NPT is the next logical step. For our collective 
future we must not fail in this task.

Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (order of discharge).
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to introduce this private 
member's bill today and I thank my hon. colleague for 
seconding introduction and first reading.
<P>
	Earlier this year I was approached by a Vancouver area lawyer 
who told me of a concern he had with the Bankruptcy and 
Insolvency Act. The concern is that an offender can be released 
from having to pay any damages arising from assault awarded in 
a civil law suit if they claim bankruptcy.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	The plight of the victim should take precedence over the 
rights of the offender. The victim in this country has suffered 
enough, and then to be hit with a blow that no payment for 
damages will be received because of a loophole in the 
bankruptcy act is completely unacceptable.
<P>
	Many have been victimized by abusive relationships only to 
learn that later they will not receive the awarded damages 
because of a loophole in the federal statute. Fines, alimony and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11996"> 11996 </A></B>
<P>
fraud debt are not exempted; civil damages from criminal 
assault should not be exempted either. Action must be taken now 
to amend the flawed act.
<P>
	The bill I am introducing will add to the list currently in the 
act under section 178. The addition will be civil damages in 
respect of an assault or battery on a victim. The changes will 
give the victim more rights. Every member in the House knows 
the victim certainly deserves more consideration than the 
convicted offender.
<P>
	It is an honour as a private member to have the opportunity to 
introduce a bill. However, I want the government to take a close 
look at the legislation. I know the Minister of Industry and the 
Minister of Justice are interested in this. I encourage the 
government to take it over exactly as it is.

	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Wellington-Waterloo, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the second petition on behalf of my 
constituents deals with another subject.
<P>
	The undersigned draw to the attention of the House that the 
Supreme Court of Canada has allowed extreme intoxication as a 
defence for sexual assault and that this ruling has also been used 
recently as a defence for wife assault. This ruling is regressive to 
women's rights and consequently provides men with additional 
justification to abuse women and their children.
<P>
	Therefore the petitioners call on Parliament to reverse the 
decision of the Supreme Court of Canada to allow extreme 
intoxication as a defence for sexual assault or physical assault.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion and the 
amendment.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Resuming debate. I give 
the floor to the hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, 
who had approximately 12 minutes left.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to conclude the remarks I had started a 
little earlier today regarding the whole issue of public morality. 
It has to be pointed out in this debate that the whole issue had 
been left lying around for a few years under the previous 
administration. Of course, as the old saying goes, what is left 
lying around gets dirty. It is true.
<P>
	Legislation was introduced in 1987 as Bill C-114. It was then 
reprinted as Bill C-46, reprinted again as Bill C-43 and 
referred-in 1991-to a parliamentary committee. The 
committee put forward, in its report dated June 1992, a new draft 
bill. The government used that draft, together with our 
recommendations, to introduce new legislation, i.e. Bill C-116. 
The new bill introduced in the House by the government was 
found lacking, but the minister responsible, Harvie Andre, 
refused to amend 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11999"> 11999 </A></B>
<P>
the bill to make it acceptable, with the result that the whole issue 
was dropped. No wonder some people think that legislators did 
drag their feet on this issue. It is true.
<P>
	I do not intend to deny what happened. I took part in the 
discussion and sat on the committee examining Bill C-116, and 
I realized that so much time had gone by that some documents 
were becoming badly outdated. For example, the report of the 
Parker Commission on the dealings of Sinclair and Noreen 
Stevens was just about forgotten and we did not have a clear 
recollection of its recommendations. It was not easy to examine 
the whole issue.
<P>
	However, the issue has not lost any of its importance and we 
must deal with it. That is why I congratulate the House leader on 
this motion. Hon. members will remember that the red book 
stated quite clearly that this issue and that of lobbying would be 
discussed.
<P>
	We have dealt first with the lobbying issue. I congratulate all 
members who contributed. They did a great job. The bill has 
now reached the third reading stage in the House, and I am sure 
it will be passed in the next few days. We are now ready to move 
to the next issue, that of a code of conduct and a conflict of 
interest code for members of both Houses.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	It is important to examine that issue right after concluding 
committee hearings on lobbying because both issues are related 
to a certain extent, which is a good reason to proceed right away. 
Also, it is important for the government to act now in order to 
show the public that it definitely intends to settle these issues 
and not to drag things out, as we saw under previous 
governments.
<P>
	By introducing this bill, the government is acting with good 
intentions. As our House leader said earlier, all kinds of 
questions will be raised. I remember Bill C-116 and all the 
errors it contained. It was so badly drafted that people under one 
set of rules were subject to another set and vice versa.
<P>
	You have to remember that this whole conflict of interest 
issue really affects three groups. First, there are the members of 
Parliament and the senators, the so-called ordinary 
parliamentarians. Then, there are the parliamentarians who are 
also public office holders; in other words, the ministers and 
parliamentary secretaries. Finally, there are the order in council 
appointees, or the top brass of the public service.
<P>
	So, you have these three groups and then you have a very 
interesting area, the one where some parliamentarians are also 
public office holders, because under the Westminster 
parliamentary system in use in Canada and in several other 
countries, members of the executive branch of government sit in 
the House. They are both ministers and parliamentarians. Under 
such circumstances, you have to determine which system they 
will be subject to. Will they be subject to the rules applying to 
public servants and other public office holders or to the code 
developed for parliamentarians? This was an interesting 
question which was examined by the committee studying Bill 
C-43 and then Bill C-116.
<P>
	We concluded, or rather the government at the time 
concluded, since our recommandations were slightly different, 
that the system applying to public servants had to apply at the 
same time to ministers and other public office holders who are 
also parliamentarians, but that for backbenchers there should be 
a separate system. The reason for this type of distinction is 
simple; it is because a system administered by the government 
cannot bind members of Parliament.
<P>
	I find it difficult to imagine that the hon. member for 
Bellechasse, for example, would agree to be judged by a system 
reporting to the Prime Minister. Indeed, I would not blame him 
for refusing. I would not agree to it myself if I were a member of 
the opposition. Consequently, what we need is a committee 
reporting to the House to judge conflict of interest cases for 
parliamentarians.
<P>
	But, of course, at the same time, we must establish a system 
by which the member for Bellechasse or another member may 
ask questions of the Prime Minister concerning the conduct of 
ministers, questions like the following: ``Mr. Prime Minister, 
since you are the boss, how can you tolerate such and such an 
action by one of your colleagues and what measures will you 
take?''
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	Of course, in a case like that, we would not expect the Prime 
Minister to say: ``No, I am not in charge of these cases, an 
officer of the House is''. The Prime Minister must have the 
authority to take the necessary disciplinary measures and he 
must also be responsible in order to be in a position to answer the 
questions asked by all those who want to make our Parliament 
accountable, as they have the duty to do.
<P>
	We will examine issues such as these in our committee. We 
already know that, in this House, it will be the committee on 
procedure, of which my colleague opposite, the hon. member for 
Bellechasse, is a member. Since he is a law professor, I know 
that he will be able to bring significant input to the work of that 
committee, as will several other parliamentarians. They will all 
help us produce a code of conduct that is both acceptable, so that 
people are not discouraged from running for public office, and 
strict enough to ensure good conduct and public morality.
<P>
	I recognize that it is not always easy to rule in this area. I had 
to deal with such cases for several years when I was the 
opposition critic for government administration. I look forward 
to the proceedings of the committee.
<P>
	But I disagree with some hon. members from the opposition 
who want to exclude from the committee members from the 
other place.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12000"> 12000 </A></B>
<P>
	I must tell you that the code of conduct has to apply not only to 
members of the House, but to senators as well. I said it at the 
beginning of my speech and I will say it again, I ask members 
who propose that senators not be included in this exercise to 
reconsider their position because we may be talking about 
amending the Criminal Code, the Standing Orders of the House, 
the Rules of the Senate and the Parliament of Canada Act. These 
laws and some of these rules need to be amended by both houses 
of Parliament. I am sure that members opposite know that, as 
does the member for Bellechasse.
<P>
	So we have to work together to be able to make the necessary 
changes to the rules in this place and in the other place. Why 
would we want to adopt a code of conduct regarding conflicts of 
interest for the members of this House and exempt the members 
of the other place? I have to tell you that I do not understand why 
people would want to do such a thing. As a matter of fact, just 
recently, some members opposite asked questions about a 
member of the other place who allegedly found himself in a 
conflict of interest situation or something like that. We know 
that it was not true, that the allegation came from the media and 
that the reporter who made the allegation had to retract, but the 
fact remains that such questions were asked.
<P>
	That proves that both houses of Parliament must work 
together to make better rules. That is what I intend to do 
personally as a parliamentarian who is interested in this issue.
<P>
	Therefore, I urge the official opposition to withdraw its 
motion to exempt the Senate from the rules that we want to adopt 
for parliamentarians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I hope we work together to arrive at a good code of conduct for 
members of both Houses of Parliament. In so doing I hope, 
because it is not the whole picture, that in part we will contribute 
toward a better acceptance and a better view by Canadians of 
what we do to govern the country honestly and appropriately. I 
am sure that is the intention of all members of both Houses.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is extremely important that members of Parliament 
have some clearly defined rules for dealing with lobbyists. It is 
important that the Senate have this as well but perhaps it is not 
incumbent upon this House to enact rules for the unelected 
Senate. It first has to clean its own house and then develop its 
own rules.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	Lobbying has long been one of those grey areas where the 
concept has been accepted but frowned upon depending upon 
who was actually doing it. If organizations such as firefighters 
lobby to make Parliament aware of problems within their 
profession, it is considered to be quite acceptable. If business 
lobbies for a particular advantage, then it becomes less clear. If 
that business lobbies using its own existing personnel, it is  
generally considered more acceptable than if it hires somebody 
to lobby on its behalf.
<P>
	There is a bit of hypocrisy in this attitude. Lobbying is either 
right or wrong. We should not be making judgments based solely 
on who is doing the lobbying. This is one of the first issues that 
Motion No. 23 should address.
<P>
	Another area of lobbying that needs to be addressed by 
Motion No. 23 is what constitutes excessive lobbying. If 
lobbying is a legal activity with no definition as to who can do it 
or how much can be done, how can any level of activity be 
considered excessive under the current unregulated structure?
<P>
	A lack of specific guidelines for elected members and for that 
matter the lobbyists themselves have caused many problems for 
both. It is appropriate to spend some time reviewing one of those 
problems.
<P>
	During the 1993 election the Liberals took aim at the Pearson 
Development Corporation contract to redevelop terminals 1 and 
2 at Pearson International Airport. The main hue and cry that 
they raised was that of excessive lobbying which led to a largely 
patronage deal which should be cancelled.
<P>
	Was this contract an example of excessive lobbying? Did that 
lobbying lead to a patronage deal? To determine this, let us start 
at the beginning.
<P>
	Terminal 3 had already been privatized and there was no 
particular objection to this. In September 1989 the Matthews 
group submitted an unsolicited bid for the privatization of 
terminals 1 and 2. The proposal was not accepted. Two and 
one-half years later in March 1992, the government issued a 
request for proposal for the privatization of terminals 1 and 2.
<P>
	One of the Liberals' claims was that the original bid was a 
form of lobbying and that the original proposal gave the 
proposers an unfair advantage in their bidding in 1992. If the 
request for a proposal had followed on the heels of the 
unsolicited bid, there may have been some justification for such 
an argument.
<P>
	Two and one-half years later, a claim such as that is totally 
invalid. Although there were and still are no guidelines for 
lobbying, the Liberals pushed forward with their claim that 
lobbying in the Pearson contract was excessive. This brings me 
back to my earlier question, how can lobbying be considered 
excessive to the point of justifying the cancellation of a contract 
if there are no guidelines to compare it to?
<P>
	A motorist was driving down the street at the legal speed limit 
on a clear day when another driver pulled out in front of the 
motorist and a collision occurred. At the inquiry after the 
accident it was determined that the speed limit followed by the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12001"> 12001 </A></B>
<P>
first driver was too high given the limited visibility for vehicles 
entering the street in that area.
<P>
	The inquiry recommended that the speed be reduced. This 
does not make the first driver guilty of speeding. The speed limit 
cannot be retroactively reduced. This, however, is exactly what 
the Liberals were trying to do with regard to lobbying in the 
Pearson contract.
<P>
	There is no definition of excessive and no evidence that there 
was any abnormal amount of lobbying in the pursuit of the 
contract. The Liberals, who by this time had formed the 
government, cancelled the contract citing excessive lobbying 
and resultant patronage.
<P>
	At the time of the last election the Pearson contract was very 
controversial. Allegations of excessive lobbying and patronage 
flowed freely. Prime reasons for these accusations were not 
those directly involved in the contract. Rather, it was the fact 
that it was put together by the Mulroney government which was 
by then looked upon as unscrupulous and possibly corrupt.
<P>
	The Pearson contract was a victim of election rhetoric, which 
I was caught up in as well. I was one of the voices that 
questioned whether or not the contract holders were entitled to 
any compensation if the accusations levelled against them were 
true.
<P>
	The leader of the Liberal Party stated that if the Liberals 
formed the government, they would review the contract process 
and cancel that contract if they found problems in the process. 
So far so good as far as I was concerned.
<P>
	As promised, the new Prime Minister set out to review the 
contract. For that purpose he appointed Robert Nixon as the sole 
person responsible for carrying out the 30-day review. Nixon 
was a long time Liberal Party supporter, father of a sitting 
Liberal MP and was rewarded for his $80,000 report by being 
appointed chairman of Atomic Energy of Canada, not exactly an 
auspicious beginning for a party decrying claims of patronage 
regarding the signing of the Pearson contract. The Nixon review 
did not interview under oath, talked only to certain people 
excluding some of the principals involved, and did not allow an 
opportunity for any of the testimony to be rebutted.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	The report stated that the deal was bad and should be 
cancelled but did not produce one word of evidence to support 
that claim. Again the general allegation of excessive lobbying 
was raised as one of the major justifications.
<P>
	The Nixon report was the rationale for the Liberal's Bill C-22 
which not only cancelled the contract but allowed the 
government to decide for itself who got compensated and how 
much they got. It also allowed the government to insinuate the 
deal was crooked because of tactics such as lobbying without 
allowing the accused to clear their names and reputations in a 
court of law.
<P>
	This is a very interesting strategy for the Liberals and it would 
have worked was if not for all the evidence to the contrary that 
started to surface. At that point they tried to expand their 
rhetoric to suggest that it was not a good deal financially but the 
evidence does not support this either.
<P>
	The legislation was subject to a debate in the House of 
Commons. When it reached the committee stage, I started to 
realize that the flaw in the process may not have been in the 
awarding of the contract but rather the way in which the contract 
was cancelled. Many of the witnesses requested by either me or 
the Bloc representative did not appear and the Liberal 
dominated committee refused to press those people to attend.
<P>
	The most significant person to be requested and not appear 
was Robert Nixon. In his case it was not a matter of not showing 
up but rather a refusal of the majority of the committee to invite 
him. The committee response to the request was: You have his 
report, what do you need him for?
<P>
	One witness of note who did appear was Sandy Morrison of 
Air Canada who was the main anchor tenant in the contract. Air 
Canada spoke strongly in favour of the contract and requested 
that it proceed as quickly as possible.
<P>
	By this time it had been decided by the government to set up 
another Liberal long time supporter and former law partner of 
the Prime Minister, Robert Wright, to review the compensation 
claims and to make a report to the minister. From this report the 
minister would decide who got paid and how much they would 
receive. Compensation was to be limited to out of pocket claims 
only with no consideration of any further request including 
lobbying costs and third party claims against the Pearson 
Development Corporation.
<P>
	The report and the decision would be confidential and would 
be protected from access to information by making it a cabinet 
document which is protected for 20 years. I questioned why this 
process was bypassing the transport committee and cloaking 
itself in secrecy. I did not receive a satisfactory answer.
<P>
	I believe it is proper that we examine the results of the 
Liberals' false vendetta against the Pearson group so that we can 
fully understand the importance of lobbying guidelines and 
what happens when no such guidelines exist.
<P>
	As I earlier stated, when it appeared the accusation of 
excessive lobbying alone would not be enough to justify the 
cancelling of the contract, the Liberals then tried to suggest it 
was not a good financial deal to cover up the fact that the real 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12002"> 12002 </A></B>
<P>
reason for cancelling the deal was political gain. As evidence 
later showed, the Liberals knew from the very beginning that it 
was not a bad financial deal but they had painted themselves into 
a political corner and they did not know how to get out.
<P>
	Through access to information, I came into the possession of a 
secret government document dated October 29, 1993, supplied 
to Robert Nixon for his review of the Pearson contract. This 
document was supplied by William Rowat, associate deputy 
minister of transport. In that document it is clearly stated that 
the rate of return to the crown from the contract is considerably 
better than the crown construction option and that the Pearson 
Development Corporation return on investment was endorsed as 
reasonable by both the Department of Finance and an 
independent financial consultant hired by the government.
<P>
	A second government document dated November 4, 1993 
later appeared through court disclosure which further elaborates 
on the financial feasibility of the contract. This second 
document was also used to give direction to Nixon. It pointed 
out that in order for the crown construction option to generate 
revenues equivalent to the private sector deal, a real revenue 
growth factor of 10 per cent per year until cost recovery was 
completed would be necessary.
<P>
	Historically speaking, the government management growth in 
revenues has been at or below inflation, projected for the 
purpose of the analysis at 3 per cent per annum. Using a more 
realistic real revenue growth rate of 3.5 per cent per year, the 
crown construction option would have realized $250 million 
less over the term of the contract than through the privatization 
method.
<P>
<B>(1555 ) </B>
<P>
	The second government document also discusses the possible 
cost of cancelling the contract. The options identified are: 
negotiate or expropriate, which leave the government open to 
damages ranging from $500 million to $2 billion; or legislate, 
which could limit the government's liability but leave it open to 
many more potential problems including severe capacity and 
congestion problems, increased costs and the undermining of 
government leasing and contracting processes if it is seen as a 
precedent.
<P>
	The document also discusses the possibility of renegotiating 
or restructuring the contract, but it makes it very clear that this is 
not a desirable option. Nowhere in that document does it suggest 
that Nixon should examine the deal to see if it is clean and if so, 
to recommend that it proceed. From this it seems very obvious to 
conclude that Nixon was directed toward a very specific 
outcome.
<P>
	I have never questioned the government's right to cancel the 
Pearson airport contract. In light of all the information that is 
now available, I might question the wisdom of the cancellation, 
but not the right to do so. With that right goes an obligation to 
see that justice is done, which does not appear to be happening in 
the handling of this contract.
<P>
	All of this has been initiated by the Liberal government which 
was looking for an election issue and seized upon Pearson 
airport as a viable victim. It utilized a lack of any lobbying 
guidelines as a way to try to justify its actions. What is the 
impact of this flagrant attempt to utilize the lack of lobbying 
guidelines? It can be looked at by a complete factual and 
documented review of the impact on Pearson airport.
<P>
	I will pass over commenting on that part because I will be 
short of time. There is so much evidence on this contract, but I 
have to move along.
<P>
	Allow me to mention another aspect of this whole process in 
which the fact that the Pearson International Airport is involved 
at all is wholly coincidental. That aspect is the rule of law.
<P>
	Under Bill C-22 the government is allowed to cancel a signed 
contract and decide for itself who gets what compensation. It 
also allows it to insinuate that the deal and those involved in it 
were crooked without allowing the accused to clear their names 
and reputations in a court of law.
<P>
	What that government action does is pronounce a group of 
Canadians guilty until proven innocent and then removes their 
right to prove their innocence. This action relates much more to 
a dictatorship than it does to a democracy.
<P>
	All of this started as a result of an opportunity for the Liberals 
to seek political gain by utilizing the fact that there were no 
guidelines for dealing with lobbyists or lobbying activities.
<P>
	Motion No. 23 will not only provide clear and long overdue 
guidelines for all MPs when dealing with lobbyists, it will 
protect the public from unscrupulous action by a political party. 
It may even protect the Liberals from their own tendency toward 
election rhetoric.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Secretary of State (Parliamentary 
Affairs) and Deputy Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the goal of the motion before 
us today is to strike a special joint committee of the House and 
the Senate to review the weighty issue of parliamentary ethics.
<P>
	We are counting on this committee to establish a practical and 
realistic code of conduct which will help balance the official 
responsibilities and personal interests of MPs and Senators. 
This issue obviously affects each member of this House 
personally while having a wider, much more fundamental scope: 
it also affects all Canadians. Our conduct as individuals and as a 
group, in fact, determines the level of confidence that Canadians 
have in parliamentarians. The way we carry out our daily tasks 
as parliamentarians molds our institution's image. The trust of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12003"> 12003 </A></B>
<P>
those who elected us to this noble House is either earned or lost 
by our conduct from day to day.
<P>
	The important issues of trust, credibility and ethics are at the 
heart of the agenda we presented to Canadians during the last 
election campaign.
<P>
	In fact, we devoted an entire chapter of our red book to 
parliamentary integrity. We clearly stated the principles 
whereby we recognize the following: ``The most important asset 
of government is the confidence it enjoys of the citizens to 
whom it is accountable''. We also recognized that the Canadian 
government would be unable to play the constructive role which 
it must unless, first and foremost, it restores the integrity of our 
political institutions.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	Since being elected 18 months ago, we have made 
considerable progress in this area. We reinforced the code of 
conduct for cabinet members and senior officials. We also 
appointed an ethics counsellor to help our officials apply these 
rules correctly. We drastically reduced the range of political 
appointments.
<P>
	My colleague, the President of the Privy Council, examined 
the role and operations of 120 agencies, commissions, councils 
and advisory committees. At the end of this exercise, on 
February 16 he announced that 665 positions filled by order in 
council appointments would be abolished. He ordered 73 
agencies to be closed down and 47 others to be restructured.
<P>
	This initiative alone will save the government as much as $10 
million annually. However, it is more than just a matter of 
efficiency and saving money. It is also an indication that the 
government does not intend to use political appointments as a 
way to reward its supporters.
<P>
	We also reformed the pension plan of members of Parliament 
which for too long has been a source of controversy. Last week, 
there was a debate in this House on a bill that will provide a 
framework for the activities of lobbyists, and today, we are 
about to create a committee to develop a code of conduct to 
guide senators and members of the House of Commons.
<P>
	It is this systematic, methodical and orderly approach to 
questions that touch on ethical issues that is now helping to 
restore public confidence in our political institutions.
<P>
	In an impressive speech yesterday to a meeting of Liberal 
militants in Trois-Rivières, our Prime Minister once again 
stressed the importance of integrity and ethical conduct. He 
pointed out that after 18 months in government, no member of 
cabinet had resigned or been dismissed for ethical reasons. 
During a comparable period, the previous government saw at 
least six resignations from cabinet.
<P>
	I am not saying we are perfect. To err is human, and errors of 
judgment do occur, but by acting prudently, according to 
clearcut rules, we will, both individually and collectively, 
manage to restore the trust of our fellow citizens.
<P>
	The role of parliamentarians is difficult and often complex. 
Society expects all individuals to be as free as possible to 
manage their economic interests. It also expects that those in 
public office will not, in the exercise of their duties, be involved 
in matters in which they have personal financial interests. Some 
feel that Parliament should enact stiffer laws, others fear that 
stricter rules will discourage competent individuals from 
becoming involved in public affairs.
<P>
	We are looking for a balance. We want rules strict enough to 
prevent practices contravening the code of ethics and to 
maintain the reputation of Parliament and parliamentarians 
among the public. However, we do not want rules that 
discourage competent individuals from entering public life and 
serving their fellow citizens. We must strike a balance that 
allows us to attract the people who are best prepared and most 
able to lead the country and have them governed by a set of rules 
that will keep them above all suspicion.
<P>
	Conflicts of interest are not new. They have always existed. 
What has changed are people's and taxpayers' attitudes and 
levels of tolerance.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	We have a practical and precise code of ethics governing 
members of Cabinet and their staff, parliamentary secretaries 
and senior public servants. We have nothing, however, for 
members of Parliament and senators. Traditionally, the public 
has felt they had little importance, individually, in the decision 
making process. I must disagree.
<P>
	Members of Parliament have increasing influence on the 
process. Their role in the various parliamentary committees is 
growing in importance. Their influence in their individual 
caucuses is expanding, and their votes on bills before the House 
is always decisive.
<P>
	On each issue, in each debate, members of Parliament must 
reflect, analyze the effect of their decisions on the lives of their 
constituents and decide on their individual approaches. They are 
entirely free to defend their viewpoint in the legislative process. 
They may propose changes and amendments, they may 
influence their colleagues' thinking. This process of analysis 
and choice is repeated hundreds of times during the mandate of a 
member of Parliament. This is why we have a Parliament and 
this is why members are elected.
<P>
	However, throughout our term of office, we remain full 
fledged citizens. We are all taxpayers and consumers. Most of us 
are parents and many own property. In this regard, we are very 
much like Canadians as a whole. We may therefore assume that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12004"> 12004 </A></B>
<P>
these essentially undistinguishing characteristics have very 
little influence  on our behaviour as legislators. Some criteria 
are more regional or specific in nature.
<P>
	Some parliamentarians share the concerns of their 
constituents, in areas such as agriculture, fisheries or natural 
resources for example. Family businesses raise some problems 
because they encompass a whole range of assets, profits or debts 
and financial interests. It is usually interests such as these which 
are covered by conflict of interest legislation.
<P>
	Maybe we should first of all agree on what constitutes a 
conflict of interest. There are several definitions. Mr. Justice 
Parker defined the real conflict of interest as a situation where a 
minister-or a member of Parliament or a senator-is aware of 
private financial interests sufficient to exert some influence on 
the performance of his other official duties and responsibilities.
<P>
	Therefore, rules must be defined in order to prevent the 
financial interests of parliamentarians from exerting an 
influence on the decisions they make while exercising their 
duties. Several control methods have been tested over the years. 
Some have proven to be efficient. The first one is disclosure, 
that is the disclosure of one's assets to a designated person. This 
information can then be recorded for reference purposes or be 
made public. When their private interests are known, the holders 
of public office are less tempted to act in their own interest.
<P>
	Prevention forces parliamentarians to divest themselves of 
interests or associations which may distort their judgment, 
either by selling the interests to third parties with whom they are 
at arm's length, or by placing them in blind trusts. Finally, 
relinquishing these interests will prevent parliamentarians from 
intervening in matters involving personal gain.
<P>
	Any code of ethics contains a number of such controls. It will 
be up to the special joint committee members to review these 
mechanisms and to decide whether they should apply to MPs 
and senators or whether it would be more desirable to resort to 
some other kind of control. The committee has all the latitude it 
needs to consult experts, and to consult with those to whom the 
code of conduct will apply, in order to come up with a firm, clear 
and realistic code. The committee will have to take into account 
the fact that parliamentarians carry on other activities in parallel 
with their legislative work.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	Members from all parties manage significant budgets, their 
budget as MPs. They must use this money wisely and prudently. 
MPs represent the citizens of their riding. It is an important part 
of their mandate. This requires regular attendance and the 
necessary amount of time. Finally, MPs are often required to 
represent Canada and Parliament abroad.
<P>
	These many facets of an MP's mandate raise a number of 
questions which the committee will probably want to review in 
detail. First, the committee will certainly want to set rules to 
avoid conflicts of interest. It will certainly want to question the 
judiciousness of allowing MPs and senators to pursue other 
professional activities during their mandate. It will also want to 
analyze the conditions surrounding our parliamentarians' public 
or private visits abroad. We want to make sure that these 
activities are entirely compatible with the Parliament's 
objectives of transparency and integrity.
<P>
	The committee will certainly want to review all the rules we 
are subjected to at the present time. They need to be evaluated to 
see if they are sufficiently clear, strict and practical for every 
parliamentarian to be able to abide by them. Finally, the 
committee has been given the specific mandate to study the 
relationship between parliamentarians and lobbyists. I believe 
all members want lobbying activities to be well defined and they 
will be happy to implement the rules established by the 
committee.
<P>
	The committee's task will not be an easy one. Several 
attempts have been made to give Parliament a code of conduct 
and they all failed along the way. This time however, there is a 
political will. This government has said its administration 
would focus on ethics. This time, all members of all political 
parties want to restore confidence in Parliament. We have all 
chosen to serve the public. We want to do it honestly, freely and 
openly. Even though they might be restrictive, the present rules 
of ethics governing many of us are precious tools that help us 
carry out our mandate in a transparent and effective manner.
<P>
	Quite often, we question the pertinence of an action, the 
necessity of an intervention, the timeliness of an initiative. In 
such instances of doubt and questioning, the rules of ethics give 
us the information and support we need to make the right 
decisions.
<P>
	So I ask all members of this House to support and help those 
who must develop that new code of conduct. Their work and 
wisdom will profit not only each and every one of us in 
Parliament, but also Canadians as a whole.
<P>
	I know that the Bloc Quebecois, the official opposition, 
proposed an amendment to exclude the Senate from this 
exercise. I know very well that the position of the Bloc is to 
ignore the Senate, but this is not the problem today. The Senate 
is part of our parliamentary institutions, it completes 
Parliament. If we want to establish a code of conduct which will 
make Quebecers and Canadians look upon their politicians with 
confidence in all their activities, and if we want to proceed 
according to the rules, can we disregard the other place? We 
have a two chamber Parliament and until that is changed I do not 
believe that we can give ourselves a set of rules and leave the 
other place without such rules, if we want to settle this question 
once and for  all. For the last decade or so, I think each 
Parliament has studied this difficult, but important issue.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12005"> 12005 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	As I said earlier, I believe that this time the government and 
the other political parties are willing to adopt a code of conduct. 
Such a code should not be an half-baked affair. It should be 
complete and we should support the motion of the government 
House leader so the Special Joint Committee of the House and 
the Senate can start its work as soon as possible, with a view to 
making recommendations that will provide members and 
senators with a tool which will allow them to represent the 
people of Canada with pride and dignity. That is why we are 
here.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I hope that by the end of the day, or whenever this debate is 
finished, the House can give a clear mandate to the special joint 
committee, supported by all parties, all members of Parliament, 
and the Senate, so that the committee can begin its mandate and 
can come back to both Houses with a full report and 
recommendations once and for all, after so many years.
<P>
	I tried before I prepared my speech to go back as far as I could 
to see how many reports have been made. There are many. I 
know the previous government tried four bills and never 
succeeded.
<P>
	I believe this time the government, the opposition parties, and 
all members of Parliament are clearly interested in solving this 
problem and giving a clear code of ethics. We can succeed. In 
order to succeed we must be united so that we can give a clear 
mandate to the committee. I hope when the question is put we 
are united in creating this special joint committee as soon as 
possible.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
some questions for the hon. member who just spoke. He told us 
that in the red book and throughout the election campaign, the 
Liberals had called for openness and proposed the appointment 
of an independent ethics counsellor directly accountable to the 
Prime Minister. He added that the House was now considering a 
bill which could allow it to have a code of conduct.
<P>
	My question for the hon. member who just spoke is this: 
Would a code of conduct have had precedence over the ethics 
counsellor appointed by the Prime Minister in the matter 
involving, on the one hand, the Prime Minister's son-in-law 
and, on the other hand, the decision made by the CRTC?
<P>
	Would the ethics counsellor have had more power with a code 
of conduct to take the Minister of Canadian Heritage to task 
concerning the letter that he passed on to the CRTC on behalf of 
one applicant? He himself sent a letter to the CRTC.
<P>
	With a code of conduct, would the ethics counsellor allow the 
government, when it calls for tenders, to accept the lowest 
acceptable bid?
<P>
	Also, what would have happened in the case of Pearson 
airport if we had had a code of conduct and an ethics counsellor? 
Would the ethics counsellor, with a code of conduct, have 
prevented the Liberal government from organizing brunches at 
$1,000 a plate which allow the lobbyists, the following day, to 
knock on the doors of Liberal members?
<P>
	I must say also that, compared to the red book, the Liberals are 
now doing the exact opposite of what they were preaching when 
they were in the opposition and the Conservatives formed the 
government.
<P>
	Now that we have an ethics counsellor, with a code of conduct 
what happened, and what is going to happen to the 30 Liberal 
members who stayed in their offices because they opposed the 
Justice minister's firearms bill? And what is going to happen to 
the three Liberal members who voted against their own 
government and who lost their seats on various committees and 
commissions?
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	The main questions are: Where are the openness and the 
credibility of the Liberal government as far as the code of 
conduct is concerned? And, is the code of conduct going to 
prevent the members of the Bloc Quebecois from speaking about 
sovereignty?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will start by using the word 
used by the honourable member, and that is transparency. I 
believe that in all the points he raised and which I will try to deal 
with one by one, there is a question of transparency.
<P>
	Let us take the decision of the CRTC which has been raised 
repeatedly during oral question period, over the past few days. 
The government established a committee which examined this 
issue and asked all the stakeholders to make representations. 
The work of the committee was made public and its decision was 
also made public, so that it could be discussed in the House.
<P>
	Second, as the Prime Minister said, he did not take part in the 
discussions and decision in Cabinet. I raise this issue because it 
affects the members of our families. Does the fact that I have 
been elected to Parliament or received an appointment as 
minister mean that my son cannot pursue his career as an 
accountant?
<P>
	Therefore transparency is important because it allows 
disclosure. The same thing applies to the famous letter sent by 
the Minister of Canadian Heritage to the CRTC. The Prime 
Minister was immediately informed of the problem. He made 
the letter public in this very House, and the whole issue was 
made public.
<P>
	As I said earlier, we are all humans and a code of ethics or an 
ethics counsellor will never solve every problem entirely. The 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12006"> 12006 </A></B>
<P>
important thing, however, is the  will to ensure that things are 
done with transparency and honesty.
<P>
	That is what this government promised to do in its red book 
and this is what it has done since its election on October 23 or 
since the day the government was formed on November 4.
<P>
	The disclosure of information on politicians is very important 
because it will ensure that nothing is kept hidden and that 
transparency becomes a fact. We will thus avoid criticism and 
we will make our decisions in accordance with the rules of 
disclosure and transparency.
<P>
	It is not easy. Our task today is very difficult. We have to make 
decisions and pass judgments. People will watch us and will also 
pass judgments. Therefore we must be logical and transparent in 
our actions.
<P>
	Therefore I can say to the hon. member that I am proud of the 
18 months of Liberal government under Jean Chrétien. 
Furthermore, despite the list mentioned by my colleague, this 
government enjoys the highest rate of popular support recorded 
since polls were begun in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
once again, the government is hiding behind a motion. Does it 
ever like to delay proceedings in the House! A motion to create a 
committee to conduct another study. For more than 20 years, 
almost 25 years, various attempts by successive governments 
have met with repeated failure.
<P>
	Had the government even the slightest political will to find a 
solution to the issue of conflict of interest, it would not have 
been satisfied with a vague motion to create a committee, but 
would have tabled a public bill improving on the ones that failed 
in the House.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	The hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell 
mentioned Bill C-116 earlier, which finally died on the Order 
Paper during the previous 34th Parliament. It would probably 
have been possible to rewrite and refine Bill C-116 with the 
government policy, while taking into account the views of the 
opposition. But no. We are being proposed today a motion to 
create a joint committee made up of eight senators and 14 
members of Parliament.
<P>
	Fortunately, the amendment moved by the hon. member for 
La Prairie proposes that the committee no longer be a joint 
committee, but a House committee made up only of members of 
Parliament. The member for La Prairie even changes the 
membership; there would be 12 members of Parliament: seven 
Liberals, three members from the official opposition and two 
from the second opposition party, which seems fair and 
reasonable at first glance.
<P>
	We do not need a joint committee. This House, which is made 
up of elected people, has its own rules and its own vision of 
things, while the Senate, which is made up of non elected people 
who are in office until the age of 75, also has its own different 
way of seeing things, a way with which we are not always 
comfortable working. Had the government wanted to involve 
both Houses in the development of a code of conduct, the best 
way of doing it would have been to table a bill. Of course, both 
this House and the Senate would have had to pass this bill before 
it could receive Royal Assent.
<P>
	Instead, the government decided to create a working 
committee, another one. If we are to create such a committee, we 
should at least let the elected members study, by themselves, 
what constitutes a conflict of interest in their case. After all, 
after a maximum of five years, these people must go back to 
their constituents. They are accountable for their actions; they 
must explain why they took such and such political decisions. 
We should have this right, since our colleagues in the Senate do 
not have this sensitive test to pass. All they need is the Governor 
General's signature to be in office until the respectable age of 
75.
<P>
	Perhaps it could be interesting to get the other place's point of 
view, but certainly not in a joint committee. Moreover, such a 
committee would probably resurrect five Conservative senators 
whose party was literally eliminated by the Canadians in the 
October 1993 election and does not have official party status 
anymore in this House. It would be a way to give back a voice to 
people that want to be heard, these days. Last week-end, they 
stated their case in Hull, and with this motion, they would do so 
in a joint committee made up of members of Parliament and 
senators.
<P>
	If nothing but to respect the will of the people, we should 
reject the creation of a joint committee. The referendum on the 
Charlottetown accord showed that the people rejected the Senate 
reforms, particularly in Quebec. The idea of a triple E Senate, 
that is equal, elected and efficient, was certainly not endorsed. 
The proposal was for six senators per province, regardless of the 
size of the province, and it was rejected.
<P>
	Now, the government party wants an elected Senate, while the 
Reform Party wants a triple E Senate, which means that there is 
disagreement on the number of Es. For our part, we want a triple 
A Senate, that is to say abolished, abolished and abolished. No 
other institution in the world is denounced by as many people as 
is this other place we have in the Canadian Parliament. There is 
no reason for a non-elected house to continue to exist in 1995. 
Perhaps there was a need for it in 1867, but before 1867, the two 
Houses we had in the Province of Canada were elected. The 
legislative assembly of the Province of Canada was an elected 
assembly. Starting in 1854, the legislative council, which had 
been an appointed institution since 1840, became an elected one. 
This means that until 1867, we had two elected Houses. What  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12007"> 12007 </A></B>
<P>
happened in 1867 that caused this split, with one house, the 
House of Commons, being elected, and the other, the Senate of 
Canada, not?
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	The preamble of the British North America Act, or BNA Act, 
1867, can shed some light on this. In 1867, it was stated in this 
preamble that the Dominion of Canada wanted to have 
institutions similar to those of the United Kingdom. What were 
these institutions in 1867, and what are they still today? The 
House of Commons, like in Canada, and the House of Lords, 
made up of peers. Because we did not and still do not have an 
aristocracy in Canada, we invented our own lords, whom were 
called senators. Originally, they were appointed for life. But in 
1965, the Canadian Constitution was amended so that a 
senator's tenure of office ends at age 75, while grandfathering 
the rights of those who were already sitting in the Senate at the 
time but had not yet reached the age of 75.
<P>
	Since then, as we can see clearly, the role of the other House 
has become less important. The Senate now sits some 40 days a 
year and cannot introduce money bills under section 53 of the 
1867 British North America Act. The house of sober second 
thought likes to drag things out, as demonstrated by the electoral 
boundaries readjustment bill, the GST legislation introduced by 
the previous government and other bills that may be filibustered 
by the other house in the future. Given the cost to Canadian 
society, I think that we could do without it.
<P>
	If we asked Canadians, ``Do you agree that the Senate should 
be abolished?'', a very high percentage of them would say yes. 
The problem is, what should we replace it with and how should it 
be done? Responses vary. There is no consensus on replacement.
<P>
	I, of course, am eager to support the amendment tabled by the 
hon. member for La Prairie to restrict committee membership to 
members of the House of Commons. If the Senate wants to strike 
its own committee, it will do so.
<P>
	The hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell said a 
little earlier this afternoon that our institutions, including 
Parliament, were based on the Westminster model, while the 
hon. member for Saint-Léonard made some comments to that 
effect.
<P>
	I heard earlier today our colleague, the hon. member for Elk 
Island, point out that we ranked 36th in the public's esteem, just 
before used car salesmen. It is probably because we have to 
defend a used system that should be refurbished, a system that, 
in the past 50 years, has seen a virtual takeover of the legislative 
power by the executive power. That was not the case previously, 
as we can see by looking at history. When our parliamentary 
ancestors fought to abolish or appropriate royal powers, they 
insisted that these powers should be held by the House of 
Commons.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	Over time, royal powers shifted from the palace not to the 
House of Commons but to the Prime Minister's Office. It is there 
that important decisions are made.
<P>
	In our constitutional system, which consists of three powers: 
the legislative, the judiciary and the executive, the legislative 
branch is, for all practical purposes, under the control of the 
executive, which in turn is under the control of the Prime 
Minister's Office.
<P>
	We have the advantage, and sometimes the disadvantage, of 
having a neighbour that has inspired us to reform. Our American 
neighbours have inspired us to carry out some institutional 
reforms that may not be in our best interests. In a system in 
which the executive is elected and accountable to the population 
and not to the American Congress, a system in which members 
of the House of Representatives and the Senate are elected and 
not accountable to the executive, the situation is quite different.
<P>
	In the U.S., what did the political parties decide to do? They 
decided to choose their party leaders, their candidates for the 
presidential election, at an all-members convention. We 
adopted this idea in Canada, so that some of our party leaders are 
elected by delegates at a general convention while others are 
elected by all party members.
<P>
	In principle, this is great, but when we want to apply this to 
our parliamentary institutions, we face a big problem. The 
problem is that, when the party leader is also the Prime Minister, 
the party leader has practically unlimited power. First, to his 
cabinet colleagues, he can say: ``Look, if you are here, it is 
because I appointed you''. To his caucus, he can say: ``I do not 
feel very accountable to you. After all, you are not the ones who 
elected me party leader. I am accountable to the party members 
who elected me''. The problem is that supporters have no 
control over what the government party does.
<P>
	You will see self-congratulatory conventions like the one 
held in Trois-Rivières, of course, but no real debate on party 
policies. The intent of the Constitution Act, 1867, was to have 
institutions similar to those of the United Kingdom. In Great 
Britain, the Prime Minister is elected by his or her peers. This 
means that the party leader is elected from within the caucus, 
<I>primus inter pares</I>, as the Latin saying goes. This was a much 
more subtle way of governing and a much more equitable one, 
since the Prime Minister was accountable first and 
foremost-and in Great Britain this is still the case-to his 
colleagues or peers.
<P>
	The role of member of Parliament is all the more important, 
since members can ask and expect to obtain from their leader the 
answers they need to continue to support that leader. The Prime 
Minister's seat is probably more precarious, more of a hot seat 
in the British system than in ours, where one can wash one's 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12008"> 12008 </A></B>
<P>
hands by telling the caucus: ``You did not elect me''. In fact, 
under our  election law, the Prime Minister can even designate 
candidates himself, over-ruling the electoral conventions in the 
various ridings.
<P>
	Imagine all the power in the hands of just one person. That 
person appoints cabinet members, ultimately decides who gets 
the top jobs in the public service, decides who is appointed to the 
bench, as well as who can run under the party's banner. That is a 
lot of power in the hands of just one person.
<P>
	The time has come for a major review. I am not sure if the hon. 
member for Saint-Léonard was being ironic earlier when he 
referred to the important role of parliamentarians. Let us not 
forget that never before was Parliament controlled to such an 
extent by the executive level.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	When we voted on Bill C-68, three Liberal members opposed 
the legislation, thus breaking ranks with their government 
colleagues. All three lost the positions which they held in 
parliamentary committees. And the member for Saint-Léonard 
has the nerve to tell us that we must respect the parliamentary 
institution. Was that institution respected then? We have to 
wonder.
<P>
	True control is not exercised by MPs. If the government wants 
to give some control to members, it must first get rid of the 
executive level in this House. We do not need it here; let it go to 
Rideau Hall or on Sussex Drive, if there is room. It is quite 
possible to change the system so that a member's ultimate goal, 
his or her greatest ambition, will be to be the best possible 
member. There should be no incentive to eventually become a 
parliamentary secretary or a minister. Members in this House 
should have no ambition other than to be able to say: I was the 
best possible member for my riding. The prospect of future 
promotions should not be a factor.
<P>
	Those who want to serve at the executive level can certainly 
do so. However, let us be careful not to mix the two levels, 
particularly in this House. We all know the perverse effects of 
this confusion between the legislative and the executive levels. 
It is high time we distanced ourselves and shifted more toward a 
congressional type of decision, adapting it, of course, to our way 
of thinking, to our practices and to our traditions by regulating 
the activities of lobbyists, the influence peddlars, in order to 
control them.
<P>
	The real issue is not members' powers or conflict of interest. 
We already have Standing Order 21, which provides the 
following, and, with your permission, I will quote it:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>No member is entitled to vote upon any question in which he or she has a 
direct pecuniary interest, and the vote of any Member so interested will be 
disallowed.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The criterion is there; it is basic. When problems arise, we 
have the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, 
previously the committee on privileges and elections, which is 
empowered to hear all matters that may arise pertaining to a 
member's status or conflict of interest.
<P>
	The committee has only to exercise its powers. Nothing is 
stopping it. If problems are brought to the attention of 
colleagues in the House, they may be raised, and the Speaker 
may determine prima facie that there is justification for their 
referral to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs.
<P>
	The mechanisms are already in place. Why create more? It 
would probably be enough to have something more flexible at 
the level of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs so we could have our committee on the rules of ethics in 
order to improve our operations. It would be much wiser and 
better advised to control the goings-on in the Prime Minister's 
office.
<P>
	The government is currently behaving like Nero. Legend has 
it that Nero played his fiddle while Rome burned down. 
Similarly, while the government fails to follow its own policies 
on ethical conduct, while the Prime Minister himself tells us that 
he did not consult his ethics counsellor before taking certain 
decisions, we are being told that parliamentarians must be 
watched.
<P>
	But let us avoid diversion. Diversion may be a very useful 
tactic in a hockey game during the last few minutes of third 
period, in order to stop the opponent from scoring a goal. In 
politics though, diversion tactics should not be overused. I think 
that we have gone a little too far. Recent cases like that of 
DirecTv show that mere parliamentarians are not the ones 
intervening to change decisions. Obviously, people from outside 
the House are making direct representations to either the Prime 
Minister's office or to the Minister of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	Let us start by really enforcing a code of conduct throughout 
government, at the ministerial and the executive level. Then it 
will undoubtedly be time to examine the ethics of the members 
of this House, the legislative branch of our constitution.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
very attentively to the comments of the hon. member for 
Bellechasse.
<P>
	I have some difficulty with the reluctance of his party to 
include the upper house in the debate. It concerns me because I 
think it concerns the people of Canada. There is a lot of 
reflection on what is happening in the Senate and if taxpayers' 
money is being properly spent.
<P>
	One of the areas of expenditure is the Senate, the senators and 
their staffs. I have some misgivings about the Senate. It appears 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12009"> 12009 </A></B>
<P>
to me that at the present time we are not going to be able to deal 
with reconstituting that place. However, this provides us with an 
opportunity to  revisit possibly the attendance of senators and 
how they are carrying out their affairs.
<P>
	The proposal the government presented today provides us 
with an avenue to revisit that. Could the member reflect on the 
fact that there may be a high degree of merit in including the 
senators in this legislation?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Langlois:</B> Mr. Speaker, in responding to the hon. member 
for Durham, I would like to remind him of what I said earlier. If 
the government had wanted the senators to be involved, it would 
have tabled a bill that would necessarily have been considered in 
this House and then have gone to the Senate. That was the best 
way to involve both Houses.
<P>
	When the government does not want a bill but simply wants to 
create one more task force, one too many, my position is: Let us 
create a committee of members of this House, a committee of 
elected representatives. We should not mix elected 
representatives with those who are not elected, people who have 
to go before the electorate every four or five years with those 
who never have to run on their record. In a democracy, Mr. 
Speaker, and I say this through you to the hon. member for 
Durham, in the kind of system we have, a non-elected House 
where no one is accountable to anyone except to the provisions 
of the Criminal Code is an anomaly. And that was my message 
just now.
<P>
	I realize the hon. member for Durham put a question mark 
after his comment. He said: Perhaps I did not quite understand? 
Perhaps I did not get it? I hope that, with this additional 
information, he will understand that we should not mix elected 
representatives with non-elected individuals. I am not saying 
that the Senate should not examine these issues if it wants to. 
However, the Senate has its own rules, its own board of internal 
economy which operates differently from ours. Although it does 
have a budget to administer, it has different rules. We, through 
our own Board of Internal Economy, set much stricter rules than 
the Senate does through its board.
<P>
	My point is, we are constantly putting our seat on the line. 
Every day, we are accountable to our constituents for what we 
do. Mixing ingredients that are not terribly compatible to start 
with, what with Liberal members, members of the Bloc and the 
Reform Party, and adding a dash of Tory senators to boot, is not 
really a recipe for success.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the question to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment is as follows: the hon. 
member for Mercier-job creation.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is with pleasure that I rise today to speak to Motion No. 23, that a 
parliamentary committee draft a code of conduct for MPs and 
lobbyists, and also support the Bloc amendment.
<P>
<B>(1650 ) </B>
<P>
	The intention of the motion to reconcile official responsibility 
with personal interests, including all dealings with lobbyists, is 
the responsibility of parliamentarians only. Senators, as 
appointed officials and not elected, should develop their own 
code of conduct, giving consideration to their current activities 
with lobbyists.
<P>
	It is about time. The government ran on a platform that said: 
``The most important asset of government is the confidence it 
enjoys of the citizens to whom it is accountable. If government 
is to play a positive role in society as it must, honesty and 
integrity in our political institutions must be restored''. That is 
right out of the Liberal red book.
<P>
	The record shows that the activities of the government's 
ministers and departments subsequent to the election of 1993 
have been inconsistent, indecisive and confused, resulting in 
serious flip-flops in terms of outcome. For a culture to endure 
and prosper it must safeguard its principles and procedures. 
Ethics in action will cause that to occur.
<P>
	I want to focus in particular on the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage and his record of conduct beginning in March 1994. I 
do this because it tracks a saga of questionable judgment and 
inappropriate interference involving four separate incidents. 
Ethical guidelines provided to him quite likely would have 
offset the many concerns that have arisen over the grave errors 
in judgment that have occurred. However, before I do that, 
consider the following as a frame on which to build an ethical 
structure.
<P>
	Public office holders must act with honesty and uphold the 
highest ethical standards so that public confidence and trust in 
the integrity, objectivity and impartiality of government are 
conserved and enhanced. As well, anyone holding public office 
should not step out of their official roles to assist private entities 
or persons in their dealings with the government where this 
would result in preferential treatment to any person.
<P>
	The issue here is not whether ethical guidelines should 
become a requirement or wondering if elected federal officials 
even have a choice any longer in this matter because Canadians 
expect honesty, integrity and accountability from their 
politicians.
<P>
	Clearly the issue is a search for broad, lasting, moral 
guidelines gleaned from the complex real life ethical situations 
in politics that are at once imaginative, meaningful and 
legislatively sound.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12010"> 12010 </A></B>
<P>
	Anyone who would be ethical has the problem of knowing 
what his or her standards are. People tend to think of themselves 
as moral. That they tend to overrate their ethical competence 
becomes apparent when they find themselves doing the same 
thing of which they disapprove. Often a substantial gap 
separates the ethical norms people verbalize and those they use 
in making their decisions, which tells us more about how ethical 
a person is.
<P>
	Verbalization or action? This is a question that Canadians 
should be asking every time the government makes a decision. 
Even the Prime Minister has said this is the case, in particular, of 
ministers who must remain above reproach at all times and in all 
of their activities, whether it be as ministers, members of 
Parliament or private citizens. That is the burden of public 
office and one that we all gladly accept.
<P>
	I turn my focus to the questionable actions undertaken by the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage, once again to exemplify this 
issue of guidelines and standards of ethical behaviour. As I 
mentioned, four incidents haunt the minister, questioning not 
only his integrity but also that of the government.
<P>
	In March 1994 the sale of Ginn Publishing Inc. to American 
interests evoked outrage on this side of the House. That 
transaction was the litmus test of the government's commitment 
to parliamentary reform and to open parliamentary process. The 
sale should have been investigated but was not. A review should 
have been undertaken by a parliamentary standing committee 
but was not. No ethical guidelines were in place at the time to 
resolve this.
<P>
<B>(1655 ) </B>
<P>
	I sent a letter to the Prime Minister asking five questions. That 
letter with those five questions was never acknowledged. I 
conclude from this that either no one knew how to answer my 
questions, or if known, there was no desire for full disclosure.
<P>
	Whatever the case, the only way to get clear answers was for a 
public investigation because we had no ethical guidelines. Such 
an investigation would have answered the preceding questions 
and the five I put to the Prime Minister. I want to repeat these 
again, because they are important in a discussion of clearly 
established ethical guidelines.
<P>
	First, how can the government explain the contradictions 
evident in the sale with the red book policy on the protection of 
Canadian art and culture? This is a simple question but there was 
no response.
<P>
	Second, how does the government explain the offers to 
purchase Ginn by several members of the Canadian business 
community during the period from 1989 to 1994?
<P>
	Third, what happens to the Canadian publishing industry after 
February 15, 1999 when Paramount's investment agreement 
ceases? These are important questions concerning the 
guidelines we are going to establish hopefully with this 
parliamentary standing committee.
<P>
	Fourth, why was a specific job loss figure not included in the 
press release of February 18, 1994? That is also important, given 
the considerations that will be coming later. Canadians are still 
asking questions relating to the Ginn affair because none of this 
was put to rest.
<P>
	Fifth, how can the government ignore the provisions of the 
Investment Canada Act and undertake a private agreement 
which precludes the sale of a Canadian firm to a foreign 
company except in extraordinary circumstances?
<P>
	Over the last couple of weeks we have seen the Investment 
Canada Act creep up into our problems in the House of 
Commons. There is no delineation with respect to clearly 
defined ethical guidelines. How are we going to deal with these 
matters?
<P>
	Reform supported the notion of an investigation to allow for 
freer competition in the Canadian cultural marketplace. The 
issue was not about protecting Canadian culture from within or 
from being co-opted by foreign cultural influences from 
without. It was ethics of procedure, allowing the market to run 
its due course without needless and harmful protection or undue 
government regulation. The government should have asked 
them whether it was the rhetoric or the action that would be 
remembered.
<P>
	The ensuing debate should have clarified the minister's 
involvement but did not. Rather the government invoked closure 
and thus began to grow a blight on the minister's judgment. 
What was the ethical criteria on which he made his decisions?
<P>
	In October 1994 the matter of undue influence from the 
minister arose over his intervention in a CRTC licence 
application. Even the Prime Minister at that time admitted his 
error not only in action but also judgment. This is another 
example where had ethical guidelines been in place they would 
have saved us a lot of unnecessary grief.
<P>
	His actions compromise the integrity of government as well 
as the CRTC decision making process. As a quasi-judicial body, 
the CRTC's role remains quite independent of government. The 
Prime Minister said on October 31, 1994: ``When a 
representation is sent to the CRTC, it is a public document''.
<P>
	From September 1993 to October 1994 the CRTC held 18 
public hearings. It received 15,422 letters in support of licence 
applicants. Seventy-two were from members of Parliament, 
from all parties in the House. Representations were made by 
many Liberal members, including ministers, members of the 
Bloc Quebecois, the Reform Party, the NDP, the Conservatives 
and one independent. I raise that as an issue because nobody had  
any guidelines. Of the 15,422 letters that were in support of 
licence applicants there were no guidelines with which to deal 
with the matter.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12011"> 12011 </A></B>
<P>
	The Prime Minister went on to say: ``Clearly we are not 
confronted with anything like calling a judge. What we are 
dealing with is the dilemma of ministers who also must fulfil 
their duties as members of Parliament who were elected to 
represent their constituents. That makes this whole area of 
relationships with administrative tribunals much more complex 
than with the courts''. The Prime Minister also said: ``I have 
learned a lesson too. This government has done a lot to give 
our ministers clear guidelines to do their jobs and avoid conflict 
of interest, including the historical ethics package we 
introduced in June. It is now plain to me that the guidelines for 
dealing with administrative tribunals were not clear or 
complete enough''.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	Even back then the Prime Minister recognized the need for 
ethical guidelines. This was in response to the questionable 
actions of the Minister of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	Although we have an ethics counsellor to assist the Prime 
Minister in ethical matters, there has been little to suggest 
guidelines of any consequence are providing complete direction 
to the Minister of Canadian Heritage or any of the cabinet for 
that matter.
<P>
	The Minister of Canadian Heritage obviously and flagrantly 
breached judicial principles in this instance. The blight on the 
minister's ethical record continued to grow. Again, what was the 
ethical criteria on which he made his decision?
<P>
	The third fiasco involving the minister saw the resignation of 
the president of the CBC. No longer able to accept the lack of 
full disclosure regarding the CBC's future, Tony Manera left his 
post. A secret meeting between CBC and the heritage ministry, 
denied many times by the minister, revealed financial 
information which had not appeared in the government's just 
released budget or in the estimates. The minister's waspish 
reply to questions in the House became mired in personal cheap 
shots and innuendo.
<P>
	In question period on March 1, 1995 I said: ``The minister had 
a secret agenda about the future of the CBC which he had failed 
to disclose. Why has the minister failed to provide this 
information to Canadians?'' In his response he said: ``Mr. 
Speaker, our colleague is out of luck. Her assistant is no better as 
a researcher than he was as a candidate in Ottawa-Vanier''.
<P>
	Clearly initiated by the pressure he felt, he resorted to tactics 
counter to the red book promise of openness and fair play in 
order for Canadians to regain their trust in the parliamentary 
system and in their politicians. Cheap shots, no ethical 
guidelines to provide assistance to the minister. The blight now 
was of odious proportions.
<P>
	We now come to the minister's current disasters: the 
challenge mounted by cabinet to overturn the CRTC's decision 
to give a licensing exemption to open up satellite distribution in 
Canada using a Canadian satellite system; and the perception of 
undue influence and interference regarding the approval of 
Investment Canada for the purpose of MCA by the Bronfmans, 
who own Seagram.
<P>
	Lunching with the players in Los Angeles represents yet 
another grave error in judgment by the minister. There is no one 
who can tell me an invitation to the executive suites of MCA is 
not as a result of considerable effort, not just a little R and R for 
the minister at spring break as has been suggested.
<P>
	Of an even more critical nature is government interference 
under the guise of competition playing business favouritism. As 
the cabinet sat around the table making a decision that favoured 
Power Corp. no one seemed conscious of the confrontation that 
would develop with the direct to home Canadian consortium of 
Expressvu Inc. which also just happens to have a close 
relationship with the CRTC.
<P>
	What I am trying to point out here is the absolute imperative 
need for ethical guidelines for all of us in the House in order to 
operate professionally, ethically and morally as representatives 
of the Canadian people.
<P>
	Both the reputation and credibility of the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage are in shreds. It is remarkable that the 
rhetoric of the Liberal red book has become meaningless and 
trite babble.
<P>
	The people of Canada demonstrated their irritation with 
politicians in government in the last election. They threw out 
those who did not consult them, who disregarded their views and 
who tried to conduct key parts of public business behind closed 
doors.
<P>
	Let us ensure the deliberations of this standing committee 
include ordinary Canadians in the process. We need to create a 
truly representative government in which the wisdom of the 
people is respected and protected. No one would be well served 
if the constituents we serve are not included. We all risk a 
further loss of public regard.
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	Ethical standards emerge from the value we place on 
ourselves. If the government begins to proactively organize and 
execute around our priorities, politicians will become known for 
making and keeping meaningful promises and commitments. 
Canadians are waiting for that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Kingston and the Islands, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a question for the hon. member. In her speech 
she indicated she was supporting the Bloc amendment which 
would delete any reference to the Senate in the motion. She 
appears to treat senators as non-parliamentarians by saying only 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12012"> 12012 </A></B>
<P>
elected members of Parliament are entitled to participate in this 
process and only they should be subject to guidelines.
<P>
	Is she suggesting the members of the other place ought to have 
no guidelines if the House of Commons adopts guidelines? 
Therefore does she feel it is fair that members of the House 
should be subject to certain guidelines where members of the 
other place are free to carry on businesses, trades or do whatever 
they wish? Is that the position of her party?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe I 
qualified that in the first sentences of my presentation when I 
expressed that senators are appointed officials. They are not 
elected and as a result should develop their own code of conduct.
<P>
	We ran on the platform that we wanted to see incredible 
change to the Senate. We believe in a Senate that is equal, 
effective but elected. It is on the position of being elected that 
the senators as appointed officials need to develop their own 
guidelines because they involve their activities in a different 
way with lobbyists compared with parliamentarians. At least 
one would hope with the result of these new guidelines that will 
happen.
<P>
	That is a question almost irrelevant when we are looking at 
comparisons between parliamentarians who are elected by the 
people of Canada and senatorial positions, most of which are 
patronage appointments with very strong links to the 
government of the day.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member in her remarks 
indicated there were no guidelines in place. Is she aware that 
there is a set of conflict of interest guidelines that apply to 
ministers of the crown and to parliamentary secretaries in the 
House? Has she seen the document? If not, I would be pleased to 
send her a copy.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would be 
delighted to receive the document, but to date the actions of the 
government show it also has not read the document.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
very intently to the member for Calgary Southeast.
<P>
	I thought her party, which seems to be so interested in 
government financing and the cost of government, would want 
to have the opportunity to focus on the area of how individual 
senators perform and whether Canadians are getting value for 
their money. I am mystified by that stand.
<P>
	The member went on to discuss ethics and so forth. A great 
halo comes from that side of the room. I wonder if she could say 
how ethical it was to be discussing Motion No. 24 which deals 
with a very specific aspect of ethics and conduct for members of 
Parliament and senators while using the time almost entirely to 
develop a political speech to chastise the government? In my 
mind she has not added anything very positive to the debate.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, with all due 
respect to the hon. member, I do not believe he heard me very 
well if he did not think I had anything very positive to add to the 
debate. I was trying to establish a basis on which ethical criteria 
are established.
<P>
	There are four things I believe that go through the mind of an 
individual when they are looking at an issue of an ethical nature. 
When people come to a make a decision on a problem they know 
what people say they should do to resolve the issue. They know 
there are people who do things as they say they will. Actually 
when it comes right down to it, the actions of people sometimes 
are not really what they said they would do. Oftentimes people 
would like to take an action but do not or cannot for whatever 
reason. Those were the elements which I tried to bring to the 
speech.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	As far as the issue of the Senate, I have stated already the 
Senate is a house of patronage. It is a house that deals quite 
specifically with lobbyists in a different way from the House of 
Commons. Senators are not elected officials and therefore I 
believe should stand on their own merit and develop their own 
code of conduct. They are all big boys and girls over there and 
they should be able to take due consideration with respect to 
their own activities without our telling them what they should 
do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to speak to this motion. I 
congratulate the government for initiating action with regard to 
a code of conduct for parliamentarians. If history teaches us 
anything it is that the House needs to be aware of the need for a 
code of conduct. It needs to be aware that Canadians expect 
ethical behaviour from us. My hope is a code will be developed 
and that it will be effective. I hope it will have some real teeth, 
not like the ethics counsellor who we saw the Prime Minister 
appoint, and not some watered down list of suggestions which 
will have as its only purpose a public relations exercise of 
so-called government action on ethics.
<P>
	I am concerned because of the government's failure to carry 
through on any of its red book promises for a more open and 
ethical government. While the concept of a code of conduct to 
guide members in their dealings with lobbyists is a good idea, I 
have some serious doubts as to the government's willingness to 
follow through with effective guidelines.
<P>
	Let us take, for example, the position of the ethics counsellor. 
Rather than having an independent counsellor accountable to 
Parliament, as the red book said, the Prime Minister has decided 
to keep the issue of ethics in house, behind closed doors. By only 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12013"> 12013 </A></B>
<P>
reporting to the Prime Minister the ethics counsellor has lost the 
appearance of independence and objectivity. This restriction 
was underscored during the debacle over the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage's interference with the CRTC.
<P>
	There are precendents for positions such as the ethics 
counsellor to be officers of the House of Commons. The human 
rights commissioner, the chief electoral officer, the auditor 
general and the privacy commissioner are all answerable to the 
House, not to the government. They are not answerable to 
cabinet or to the Prime Minister; they are answerable to the 
House. That is important.
<P>
	In each case it is clear an arm's length relationship with the 
government is required for those officers to objectively and 
adequately discharge their responsibilities. The same is true for 
the ethics counsellor and for any type of code of conduct for 
parliamentarians.
<P>
	My concern is that the government wanted to give the 
impression of ethics without actually changing anything. That is 
the only reason I can see for not making the ethics counsellor an 
officer of Parliament. It is a very select group. It is not as though 
there is no room for change any more. Being an independent 
officer of the House would allow the ethics counsellor to 
promote the ethical conduct of members of the House instead of 
its current position of being a political lap-dog of the Prime 
Minister.
<P>
	Despite all the rhetoric about open government and more 
independence for backbenchers the government has continued 
the tradition of secrecy and whipping members into line. I have 
seen many government members speak in favour of some of the 
ideas expressed on this side of the House only to withdraw and 
toe the party line when their voice really counted, when they 
stood up in the House to vote, when they voted in committee or 
when they had to sign on to committee reports. That is not active 
and quality democracy and that is not representative democracy.
<P>
	Our debates in the Chamber on gun control are a good 
example of how the government really feels about open 
government. When some of its members chose out of good 
conscience to represent their constituents rather than do the 
bidding of the party hierarchy they were reprimanded. Imagine 
that. They were reprimanded for daring to do the bidding of the 
constituents who sent us here, who pay the bills, who pay our 
salaries and who even pay for our pensions.
<P>
<B>(1715 ) </B>
<P>
	These are the reasons I am concerned that this code of conduct 
must be carefully and properly crafted. This government does 
not have a good track record of being proactive on ethical 
matters. If we can draft a good code of conduct, it may add some 
much needed legitimacy to the ethics counsellor.
<P>
	The importance of having this kind of code of conduct cannot 
be overemphasized. This government obviously needs some 
guidelines when it comes to ethical dealings with lobbyists. The 
whole Pearson scandal is the best example of closed door 
unethical activity. This deal was started by the previous Tory 
government and the closed door antics have been continued by 
this government.
<P>
	There is the whole issue of José Perez and his dealings with 
Senator De Bané and Canada Post. As well, the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage has had questionable dealings with the CRTC 
in the past and is under a cloud of suspicion once again.
<P>
	The need for this kind of a code of conduct is self-evident. I 
only hope the Liberals have the political courage to put aside 
their self-interests and the interests of their well-connected 
friends and family members to draft an effective and complete 
code.
<P>
	While having a committee draft this code is an improvement 
over the usual closed door cabinet process, I have some concerns 
about the make-up of the committee. I do not believe that 
senators should be included on a House of Commons committee. 
Let me take a few minutes to tell this House why I have some 
concerns.
<P>
	Having senators involved with drafting a code of conduct 
dealing with issues like conflict of interest is a bit like having 
the inmates running the asylum. It is a bit like putting violent 
offenders on the parole board. It just does not make sense. I do 
not understand why this Liberal government would promote 
such a ridiculous idea.
<P>
	I will not make these suggestions without backing them up 
with facts. Not very many years ago, a Prime Minister by the 
name of Mulroney stacked the Senate with eight senators. Why 
did he do that? To put through the GST.
<P>
	What would happen if some of those senators who agreed to 
accept those extra positions above the 104 senators ended up on 
this ethics committee? I am a bit concerned about that. What if 
the Hon. Eric Berntson from Saskatchewan, one of the stacked 
senators, ended up on this ethics committee? He was the one 
who said: ``I will never accept a government appointment. I 
refuse any government appointments''. A week or two later 
when Brian Mulroney asked if he would take a Senate seat to 
help him get the GST through, he said: ``Yes, I would love to sit 
in the Senate. The rest of my life will be cushy. I will do that for 
you''. The Liberal government defends that type of action and I 
am shocked.
<P>
	There was another member in that group of select senators. 
They had to put stacking chairs in the Senate to accommodate 
these extra senators. His name was the Hon. John Buchanan. He 
was considered to be the most efficient bagmen in all of Atlantic 
Canada. Is this the type of person we want to allow to sit on a 
committee to discuss a code of conduct and to consider conflict 
of  interest? I am shocked that the Liberals would suggest and 
promote such an idea.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12014"> 12014 </A></B>
<P>
	There are a couple of other people who sit over in the other 
place: the Hon. Guy Charbonneau and the Hon. Michel Cogger. 
Their names were in the news for a long time. I remember 
reading about them in almost every chapter of Stevie 
Cameron's book <I>On the Take</I>.
<P>
	Are these the kinds of people the hon. member for Kingston 
and the Islands wants to see sitting on a committee to draft a 
code of conduct for parliamentarians? Perhaps they may be the 
result of an investigation rather than the ones who are drafting 
the code. The Liberals are putting forward a motion in this 
House which would allow them to sit on this committee. I am 
shocked. I would ask the Liberals to withdraw the motion, come 
to their senses and realize what they are doing.
<P>
	There is another potential candidate for this committee. Her 
name is Marjory LeBreton. She was the director of Tory 
patronage, the one who decided which Tories got put in which 
position of patronage. She probably even had a hand in 
determining who Brian Mulroney would place in the Senate. 
Perhaps she had a hand in choosing the six senators to sit on 
those six stacking stools that the Minister of Transport has 
correctly identified. Would the Minister of Transport agree to 
have Marjory LeBreton sitting on a code of conduct committee? 
This motion would allow that to happen. I am shocked.
<P>
	There is another one over there, Pierre Claude Nolin. He was 
Brian Mulroney's crony in Quebec, his principal adviser in the 
province of Quebec. He accepted his appointment right at the 
tail end of the Mulroney era, when the whole country was angry 
at Brian Mulroney and his government and the people wanted to 
kick them out.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Who was that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> The Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin was 
appointed. I think it was in June 1993 that he accepted his 
appointment.
<P>
	Do we want somebody, a friend of a government Canadians 
considered to be villainous to be sitting on the committee for the 
code of conduct, to be determining the code of ethics we should 
be living by? I am shocked. I can hardly believe it.
<P>
	There is someone else who might happen to be involved in the 
committee and who happens to be a Liberal, the Hon. Allan J. 
MacEachen. He is considered to be the godfather of the Liberals 
in Atlantic Canada. He has a reputation that one member on the 
front bench is trying to emulate.
<P>
	There is an article in <I>Maclean's</I> which says: ``Then comes the 
minister of public works, a show stopper. The incantatory, 
drawn out delivery of Allan J. MacEachen, the long time federal 
Liberal minister from Cape Breton  who now sits in the Senate. 
``Close your eyes'', says one of the acquaintances of both men, 
``and you will swear Allan J. is right there in the room''. There is 
only one Allan J, the minister explains with an annoying 
chuckle.
<P>
	Then it goes on to talk about how Hon. Allan J. MacEachen 
was a godfather in Atlantic Canada and certainly someone 
involved in patronage. Certainly, he is someone that we would 
not want on a committee to discuss and draft a code of ethics for 
parliamentarians, but this is what the Liberals are intending to 
do.
<P>
	There is another problem with this committee. Right now the 
Senate is controlled by the Tories. I understand that the Prime 
Minister is working overtime to install his own hacks. The 
Minister of Transport knows that the Senate is controlled by the 
Tories. He is having some problems with the Pearson airport 
affair.
<P>
	The Tories are also worried. A few hundred of them met 
across the river over the weekend. They were planning strategy. 
Their strategy was: ``How do we get back on the gravy train? We 
are not getting many appointments to the Senate anymore and 
we miss that''. They are strategizing how to get back into 
government so they can get back on the gravy train and see some 
of their own appointed to the Senate.
<P>
	Too many of the old Mulroney gang had their eyes on a red 
covered chair in the Senate. And these are the people we want to 
be involved in drafting a code of ethics for us, for the elected 
members of the House of Commons? I think not. Some code of 
conduct that might be.
<P>
	The group of Tories that met in Hull over the weekend did not 
apologize to Canadians for the despicable things they did when 
they were in power. They should have. They did not apologize to 
Canadians for increasing our debt from about $200 billion to 
over $400 billion. They never said they were sorry. And these 
are the kind of people the Liberals want to put on an ethics 
committee? I think not.
<P>
	The Tories imposed the GST on Canadians against their will 
and they had to stack the Senate to do it. These are the kinds of 
people we want to put on an ethics committee?
<P>
	The Tories, along with the Liberals, were involved in drafting 
the Charlottetown accord, the infamous accord that had some 
terrible things in it. One item in the Charlottetown accord called 
for a double majority in the Senate regarding votes on matters 
respecting language and culture. That meant that if there was an 
issue that addressed language or culture, not only did the 
majority of senators have to vote in favour of the measure, but a 
majority of francophone senators had to vote in favour it. That is 
not democratic.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12015"> 12015 </A></B>
<P>
	It is not democratic that they are unelected, but then they get a 
double majority based on language and ethnic origin? That is 
disgusting. Yet the people over there want these types of people 
to sit on an ethics committee. I am astounded. I cannot believe it.
<P>
	The Charlottetown accord said that this new Senate would be 
elected. Members on the other side brought that to our attention. 
Of course we knew it would be elected, but who wants that type 
of an elected Senate? What decent person would run for election 
to that kind of a Senate? I do not think we would find very many 
good candidates that would agree to sit in a body that would use 
a double majority on votes relating to language and culture. That 
is disgusting. It is not Canadian and it is not true democracy. Yet 
the Liberals want these kinds of people to sit on a committee to 
draft a code of conduct for parliamentarians.
<P>
<B>(1725 ) </B>
<P>
	The Tories never apologized for doing these things. The 
Liberals have not apologized for their role in the Charlottetown 
accord, although there were two or three of them who I think did 
see the light and spoke against the accord. The majority as usual 
followed like sheep to the slaughter and lost the Charlottetown 
accord.
<P>
	Canadians are not as thoughtless as many members on the 
other side might think. They see through these things and were 
appalled at the Charlottetown accord. They were appalled at the 
debt the Tories built up. They said it was immoral, that it was 
wrong. Because of that they only elected two Tory members to 
the House in the last election. They said that the GST was wrong 
as well. When two or three Tories stood up and said they would 
not vote for the GST, they were disciplined just like the Liberals 
were who voted against the gun control measure. Nothing is 
different between the Liberals and the Tories. They stand for the 
same principles. Did I say principles? I do not think they stand 
for any principles. It is disgusting.
<P>
	These people want to draft a code of conduct, a code of ethics 
for parliamentarians? I think not.
<P>
	The Senate certainly needs a code of conduct. The member for 
Kingston and the Islands has talked about it. Do they not want 
senators to have a code of conduct? Do they not want them to be 
accountable? The first thing is that they need to be accountable 
to the people of Canada. Until we change the Constitution that 
will not happen. Perhaps rather than abolishing the Senate we 
should be talking about abolishing the appointed senators. That 
might be a move in the right direction.
<P>
	I have spoken at some length on this matter and will conclude 
before my time runs out. I want to clearly say to the House that 
we do need a code of conduct. We do need to know how to deal 
with lobbyists. That is important. However, we certainly do not 
want direction from the old Tory gang. That would be a disaster. 
That is far less than Canadians deserve in this place. We must  
not support a joint committee to deal with the issue of ethics and 
a code of conduct.
<P>
	Perhaps the Liberals have seen the error of their ways. I know 
they did quite a bit of yelling over there because they have been 
told they have to support this motion. It is government policy 
and they have no choice. However, they should just step back for 
a minute and think logically about what they are doing. They are 
supporting the old Tory ways. They are not being any different.
<P>
	There are several new MPs over on the other side who have 
not been tainted with that Tory-Liberal past of previous 
Parliaments. Perhaps this is the time for them to stand up and be 
counted and vote against something that is not right. Let them do 
something right for a change, not just for themselves, not just 
for the Liberal Party, not just for the House of Commons, but for 
Canadians.

	The House resumed from April 28 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-43, an act to amend the Lobbyists Registration Act 
and to make related amendments to other acts, be read the third 
time and passed.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives me a 
great deal of pleasure to speak today in opposition to the 
Lobbyists Registration Act.
<P>
	When American President Calvin Coolidge was governor of 
Massachusetts prior to becoming president, the local Polish 
community wanted him to appoint one of theirs as a judge. There 
was one lady in particular, a lobbyist, who came to see the 
president on a regular basis. She pestered him again and again 
but she could not get him to make the appointment. She showed 
up at his office on a regular basis and could not get him to make 
this appointment. Finally an entire delegation of notables 
descended on him in his office. They came to see him to try to 
persuade Mr. Coolidge to make this appointment.
<P>
	When they arrived at his office, Mr. Coolidge sat and stared at 
the floor. After an uncomfortable silence he said ``New carpet''. 
The whole delegation hastily agreed it was a wonderfully new 
carpet and that he had gotten his money's worth. After a while he 
said ``It cost a lot of money''. The delegation again assured him 
that it was a very beautiful carpet and that indeed he had gotten 
his money's worth. Finally he looked up at them and said ``She 
wore out the old one trying to get you that judge''. They left.
<P>
	The same Calvin Coolidge wrote in his memoirs that when 
one is in politics, nine out of ten people who come to lobby you 
want something they ought not to have. ``If you just ignore 
them'', he said, ``after three or four minutes they will run out of 
things to say and they will leave''.
<P>
	If Mr. Coolidge were still in office, we might not need to 
register lobbyists. We might not need this act. If Mr. Coolidge 
were still in office, we might not need an ethics counsellor. Old 
Silent Cal was his own ethics counsellor, and he sure knew how 
to deal with lobbyists.
<P>
	Calvin Coolidge did not think that it was the business of 
government to seize property from the average citizen and 
redistribute it to the shrill. Unfortunately-I say that 
judiciously-we have made much progress since then. Now our 
governments dispose of huge sums of money. Our federal 
government spends $160 billion a year, and that means that 
anyone can get very rich on even a small amount of it if they 
manage to persuade government to dole out the favours.
<P>
	There are a lot more plums to be shaken from the tree of 
government. Our governments now relentlessly regulate the 
economy. If you can get a regulation changed in your favour it 
means more to you than making a better mouse trap, hiring a 
better employee, or finding a new and better way of doing an old 
task. We have seen that with the recent changes to TV 
regulations. Even when the policy change is a good one, we have 
to worry about how it was done. Government simply has too 
many favours at its disposal.
<P>
	When people lobby government, they almost invariably want 
something they can get by going to Canadians and asking them 
for it. They can come to my house and ask me for donations for 
the various enterprises for which they are looking for funding. 
They can go to other Canadians, but most Canadians probably 
would tell them to go play in traffic. What do they do? They 
come to Ottawa to lobby government for the funds they are 
looking for.
<P>
	If we substitute the word ``force'' for the word 
``government'', we can see how government can achieve what 
these people are looking for, because government has the means 
and the power to force people to give up part of their incomes 
through taxation and take that money and redistribute it to these 
people who come lobbying in Ottawa.
<P>
	We have swarms of lobbyists trying to influence government. 
That means we need laws to regulate them. Unfortunately, this 
bill does not do the job. This bill does not define lobbying 
strictly enough and enables people to lobby in everything but 
name.
<P>
	It is even worse when we come to ethics counsellors. It is a 
shame that we need them. I would much rather have politicians 
who know right from wrong. I lament the day that we went from 
morals to ethics. It has all been downhill ever since.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	If we are to have an ethics counsellor, let us have one with 
some independence. Let us have the ethics counsellor who is 
described in the red book, who reports directly to Parliament. 
Let us have an ethics counsellor who can tell the Prime Minister 
``No, you are wrong'', without fear of getting fired from his job. 
Let us try to swat the swarm of flies buzzing around Parliament 
Hill picking up scraps off a bloated budget and carrying them 
off.
<P>
	Let us not forget that the reason we have people seeking 
unseemly favours from government in unseemly ways is that 
government has become too big. Let us not forget that 
government has the power to reward friends and supplicants in a 
way it simply should not. Let us work on putting government 
back in its box.
<P>
	Let us remember that if men were devils government would 
not be possible, but if they were angels it would not be 
necessary. Let us remember that political philosophy should be 
occupied not with the question ``Who gets to the front of the 
trough?'', but with the question ``How can government be strong 
enough to protect the lives, liberties, and property of its citizens 
without being strong enough to menace them?'' Then we would 
not have to worry about who the cabinet is meeting with today, 
who the Prime Minister is related to, or any other questions. 
That would be real lobbying and ethics reform.
<P>
	Let us defeat Bill C-43 and get on with that.

<HR>
<B><A NAME="12017"> 12017 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise to speak in support of 
Bill C-43, as amended.
<P>
	The Lobbyists Registration Act is one more initiative of the 
government to help ensure honesty and integrity in the politics 
of governance, a key plank in the Liberal platform as laid out in 
our red book. I am glad to note that members opposite have also 
found this book to be a valuable reference.
<P>
	At this juncture allow me to congratulate the members of the 
Standing Committee on Industry, under the able leadership of its 
chairman, the hon. member for Fundy-Royal, for its excellent 
and timely report, appropriately entitled ``Rebuilding Trust''.
<P>
	It was my privilege to have contributed in some small 
measure to the deliberations of this committee. It was evident 
then, and my initial impression has since been reinforced by the 
report, that the committee, composed of members from all 
political parties, would leave no stone unturned in its effort to 
report a bill that would ensure that present and future 
governments will remain honest, open, and accountable. 
Citizens expect no less.
<P>
	I indicated earlier that the report's title, ``Rebuilding Trust'', 
is most appropriate and timely. Until the last federal election 
there was an unprecedented level of public cynicism about our 
national institutions and the political process, about Parliament 
itself. Citizens saw their system eroded, serving the servants and 
not the public. That is why integrity in government was a major 
Liberal platform in 1993.
<P>
	Keeping his promise, the Prime Minister restated in leading 
the debate in this House on Bill C-43 that his highest priority 
was restoring Canadians' faith in their institutions. He reasoned 
that cynicism ultimately undermines the proper functioning of 
Canada, eroding our national resolve to work for a better nation. 
The Prime Minister with these remarks was acknowledging the 
central role public trust plays in the success of any government, 
and we all share in this.
<P>
	Canadians will recall that early in the mandate of this 
government the EH helicopter contract was cancelled at once, as 
promised. A $6 billion national infrastructure works program, in 
concert with the provinces and municipalities, was immediately 
put in place, as promised. The preceding and the last budgets are 
on track to reduce Canada's deficit to 3 per cent of the gross 
domestic product, as promised. Overfishing by foreign fleets, 
which threatened our already scarce domestic stocks, has been 
stopped, as promised.
<P>
<B>(1740 ) </B>
<P>
	Last but not least, a new Canada health and social transfer 
program to govern future provincial-federal transfers has been 
announced to ensure the preservation and strengthening of 
medicare, as promised.
<P>
	We have shown Canadians that integrity cannot be preserved 
simply by paying it lip service. It must take the form of clear, 
decisive action. Integrity must become a way of public service, a 
habit of the heart on the part of any government. The Liberal 
government since assuming office has sent out a strong and clear 
message that the integrity of our country's institutions is not for 
sale.
<P>
	The government and Parliament will serve all Canadians. Bill 
C-43 is one more indisputable proof of that resolve on the part 
of this government.
<P>
	How will Bill C-43 restore and reaffirm public trust in the 
integrity of our national institutions? There are several ways. By 
appointing an ethics counsellor, by empowering the ethics 
counsellor to develop a code of conduct for lobbyists, and by 
ensuring that lobbyists will have a legal obligation to comply 
with the code, we can assure Canadians of integrity in our 
national institutions and therefore regain their trust.
<P>
	By insisting that a code of conduct will have to be reviewed by 
a parliamentary committee before it comes into full effect, we 
can ensure that all political perspectives will have input into the 
substance of the code. By requiring that the ethics counsellor 
must investigate breaches of the code and submit a detailed 
report of each investigation to Parliament, we can ensure there 
will not be a whitewash. By ensuring that the ethics counsellor 
reports to Parliament annually, we can ensure there will be 
ongoing vigilance.
<P>
	Some members opposite have argued that the code of conduct 
as proposed is not a regulatory text and not enforceable in law. 
There is a far greater document than law. Codes of conduct of 
various professional societies and trades have proven to be 
effective tools in ensuring exemplary conduct on the part of 
their members. I am confident that elected officials will rise to 
the challenge called for by the new code of conduct.
<P>
	Some members opposite have also argued that appointment of 
the ethics counsellor by the governor in council is not too 
independent a process. I remind the members opposite have far 
greater faith in the integrity of our citizens, in the integrity of 
our appointees, in the integrity of our officials who assume 
office through the appointment process. One classic example is 
that of our judiciary system. Our Supreme Court is one such 
shining example.
<P>
	The process of assuming office is not as critical as the 
integrity of the people who have assumed office. Let us not 
prejudge the integrity of our ethics counsellor.
<P>
	Other colleagues from the government side have already 
spoken on the many other positive aspects of Bill C-43, includ-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12018"> 12018 </A></B>
<P>
ing the area of disclosure. There will be disclosure of fees and 
disclosure of government funding for associations.
<P>
	Allow me to recall once more for my colleagues opposite and 
for all colleagues in the House that we have gone a long way 
since 1993 in terms of the rebuilding of public trust. The mood 
of Canadians has greatly changed, from cynicism in 1993 to 
optimism today.
<P>
	The Canadian people have placed their trust in the Liberal 
government. I am honoured to serve with the government. Not 
only has it restored economic life, not only has it reduced the 
federal deficit, not only has it created jobs, not only has it 
restored public institutions and infrastructures, this government 
has also restored integrity in governance.
<P>
	Integrity is once again a way of public service, and we have all 
benefited from this change. Parliament is the highest court in the 
land where the voices of Canadians, rich and poor, men and 
women, young and old, are heard and given equal strength.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	It is said that members of Parliament should reflect the fears 
and hopes of their constituents today and in the future. I agree 
and we agree. I also say that we must reflect the hopes of our 
constituents of yesterday whose time honoured values include 
integrity, which continues to guide decisions we make today.
<P>
	I am delighted to support Bill C-43 which marks the dawn of a 
renewed era in Canadian politics, integrity in governance, and 
thereby restore the nobility of our chosen profession in the 
House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
intervention will be more a comment than a question, although I 
am sure the member will want to respond to it.
<P>
	He indicated that we have spoken about the lack of 
independence of the counsellor. Then he went on to say that he 
had more faith in these people than that. So do we. That is why I 
think the process, as defined, is so very unfortunate.
<P>
	The person in the position right now is an honourable person. 
It certainly is not a goal of mine to see if I can find where 
someone has made an error. That is not my goal. I have not found 
anything on him. I do not think there is anything of a serious 
nature or anything at all.
<P>
	He is a man of integrity. He is a man that can be trusted. 
Unfortunately, because he is appointed by the Prime Minister, 
because he answers to the Prime Minister and because there is 
no independence from that particular role, the individual can be 
as honest and as clean as the day is long but he will not be able 
authentically to convince Canadian people of it. Try as he might, 
because of that close relationship there will always be people 
who have not forgotten the previous government, even on the 
assumption that there is nothing wrong with the government. I 
do not buy that, by the way. Everyone has problems from time to 
time.
<P>
	When we form the government next time I am sure there will 
be allegations made about us. That is when I want the ethics 
counsellor to be independent. When false allegations are made 
the person who makes an investigation and reports on them must 
be truly seen to be independent so that he is trusted. Then when 
he says there is nothing wrong it will be taken as a true statement 
instead of one that is manipulated. That is why we are saying 
that the ethics counsellor should be totally independent from 
cabinet and from the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The added problem in Bill C-43 is that both the ethics 
counsellor and the registrar report through the minister. There 
have been comments on that point: ``What is wrong with that? 
Don't we trust our ministers?'' Yes, we do, but if there is a true 
or false allegation against any minister, particularly the minister 
who will act as registrar general, the case is totally weakened by 
the fact that he would bring forward the report on himself. No 
one would believe it and it might be totally true. That is what is 
so unfortunate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pagtakhan:</B> Mr. Speaker, the conclusion in his comments 
was that anything via the appointment process is inherently bad 
and that anything by election is inherently good. Otherwise he 
would not have made a comment.
<P>
	Sad as it may be, even some elected members of Parliament 
have been corrupt in the past so an election is no guarantee. We 
need citizens who will serve the country with integrity.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	The justices of the Supreme Court have been appointed to 
office but have retained their independence. The independence 
of an official is not related to the process; it is related to the soul 
of the individual. If the member were to be appointed by the 
government to an office in the future, he would think just as 
independently as anyone would.
<P>
	The appointment process does not in any way take away from 
the true independence of the appointed Canadian citizen. I have 
faith in our citizenry.
<P>
	Also in the bill is the area of public scrutiny, scrutiny by the 
highest court of the land, by the House, when allegations can be 
substantiated to show the disappearance of independence on the 
part of the appointee. Then members of Parliament have an 
obligation to point it out to the Canadian public.
<P>
	I am not afraid of the appointment process. I would like my 
colleagues to have more faith in our officials. Appointment as a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12019"> 12019 </A></B>
<P>
process is not the only answer. We need officials with the 
highest level of integrity. I am convinced the government with 
its bill and commitment to keep its promises has already shown 
the Canadian public it is serious about integrity. I would like my 
colleague to have faith in us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague across the way 
missed the point. It is not that I do not have faith. Those of us 
within these walls have a high level of faith in one another 
across party lines. I do. I look at Liberal members and I do not 
see any reason to accuse them wholesale of wanting somehow to 
deceive the public. I do not observe that. From time to time 
allegations are made. I am not the one who has to have faith; it is 
the Canadian people.
<P>
	Why was this section included in the red book if it was not as a 
response to the lack of faith Canadians have developed over the 
last number of years? I am sure they would be happiest if we said 
over the previous nine years before the last election. There is no 
doubt that Canadians in general have lost a lot of faith in 
government officials because of things that have gone on, things 
that have been exposed and things that have been wrong.
<P>
	We need an ethics counsellor who is independent and is seen 
to be independent by the public so that he has real credibility 
when he makes the pronouncement that it is an innocent case. He 
should have total freedom and not in any way be perceived to be 
under any pressure from the Prime Minister or any cabinet 
minister when he is conducting an investigation so that he will 
be believed regardless of how he calls the investigation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pagtakhan:</B> Mr. Speaker, how can the member say he has 
faith in the ethics counsellor at the same time as he says the 
person could be manipulated and his report may not be believed 
because he has been appointed to that office? How can we 
believe the member has complete faith in the person when at the 
same time he would say that the person can be manipulated?
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, with 
Bill C-43, the Liberal government has as usual ignored the real 
problems.
<P>
	With this bill to amend the Lobbyists Registration Act and to 
make related amendments to other acts, the government has not 
resolved anything. What this Parliament needs is not another 
bill but above all a code of conduct for lobby groups, which 
wield excessive powers in this country.
<P>
	To go on and conclude that lobbyists are leading the country 
seems to be the logical step. True enough. We know that 
lobbying activities have always been part of the Canadian 
political scene. Over the years, these activities have become an 
important component of the political process.	Between 1969 and 1985, some 20 private members' bills dealing with this issue were tabled in the House of Commons.
<P>
	All these bills were motivated by the same reason, the same 
need, the same desire, that is, to make the government more 
open and democratic. The fact that we are being asked to address 
this issue again today means that we have not made as much 
progress as we hoped.
<P>
	As I read this bill, it occurred to me that, between the time 
when election promises were made and the time when they were 
put into law, lobbyists probably dictated the final version of Bill 
C-43, which would account for this abrupt turnaround in Liberal 
policy. I would like to caution this government against 
dissociating itself from these groups, as we all remember that 
the Government of Canada started being influenced by lobbyists 
as far back as 1969, under the Trudeau government, of which the 
current Prime Minister was an active member.
<P>
	Let us remember the role played by lobbyists in developing 
the free trade agreement and the goods and services tax. 
Remember also the role played by the Business Council on 
National Issues, the most powerful and active lobby in this 
country. In fact, to join, you have to be president of one 
Canada's top 150 corporations. Together, members of this select 
circle manage $975 billion and employ 1.5 million Canadians, 
or 12 per cent of the country's labour force. It is therefore fair to 
say that this group has power, or a hold, over the government.
<P>
	We also know that the members of this organization make 
generous donations to campaign funds, whether Conservative or 
Liberal. Must I remind members of the influence this group had 
on the Mulroney government when the Meech agreements were 
passed in 1990? As members will recall, the Mulroney 
government had hired Ronald Watts to act as the brain behind 
the constitutional strategy. But what everyone here may not 
know is that Mr. Watts was the expert adviser of the Business 
Council on National Issues at the time. Just think of how much 
influence he had and was able to bring to bear on the 
government.
<P>
	I would even go further and say that the kind of lobbying 
practised in Canada is causing this country to become 
dehumanized.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	In his memoirs, a former Quebec Premier, René Lévesque, 
refers to a meeting which took place in 1982 with a Bank of 
Canada official who was obsessed with the fight against 
inflation, but showed very little concern about unemployment.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12020"> 12020 </A></B>
<P>
	As you can see, central bank officials change, but their 
obsession remains the same. Why? Simply because of the 
lobbyists, whose companies prefer to maintain unemployment 
high, so as to have access to cheap manpower.
<P>
	When the party in office claims to want to put people back to 
work, we have to wonder, since its cannot do anything against 
powerful lobbies.
<P>
	This is why members opposite are not so irked by a 
referendum campaign, since it provides them with an 
opportunity to avoid the real problems which they cannot solve, 
such as job creation.
<P>
	I am only asking the government to fulfil a commitment made 
last June, when the Prime Minister said that initiatives relating 
to transparency, including Bill C-43, would give unprecedented 
transparency to the federal administration. The events of the last 
15 days give you an idea of this transparency.
<P>
	There can be no doubt about the power of lobbyists. 
According to an article published in a London newspaper in 
December 1992, there were 149 rich men and women in Canada. 
These are the people who run the country. These rich men and 
women are of course the members of the Business Council on 
National Issues. This is a group which, I say again, makes 
financial contributions to the Conservative and Liberal parties.
<P>
	The credibility of the Parliament of Canada is undermined by 
such headlines. The time has come to act and this is why the Bloc 
Quebecois is asking that all lobbyists be subjected to the same 
disclosure rules.
<P>
	Nobody in this House would be surprised to hear that, as 
usual, the government, contrary to its red book commitments, 
even refuses to subject all professional lobbyists, that is those 
who influence the government for essentially economic reasons, 
to the same disclosure rules. Why? What is the government's 
interest? Who is it trying to protect? Who is it trying to please? 
We hope those questions will be answered.
<P>
	Obviously, clauses concerning the ethics counsellor need to 
be closely scrutinized. One of the main functions of the 
counsellor should be to prepare a code of conduct for lobbyists. 
Properly designed, that code could increase public awareness of 
lobbying and reduce improper conduct on the part of lobbyists. I 
hope that code would have a greater impact than the Lobbyists 
Registration Act itself.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I listened to what the member opposite had to say. 
Towards the end of his speech, he indicated that he would like all 
lobbyists to be subject to the same rules.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	That would mean for example that the Canadian Federation of 
Agriculture, the UPA and the Red Cross would be subject to the 
same onerous rules as the large lobbying firms set up here, in 
Ottawa.
<P>
	I do not know if the member was there when the parliamentary 
committee considered the bill, but the groups I just mentioned, 
the Dairy Farmers of Canada, for example, told the committee 
that the rules should not be the same for them and for the large 
Canadian lobbying firms.
<P>
	Can the hon. member tell us why he disagrees with the 
proposal which was made by the Dairy Farmers of Canada to the 
parliamentary committee and which the government has 
implemented?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fillion:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to answer this 
question. First of all, lobbying can be divided into two 
categories. The first category is the kind of lobbying where 
fundamental problems concerning basic principles are 
discussed, whether they be moral principles, work principles, or 
whatever. The other category is the economic lobbying 
category. These lobbyists are the ones that I am talking about. 
Just take as an example the events which took place over the last 
few weeks. Think about Power Corporation and Power DirecTv. 
These two examples are enough to give the members opposite 
pause.
<P>
	I want to add that when we talk about integrity and 
transparency in this area, we are talking precisely about fiscal 
integrity and transparency. You organize dinners at $1,000 a 
plate. What ordinary citizen can afford a dinner at that price? It 
is Power Corporation who will buy 10, 15, 20 or 25 tickets at 
$1,000 each and give them to their friends. Is that your idea of 
transparency?
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is simply saying no to that. All we want is 
to improve the integrity of parliamentarians.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before returning the floor 
to the hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell for a 
supplementary question, I would remind you, dear colleagues, 
that all remarks must be addressed to the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, judging by his response, I think 
the hon. member misunderstood my question. He said in his 
remarks that all lobbyists-I wrote it down as he went 
along-that all lobbyists should be subject to the same rules.
<P>
	In the answer he tried to give us, he acknowledged himself 
that lobbyists were not all on an equal footing. He said that some 
people dealing with certain types of matters should, by dint of 
circumstance, come under stricter rules, if I understood 
correctly.
<P>
	I therefore repeat my earlier request. In the bill, the rules 
governing organizations such as farm federations or similar 
groups will be less strict. Why does the hon. member want the 
rules to be just as strict in the case of farm federations and of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12021"> 12021 </A></B>
<P>
Canadian association of dairy  producers, which testified before 
the committee requesting more relaxed rules for its members? 
Why does he oppose the position of these organizations? I am 
trying to be clearer than I was the last time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fillion:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. member opposite 
understood perfectly the answer I gave earlier. He understood 
every word, but he chose to interpret it in his own way. However, 
I do not agree with his interpretation. I do not agree, because 
once again, the rules must be the same for lobbyists involved in 
the financial sector.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	I understand what he is getting at. He would like to stifle the 
activities of pressure groups as well, but that is not the point. We 
will not prevent lobbying on issues pertaining to unemployment 
insurance, student loans and post-secondary education. We will 
not prevent lobbying in those areas, except in the case of 
financial lobbyists, when the time comes to pass strict laws that 
will help the old-time parties, the Liberals and the 
Conservatives, show a little more integrity and more 
transparency in their operations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to my colleague's opinion on lobbying and I realize that 
lobbying is a legitimate activity. Parties with interests at stake 
have the right to heighten the awareness of others to them. What 
is not right is carrying on these representations secretly, 
furtively, which can in no way serve the public interest.
<P>
	My colleague mentioned in his speech that the legislative 
branch, the House of Commons, has a role to play. And I, as an 
MP-this needs to be said-often get the feeling that outside 
influences, especially from high finance, force a decision to go a 
certain way, and they leave no trace leading to the truth or even 
to information which would shed some light on what is being 
hidden behind the masks and the empty gestures.
<P>
	For two weeks, several questions have been asked in this 
House regarding who is responsible for the satellite 
broadcasting issue, and, overall, the issue is extremely clouded.
<P>
	Therefore, we do not want to prohibit lobbying but to make it 
transparent so that the House can really protect the public's 
interests.
<P>
	I would like my honourable colleague to respond to the 
comments I have just made.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fillion:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for giving me 
the opportunity to point out that his comments show that he did 
not really listen to my speech, but only grasped two or three 
words from it, on which he based his incomprehensible 
gibberish that he probably does not even understand himself.
<P>
	I will quote exactly what I said in my speech: ``Nobody in this 
House would be surprised to hear that, as usual, the 
government-your Liberal government-contrary to its red 
book commitments-''.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order please. I already 
took a few moments earlier and I will do it again. I must remind 
you that, to the greatest extent possible, all statements must be 
made through the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fillion:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will continue quoting from my 
speech: ``-the government, contrary to the red book 
commitments''-I know it is shocking-``refuses that all 
professional lobbyists, that is to say those who influence the 
government for purely economic reasons, be made to abide by 
the same disclosure rules''. This is what I said. I was referring to 
lobbyists whose goals are essentially economic. I differentiate 
between the two categories. So, when it comes to lobbyists 
whose goals are essentially economic, their name, interests and 
rules should be disclosed, just as we, in the Bloc Quebecois, are 
not afraid to publish the list of taxpayers who contribute to our 
election fund, since we do not accept gifts from companies.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to address Bill C-43, the Lobbyists 
Registration Act, and to express some of my concerns and 
frustrations with the continuing saga of the sophistry of the 
Liberal Party, which is using clever but misleading arguments to 
encourage and to instil confidence in the Canadian public that 
what it is doing is in their best interests.
<P>
	In the long run, at the end of the day and at the end of the term, 
when we see the results of that party's futile efforts, finally we 
will see that all the things the Reform Party and a lot of the 
things the Bloc Québécois are saying about this government will 
come true. We will see the facts and know that all the sophistry 
has done nothing but keep the Prime Minister high in the polls.
<P>
	During the next election I know there will be Liberal members 
taking pride in initiatives such as this bill and the joint 
committee of the House of Commons and Senate to establish a 
code of ethics. They will say the government has restored 
integrity to the Canadian parliamentary system. They will talk 
about how they kept all their promises in the Liberal red book, 
despite the fact that the Reform Party has already pointed out 
about 20 broken promises.
<P>
	The Liberals are against recall. They do not want recall. They 
do not want to have a certain member in their party who has been 
expelled from caucus; that member is representing over 100,000 
people, was elected as a Liberal, and sits in the House as an 
independent. That should be an embarrassment to Liberals, but 
they say the best form of recall-and this will come back to 
haunt them-is at election time. The Prime Minister has said 
``That is the time when they can vote me out. That  is the time 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12022"> 12022 </A></B>
<P>
when we will be held accountable.'' I am here to remind Liberal 
members that they will be held accountable. The people of 
Ontario, who voted with their feet the last time, just might vote 
with their feet again in 1997.
<P>
	They talk about pension reform, the relaxation of party 
discipline, open and honest government. Restoring integrity to 
politicians is what is in the red book. We know politicians have a 
poor name, probably because of the most immediate past 
government. Nevertheless, this government is starting to 
develop that same arrogance, that same defiant way, where its 
members feel they can do anything they want to do, when they 
want to do it, how they want to do it, behind closed doors.
<P>
	For instance, let us look at the incident that is being debated in 
the House now, with the direct to home satellite service, and the 
performance of the Minister of Canadian Heritage to date. As we 
all know, we questioned his judgment and we questioned his 
competence when he wrote a letter to the CRTC, an agency that 
is supposed to report to him on an arm's length basis, suggesting 
that a certain constituent of his receive a radio application. That 
was a breach of his cabinet oath, yet nothing happened. This was 
run by the ethics counsellor, who also in the red book, the Prime 
Minister promised, would answer to Parliament.
<P>
	I will come back to that issue in a second, because the Reform 
critic has done an excellent job of pointing out things that he 
feels should be repeated at this point in time.
<P>
	This bill talks about elements like integrity and ethics. When 
we talk about integrity and ethics we have to show transparency, 
we have to show consistency, and we have to keep our promises.
<P>
	An order in council came forth this past week saying that we 
believe in fair and open competition, we believe that Canadians 
want competition, and we are working in the best interests of 
Canadians; therefore, Power Corp. should have the right to 
compete for direct to home satellite services. So be it. If the 
government was really consistent in its philosophy and if it 
really had any integrity at all, it would have to be consistent. To 
be consistent, the government must also revisit the decision of 
the CRTC, which at this point was consistent in both of its 
decisions, because it wanted to protect Canadian culture. Both 
of those decisions were rendered in the name of Canadian 
culture. One is overturned by an order in council, which is an 
unprecedented use of power. It is using a sledgehammer when a 
little hammer would do.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	What did the government do with the other decision, about the 
monopoly granted to Rogers cable system, that only Canadian 
programming would be on there, and the new stations that were 
awarded? It excluded the country music cable station from the 
United States.
<P>
	If this government really has integrity, if this government has 
any morals at all, it will be consistent with their order in council 
on the direct to home television decision and it will have another 
order in council ordering the CRTC to reverse its decision on 
Rogers and allow CMT to compete openly with Canadians.
<P>
	We now have to compete as Canadian football players with 
Americans in the CFL. We now have free trade. We now have 
open borders. If we are going to compete, let us compete. Let us 
not just do it on the basis of keeping it all in the family.
<P>
	That is what is wrong with this bill, the very thing we are 
talking about this week, about the transparency of transactions 
where government gets itself involved with businesses. Power 
Corporation and those people who are representing the satellite 
services run a business. They make a profit. They want the 
government's help. They needed the government's help to come 
into this picture so that they could compete with Expressvu, 
which has spent $200 million. They were using Canadian 
services, Canadian satellites. The CRTC was consistent, but this 
government orders an order in council.
<P>
	We have the right to question that. Did Power Corporation 
lobby? Was there any company hired to lobby on behalf of 
Power Corporation? Was there any need for a lobby? Somebody 
said the Liberal Party is a lobby. I like that line.
<P>
	Joking aside, if there were a need, how would the Lobbyists 
Registration Act, Bill C-43, aid, benefit, and help this process 
and keep it transparent so that the Canadian public does not 
question the integrity and the ethics of the government 
politicians?
<P>
	I want to hold up my Prime Minister and that cabinet in 
esteem. I want to criticize wrong policies. I never want to have 
to question their ethics, their morals, or their intent. That is not 
what we should be here for.
<P>
	In the way it happened, an order in council, why. On the basis 
of a three person committee? On that three person committee 
there was a former law partner of the Prime Minister, an 
individual who runs a company that is owned by Bronfman, and 
another individual who was appointed deputy minister by 
Liberal Prime Minister Trudeau. They were all deputy 
ministers, I heard somebody say today; I believe it was the 
government whip. They all were working in the bureaucracy. 
They got solicitations. They got a hundred or so letters, we were 
told in answer to a question in question period. Let us make 
those letters public. Let us find out what those people said 
before they made their recommendation. We cannot get to the 
bottom of this.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12023"> 12023 </A></B>
<P>
	This bill is important. We should have lobbyists register. We 
should have them register as per what was said in the red book. 
They are breaking another promise. Where is the ethics and the 
integrity in breaking another promise?
<P>
	The positive elements of the bill are that it does increase the 
disclosure requirements for lobbyists, especially for tier two, in 
house. Another positive is that any lobbyists whose clients are 
coalitions will have to disclose the membership for that 
coalition so that we know exactly the size of the group we are 
dealing with. It also adds government funding and the subject 
matter of a lobbying proposal to disclosure requirements. It 
allows for electronic filing of returns. It increases the statute of 
limitations for investigations from six months to two years. That 
is about it for the positives.
<P>
	On the negatives, the bill classifies lobbyists not on what they 
do but rather who they work for. They should be defined by their 
activities, not their employers. All professional lobbyists should 
be treated the same. Further, the red book promises that the 
recommendations from the 1992 unanimous Holtmann report 
will be implemented by the Liberal government. Removal of the 
tiers was an explicit Holtmann report recommendation.
<P>
	A lobbyist is defined as someone who lobbies as a significant 
part of their duties. John Turner, who may only lobby two or 
three times a year, can make a case that he is not a significant 
lobbyist and therefore he does not have to register. A better 
definition is someone who is paid to attempt to influence the 
government.
<P>
	There is nothing wrong with having lobbyists, but let us make 
sure it is open and transparent and above board.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	The bill does not address the problem of using past and 
current political ties to gain access and influence. Past political 
positions held and political donations should be declared. The 
fees paid to lobbyists are not included on the list of disclosure 
requirements even though when in opposition the Liberals 
insisted on it and the chief government whip wrote a report 
calling for disclosure.
<P>
	It would help to show when there has been a massive lobbying 
campaign on any one side of an issue like the Charlottetown 
accord. The bill specifies that the individual lobbyist must 
register but he need not disclose the name of the government 
official he is lobbying.
<P>
	For the Pearson deal we would only know that the Department 
of Transport was lobbied but we would not know who the 
individuals were. This sends a message that specific lobbyists 
must be held accountable but not specific public office holders.
<P>
	Who in the Department of Transport was lobbied? That is 
what we have to know. The bill has a loophole whereby any 
meeting initiated by a public office holder need not be disclosed. 
This is obviously a major flaw  because, as Jean Chenier of <I>The 
Lobby Monitor</I> said, ``Any lobbyist who cannot get an invitation 
from a public servant is not worth his retainer''.
<P>
	The bill completely ignores anti-avoidance schemes. Even 
with the relatively uncomplicated act before the bill there were 
anti-avoidance schemes developed. Not dealing with them is a 
problem, another Holtmann report recommendation ignored.
<P>
	We also suggest the registrar who administers the act be given 
the power to perform random audits to better ensure lobbyists 
are complying with the provisions of the act. That is a very solid 
and concrete recommendation or proposal by the Reform Party.
<P>
	The bill also touches on the ethics counsellor. The biggest 
scam perpetrated on the House is in the red book. It is quite 
clear. It is on page 95: ``The ethics counsellor will report 
directly to Parliament''.
<P>
	The ethics counsellor was hired. We know the gentleman's 
name. We are not questioning his ability. We are questioning to 
whom the ethics counsellor reports. It is to the Prime Minister, 
directly to the Prime Minister.
<P>
	He is not a watchdog, which is what an ethics counsellor 
should be, on behalf of Parliament to restore integrity and to 
restore politicians to the high standards they were held in back 
in the old days. He is not a watchdog, he is a lapdog.
<P>
	If the Prime Minister is involved in a situation in which there 
are close family ties-and there is no accusation of wrongdoing, 
none whatsoever-we want the process to be transparent and the 
ethics counsellor to be able to say to the House that it is 
transparent. The fact that the gentleman is the Prime Minister's 
son-in-law should have no bearing on the decision rendered in 
cabinet. The order in council should be above board. They 
should be in the best interest of all Canadians. There is no more 
to it.
<P>
	We want to be able to trust and accept unequivocally the 
decisions of the ethics counsellor. We cannot do that now 
because the ethics counsellor answers directly to the Prime 
Minister. He does not answer to Parliament. It is a direct 
violation, another promise of the Liberal government in its red 
book.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Augustine:</B> Rubbish.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> That is not rubbish. It is on page 95. Nod your head 
if you agree with me, Mr. Speaker, that in the red book it says the 
ethics counsellor is supposed to report to Parliament or to the 
Prime Minister. I know you cannot nod your head. I withdraw 
the request.
<P>
	The ethics counsellor must investigate any time he has reason 
to believe there has been a breach in the code of conduct for 
lobbyists and he must report his findings. He must also file an 
annual report on the operation of his office. That is a good 
element.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="12024"> 12024 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> That is not true.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> I will say it again because I hear members opposite 
saying it is not true. I would not stand here in the House and say 
that the Liberal promise is not in the red book. I would not do 
that. The authors of the red book promised an ethics counsellor 
would report to Parliament. The ethics counsellor does not 
report to Parliament and all those geniuses jabbering on the 
other side better get their facts straight. It is a direct violation, a 
broken promise.
<P>
	Along with the government we wish to restore integrity to 
politicians. We have to get there from here because there is a 
long way to go. The book <I>On the Take</I> has cast a negative light on 
all politicians.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	I am a rookie politician. I am a politician now by profession 
because I get paid for it, but in my heart and in my mind I am still 
a businessman. I know what I thought two years ago when I was 
on the outside looking in here at what these people were doing. I 
was not too happy about that. I was so frustrated that I decided to 
run.
<P>
	Now I am hoping that by being here and being able to express 
my point of view I can now say I would like to restore integrity 
to politicians. The government should be listening rather than 
talking. I know some of its members are very talented and can 
talk and listen at the same time, but not too many people are able 
to do that.
<P>
	When I accuse the government of sophistry, which is no more 
than using clever but misleading arguments for a false 
conclusion, sleight of hand is another good way of saying it, my 
concern is it talks about the great and wonderful things it is 
doing for the country when it really is not. It is letting Canadians 
down.
<P>
	It has bills like the Lobbyists Registration Act and the motion 
today for a joint committee on a code of ethics, a joint 
committee with the Senate and the House of Commons to enact a 
bill that would define the code of ethics. Why is there a need for 
all this?
<P>
	Two months ago the Prime Minister said in the House that we 
have all these things in place. Cabinet ministers must take all 
sorts of oaths. We have to take oaths as members of Parliament. 
We have all sorts of rules controlling what we can and cannot do. 
We are into about six levels of controls to ensure we restore 
respectability for parliamentarians.
<P>
	We want to know what is happening in the bureaucracy. We 
want to know who is in charge. The Lobbyists Registration Act 
does make a lobbyist register who they are lobbying with within 
the department. Are they seeing the deputy minister? Are they 
seeing Mr. Dodge? The Canadian public should know that after a 
meeting with Mr. Dodge he changed his mind on a certain issue 
or that his recommendation changed. There is nothing wrong 
with that. That is a positive. That is not a negative and yet the 
government will not put that in.
<P>
	We have about three or four strong recommendations for the 
bill and we will continue to put them forward in the interest of 
all parliamentarians and in the best interest of some lobbyists. 
There may be some former politicians who after a couple of 
years off could come back and be lobbyists, and they would be 
darn good lobbyists, to help their reputation, to help them build 
on the experience they have gained by working in government so 
they can help other Canadians. Through open disclosure and the 
rules working both ways, I believe the bill could help a lot of 
people within government.
<P>
	The bill is another example of the feel good, talk good, do 
nothing government that likes to tell us everything it is doing is 
wonderful and there is no room for improvement. I am sorry to 
hear that. With my intervention today I hope maybe one or two 
of these suggestions I have made may stick, although I rather 
doubt it.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before I go to questions 
and comments, the hon. member for Calgary Centre in his 
intervention used the word ``sophistry'' and really piqued my 
curiosity. He did describe the meaning of the word but I had to 
go through Webster's new dictionary of synonyms and the 
concise Oxford dictionary to find out exactly the meaning of the 
word.
<P>
	On another note, at one point in his intervention he asked the 
Chair to participate in some way in the debate by nodding. The 
last time I nodded I was at a friend's farm and ended up buying 
something I did not want and have never used since.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, that was a very wise ruling on your part. I will try to 
remember it when I attend the next farm auction as well.
<P>
<B>(1835 ) </B>
<P>
	He indicated he favoured the removal of the tiers for the 
different categories of lobbyists for the purpose of registration. 
This subject came up some minutes before the member started 
his speech. I have to repeat a question I asked of another hon. 
member.
<P>
	The Dairy Farmers of Canada and a number of other groups 
testified before our committee. They indicated it was unfair to 
apply rules to them. I can imagine it would be unfair to apply to 
the Dairy Farmers of Canada and to the Canadian Federation of 
Agriculture and the Red Cross the same kind of rules we would 
apply to Earnscliffe or S.A. Murray Consulting or any one of 
those consultant lobbyists. The member has advocated we 
should do this.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="12025"> 12025 </A></B>
<P>
	Does he not agree that for the kind of groups I have identified 
the requirements should be different? If he agrees with me, why 
is he making this criticism?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question and the 
intervention. It was a very good comment. I do not agree with 
the member because if these groups are asked to come to the 
standing committee or if they come to the House and go through 
the offices of members and want to give information, that is 
okay if it is strictly giving information. However, some are here 
to influence MPs, to lobby MPs. A lot of people come into my 
office and try to set up meetings to tell me what their problems 
are, what the solutions are and to suggest what I should consider, 
that maybe I should vote a certain way on a bill.
<P>
	As soon as they start talking about how I should vote or how I 
should look at a certain situation that basically is influence 
peddling.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> That is a criminal offence.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> I should not say it is influence peddling. Somebody 
said it is a criminal offence to influence peddle. I take that back. 
As I have said, I am a rookie. I do not know all the terminology.
<P>
	When they come here to influence the Department of 
Transport or the Department of Health or whatever department, 
for example a pharmaceutical lobbyist or someone lobbying for 
agriculture, if it is for information it is okay but if it is to 
influence the department or the ministry or affects any kind of 
decision before the government, they should register. What is 
wrong with registering? I do not see why they would object to 
that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I as well know a bit about sophistry. Sophistry is a lot of 
rhetoric, knowing how to use words that mean virtually nothing.
<P>
	In this case when we are talking about lobbying it is a very 
serious issue in spite of the fact that the project under study, Bill 
C-43, does not have any teeth. I ask the member what he thinks 
about nepotism. We have been examining over the past couple of 
weeks the fact the Prime Minister would actually arrange to 
favour a firm owned by his nephew. That is a clear and flagrant 
case of nepotism. No one can doubt it. No one should doubt it. It 
is not only apparent, it is difficult to argue otherwise being that 
the whole system is filled with people closely connected to 
Power Corp. or closely connected to the Prime Minister who 
have actually acted in a very exceptional way overturning a 
decision by the CRTC. This is the first time in history. One 
really has to have a lot of power. We are not talking about the 
average lobbying firm. We are talking about corruption in high 
places. We are talking about a Prime Minister favouring the firm 
of his nephew.
<P>
	In spite of the fact it is quite obvious, high stake patronage 
and corruption, the Liberal government finds this to be a subject 
of humour. This is a flagrant example of the misuse and abuse of 
power.
<P>
	What I would like to ask the member-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fontana:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I am sure 
on careful reflection of the blues the use of such words as 
``corruption'' are unparliamentary. I think the member ought to 
apologize now. If he does not have the guts to do that, he should 
step outside and use those words-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. Let me take things 
in reverse order. I appeal to the hon. member who just had the 
floor, in the spirit of parliamentary language the word by itself is 
not unparliamentary. However, some words that come to mind 
which would replace the one I heard are ``courage'' and 
``fortitude'' as opposed to the word used by the hon. 
parliamentary secretary.
<P>
	With regard to his initial appeal as to whether a word was 
unparliamentary, I did not hear of any one word that was 
unparliamentary, and I was listening with a great deal of 
attention.
<P>
	However, the time has elapsed. I have taken into 
consideration the 13 minutes I had to allow for the ministerial 
statement.
<P>
	It being 6.43, we will now move to the adjournment motion.
<P>
