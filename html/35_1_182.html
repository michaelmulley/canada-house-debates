	<B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Don Valley North, Lib.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should designate the 
period from April 20 to 27 of each year as the week in which we commemorate 
the issue of man's inhumanity to his fellow man to remind Canadians that the 
use of genocide and violence as an instrument of national policy by any nation 
or group at any time is a crime against all mankind which must be condemned 
and not forgotten.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to present 
my motion to the House. The motion calls for designating the 
week of April 20 to 27 to commemorate the issue of man's 
inhumanity to his follow man.
<P>
	I chose April 20 to 27 because April 19 and 20, 1939 was the 
beginning of the Holocaust committed by the Nazis against the 
Jewish population. April 27 was the end of the apartheid regime 
in South Africa which gave the South African population the 
right to vote; the one man, one vote concept.
<P>
	I want to present to the House the definition of crimes against 
humanity. The first time this term was used was in the London 
Charter of 1945, the structure and basis for prosecution of major 
war crimes before the international tribunal at Nurnberg. Crime 
against humanity presents a distinct category of international 
crimes. Article 6(c) of the charter defines crimes against 
humanity as murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation 
and other inhumane acts committed against any civilian 
population before or during the war; or persecution on political, 
racial or religious grounds in execution of all in connection with 
any crime within the jurisdiction of the tribunal whether or not 
in violation of the domestic laws of the country where the crime 
was perpetrated.
<P>
	I have personal experience with violence, genocide, 
deportation and the beginning of a new life. On many occasions, 
Mr. Speaker, you have spoken on this crime. I invited you down 
when I was working for the Armenian community in my home 
town of Toronto.
<P>
	I will tell the House about my experience this year in July 
when I went to the Middle East for the first time since 1967 
when I left. It was my intention to visit Der-zor where 
documentation shows that hundreds of thousands of people were 
deported from their ancestral homelands and driven to Der-zor 
and left there to die or were killed by the Ottoman Turkish 
soldiers at the time.
<P>
	Even today when one goes there and puts a hand in the sand 
one has to go down only six inches to pick up the bones and 
remains of human beings. The river running through Der-zor is 
a very historical scene to Canadians of Armenian origin and 
many other Armenians living throughout the world because in 
that river we saw bodies floating in the same way we saw bodies 
floating last year in Rwanda. I saw that river, I walked in that 
river and I remember the past, 1915.
<P>
	My personal experience with the holocaust of Armenian 
origin was in 1965 when I was only 17. I knew the extent of the 
holocaust that my ancestors went through. Since then and before 
that many other people went through the same crimes against 
humanity.
<P>
	I regret to say that so far humanity has never brought a single 
person to justice. Even with what we saw last year in Rwanda, 
today there is not one single person accused of crimes against 
humanity. When will we take charge and outlaw this crime and 
punish them so they will not be able to repeat the crime and then 
enjoy the fruits of their crimes against humanity?
<P>
	As I mentioned, April 24 was the beginning of the Armenian 
genocide committed by the Ottoman empire in 1915. On that day 
300,000 intellectuals were rounded up from their houses and 
taken into the desert. The leadership of the community was 
taken so there would not be resistance to this crime that was to 
be carried on for the next eight to twelve months.
<P>
	As a result of the holocaust 1.5 million people were murdered 
and another 500,000 were deported from their homelands. As of 
now the crime remains unpunished.
<P>
	My motion calls for this not to be forgotten, but it never says 
not to be forgiven. Forgiveness has to come when those who 
committed the crime ask for forgiveness. They also should be 
ready to be forgiven because forgiveness is the nature of human 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11376"> 11376 </A></B>
<P>
beings. We cannot forget because if we forget we are condemned 
to repeat it.
<P>
	We all know very well what happened to the Jewish 
population in World War II beginning in 1939. Adolf Hitler had 
many excuses, but as far as I am concerned there is no good 
reason to commit violence or genocide in any shape or form. 
This cannot be comprehended by an ordinary person. There is no 
reason to commit, especially in this case, crimes against 
humanity.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	The world was silent. It stood silent while six million Jews 
were slaughtered. Nobody said a word until the war was over. 
Why did we have to wait until the number reached six million 
before we spoke up? Why did we have to wait until the numbers 
reached 1.5 million before we spoke up? Why can we not make 
our position known to everybody that this will not be tolerated?
<P>
	In 1975 in Cambodia in a city of three million, two million 
were wiped out. We did not say a single word. The UN did not act 
in any way. Is this the way to treat criminals? We cannot tolerate 
this forever.
<P>
	Today in Yugoslavia UNHCR estimates that more than 
100,000 Bosnians were massacred and 300,000 were deported. 
Again, there is not a single international tribunal to punish those 
who commit these crimes so they will not be repeated.
<P>
	I spoke earlier about Rwanda. We had discussions about 
whether to send our troops to Rwanda for peacekeeping. I stated 
in response to a member of the opposition that we should have 
discussed this issue further.
<P>
	In two weeks half a million people were killed. Technology 
has advanced so much that half a million people can be killed in 
two weeks and yet we in this country and other countries sit back 
and ask what to do next. I propose we do something about it now. 
Let us declare the week of April 20-27 the week of man's 
inhumanity to his fellow man so we can educate the younger 
generation that crimes against humanity must be punished. 
There is no escape when a crime is committed, be it a small or a 
large crime.
<P>
	Even today violence is taking place in the Middle East. 
Yesterday a three-year old child was killed for no reason. Who 
will stand up and condemn this violence against innocent 
people?
<P>
	In 1939 when Adolf Hitler was giving his orders to SS units to 
slaughter the Jewish population, he said: ``Who remembers the 
extermination of the Armenian people today?'' That was on 
August 9, 1939. Today is April 3, 1995 and I hope and pray the 
House will remember the message of Adolf Hitler was wrong in 
1939. A continuation of this cannot be tolerated.
<P>
	Many ministers of the government and members of 
Parliament spoke against genocide in the past. I quote three of 
them. The hon. member for York West on April 24, 1985 in the 
House said: ``Today the Armenian militia commemoration 
serves to remind us all in a  profound way of the importance of 
fulfilling our commitment to human and minority rights''.
<P>
	The Deputy Prime Minister said: ``It is not simply a question 
of a problem over there in a far away country. It is a question of 
human rights, not only for the Armenian community but for all 
communities''.
<P>
	For the last 25 years on April 24, I have demonstrated in front 
of the Parliament buildings along with many thousands of 
people. I and many members of the House have spoken against 
genocide. We should continue to do that because it is very 
important to remember. We have to ask ourselves what has 
happened over the last 25 years of protest, of demonstration and 
condemnation. The House was silent.
<P>
	I call on the House to recognize these crimes against humanity 
and to make sure we know Hitler was wrong, that the world 
remembers and the House remembers.
<P>
<B>(1115 ) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, with the consent of the Chair and this House, I 
would like this motion to be a votable item if possible.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member could bring it up at 
the last minute or two and ask that by unanimous consent it be 
made a votable item or he could do it now if he wishes. Which is 
his preference?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Assadourian:</B> I will wait because there is going to be an 
amendment made to the motion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Daviault (Ahuntsic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank the hon. member for Don Valley North for tabling this 
motion to designate a week to commemorate the victims of 
genocide. I also commend the hon. member for Saint-Denis.
<P>
	The hon. member for Don Valley North is very involved in his 
community. In fact, he is the first member of the House of 
Commons of Armenian origin and, as such, like all the members 
of his community, is very concerned about the issue of genocide 
and the suffering of its victims.
<P>
	Since I am in favour of recognition by the Government of 
Canada of the genocide of the Armenian people, I welcome the 
opportunity to speak to this motion today. Because I also feel 
very close to this community, on February 1st this year, I wrote 
to the Minister of Foreign Affairs to condemn a decision by the 
Armenian president to prohibit temporarily the FRA 
Dachnaktsoution Party, in December 1994.
<P>
	The motion, therefore, proposes that, to ensure that this crime 
against humanity is condemned and we remember the genocides 
of the past, the Canadian government designate the period 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11377"> 11377 </A></B>
<P>
between April 20 to 27 of each year as the week to commemorate 
the victims of genocide.
<P>
	I must point out that the suggested date coincides with the sad 
anniversary of the first great genocide of the twentieth century, 
that of the Armenian people in April 1915, when more than one 
million people were killed. In fact, the purpose of the 
amendment I will move later on will be to express what is 
implicit in this motion.
<P>
	I would like to quote what was said by a survivor of this 
genocide, Aram P. Aivazian, who wrote an important book 
entitled: <I>Armenia usurped by genocide and treachery</I>. This book 
describes the horror of this crime against humanity and 
subsequent government denials. Mr. Aivazian wrote:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``As a survivor in Canada, I am left with a daily echo of these 
memories, the brutally ignored and shamelessly denied tragedy 
of the Armenian holocaust. The rest of humankind have their 
own places in the sun, but not my fellow exiled Armenians who 
lived under foreign flags, deported by brute force and massacred 
with no option to return to their enslaved homeland''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, these words could apply to all who have been 
exiled or deported from their homeland. The steadfast refusal to 
recognize the Armenian genocide, this first holocaust of the 
twentieth century, is an attitude we must condemn, because 
denying that it exists is the ultimate step in the process and 
constitutes a form of indirect support. Silence is a form of 
consent.
<P>
	This Liberal government, when it was in the opposition, 
supported recognition. Now that it is in power, it should, with 
the opposition's support, specifically condemn the Armenian 
genocide. However, this government now subordinates human 
rights to political and economic interests, which goes against 
traditional Canadian values.
<P>
	I want to remind my colleagues in this House that many 
political figures in Canada have come out in favour of 
recognizing the Armenian genocide. The hon. Marcel 
Prud'homme, now sitting as an independent in the Senate and 
former Liberal member for Saint-Denis, intervened twice in 
1990 and 1993, to ask the Conservative government to recognize 
the Armenian genocide.
<P>
	In March and April 1980, the Ontario Legislature and the 
Quebec National Assembly passed a resolution asking the 
Government of Canada to recognize and officially condemn this 
genocide and the atrocities committed by the Turkish 
government against the Armenian people.
<P>
	On May 11, 1984, the Hon. Sinclair Stevens rose in the House 
to recognize the existence of this genocide and to say that action 
was necessary. On May 27 and 28 1984, the hon. members for 
Edmonton Southeast and Willowdale, members of the present 
government, spoke to this House on the subject of the Armenian 
genocide.
<P>
	I shall, if I may, quote what was said by the hon. member for 
Edmonton Southeast:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``But the Armenian slaughter is an act of history and we 
cannot wipe clean for the Armenian descendants by pretending 
it never happened''.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Finally, in May 1985, in the Quebec National Assembly, 
Gérald Godin, who is recently deceased and who was, at the 
time, the Minister of Cultural Communities, reiterated his 
condemnation of the genocide.
<P>
	His motion was seconded by Claude Dauphin, the Liberal 
member for Marquette and by Thérèse Lavoie-Roux, who is 
now a Conservative senator. At the time, she said that, in 
international relations, because of economic and other ties 
Canada has with Turkey, the federal government was known to 
exercise extreme caution before taking any initiative. She added 
that the peoples' court, in Paris, had confirmed in a decision on 
April 16, 1984 that there had indeed been a genocide.
<P>
	Until people take more positive action to stop it, there will 
continue to be a sort of conspiracy of silence surrounding the 
genocide of the Armenian people. It must be brought to light; it 
must be given international recognition.
<P>
	<I>Le Devoir</I> of May 23, 1984 carried long extracts of a lecture 
given at McGill University by the former Minister of Justice of 
Quebec, Herbert Marx. It said, and I quote: ``After giving the 
background to the tragic events of 1915-16, Mr. Marx expressed 
his outrage at the fact that the genocide of the Armenian people 
was never officially recognized because of interventions by the 
Turkish government at the United Nations''.
<P>
	On April 20, 1994, I rose in this House, on behalf of the Bloc 
Quebecois, to call upon this government yet again to recognize 
this genocide.
<P>
	On April 22, 1994, two other members of this House made 
statements in this regard, including the hon. member for Don 
Valley North, who not only denounced the Armenian genocide 
but called on the Government of Canada to recognize it. He said, 
and I quote: ``-I call upon the Government of Canada to 
recognize and condemn the Armenian genocide and formally 
request the Turkish government to assume responsibility for this 
atrocity once and for all, as Germany did for the six million Jews 
in World War II''.
<P>
	Considering all these expressions of sympathy and 
declarations, how can we not recognize the existence of the 
genocide?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11378"> 11378 </A></B>
<P>
	On June 18, 1987, the European parliament recognized this 
genocide, as did the Russian parliament, more recently, on April 
22, 1994.
<P>
	For this reason, the hon. member's motion is so appropriate 
today. We should not forget such a crime against humanity. 
Canada should not side with countries which have chosen to 
forget and which are relying on time to wipe away the memories 
of it.
<P>
	On April 23, 1994 I and several other MPs attended a 
commemorative evening in Montreal, which drew several big 
political names. The guest speaker, Mr. Hrayr Balian, the 
permanent representative to the UN in Geneva of an NGO which 
defends human rights, said that the challenge facing the 
international community is prevention. The best prevention is 
ensuring that the persons responsible for past and current 
genocides be punished for their heinous crimes.
<P>
	He added that relations between Turkey and the Republic of 
Armenia cannot be based on ignorance and denial of the past. 
One of justice's basic goals is that the perpetrators of a crime be 
held responsible and that the rights of the victims be protected as 
much as possible. For there to be justice, the truth must be 
revealed, demonstrated and the guilty parties must admit their 
guilt.
<P>
	In this sense, I can only deplore the fact that the motion is not 
a votable item, and our party will support the petition made by 
the hon. member for Don Valley North that it be votable. We 
would also like to reiterate our support for the request that the 
Government of Canada specifically recognize the Armenian 
genocide.
<P>
	In closing, setting aside a week to commemorate victims of 
genocide is a step towards recognizing the Armenian genocide, 
and a real step towards preventing the reoccurrence of this kind 
of crime against humanity. To this end, I move, and the member 
for Frontenac seconds:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by adding the phrase ``particularly to mark the 
80th anniversary of the Armenian genocide'', after the word ``government'' 
and before the words ``should designate''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1125 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure today to speak on the motion of my 
esteemed colleague from Don Valley North. The motion is to 
recognize April 20 to 27 as a week to remember man's 
inhumanity to man and to recognize that genocide and violence 
must be condemned and not forgotten.
<P>
	Since the close of the cold war, people have expected that the 
world, liberated from nuclear threat, would be more peaceful. In 
fact, we expected a peace dividend that could strengthen our 
own economy and which could be used to bridge the huge chasm 
that exists between those of this world who have and those who 
have not.  However, as the years have shown, the reality has been 
much different.
<P>
	With the collapse of the U.S.S.R., ethnic tensions long 
suppressed have been unleashed. The rise of the nation states to 
fight over dwindling and finite resources, the exploding world 
population especially in developing countries and 
environmental degradation have all combined to unleash an 
orgy of violence and bloodshed which affects millions of people 
every year.
<P>
	More recently, Rwanda has seen half a million people killed 
within two months. Burundi has seen 100,000 people killed in 
one month. In Angola 1,000 people are killed per day. The 
situation in the former Yugoslavia which blew up and killed so 
many thousands is yet a tinderbox and can explode at any time. 
These are the more obvious examples.
<P>
	There are many more hidden, dirty little conflicts that 
occurred in the world to which the western world was oblivious, 
such as the Kurds in northern Iraq. In Sudan for years people 
have been killed. There was killing in East Timor and Sierra 
Leone. The list goes on and on. It is an embarrassment to the 
world community.
<P>
	If there is one thing the world has demonstrated in the face of 
this carnage, it is its impotence to deal with these situations and 
in fact, the precursors of these situations, even when the writing 
has been on the wall for so many years. The response of the 
international community has been a succession of collective 
sighs, groans and handwriting. The world does not get involved 
and when it does, it is too late for the thousands upon thousands 
of civilians who were killed.
<P>
	It is important to realize that it is not those who have arms 
who bear the brunt in these conflicts; it is the innocent men, 
women and children who are slaughtered indiscriminately and 
are defenceless. Once we do get involved, it is costly both in 
terms of our dollars and in terms of our people who we put in 
harm's way.
<P>
	Furthermore, the groundwork for future carnage has been 
laid, for in these civil conflicts hatreds will be branded into the 
psyches of generations to come. Children are told by their 
parents to hate Muslims, to hate Jews, to hate Chechens, to hate 
Tutsis, to hate Hindus, Tamils, Croats, and the list goes on. They 
in turn tell their children who tell their children and the cycle 
repeats itself with deadly efficiency. Memories are long for 
these carnages and hatred dies a difficult death.
<P>
	There were in fact over 120 conflicts in the world. In the 
future we can see the pots boiling over in Burundi, Nigeria, 
Sierra Leone and even in Kenya. Some only with extreme 
restraint have prevented this from occurring, such as in Tibet. 
The people there deserve a lot of credit.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11379"> 11379 </A></B>
<P>
	If there is not a radical change in the way foreign policy 
occurs in this world, there will be an increasing number of these 
conflicts. In fact, peaceful nations will exist as a sea among a 
river of blood and turmoil.
<P>
	Why should we get involved? Apart from the obvious 
humanitarian aspects, perhaps the easiest way to describe it to 
the people of our country and other countries is to preserve our 
basic self-interests. What occurs half a world away will wind up 
on our doorstep. Borders are porous and people migrate. They 
migrate from areas that have not to those that have, from areas in 
conflict to those which are peaceful, from areas which are 
resource depleted to areas which are rich in resources.
<P>
	People will come here in droves and our current economic 
situation is ill equipped to deal with it. Furthermore, it will 
affect our societal and economic situations so that we will not be 
able to help our own people and we will not be able to help those 
in have-not areas.
<P>
	We must have a plan. In short, what we must do is prevent the 
conflict before it happens. To prevent the problem we must 
understand it. I think it is wise for us to distil the problem down 
to its simplest form. We must simplify it down to its common 
denominator, which is the individual.
<P>
	All individuals must have their basic needs met. These 
include food, shelter, water, medical care. I would also add safe, 
effective birth control, education, good governance and a fair 
judicial system. When a person has all of these it is very difficult 
to incite someone to commit violence against other people.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	Therefore the world community must recognize the 
precursors of conflict and have a system to address them. Set up 
a list of transgressions by offending groups such as genocide, 
gross transgressions of human rights, the abuse of a country's 
economy, overt military spending, subjugating a people and 
trampling on their democratic rights. All of these have to be 
considered. With this list there should be another list of the 
consequences that the international community can mete out to 
these individuals.
<P>
	Despite all that has been said before, the United Nations is 
probably the best bet today. Diplomatic initiatives must be put 
forward: sanctions where necessary, along with decreasing 
non-humanitarian aid or eliminating it to those belligerents, 
using the IFI as an economic lever to force belligerents apart so 
that they have to solve their problems. Rather than solving them 
at the end of an assault rifle, solve them at the diplomatic table.
<P>
	I would also add a word of caution. We make a fundamental 
mistake in diplomacy. We ordinarily assume that those we are 
dealing with across the table actually represent the best interests 
of the people. That is not always the case. History has borne that 
out. Not all people have the best interests of all of their civilians 
at  heart; rather they often have the best interests of their 
specific tribe, and I use that in the broadest sense, at heart. It is 
important for us to realize that and to understand it when we go 
into these discussions.
<P>
	The world is looking for a leader to do this. It is looking for a 
middle power, one with an impeccable reputation, one with no 
history of imperialism or materialism, one with a proven track 
record and one that is widely respected. I would submit that that 
country is Canada. We can organize the middle powers to set up 
a system to influence the world body to prevent these conflicts 
from occurring, to set up those systems that I have just described 
of transgressions and penalties that need to be elucidated in no 
uncertain terms to the international body.
<P>
	The ultimate power to do this would be the United Nations. I 
have a few simple suggestions. Expand the security council to be 
the G-24; decisions on votes need a two-thirds majority; 
eliminate the power of veto; and, to help with the financial 
crisis, if you do not pay you do not vote, if you do not vote you 
do not have any power.
<P>
	These are some suggestions I have that we can put to the 
international community to help the United Nations deal with 
these problems.
<P>
	International aid must also be revamped to help people to help 
themselves in a sustainable fashion that is culturally sensitive. 
We must focus on the basic needs to enable people to provide for 
themselves if they are not going to go ahead and try to commit 
atrocities on other individuals and provoke the conflicts that 
have plagued us throughout our history for so long.
<P>
	I would also decrease government to government aid and 
increase the influence of NGOs. This would be in keeping with 
today's restricted budgets and the necessary cuts that must come 
from all aspects of government, including ODA.
<P>
	Having said all this I will close. Every year we commemorate 
the Holocaust and World War II and say never again. The reality 
is that never again occurs again and again and again. This is a 
tragedy from Angola to Burundi, to Cambodia, to Tibet, to the 
former Yugoslavia. These tragedies have occurred and 
frightened all of us.
<P>
	Mankind has continually demonstrated efficiency in 
committing atrocities against his fellow man with impugnity. 
The world has said nothing. We have learned nothing.
<P>
	I hope as we approach the new millennium that Canada can 
take it into its heart to realize that part of its grand destiny is to 
take a leadership role on the world stage to link those parts of the 
international community and construct a forceful, powerful, 
peaceful bulwark against those individuals and groups that wish 
to stir up conflict and stir up animosity.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos (Saint-Denis, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is a genuine honour for me to address the House today in support 
of this important motion. I commend my colleague, Mr. 
Assadourian, the member for Don Valley North, on his 
initiative.
<P>
	The twentieth century has seen two world wars and numerous 
historic conflicts, but crimes against humanity are still not 
relegated to the past, atrocities are still committed daily in too 
many countries, where civilians are subject to torture, 
enslavement and mass deportation. Every day, we witness the 
persecution of minorities because of political beliefs, race or 
religion. Although the Geneva Convention condemns such 
actions, they continue to take place.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Motion No. 282, introduced by the hon. member for Don 
Valley North, will bring Canada, as a member of the 
international community, one step closer to helping to eradicate 
from our world these unacceptable acts.
<P>
	It is essentially a moral question that we ask. Can we continue 
to be an active member of the international community and 
allow these atrocities to continue? I think not. We must first be 
able to internationally acknowledge that atrocities against 
humanity are unacceptable, then allow for the legislation to 
follow.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As representatives of a country renowned for its support of 
human rights, we know that Canadians condemn genocide and 
the use of violence as an instrument of power. By not 
recognizing such actions for what they are, we support them as 
national policy.
<P>
	It is a sad commentary that the media too often still can look 
to the horrors of crimes against humanity for their headlines.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A brief historical overview of only a few of these acts will 
give everyone the proof they need to acknowledge that these acts 
are criminal and should be condemned.
<P>
	The Armenian genocide which took place during the first 
world war is perhaps the most vivid example of genocide as an 
instrument of national policy by the Ottoman Turks. What 
makes the Armenian genocide such a particular example is that 
unlike the genocide of the Jewish people which took place 
during the second world war, the international community did 
not try the war criminals or even formally acknowledge the 
massacre took place.
<P>
	While several countries such as Italy, France and Israel have 
passed parliamentary decrees formally recognizing the 
Armenian genocide, the international community as a whole has 
not taken the steps necessary to condemn these horrible acts of 
inhumanity. There are unfortunately many examples of such 
atrocities, some well known, others such as the Asia Minor 
catastrophe of 1922, not so well known.
<P>
	By the end of the first world war there were close to two 
million Greeks inhabiting the region of Asia Minor on the west 
coast of present day Turkey. The Greek population has lived in 
this region for over 3,000 years. In 1922, these people, like the 
Armenians and other minorities of Turkey, were subjected to the 
first ethnic cleansing of the 20th century.
<P>
	During the summer of the tragic year, 600,000 Greeks of Asia 
Minor were exterminated by the forces of Mustapha Kemal, the 
father of modern Turkey. Another 1.5 million people were 
forced to leave their ancestral homes and then dubbed as 
refugees in Greece. These acts were not sporadic or spontaneous 
but a cold, calculated policy of the new Turkish state to establish 
an ethnically pure population. In this orchestrated act of mass 
murder, the Turkish government also burnt and destroyed 
thousands of churches, schools, even cities and towns that were 
identified with the Ioanian Greeks.
<P>
	These atrocities were witnessed by foreign diplomats, 
correspondents and thousands of individuals from every walk of 
life. The international community did nothing to condemn the 
atrocities taking place.
<P>
<B>(1140 ) </B>
<P>
	Although the United States, Britain, France and Italy had 
ships and troops stationed on the coast of Asia Minor, they 
refused to intervene. The failure of these countries to condemn 
the actions of the Turkish government encouraged other states to 
practise genocide as government policy. The Holocaust of the 
second world war offers the most graphic example of 
inhumanity by a modern state.
<P>
	In 1974, Turkey once again embarked on a course of action 
that led to the invasion and occupation of northern Cyprus. Once 
again the cycle of violence and destruction was an integral part 
of the Turkish policy. Thousands were killed during the invasion 
and approximately 200,000 Greek Cypriots were forced to 
abandon their homes and become refugees in their own country.
<P>
	I had the occasion to visit Cyprus this past January with some 
of my colleagues. We witnessed firsthand what is the reality of 
the Cypriots living in Cyprus. Over 1,600 missing persons are 
still unaccounted for.
<P>
	Turkey was condemned by the international community but 
except for peacekeeping, no action was taken to force the 
Turkish government to withdraw its occupation forces. Instead, 
the government in Ankara proceeded to establish a puppet 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11381"> 11381 </A></B>
<P>
Cypriot-Turkish state  and transplant thousands of Anatolian 
Turks to increase artificially the Turkish population of Cyprus.
<P>
	In northern Cyprus the Ankara government has made every 
effort to erase any traces of Cypriot cultural identity. This has 
not only destroyed the economy of northern Cyprus, it has 
practically eliminated the cultural heritage of the Greek-Cyriot 
community, a community that had developed a unique identity 
among the people of the Middle East and Asia. What was once a 
prosperous region and home to Greek and Turkish Cypriots, the 
northern part of the island has become an economic and cultural 
wasteland.
<P>
	Unchecked aggression only leads to further acts of barbarism 
and genocide. That is why we must all lend our support to 
Motion No. 282. In the last four years, we have witnessed the 
cataclysm that has befallen the former Yugoslavia. All the 
warring factions are guilty of mass killings, ethnic cleansing 
and cultural genocide to varying degrees but the cycle of 
violence has not stopped. We only need to look at the mass 
murders that have taken place in Somalia and Rwanda to 
confirm the fact.
<P>
	I add that as recently as two weeks ago, Turkey was bombing 
the Kurdish minorities in the northern part of Turkey. In all of 
these examples, the killing, destruction and forcible movement 
of populations have been acts of deliberate policy and not 
random excesses of rebel or uncontrolled government forces.
<P>
	By acknowledging these historical examples as crimes 
against humanity, we are acknowledging that past and present 
crimes are unacceptable. We must do our part as 
parliamentarians to encourage the international community to 
make greater efforts and prevent future crimes against 
humanity.
<P>
	By passing this motion, we are one step closer. In addition I 
ask the hon. members to adopt this motion with the amendment 
as a votable motion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
support Motion M-282 put forward by my colleague, the hon. 
member for Don Valley North, to designate the period from 
April 20 to 27 of each year as the week in which to 
commemorate and pay tribute to the victims of crimes against 
humanity and to strongly condemn such crimes, in particular the 
use of genocide and violence.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I congratulate my colleague from Don Valley North for this 
motion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I also support the amendment moved by my Bloc colleague 
for Ahuntsic. As you know, I immigrated from Chile in 1974 
following the September 11, 1973 coup d'état. More than 30,000 
Chilean men and women were killed or reported missing under 
General Pinochet's dictatorship. It was a very dark period in 
Chile's history. Opponents of the military regime fell victim to a 
kind of  genocide. Other dictatorships and civil wars in Latin 
American countries, including Argentina, El Salvador, Brazil 
and Uruguay, caused the death or disappearance of thousands of 
people. International organizations and global public opinion 
were powerless to stop these gross and flagrant abuses of human 
rights.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	Fortunately, all this is in the past and a wind of democracy is 
now blowing across Latin America. However, the people have 
demanded that their new democratic governments enact laws 
providing for prosecution of those responsible for these terrible 
crimes and compensation for the families of victims. In Chile, 
for instance, President Patricio Aylwin apologized on behalf of 
the government after publicly recognizing that such crimes had 
indeed been committed.
<P>
	It must be pointed out, however, that the efforts made to 
uncover the truth and punish those responsible for these actions 
have been rather limited so far. There must be no prescription 
for crimes against humanity. The UN must take more concrete 
initiatives in this area. Conventions have been signed but are not 
being enforced. A case in point is the current slaughter in the 
former Yugoslavia, which we are all powerless to stop or bring 
under control.
<P>
	In 1985, following the atrocities committed in several 
countries of the hemisphere, the Organization of American 
States adopted the Inter-American Convention Against Torture.
<P>
	Today, the OAS is more active in the area of human rights 
violations and tries to promote democracy as a means of 
preventing such violations in the future. But these efforts need 
to be stepped up and Canada, which joined the OAS in 1990, can 
do much more in that regard. The international community 
cannot and must not tolerate these violations of international 
law. We must learn from past mistakes and the inhumanity 
displayed by certain countries, governments and military or 
police forces.
<P>
	I rose in this House on numerous occasions to denounce the 
genocide in Rwanda in 1993 and 1994. On the eve of the 21st 
century, it is unthinkable and intolerable that such situations 
continue to occur.
<P>
	Canada must do its share, following the civil war in Rwanda, 
notably by taking in refugees. So far, according to my 
information, ICSI has not processed more than a hundred 
refugee claims. It is obvious that Canada is not rising to the 
occasion with respect to Rwanda.
<P>
	And unless the international community, and the UN in 
particular, mobilizes, the same thing is bound to happen in 
Burundi, where thousands have died already and many more are 
fleeing, mostly women and children.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11382"> 11382 </A></B>
<P>
	We must ensure that the same atrocities that were observed in 
Rwanda are not repeated in Burundi.
<P>
	Both before and after being elected to this place, I have 
repeatedly denounced the Armenian genocide of 1915-16, in 
which more than one million were killed.
<P>
	I take this opportunity to, once again, show solidarity with the 
Armenian community in Quebec and Canada, a community of 
which the hon. member for Don Valley North is a member. I 
congratulate him on his excellent work on that issue.
<P>
	Also, I rise in my place to denounce most vigorously the 
crimes committed by the Nazis against the Jews in the Second 
World War.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	All present or future generations must remember the 
holocaust in which six million Jews were exterminated. In a few 
weeks, we will be commemorating the anniversary of the 
Holocaust. I will take part in the ceremonies marking that day 
and, on behalf of all Bloc Quebecois members, we will, once 
again, denounce the slaughter of European Jews during the 
Second World War.
<P>
	I also take this opportunity to tell the Jewish community how 
much we appreciate their tremendous contribution to Canadian 
and Quebec society at every level, whether economic, political, 
cultural or social.
<P>
	I hope that the international community will work relentlessly 
to ensure that no horrible crimes of the sort are ever committed 
again.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in this debate today. I want to commence my 
remarks by complimenting my colleague, the hon. member for 
Don Valley North. His ideas and contributions since he became a 
member of Parliament, particularly in the area of international 
human rights, are truly appreciated.
<P>
	All of the speakers this morning have talked of the horror of 
genocide. We all know that there is common international 
condemnation for violations of humanitarian law. Of these 
violations, genocide is the gravest of all crimes recognized at 
international law. Indeed, in light of the evidence of the acts of 
genocide committed by the Nazis in World War II, the 
Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of 
Genocide was signed by Canada on November 2, 1948 and has 
been in force since December 2, 1950. Over 100 members of the 
United Nations are parties to the convention, which creates a 
binding, legal obligation for contracting parties to punish 
persons responsible for genocide.
<P>
	In the convention, genocide is defined as any of the following 
acts committed with intent to destroy in whole or in part a 
national, ethnic, racial or religious group as such: killing 
members of the group; causing serious bodily or mental harm to 
members of the group; deliberately inflicting on the group 
conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical 
destruction in whole or in part; imposing measures intended to 
prevent births within the group; and forcibly transferring 
children of the group to another group.
<P>
	Canada has long been a leader internationally in the defence 
of human rights and promotion of humanitarian law. As a 
signatory to the genocide convention, Canada has undertaken to 
punish persons for genocidal acts committed in time of peace 
and in time of war.
<P>
	Genocide is the worst of crimes. It commonly takes the form 
of murders, disappearances, torture, arbitrary imprisonment and 
exile, and often it is committed by governments or rebel groups 
against its opponents or ethnic and religious minorities. Recent 
events in the world have demonstrated that genocidal acts are 
still commonplace.
<P>
	Most recently, compliance with the obligation to punish 
persons responsible for genocide has been facilitated by the 
creation of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former 
Yugoslavia, established by the UN Security Council. The 
international tribunal, though not established in the context of 
the genocide convention, is an international penal tribunal as 
contemplated by article VI of the convention. Article IV of the 
tribunal statute gives its jurisdiction over the crime of genocide 
committed in the former Yugoslavia.
<P>
	We are strongly committed to the international tribunal and to 
ensuring that all those responsible for the atrocities of genocide 
are brought to justice. We were one of the first countries to call 
for an international war crimes tribunal and a Canadian is one of 
the 11 judges elected by the UN last fall. A former member of 
the National Defence Judge Advocate General's Office is 
working as the international law adviser to the prosecutor's 
office, and Canada has contributed over $500,000 to the UN 
Commission of Experts and to the tribunal. In order to assist the 
tribunal in its investigations, Canada is in the process of 
attempting to locate victims and witnesses of war crimes who 
have resettled in this country.
<P>
	The United Nations Security Council is also considering 
establishing a tribunal for Rwanda along the lines of the 
international tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. This tribunal 
would be responsible for investigating and prosecuting those 
persons responsible for the genocide and other atrocities that 
occurred in Rwanda earlier this year. Again, we support the 
establishment of this tribunal, which, for the reasons of 
consistency and administrative convenience, would have links 
to the Yugoslav tribunal.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11383"> 11383 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	In the same spirit, Canada is committed to the creation of a 
permanent international criminal court that would have 
jurisdiction for the most serious crimes, including genocide.
<P>
	The report on the draft statute for the court, submitted by the 
International Law Commission after receiving comments from 
many states, including Canada, is being debated at the United 
Nations sixth committee this fall. In its intervention at the 
debate, Canada called for the holding of a diplomatic conference 
next year to establish a treaty, which would create a permanent 
court with a series of preparatory committees leading up to the 
conference. Canada intends to fully participate in the 
conference and provide support for the court once it is 
established.
<P>
	At the domestic level we have responded to international 
obligations by amending domestic laws to give Canadian courts 
the jurisdiction to try persons charged with committing 
genocidal acts. Genocidal acts can be prosecuted in Canada 
using the provisions of the Criminal Code. The definition of war 
crimes and crimes against humanity in the code make 
punishable in Canada many of the acts defined as constituting 
genocide in the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment 
of the Crime of Genocide. Whether the genocidal acts could be 
prosecuted as war crimes or crimes against humanity depends on 
the circumstances of each case.
<P>
	The Criminal Code can apply to acts committed in the past as 
long as at the time and place of commission they were 
considered as international crimes. The criminal courts of 
Canada have jurisdiction if the accused is found in Canada and 
where international law would recognize universal jurisdiction 
by any state over the offence.
<P>
	The Department of Justice crimes against humanity and war 
crimes section has the mandate with the RCMP to investigate 
and prosecute cases of genocide committed and prosecutable in 
such circumstances.
<P>
	Therefore, Canada will not be a haven for the architects of 
genocide and will use all the legal remedies available to it to 
ensure that those who come to Canada are brought to justice. Not 
only does the Criminal Code provide for the prosecution of 
genocidal acts, but it also creates an indictable offence of 
advocating or promoting genocide, genocide being defined as 
killing members of any identifiable group or deliberately 
inflicting on it conditions of life calculated to bring about its 
physical destruction with intent to destroy in whole or in part 
that group.
<P>
	I strongly believe that people of the world should be permitted 
to live in peace and security, free to speak their language, 
practise their customs and associate with one another. Those 
responsible for enormous crimes against groups deserve to be 
prosecuted and, if convicted, punished to the full extent of the 
law. In Canada, I am proud to say that we have both the legal 
framework and the moral and political conviction to do so.
<P>
	My colleague for Don Valley North wants to designate a week 
for commemorating genocide. I believe genocide is so horrible 
that the memory of past genocides will always be with us. We 
should always be aware of genocides currently being committed 
and we should always be on the lookout for acts that could lead 
to more of this horrible crime. The commemoration of past 
genocides must not distract us from new ones.
<P>
	For this reason, while I share the member's indignation at the 
most horrible crime against humankind, I must say that I would 
be concerned if we were to designate a particular period of time 
for commemorating genocide. Genocide should be a 
preoccupation in our daily lives. No particular week should be 
needed to remind us about the human tragedy of genocide.
<P>
	In conclusion, I am proud that Canada does have the legal 
means necessary to deal with this crime both internationally and 
domestically. While I support the spirit of the hon. member's 
motion, I must in this case be against it.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There are still approximately three 
minutes left in the debate. Does anyone else wish to rise to speak 
on the matter?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Assadourian:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to take a few minutes 
to thank those who supported my motion. I really feel that this 
motion was an important one for Canadians and for the people 
who suffered from crimes against humanity.
<P>
	However, I especially want to express my sincere 
appreciation to members of the governing Liberal Party who 
supported it, the members of the opposition and also members of 
the Reform Party. He who runs away may live to fight another 
day.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="BUDGETIMPLEMENTATIONACT,1995">BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 1995</A></H3>
	The House resumed from March 31, consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-76, an act to implement certain provisions of 
the budget tabled in Parliament on February 27, 1995, be read 
the second time and referred to a committee; and of the 
amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first 
I want to say that I agree with my two colleagues, the hon. 
member for Ahuntsic and the hon. member for Bourassa. 
Indeed, we all know Armenians who directly or indirectly 
experienced the hardship suffered by that nation.
<P>
	Let us now turn our attention to Bill C-76, which was 
carefully reviewed by our critic, the hon. member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, who knows a great deal about public 
finances, particularly at the federal level. Bill C-76 seeks to 
implement certain provisions of the budget tabled by the 
Minister of Finance. I want to discuss the impact of that budget 
on the agricultural industry, which is one of the most seriously 
affected.
<P>
	The proposed cuts are far from having an equal impact on the 
various regions of the country. The Liberal government has 
abdicated its responsibility toward the agricultural sector. It is 
abandoning one of the most dynamic industries in Canada and in 
Quebec. The agri-food sector accounts for close to 10 per cent 
of our GDP, 15 per cent of the total employment, and almost 25 
per cent of the surplus of goods. Between 1987-88 and 1994-95, 
the Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food's estimates was 
reduced by a whopping 33 per cent, and that includes the 
subsidies provided under the WGTA. We are talking about a 33 
per cent reduction in financial resources; this is one third of the 
total budget over a five-year period.
<P>
	If you look a little farther down the road, it is estimated that, 
by 1997-98, the agriculture and agri-food budget will have 
diminished by 58 per cent. This is ridiculous. This morning, I 
was looking at a publication called <I>Farm and Country</I>, which is 
sent to Ontario farmers. The cartoon on the front page showed a 
beautiful Holstein cow with a farmer sitting on his little stool 
and trying to milk the cow. But nothing was coming out.
<P>
	If this government continues to slash in that sector, this could 
well be the fate of Canada's agriculture and agri-food industry.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	As a percentage of total government spending, amounts 
allocated for agriculture have dropped dramatically. In 
1987-88, the total budget for agricultural and agri-food, as a 
percentage of the budget for all government envelopes, was 3.5 
per cent under the  Conservative government. In 1994-95, the 
fiscal year that ended yesterday, it was 1.6 per cent. In 1997-98, 
it is expected to be only 1.2 per cent.
<P>
	This government seems to have cut itself off completely from 
the agricultural sector. We have said so before and we will say it 
again: it is outrageous to treat the agricultural industry this way.
<P>
	If we look at the kind of cuts that will be made, it is clear the 
government does not have its priorities straight. Furthermore, it 
is not prepared to deal with the problems and consider the long 
term impact. Bill C-76 repeals the Western Grain 
Transportation Act, the WGTA. The legislation will be replaced 
by a series of measures that will continue to regulate grain 
transportation, despite elimination of the Crow Rate.
<P>
	Included in this budget is compensation for western producers 
who are affected by this cut. The government intends to offer 
$1.6 billion to owners of farm land, to partially offset the drop in 
land values that will result.
<P>
	Interestingly, even if a producer did not grow wheat during 
the past year, he will be entitled to compensation. I see the hon. 
member for Brome-Missisquoi across the way. I am anxious to 
see whether he will react to this injustice, in a country where we 
now have two classes of farmers: those who are compensated to 
the tune of $1.6 billion, not taxable, while dairy producers in his 
own riding will suffer cuts averaging $4,485 and get absolutely 
nothing.
<P>
	Yesterday, he was in Cowansville, the riding of 
Brome-Missisquoi, to sing the praises of his government's 
policies. I assume he did not say a word about the unfair 
treatment of our Quebec farmers as opposed to western farmers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> For shame.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Yes, for shame, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	During his election campaign, he said he would speak out, 
loud and clear, for Quebec and for the riding of 
Brome-Missisquoi. However, he has kept a very low profile, 
not bothering to speak out even once to defend the interests of 
the farmers in the riding of Brome-Missisquoi, a riding that 
has so many outstanding farms.
<P>
	As I said before, not a penny of tax will be collected on those 
$1.6 billion. And in addition to the $1.6 billion, there is another 
$300 million, but the government does not even know how it 
will spend it. Nevertheless, an additional $300 million has been 
provided, to be included in the budget over the next five years.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	Every time we see an example of inequity or injustice, we 
intend to rise in this House and vigorously condemn the 
government. And I urge my colleagues from Quebec to avoid a 
recurrence of what happened last week, when Quebec's 
entitlement to its fair share of seats in Parliament was attacked 
and to rise in the House and say  no, we will not go below 25 per 
cent. The hon. member for Brome-Missisquoi rose in the 
House and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11385"> 11385 </A></B>
<P>
was applauded by his anglophone colleagues when he joined in 
the attack on his own Quebec.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in the debate today. As I commence my 
remarks, may I add a special word of congratulations to one of 
our newest colleagues, the hon. member for 
Brome-Missisquoi. We are particularly delighted to have him 
here in the House of Commons to speak so clearly for the people 
of his riding and for les gens du Québec.
<P>
	The Liberal government has introduced a budget that reflects 
what Canadians want. We are aware of the current economic 
realities and we have made choices. They were tough choices. 
However, the choices not only get government right, they get the 
economy right.
<P>
	We stated our promises in the red book and we have acted on 
them. The economy is growing. New full time jobs are being 
created and we continue to move forward without compromising 
our integrity or our history. We simply will not tear apart the 
social fabric that keeps us together. That being said, it does not 
mean that the social fabric does not have to fit a bit tighter and a 
bit smaller than it used to.
<P>
	Canadians have said they want less government, fewer 
personal taxes and more fiscal responsibility. This is a 
check-list. It is a list that we not only read but implemented in 
our budget.
<P>
	The budget takes fundamental action across government 
programs and operations. It implements a comprehensive 
examination of departmental spending. Our focus will be on 
what is essential. What government does best it will continue to 
do. What government does not do best it will see that there is a 
way in which the private sector can take over. We will continue 
to utilize our resources in the most effective and efficient 
manner.
<P>
	We are not living in the surplus 1960s. For some of us who had 
our political beliefs and, to some degree, our characters formed 
in those surplus 1960s, it has been a difficult adjustment, but it is 
one we have made. We must operate our programs with 
accountability and with conscience. We simply cannot afford to 
have overlap and redundancy within government programs.
<P>
	However, spending cuts will be made with compassion. They 
will be made protecting the most vulnerable. Fairness will be the 
hallmark and it will ensure that all regions of Canada, all 
Canadians, everyone who lives in this, the greatest country on 
earth, will share the burden.
<P>
	Canadians said they were over-burdened by taxes and could 
not afford another increase. The Liberal government listened. 
There has been no increase in personal income tax. We can 
understand the financial burden that Canadians are facing 
because each one of us in this House faces it as well, and we 
refuse to increase their load.
<P>
	The budget incorporates some tough choices, but it does not 
forgo compassion, nor does it lack vision. The Canadian vision 
will continue to glow with strength, opportunity and prosperity.
<P>
	Over the past year and a half we have seen the creation of 
433,000 full time jobs. We have seen a decrease in the 
unemployment rate of 1.7 per cent. We have observed the 
strongest growth rate in six years, at 4.5 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1215 ) </B>
<P>
	This is only the beginning. It can be seen that the Liberal 
government has listened to Canadians. We have implemented a 
budget which reflects the economic realities of our time and also 
offers hope for a prosperous future. I will mention just some of 
the things this budget has done.
<P>
	It has cut business subsidies by 60 per cent. It promised a 
smaller public service with 45,000 fewer positions. That is 
something of great concern in my own riding of Halifax which is 
the third largest public service town in Canada.
<P>
	There have been major reforms of programs such as 
agriculture and transport. Programs have been merged, 
consolidated and commercialized. There is increased cost 
recovery. Again, this is an area about which I am very 
concerned, that is, in the department of immigration with the 
new right of landing fee of $975 per adult immigrant.
<P>
	There is the new Canada social transfer to the provinces in 
1996-97. Unemployment insurance reform will be in place by 
July 1, 1996. There is a course charted for public pension system 
reform to make it fairer and more sustainable in the long term.
<P>
	Tax fairness as I mentioned before will be improved. There 
will be tighter rules for tax deferrals, foreign and family trusts 
and R and D incentives. New measures to ensure the collection 
of taxes owed is a measure the hon. Minister of National 
Revenue has already spoken about quite eloquently.
<P>
	RRSP contribution limits will be reduced. Retiring allowance 
rollovers are phased out. Overcontribution allowances are cut. 
There will be higher taxes for corporations and large banks. 
There will be dramatic cuts in departmental budgets. Some will 
be halved in a three year period.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11386"> 11386 </A></B>
<P>
	There are $7 in expenditure reductions for every $1 in new tax 
revenues. There will be a three year savings of $29 billion, $25.3 
billion of these from these expenditure cuts.
<P>
	It is quite clear the government has followed its promises both 
in the red book and in the speech from the throne. It is quite clear 
the Minister of Finance listened, as did his cabinet colleagues. 
They listened to Canadians and they acted upon the 
consultations.
<P>
	It is quite clear the Prime Minister and the Government of 
Canada stand together in supporting a smaller and more efficient 
government but also a government that will remain fair, true to 
its roots and true to its history.
<P>
	I am delighted that I can stand and say without reservation 
that I think the majority of Canadians support Bill C-73, an act 
to provide borrowing authority for the fiscal year beginning 
April 1, 1995. They know their government is working for 
Canadians and will continue to do so.
<P>
	These times are not easy. They are not easy for civil servants. 
They are not easy for workers across this country. They are not 
easy even perhaps for members of Parliament. But Canada is a 
country with a huge and tremendous and glowing future 
provided that we have good stewardship. It is my belief that this 
government, this Prime Minister, this Minister of Finance and 
this cabinet provide this kind of stewardship.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, today I 
will deal with three aspects of the 1995 Liberal budget and Bill 
C-76, an act to implement certain provisions of the budget.
<P>
	First, I will outline the cuts in agriculture spending and make 
some general comments on the cuts. Second, I will ask some 
questions on behalf of Canadian farmers about what will follow 
the WGTA. These questions and many others have been asked 
over the months since this budget was tabled in the House. 
Third, I will discuss how the shortcomings in the overall budget 
might affect farmers and the agri-food industry.
<P>
	First, how do the cuts in agriculture spending compare to the 
cuts in other sectors of federal government spending? How do 
the cuts on payments to farmers compare to cuts in operating 
costs of the department itself?
<P>
<B>(1220 ) </B>
<P>
	Farmers have obviously been asked to shoulder an unfair 
portion of the spending cuts in this budget. I am not saying the 
cuts should have been the same percentage in all areas of 
government spending, but by any measure, agriculture was hit 
disproportionately hard. Had cuts been made in other sectors in 
a fair way, this would have produced a balanced budget and all 
the positives that go along with a balanced budget. To illustrate 
this point, I will give a brief summary of the cuts in agriculture 
spending.
<P>
	In the agriculture department overall spending was cut by 
about 20 per cent. Total funds available for 1994-95 are $2.1 
billion. There was a $445 million cut in spending in this budget 
to the agriculture department. These cuts came in safety net 
funding, subsidies to dairy farmers, research, and user pay fees 
for inspections and those types of things. As well, there were 
some cuts in the department itself.
<P>
	There are also cuts in agriculture from the transport 
department. The Crow rate, $560 million a year, was the largest 
single cut to farmers and is effective July 31, 1995. The Atlantic 
Feed Freight Assistance Act and the Maritime Freight Rates Act 
will be eliminated by July 31, 1995. The cost for this subsidy 
was $99 million a year.
<P>
	To summarize, the total cuts in agriculture spending from the 
transport department are approximately $660 million a year by 
the end of the third year. Total cuts to agriculture spending from 
the agriculture department itself are $445 million per year. Total 
cuts to agriculture spending in this year's budget are 
approximately $1.1 billion. By any measure, this is 
disproportionately weighted toward agriculture.
<P>
	When the cuts in agriculture spending from transport and the 
agriculture department are combined, the reduced spending to 
farmers is 40 per cent in this budget. There is almost 50 per cent 
in cuts in payments when payments to the railways and direct 
payments to farmers are included.
<P>
	How do the cuts to farmers outlined in this budget compare to 
the cuts in the operations of the agriculture department? The 
cuts in the agriculture department were 20 per cent compared to 
almost 50 per cent in cuts in the direct payments to farmers and 
the railways on the farmers' behalf. There is no balance when 
comparing those cuts.
<P>
	I am not saying these cuts should not have been made. Rather, 
there should have been more balance across all sectors of 
government spending when compared to spending on the 
operations of the department itself. Later I will talk about the 
negative effects of the government not going far enough in this 
budget.
<P>
	Farmers also needed a transition time to adjust to these cuts. 
For example, Reform proposed a trade distortion adjustment 
program nearly five years ago. This would have provided a 
gradual phase out of the WGTA benefit, putting the payment 
immediately to farmers so they could provide for the loss in the 
WGTA payment as was needed. It would have also provided for 
a fund to compensate farmers against unfair trade practices in 
other countries.
<P>
	This transition time was desperately needed by farmers so 
farmers would have time to make the necessary changes in order 
to recoup the losses suffered as a result of this budget. Not only 
is there no transition time, but there are not enough substantial 
changes to allow farmers and agribusiness to become more 
efficient.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11387"> 11387 </A></B>
<P>
	Some changes were made but they did not go far enough. For 
example, in branch line abandonment, the reductions that will 
be allowed are limited and uncertain. In car allocation, the 
method used will be based on historic allocation. That does not 
provide well for the changes which are needed to make this 
system more efficient. The Canadian Wheat Board will still be a 
government controlled body instead of a farmer controlled body 
which is what it should be and what farmers want it to be.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	Payouts will be made to farmers under this budget. First, in 
regard to the WGTA there will be a $1.6 billion compensation 
package. The stated intent is to compensate farmers for a loss in 
land value which will result from the loss of this $560 million a 
year subsidy. When we examine this it allows for about a one 
and a half to a two year transition time for grain farmers. It is too 
short a transition time. There would also be a $300 million 
transition fund but we do not know where it will be spent and 
how it will be used. There is too much uncertainty.
<P>
	In feed freight assistance the payment is eliminated entirely 
but there will be a $326 million transportation adjustment 
program. Again, it will be paid out over five years. The detail 
beyond that does not exist. The uncertainty is unacceptable.
<P>
	Governments have talked a lot about trying to help stabilize 
the agriculture industry. It seems to me that they have caused a 
lot of uncertainty and instability. That is certainly the case with 
this budget. More questions have been left unanswered than 
have been answered.
<P>
	I want to ask some of the questions which have been asked of 
me by western Canadian farmers over the past month. They 
concern the loss of the Crow benefit payment and how the 
payment will be made. Other questions concern the 
compensation and transition packages.
<P>
	The stated purpose of the $1.6 billion WGTA payout is to 
compensate farmers for a loss in land value resulting from a loss 
of this benefit. If this is the intent, then why would the payment 
not be made on all farmland? If grain land loses its value, then 
would not other land lose its value as well?
<P>
	Why did the minister call on owners and lenders to pass the 
payment on to renters and lessees? This seems inconsistent with 
the government's stated intent which was to compensate for the 
reduced land value. If the real intent on the other hand is to 
provide transition funding to grain farmers, then why is this not 
acknowledged and why is the payment not structured 
accordingly?
<P>
	There is a second area of questions I will ask on behalf of 
farmers. Does the minister have any advice for renters or those 
leasing land and who are part way through a lease or rental 
agreement right now? These farmers will be caught paying up to 
$35 an acre more in freight costs for crops they will be seeding 
over the next two months.  Because of crop rotations and 
herbicide planning, it will be difficult to make the appropriate 
adjustments in crop seeding to help reduce the added costs by 
changing to higher value, lower volume crops or indeed moving 
more into livestock and growing feed or providing pasture for 
livestock.
<P>
	Does the minister feel it is reasonable to make a policy change 
which will have the magnitude of impact with virtually no 
transition time and no transition funding? That is the case for 
lessees and land renters. I am sure there are thousands of farmers 
renting land, and many in the minister's own riding I would 
suggest, who are looking for advice on how to deal with this 
unanticipated extra cost. I doubt very much they will be looking 
to the minister for this advice.
<P>
	The third area of questions farmers have asked over the past 
month since the budget and indeed before it also has to do with 
the WGTA and the loss of that benefit. I have several questions 
to ask on behalf of western grain farmers regarding how the 
payment will be calculated and when the payment or payments 
will be made.
<P>
	The budget implementation bill does state that payment will 
be based on 1994 acres seeded to grains and an adjustment will 
reflect historic productivity. This leaves many questions 
unanswered.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	For example, how will historic productivity be determined? If 
the payment is based on 1994 grain acres, those who have been 
moving acres from forage to grain land in a rotation may be 
completely missed in terms of a payout. People who read the 
market signals and who made the appropriate moves could be 
completely missed by this payment through no fault of their 
own. The last question is when will farmers receive their 
payment or payments?
<P>
	Another area is what measures will be taken to allow the 
system to become more efficient and to give farmers more 
flexibility in marketing. I have seen very little evidence this 
exists.
<P>
	The Liberal government by not going far enough in the budget 
will make life for Canadian farmers very difficult. Cuts in 
agriculture are not matched in any way by cuts in other areas of 
federal spending. As well, changes which would allow farmers 
to make up for some of the losses in payments from government, 
or which would allow farmers to cut costs, are inadequate. 
Changes that would allow farmers more direct access to markets 
are non-existent.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11388"> 11388 </A></B>
<P>
	The inadequacies in the budget will make the next few years 
very difficult for farmers. However, there is another overriding 
factor which if not dealt with quickly will make the future most 
difficult for farmers, other business people and all Canadians. 
This overriding factor is the continual increase in interest 
payments on the debt. Interest payments on the debt have 
increased from $39 billion a year, when the government took 
office, to $51 billion with the finance minister's own figures, an 
unacceptable increase in levels.
<P>
	What this will mean to farmers is more cutbacks next year and 
beyond, higher than necessary interest rates, little hope of 
reducing input costs to help compensate for increased freight 
costs, losses in government payments and more uncertainty 
regarding the future of social programs. Farmers will face these 
extra costs and difficulties because the budget does not set a 
definite date for eliminating the deficit.
<P>
	I have provided a summary of the cuts in agriculture. I have 
asked some of the yet unanswered questions regarding the 
WGTA payout. I have outlined the major, overriding factor, 
interest payments on the debt, which threatens farmers in so 
many ways.
<P>
	Farmers need some answers in order to provide certainty in 
their lives. I am asking the government to give some answers 
which will allow certainty to replace the instability and 
uncertainty farmers will feel and have felt as a result of the 
budget.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
budget was tough, but fair.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Most commentators have indicated that is what the last budget 
was all about, tough but fair. That is quite a feat when one looks 
at the country, the extent of the various groups represented. 
Provinces and the territories believe it has been fair to them 
overall. The regions are reacting positively in the sense that no 
region seems to have suffered more than others. Men and women 
are feeling as if neither one of the two groups has been 
disadvantaged over the other. There is some sensitivity to those 
who are both younger and older. There is as well a response in 
terms of reductions to Canadians at various levels of 
remuneration.
<P>
	I am proud that the Liberal Party has never claimed 
perfection. It wanted a good budget, if possible a very good 
budget. That is exactly what was accomplished.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	To be fair, opposition parties have done what they do best, 
criticize the budget. That is their role and I respect that role as I 
believe we all do. However, it would have been quite novel if 
they had not only criticized but made specific suggestions as to 
how it could have been improved. There is one exception, which 
I will speak to in some detail, where the Reform Party put 
forward a  budget. I will share with my colleagues and with 
Canadians what kind of response it was.
<P>
	One of the unfortunate realities about budgets and reductions 
is one cannot reduce or change without affecting people, 
unfortunately sometimes negatively. We have in the budget 
attempted to minimize the discomfort, the hurt and the negative 
impact. I will give a couple of examples with respect to the civil 
service. There are going to be massive reductions as a result of 
an analysis of those things the government feels it ought to 
continue to do to remove the duplication. There will be 
programs eliminated, some reduced, and some jobs will be lost.
<P>
	However, if one looks at the early retirement incentive, the 
early departure incentive, and the other initiatives undertaken 
by government to attempt to cushion the departures of those 
particular civil servants, one gets a good sense of how concerned 
we are to be fair and responsible.
<P>
	In spite of any number of programs, it is quite clear it does not 
remove the hurt or the disappointment. That is unfortunate but it 
is reality. To think one can come forward with a budget that 
somehow would undertake some significant changes and yet not 
have any impact whatsoever less than positive would be 
dreaming in technicolour.
<P>
	In a recent poll 73 per cent of Reform Party supporters 
thought the Liberal budget was a move in the right direction. 
This is really astonishing.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Can you imagine, Mr. Speaker, that 73 per cent of supporters 
of the Reform Party, which had wanted to go much, much farther 
than the government, nevertheless felt that the budget was a 
move in the right direction?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The budget is a result in large part of an analysis of the 
programs government was involved in and decisions made to 
either remove those programs or reduce them substantially 
because we recognize there was significant duplication.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	My colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois make frequent reference 
to overlap and duplication. This budget represents an 
extraordinary effort to eliminate much of it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Hundreds of appointments have been reduced as a result of 
this. We have talked about the reduction to the civil service 
which is important and extremely difficult. There have been 
many other reductions and cuts.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11389"> 11389 </A></B>
<P>
	Rather than applaud the budget-as a member of the 
government I would be expected to be supportive-I want to 
share some of the things said by third parties, people who are not 
part of the government.
<P>
	Jayson Myers of the Canadian Manufacturers' Association 
said he was impressed and applauds the minister for what he has 
done. Ghislain Dufour, Conseil du patronat, said it is a good 
budget. Peter Wolford, Retail Council of Canada, said it is a 
good budget on several fronts. Sherry Cooper, economist with 
Burns Fry, said it is a terrific budget, there is no smoke and 
mirrors.
<P>
	Stephen Von Houten, Canadian Manufacturers' Association, 
said it is really the first serious attempt at deficit reduction we 
have seen in this country in a long time. ``He has more than met, 
if not exceeded, the market's expectations'', said another 
observer, a person not part of the government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I could go on quoting. I will, however, add only two or three 
more so that the people listening will get an idea of the breadth 
of the budget's acceptance.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	For example, ``Serious action was necessary and, remarkably, 
the government took it. After years of tinkering, making minor 
adjustments, and across-the-board cuts, the federal government 
finally had the political courage to tackle the problem in a direct 
way'', Peter Boswell, columnist and political science professor 
at Memorial University.
<P>
	``In attacking the deficit by reducing spending, one must take 
care to take aim only at waste and not at productive government 
expenditures. Well-targeted cuts, like those in the budget, will 
not put a brake on growth'', editorial comment, <I>La Presse</I>.
<P>
	I conclude with this quote: ``While the opposition parties 
twist and turn in the wind, Mr. Chrétien quietly and effectively 
stays the course-the most popular prime minister in many a 
year, at a time when public mistrust of politicians is epidemic''.
<P>
	So many people have expressed their support for the budget. 
So many people have said that, for the first time, the budget was 
heading in the right direction. As I said earlier, this is not a 
perfect budget. There is no perfection in this world. This is, 
however, a budget that is moving in the right direction and one 
that has been accepted by the vast majority of Canadians in the 
provinces, the territories and the regions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This is the first time since there have been these kinds of 
statistics that there are more people in favour of the budget, who 
see it as a positive measure, than there are against. That is quite 
an accomplishment.
<P>
	Subsequent to the budget the Liberals increased their 
popularity with Canadians to 60 per cent from 55 per cent, while 
all other political parties decreased in popularity, with the 
exception of one which increased by 1 per cent.
<P>
	The Reform Party put out a budget. If one looks at media 
quotations on that budget, they show quite a contrast. I will not 
have time to read them all, which disappoints me because some 
of them are very good.
<P>
	Shane McCune of the Vancouver <I>Province</I> wrote on February 
22, 1995: ``A 57-page document from the Grumpy and Dopey 
school of finance-comic in its stupidity and tragic in its 
meanness''. ``The proposals are very simplistic and little more 
than playing with arithmetic,'' said John Bulloch, president of 
the Canadian Federation of Independent Business. He criticized 
Reform's detailed plans, particularly its proposal to cut $3.4 
billion from UI.
<P>
	Professor John Loxley said: ``The Reform Party's economic 
analysis is horrendous and completely ignores basic principles 
of budgeting''. An editorial in the Vancouver <I>Province</I> reads: 
``It's also vague on details and big on assumptions where it suits 
Reform. Unfortunately that's the whole problem with the 
document. It suits Reform, but how about Canada?''
<P>
	``It would be nice if we could cite just one way in which 
Reform is helping the country or itself by producing such an 
incomplete and controversial alternate budget at this time. Alas, 
we draw blanks'', wrote Stewart MacLeod of the <I>Guardian</I>. An 
editorial in the Vancouver <I>Sun</I> reads: ``Reform's vision 
represents return to the law of the jungle where it's everyone for 
himself or herself and the devil take the hindmost''.
<P>
	The Montreal <I>Gazette</I>: ``In his zeal to drive a stake through 
the deficit's heart, leader Preston Manning just may take the 
country with it. He's taking the easy way out, the lion's share of 
the cuts as aimed at those who can't fight back''. A further quote 
reads: ``Empowerment seems to be a word for whatever a 
Reform government wants to impose on a group of citizens. 
Seniors, for example, are to be empowered by reducing 
pensions''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I conclude my remarks by further stressing that, 
while the budget is clearly not perfect, it is moving in the right 
direction.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We are already starting to build next year's budget and I invite 
all of my colleagues to pitch in and make it an even better 
budget.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the 
budget is really heading in the right direction as my colleague 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11390"> 11390 </A></B>
<P>
across the way claims, ordinary people have every reason to be 
very worried, because in reality this  budget is two-faced. And 
when I use this expression, I mean it in the usual sense.
<P>
	This budget says two different things, depending on the 
people or groups involved: Quebecers or the rest of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	The government said that the budget promotes flexibility and 
would satisfy Quebec's desire for decentralization.
<P>
	However, in some cases, why were the people who had 
believed the promises of flexibility and decentralization so 
surprised by Bill C-76, which was supposed to make it possible 
to implement the promises made in the budget? I will read to you 
clause 48, which amends what is referred to in my version, the 
first version of the bill, as the Canada Health and Social 
Transfer. I will allow myself to dwell on this <I>Canada</I> transfer for 
a long time.
<P>
	So, clause 48 says the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>13. (1) Subject to this Part, a Canada Health and Social Transfer may be 
provided to a province for a fiscal year for the purposes of (a) establishing interim 
arrangements to finance social programs in a manner that will increase provincial 
flexibility;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This pertains mostly to Quebec.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) maintaining the national criteria and conditions in the Canada Health Act-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	At this point, the five conditions contained in the Canada 
Health Act are listed. But, surprisingly, they added extra-billing 
and user charges, which are mentioned almost as principles.
<P>
	Then, they add the following, which is the most important and 
the most surprising to those who were naive enough to believe 
the ministers who promised that this was going to be a flexible 
budget:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-maintaining national standards, where appropriate, in the operation of 
other social programs.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This sentence can be taken in no other way than as an 
announcement of the federal government's intention not to give 
greater flexibility or more room to manoeuvre to the provinces 
regarding the organization of their social programs. The only 
way to read this sentence is that the federal government intends 
to become more involved in the development of national 
standards.
<P>
	Therefore, on the one hand, they talk about flexibility, but, on 
the other, we see the truth. The truth is that this is the beginning 
of a push to centralize more. But, of course, a subclause does 
stipulate that the Minister of Human Resources Development 
must meet with his provincial counterparts to seek and secure 
mutual consent. Nowhere does this subclause state that mutual 
consent will become par for the course, and what is more, there 
is nothing guaranteeing, on the contrary, that if no agreement is 
reached-and the agreement is contingent on the central 
government in the first place-the government will not impose 
its own vision for social programs.
<P>
	This is very serious because, contrary to what the party 
opposite would have us believe, the budget is not balanced. It 
contains some less-than-straightforward cuts. Where it hits 
hard, where they say it will hit hard is among ordinary people. It 
does this in two ways, by the savings that the federal 
government will make until 1997-98.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	As for the cuts to the central government's cash payments to 
the provinces, which are calculated according to formulas I will 
not get into but which are supposed to take each province's 
respective wealth into consideration, they should save the 
central government $12.3 billion over three years.
<P>
	Although lower figures of $2.5 billion and $4.5 billion have 
been quoted, all transfers should be taken into account. These 
transfers would have taken place but the cuts, the provinces' 
shortfall and the central government's savings are all new. The 
new policy calls for slashing social programs like health care, 
education and social assistance in order to save $12.3 billion 
over three years by asking the provinces to decide where to cut.
<P>
	The central government claims that it is flexible. Nothing 
could be further from the truth. Nothing better illustrates the 
meaning of the expression ``two-faced''. In fact, the central 
government imposes standards for social assistance. It is 
removing a number of them but still leaving some. It is 
toughening health standards and reserves the right to impose 
additional standards, while forcing savage cuts on the provinces 
and the most disadvantaged, who are more likely to need these 
services.
<P>
	This is a two-faced budget because it does not seem to tackle 
anything this year whereas next year and especially the year 
after, there will be, there will have to be drastic cuts to health 
care, education and social assistance. In two of these three areas, 
the government is reserving the right to cut transfers if it feels 
that the provinces are not abiding by national standards. Far 
from improving access, far from decentralizing, the government 
is centralizing powers.
<P>
	What is worse is that, on the one hand, the government is 
forcing the provinces to cut while, on the other hand, it is using 
unemployment insurance as a cash cow in order to cushion itself 
against the next recession, while the provinces will have to bear 
the brunt of welfare cost increases that will continue to occur as 
they did during the recent recessions. The government is 
cushioning itself by transferring more and more costs to the 
provinces, thus bleeding them dry and putting itself in a position 
to make them a generous offer to intervene directly in areas of 
provincial jurisdiction. It is already making such announce-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11391"> 11391 </A></B>
<P>
ments with respect to the long-term unemployed and child 
poverty.
<P>
	Who can be against helping the long-term unemployed and 
poor children? You understand what is happening. Yes, it is a 
reform of federalism, which had been supporting provincial 
programs since 1960. They are reducing funds to the provinces, 
starving them. Instead, with the cushion provided by UI 
premiums, they will offer the services directly from Ottawa.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development and the 
Prime Minister had both promised us that reforms would be 
carried out. Reforms are indeed under way but they are 
unconstitutional, they are grave and they will become even 
radical in the years to come.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
gives me pleasure to speak on Bill C-76, an act to implement 
certain provisions of the budget tabled on February 27, 1995, 
and specifically the Bloc amendment thereto.
<P>
	The 1995 budget was one of the most important in the history 
of Canada. It was a budget of fundamental reform and national 
renewal.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	On October 18, 1994 the Minister of Finance addressed the 
finance committee and indeed all Canadians. I would like to 
quote the finance minister. At that meeting he stated: ``We came 
into government to help build a better Canada, a Canada of jobs 
and growth. That is our only goal and it is because of that that we 
must act decisively on the debt challenge today. We must not 
waste this recovery.''
<P>
	That commitment continues to be met by this budget and it is 
reflected in the confidence level of the financial markets, of the 
business community, and indeed of the Canadian people.
<P>
	The budget incorporated numerous provisions for all sectors. 
The deficit targets have been met using prudent economic 
assumptions. The total savings from the budget actions of $29 
billion over three years are the largest set of actions since the 
demobilization of the second world war. The deficit was planned 
to be cut to 3 per cent of GDP or about $24.3 billion in the 
1996-97 year. If the private sector economic forecasts are right, 
the deficit will likely be lower.
<P>
	New borrowing from financial markets is down to $13.7 
billion in the 1996-97 year or 1.7 per cent of GDP, less than 
projected for the national government of any other G-7 country. 
Debt to GDP begins to decline in 1996-97 as the debt grows 
more slowly than the economy.
<P>
	The deficit reduction was largely due to expenditure cuts. The 
budget delivers $25.3 billion of cumulative spending cuts over 
three years, with $16.9 billion from the top to bottom program 
review. Almost $7 in expenditure reductions were made for 
every $1 of new tax revenue over the next three years. As all 
Canadians know, there is no increase in personal income taxes.
<P>
	Program spending will decline from $120 billion in 1993-94 
to $107.9 billion in 1996-97. This is the lowest program 
spending in relation to the size of the economy since 1951.
<P>
	There has also been a dramatic reduction in departmental 
budgets. Several have been halved over the three years. As all 
Canadians know, 45,000 public service positions were cut as 
part of the budget.
<P>
	In addition, there were structural changes to ensure that we 
have continued savings. There is a fundamental change in the 
structure of program spending, which will keep the deficit on a 
downward track. Major cuts in business subsidies were made. 
They are down by 60 per cent from $3.8 billion in 1994-95 to 
$1.5 billion in the 1997-98 year. Many programs have been 
consolidated, merged or commercialized.
<P>
	The new Canada social transfer to the provinces in 1996-97 
has been created to provide more flexible, sustainable block 
funding. Unemployment insurance reform is intended to be in 
place by July 1, 1996. A course has been charted for the reform 
of our public pension system to make it fairer and more 
sustainable in the long term.
<P>
	The burden of the restraint must be shared equitably among 
all Canadians. Impact of budget actions have been equitably 
distributed across Canada. For instance, the transfers to the 
provinces declined 4.4 per cent from 1994-95 to the 1996-97 
year compared with a 7.3 per cent cut in other federal programs. 
It demonstrates that the provinces have been asked to contribute 
far less than the federal government.
<P>
	The increased cost recovery in other fees, such as the $975 
immigration fee per adult immigrant, also recognizes that social 
programs must seek to provide self-funding to the greatest 
extent possible. There have also been new measures to ensure 
the collection of taxes owed. Tax fairness has been improved 
with tighter rules for tax deferrals on foreign and family trusts, 
R and D incentives, and RRSPs. There are also higher taxes for 
corporations and large banks and, as we know, a small excise tax 
increase of 1.5 cents per litre to help reduce the deficit.
<P>
	One of the specific provisions within the budget that is of 
particular interest to me is the provision that deals with the tax 
deferral of unincorporated businesses and self-employed 
businesses. Businesses that are self-employed or 
unincorporated have the opportunity under the tax act to choose 
a year end that suits their needs. It does not necessarily have to 
coincide with the calendar year. That was brought in initially to 
provide businesses with the opportunity to have the cash flow 
they would need in those start-up periods so they could continue 
to establish the business.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11392"> 11392 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	The tax deferral of those deferred months is a permanent 
deferral. Take for example a business that has a year end of 
January 31. It means that the income from the past 12 months 
ending January 31, 1995 would not be reported until his or her 
personal income tax return was filed in 1996, which would not 
be until April of that year at the latest. Theoretically businesses 
would have a permanent deferral of up to 11 months. The budget 
changed the law so that after 1994 all businesses will have to 
declare income on a calendar year basis.
<P>
	We understand the treatment involves a catch up of the 
deferral of reporting that income. To provide the transition 
period available, the budget proposes that the recouping of those 
taxes will take place over 10 years, 5 per cent in year one, 10 per 
cent in years two to nine and the balance of 15 per cent in the 
10th year.
<P>
	In addition, the government has extended the filing date for 
the tax returns of these taxpayers until June 15, although the 
taxes otherwise owing have to still be paid by April 30.
<P>
	Most parliamentarians have made very clear their views on 
the budget. The most important aspect of the budget reaction is 
how Canadians feel about it. I would like to very briefly read 
some of the figures from the latest Angus Reid poll on the 
budget. First, more than two-thirds or 69 per cent of Canadians 
surveyed said they believed that the federal government is on 
the right track with the overall approach they have taken in the 
budget.
<P>
	A majority of respondents from all major socio-demographic 
segments of the population endorse the overall direction of the 
budget. A clear majority of Canadians in every region support it.
<P>
	A majority of Canadians, some 57 per cent, say that the 
budget is better than most federal budgets in the past decade or 
so. Fifty-six per cent of Canadians also say that they are more 
confident in the federal government's ability to manage the 
economy as a result of the budget.
<P>
	I could go on but I think it is clear to say at this point that 
Canadians are happy with the work we have done. The biggest 
debate that has been going on has to do with the size of the debt. 
There is no question the government is committed to 
eliminating the deficit and to start paying down our debt. At 
$550 billion, it represents a substantial expenditure to service 
that debt.
<P>
	Canadians, I know, are aware that the government is 
committed not only to hitting a target of 3 per cent of GDP for 
the deficit by the end of the third year but to getting it as low as 
possible as quickly as possible, but in a fair and compassionate 
manner.
<P>
	The renewal of Canada's fiscal health must include 
compassion. That is a very important issue. Canadians must be 
consulted on the kind of Canada we want. Those who rely 
continually on government must be weaned off their 
dependency for social handouts.
<P>
	The government can no longer afford to subsidize the payrolls 
of businesses through UI. The system must be restructured to a 
bona fide system of insurance. Also the government can no 
longer afford to sustain the same level of social spending. 
Seventy-five per cent of the people on welfare are employable. 
We must pursue every opportunity to promote job creation and 
training for Canadians so they can have meaningful 
employment.
<P>
	The Canadian people spoke up very clearly on how they felt 
about increased taxes and the minister responded in the budget. 
The job of restoring the fiscal and social well-being of Canada 
has begun. We have work to do on behalf of all Canadians. It 
must be done in a fair and compassionate manner.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to speak to Bill C-76 and the budget.
<P>
	A saying that comes to mind is that great parties must be ready 
not only to take advantage of opportunities but to make them. In 
the case of the Liberal government, we have in dealing with the 
budget a party that is taking advantage of an opportunity where 
it can. The advantage it is taking is that for so long, taxpayers 
have been crying out for governments to balance their books. 
They knew full well that had to be done. This is not some kind of 
brilliant idea the Liberals have to balance the budget or to cut 
costs. It is actually something that has been forced on them.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	How did they take advantage of the opportunities that have 
been presented to them? How did they make opportunity? For 
instance, I did not see some form of taxpayer protection act, as 
the Reform Party put forward. I did not see an indication in the 
budget for legislation that would guarantee balanced budgets. 
Those are what one makes out of a budget exercise. Those are 
the opportunities one makes. All they did was react to some 
extent to public opinion. That is unfortunate because they did 
not act far enough.
<P>
	Some of the comments made here today were: ``We did what 
is best. We reflect what Canadians want. We clearly have the 
majority of support from Canadians''. I often wonder where 
those general sweeping statements come from because in my 
riding that is just not the case. By and large, the people I talk 
to-I try to talk to as many as I can-are basically saying the 
Liberals wimped out in the end.
<P>
	They went for 3 per cent of gross domestic product. In three 
years they will overspend by approximately $25 billion a year. 
Over the life of this Parliament they will accumulate debt in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11393"> 11393 </A></B>
<P>
amount of one hundred thousand million dollars or better. I 
hardly think that is anything about which to be standing up in the 
House claiming to have come up with some wonderful ideas.
<P>
	Nowhere have I heard of the impact on the young people that 
are depending on us to balance the books. We keep getting this 
rhetoric: ``Look what we have done. Look how tough we have 
been''. That is not the case.
<P>
	I work very closely with what we call an advisory group in my 
community. The 11 people in that group are geographically 
selected. I sit with them on Saturdays once a month. They 
provide input from their selective geographic area as well from 
people they deal with on a business basis. We went through the 
budget. Not surprisingly, it came out quite similar to many 
things being said about some things that should be cut.
<P>
	I want to give the House an idea of what the people in the 
advisory group had been talking about. They said there should 
be selective cuts to old age security. Some of these people are 
seniors themselves. They suggested there should be selective 
cuts to unemployment insurance, no cuts to veterans' 
allowances and pensions. There should be selective cuts to 
universities and colleges, major cuts to CAP-the transfers for 
welfare payments-major cuts to health and reductions in 
transfers to have-not provinces.
<P>
	This is not a group of Reformers but people trying to balance 
the budget as best they can. Recognizing that the social system 
has to stay in place, what better way than by balancing the 
budget first? After all, the larger the debt gets, the more interest 
payments we have to make and the less operating funds we have 
to pay toward programs. That makes so much common sense.
<P>
	Every time we make a speech we should not have to repeat and 
repeat it. The government knows what it has to do. What it is 
trying to do is put enough rhetoric forward with the hope the 
Canadian people are going to buy what it is saying. Just wait 
until Moody's has a really good look at what is going on and our 
bond rating starts going downward. It will be asking about the 
taxpayers' budget the Reform Party put forward. It is only a 
matter of time.
<P>
<B>(1310 ) </B>
<P>
	When I talked to the advisory group in my community its 
members gave me some suggestions to bring to the House. I 
want to express them today. These are some of the comments 
from these folks. ``It hurts less to cut with a sharp knife than a 
dull one''. These comments are unsolicited. They are telling the 
government to get it over with. Balance the budget and get on 
with the economic and social life that we have planned for our 
young people and our seniors. We cannot keep going ahead with 
this umbrella of debt sitting over us in deficits and unbalanced 
budgets.
<P>
	They also suggest that we should run government like a 
business and not a charity. Can anyone imagine talking to the 
Liberal government about running government like a business 
and not a charity? That is a strange kind of terminology in 1995, 
for the Liberals that is.
<P>
	It was suggested that we run Canada like a household. They 
have to live within their means. They just cannot go to the bank 
and borrow and borrow past the ability to pay out of the incomes 
that are brought into that household. They do not understand 
how the government can say: ``We are doing such a good job 
because in three years we are only going to overspend by $25 
billion''. They do not understand that.
<P>
	To stand here today and say the budget reflects what 
Canadians want is hogwash. Because the government was 
elected as a majority government, Liberals should not 
misunderstand the fact that Canadians wanted to throw out the 
Conservatives, not necessarily elect the Liberals. Everything 
the government does here should not be construed by 
government members as being politically and morally right on 
behalf of the majority of Canadians. If the government makes 
that assumption, it will be joining the other party from Jurassic 
Park.
<P>
	Canadians have been making more comments. ``Continued 
deficits do not resolve the problem. There is $150 million going 
to countries heavily in debt. What is Canada?'' They do not 
understand why that is being done. If we seriously look at all the 
cuts and reductions in expenditures, how come that is still there? 
They do not understand that if a budget is so tough and strong, 
why was an increase given to the department of Indian affairs? 
Why is there such a pot of dollars that nobody is sure where the 
money is going? All they are asking for is a little accountability. 
Rather than accounting for the money in that department's 
budget, more is added to it. One only has to look at the Auditor 
General's report to see that there is something desperately 
wrong in that department.
<P>
	I remember the first several months we sat in the House the 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development said: ``We 
are going to do away with the department''. What happens in 
1995? Money is added to it. Someone can stand in the House and 
say: ``We are only reflecting what Canadians want''. Go across 
the country and ask Canadians if they want more money put into 
the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. 
You will get an answer.
<P>
	Some other comments were made by these folks: ``Let people 
look after themselves and not government''. We only have to 
look as far as the regional development programs to see what 
they are talking about. It does not take much to see what is 
wrong with the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency. It has 
been giving grants, both by Liberals and Conservatives, to 
virtually everybody to buy votes.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11394"> 11394 </A></B>
<P>
	We convinced the minister in charge of ACOA to drop the 
granting process within ACOA. What does he do? He said: ``We 
are going to give loans and ask that they be paid back''. Last year 
alone the government wrote off $50 million in loans. What is the 
difference between $50 million on loans that are written off and 
a grant?
<P>
<B>(1315 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> It looks better in the books.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Yes. My 
colleague says it looks better in the books, and that is exactly 
what it is. That is a snow job just like a whole bunch of other 
things in this budget. However, it is going to come back to haunt 
you.
<P>
	I have one minute, Mr. Speaker? It is funny how time flies 
when you are having fun.
<P>
	Let me give some other suggestions. They say we have to look 
after our young people, keep them in mind, because there will be 
no assets left for them. They talk about 3 per cent of GDP. It is 
like shooting at the outside rings of a dart board. These are 
comments from average, everyday, law-abiding, good Canadian 
citizens. Yet we have the audacity to stand in this House and say 
this is what the majority of Canadians want.
<P>
	Finally, there are two other comments they made. Lobby 
groups do not want cuts. Some social programs are the right of 
the privileged. We should look at that. Another comment is that 
potential is being squashed in the country.
<P>
	If we cannot listen to each other in the House and we are going 
to listen to all this rhetoric, maybe all members should end up 
with an advisory group and take their advice. It seems a heck of a 
lot more sound than what I have been listening to here.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Serré (Timiskaming-French River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very happy to be able to take part in the debate on 
my government's budget. I will start, perhaps, by giving an 
overview and talking about the budget's objectives and 
highlights.
<P>
	This budget does what is necessary to bring the deficit under 
control. These are the strongest fiscal measures adopted by the 
federal government in 50 years. This budget guarantees that we 
will bring the deficit down to 3 per cent of the gross national 
product by 1996-1997. It enables us to meet our deficit 
reduction objective, without increasing personal income taxes. 
For the second year in a row, the government has refused to 
lower the deficit on the backs of taxpayers.
<P>
	The program review introduced in this budget redefines the 
role of government, with the result that the departments will 
concentrate their efforts on the priorities of Canadians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	After the broadest prebudget consultation process in this 
country, both the financial markets and Canadians alike have 
told us that they want first and foremost for us to cut the deficit 
and to put our financial house in order.
<P>
	As the finance minister said himself: ``Come hell or high 
water, we will meet our 3 per cent of deficit reduction by 
1996-97''. However, there are ways to do that. We could have 
used the Gingrich-Manning approach, the slash and burn 
approach, and cut everything by 15 per cent to 20 per cent. 
However, this is the wrong way. We have to do it in a fair 
manner, taking care of the poor, the handicapped and the senior 
citizens in our society. I do not think it is appropriate to cut 20 
per cent of something that is good and keep 100 per cent of 
something that is bad.
<P>
	The new philosophy of this party is that if the government 
does not have to do it, we will not do it; we will give it to private 
enterprise.
<P>
	Most Canadians approve of this budget. There are very few 
people who complain about this budget. Of course, there are 
those who want to destroy this country; they will not approve 
something as good as this budget.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the premier of Ontario, Bob Rae, along with 
his strategists, had to go back to the drawing board. He was 
counting on us to bring in a bad budget. He was counting on this 
to start his provincial campaign. I have news for Mr. Rae. He can 
call an election and campaign against the federal budget. He will 
meet Brian Mulroney and his party, because in Ontario we can 
take a lesson. I think the Ontario NDP government can take a 
lesson from what we have done here at the federal level in terms 
of deficit control.
<P>
<B>(1320 ) </B>
<P>
	This budget is necessary medicine for difficult economic 
times. It is the strongest fiscal action by any federal government 
in 50 years. It will result in a total savings of $29 billion over 
three years; $25.3 billion will be saved by expenditure cuts. The 
Minister of Finance is sending a strong message to international 
markets that Canada is serious about deficit reduction. Cuts to 
government departments account for half of the fiscal saving in 
this budget. Departmental spending will be cut by $3.9 billion in 
1995-96, $5.9 billion in 1996-97, and $7.2 billion in 1997-98. 
For every dollar in increased revenue there will be $7 in 
expenditure reductions. That is what Canadians told us they 
wanted and that is what we did.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would also like to speak about the impact of the budget in my 
northern Ontario riding.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There can be no mistake that this budget was tough on 
northern Ontario, as there were no incentives for natural 
resources and about 80 per cent of the economy of northern 
Ontario depends on natural resources. We knew  this was to be a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11395"> 11395 </A></B>
<P>
tough budget, but we in northern Ontario were prepared to 
accept that. We know that we have to share the burden of taxes 
and deficit reduction.
<P>
	Let us look, for instance, at the natural resources department. 
It suffered one of the largest cuts of all departments, close to 50 
per cent. The new role of the department will be to focus on the 
sustainable development of natural resources, the revitalization 
of the natural resources sector, national and international 
leadership, knowledge of the land mass and natural resources, 
and health, safety and resource related environmental concerns. 
It will maintain a presence in areas of federal responsibility such 
as international trade and science and technology.
<P>
	Due to the current financial situation, the government did not 
renew both the mineral development agreements, the so-called 
MDAs, and the forestry development agreements, the FRDAs, 
which were cancelled by the last Tory budget in 1993. We said in 
the red book that we would review those programs and we did. 
We would have liked to have kept those programs for northern 
Ontario and other parts of rural Canada, but we had to cancel 
them because of the fiscal reality in the country.
<P>
	However, the government responded in other ways. It 
responded by taking action in eliminating unnecessary 
regulatory barriers to mineral development. This was a key 
priority identified by the mining industry.
<P>
	The finance minister also told northern Ontario Liberal MPs 
that after the budget was presented he would be willing to look at 
alternative measures and incentives for the mining industry.
<P>
	There is a campaign called ``Keep Mining in Canada''. It is a 
broad based organization of industries from across the country. 
That organization gave the budget an A-plus on the deficit 
reduction side. However, it would have liked to have seen tax 
based incentives for the mining industry. I have been pushing for 
that for the last year. I am a little disappointed they were not in 
the budget; however, I understand that the main thrust of the 
budget was deficit reduction. I also understand that the finance 
minister could not on the one hand, cut one sector, like 
agriculture, and on the other hand, give more incentives to 
another sector.
<P>
	On the agricultural side, there are quite a few dairy producers 
in my riding. Only a few years ago Canadian farmers were 
caught in an international trade war that drove down crop prices 
and farmers' incomes. With many disputes settled, agricultural 
producers now receive more than a third of their income from 
the market. Our government will introduce a national whole 
farm stabilization program, along with crop insurance, instead 
of basing programs on individual agricultural commodities.
<P>
	In 1997-98 $600 million a year from the federal government, 
in addition to $400 million a year from the provinces, will go 
into this program. This is after a  reduction of 30 per cent, with a 
total savings of $250 million.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	The greatest impact on farmers in Timiskaming-French 
River is the reduction of the dairy subsidy, which is 30 per cent 
over a two-year period. It is believed that this reduction may be 
made up in part by the cost of producing a pricing formula that 
ensures a fair payment to producers.
<P>
	The elimination of the western grain transportation subsidies 
will save the government about $5 million annually. This will 
open the western economy to diversification and innovation and 
meet GATT requirements.
<P>
	Since I only have two minutes, Mr. Speaker, I will address the 
regional development programs. There was a reduction of over 
$560 million by Industry Canada to ACOA, FORD-Q and 
western diversification. That is a reduction of about 49 per cent 
across the board. Fortunately for northern Ontario we have a 
program called FEDNOR. We were getting approximately a 1 
per cent share per capita compared to other programs in Canada. 
True, with strong lobbying by northern Ontario MPs this 
program was not reduced but increased by $18 million. For that I 
have to thank the finance minister, who finally recognized that 
northern Ontario was not getting its fair share of regional 
development moneys.
<P>
	It demonstrates that the Minister of Industry has listened to 
the concerns of the northern Ontario caucus and has recognized 
that northern Ontario was not getting its fair share of regional 
development funding and has acted decisively to correct this 
inequity.
<P>
	Increases to FEDNOR will total $63.7 million over the next 
three years. The breakdown in funding is as follows: in 1995-96, 
$6.2 million to $23.3 million; for 1996-97 it will be up to $20.4 
million; and in 1997-98 it will be up to $20 million again.
<P>
	In closing I approve of my government's initiative to make 
this regional development money available on a repayable loan 
basis. I can say that the business people who are going to profit 
from these programs in my riding are also in agreement.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to participate in this debate on the budget before us on 
behalf of my party. There are many ways of looking at a budget. 
One can theorize and get into a macroeconomic analysis of the 
budget.
<P>
	Personally, since the closure of the military college in 
Saint-Jean was announced in last year's budget, I tend to look 
for direct impacts on my riding. First, I look at the budget as a 
whole and what impact it will have on Quebec, and then I look at 
its 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11396"> 11396 </A></B>
<P>
real and potential impact on my riding. Today, my remarks will 
focus on agricultural considerations affecting my riding.
<P>
	While Saint-Jean is a semi-rural riding situated very close to 
Montreal, it has many farms and dairy farms in particular. From 
what I can see, these farmers will be hard hit by this budget 
which has been before us for some time now. I will try to show 
you how it will affect the farmers in my riding.
<P>
	Overall, the budget for agriculture will be reduced from $2.1 
billion to $1.7 billion, a 19 per cent cut, and 18 per cent of this 
cut is in personnel, which means the salaries often already 
allocated to researchers, because there are several agricultural 
research stations, including one in Saint-Jean, that I will talk 
about later. If we look at the budget as a whole, I think it is 
important to know just what percentage is involved. Overall, 
there is a 19 per cent cut to the Department of Agriculture, 18 
per cent in personnel.
<P>
	Now, let us look at the impact of this budget on Quebec. In this 
area as in every federal area of activity, Quebec foots about 24 
per cent of the bill, while farming in Quebec accounts for about 
17 per cent of all farming in Canada, but we get back only 13 per 
cent.
<P>
	So, for the sake of equity, it would have been great to say: if 
there are cuts to be made in agriculture this year, perhaps we 
should make an effort to spare Quebec. Perhaps some cuts could 
be made in Quebec but not as much as everywhere else. The 
actual percentage was higher than the 19 per cent figure 
mentioned earlier.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	I will tell you about the cuts affecting the Saint-Jean research 
station, and you will see that these are significantly higher than 
the 19 per cent figure for the rest of Canada. I mentioned the 
percentages for Quebec as a whole.
<P>
	The budget also proposes to close the L'Assomption research 
station, which specializes in ornamental plants. It may be that 
the private sector can take over this activity. That research 
station was financed out of the budget of the Saint-Jean station. 
Indeed, although the two facilities were in different ridings, 
their budgets were centralized.
<P>
	Quebec will also lose the La Pocatière centre. The 
consequences of that closure were explained by the hon. 
member for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup. I will get back to 
this particular case later on. A number of documents which I 
have here list the various research stations, and the reasons for 
closing them. In the case of the La Pocatière station, the reasons 
mentioned are highly questionable.
<P>
	Let us now take a look at the impact of these measures in my 
riding. The budget for the Saint-Jean centre is reduced by 32 per 
cent, going from $5.6 million down to $3.8 million. As I 
mentioned earlier, the overall cut is 19 per cent. So, after the 
military college, the residents of Saint-Jean are once again 
paying more than their share, this time in the agricultural sector.
<P>
	The closures in L'Assomption in Saint-Jean will result in the 
loss of 17 and 10 jobs respectively. If you exclude L'Assomption 
and only take Saint-Jean into consideration, you end up with a 
21 per cent cut. Once again, Saint-Jean residents are paying for 
the cuts affecting the agricultural sector.
<P>
	I seriously wonder about the meaning of this flexible 
federalism which we hear about these days. Based on what we 
have seen so far, this flexible federalism means that Quebec 
must always do more than the rest of Canada. I showed that to be 
the case with an example relating to agriculture. I also showed it 
on numerous occasions last year with the military college. This 
year, however, it is in the agricultural sector that this budget will 
really have a negative impact in my riding.
<P>
	I also have a document prepared by the Research Branch. This 
is not the first such document which I come across. Last year, I 
saw one from the National Defence Department. These 
documents are simply a series of questions and answers 
distributed to senior public servants in the various departments. 
Research Branch officials received this particular one, which 
merely repeats the answers to various questions. I think it is 
important to touch on some of these issues.
<P>
	We are told about the impact of the budget on federal 
agri-food research in Quebec. This is what transpires: ``As far 
as the food research and development centre at Saint-Hyacinthe 
and the dairy and pork research centre in Lennoxville are 
concerned, the impact will be minimal. The work being done in 
these centres reflects the main priorities of the food industry- 
There will be cut backs in the grain research program at the 
centre for soil and crop research and development in 
Sainte-Foy''. No further details.
<P>
	The next item is research on small fruits which was being 
done in Saint-Jean, a major production centre for strawberries 
and raspberries. The paper simply says that research activities at 
Saint-Jean will be terminated and transferred to the research 
centre in Kemptville, Nova Scotia.
<P>
	Imagine, under-funding is already a problem in Quebec and 
Saint-Jean. Now they cut this program to transfer it to Nova 
Scotia. The same paper provides a list of centres of excellence 
where research is to be concentrated, apparently to be closer to 
production centres and the industry. This makes no sense at all. I 
condemn the fact that ten experts on small fruits research are 
removed at Saint-Jean, in order to transfer the centre to Nova 
Scotia. I cannot accept that.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11397"> 11397 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	Next question. Why did the government close down two 
facilities in Quebec? The answer? There will still be a federal 
research laboratory that will work on every aspect of the food 
industry. Saint-Hyacinthe and Lennoxville are mentioned 
again. So the policy seems to be that when we condemn these 
cutbacks, they are supposed to answer: We are still maintaining 
facilities at Lennoxville and Saint-Hyacinthe. Yes they are, but 
part of the operation at Saint-Jean has been removed and 
operations have been eliminated altogether at l'Assomption and 
La Pocatière.
<P>
	Why are they closing La Pocatière? There will be a significant 
impact on ovine research in Canada and ovine, for the benefit of 
our viewers, means sheep. However, we are told that the sheep 
growing industry is relatively small. Just when they are starting 
to develop some expertise at La Pocatière, the government says 
they are going to stop because this sector is not significant. Once 
again, a market niche that should be expanding because in 
Quebec, we have the right kind of pasture for sheep, has once 
again been sacrificed at our expense.
<P>
	Taking the experimental farm at l'Assomption as an example, 
they say that as a general rule, since this is research on 
ornamental plants, the private sector will take over. They always 
say to Quebec that, yes, we will be making cuts, but the private 
sector will pick up the slack and the only changes, if any, that 
need to be made regarding research centres and centres of 
excellence, will be to move them closer to areas of production.
<P>
	I have a list of all the centres of excellence in Canada and only 
4 out of 19 are located in Quebec. Once again, we are not getting 
a share proportionate to our population and to our contribution 
of 24 per cent of the federal government's agriculture budget.
<P>
	Voters in Saint-Jean are very disappointed. My colleague 
talked about the 15 per cent cut a year for the next two years in 
dairy farm, dairy production subsidies. In this case again, 
Saint-Jean has huge dairy farms. These people are already 
dealing with a war that is brewing between us and the 
Americans; the Americans want NAFTA to prevail and we want 
the GATT to prevail. We are already on the road to a war and the 
only help the government is offering is to cut subsidies, while it 
will compensate western producers for decreases in land values, 
by means of loan guarantees and additional compensation of 
$300 million during the transitional period.
<P>
	I call that out and out injustice. Through this budget, the 
electorate in Saint-Jean will lose 10 experts who were building 
up a renowned expertise and to whom all farmers in my riding 
constantly referred for their input. Now they are saying to the 
strawberry and raspberry producers of Saint-Jean that they will 
have to call Nova Scotia for advice, and I very much doubt that 
production anywhere in that province surpasses that in my 
riding. Lastly, Quebec's dairy producers are left out. Once 
again,  this budget, on the agricultural front alone, hits Quebec 
and the electorate of Saint-Jean, and it is my duty to denounce it 
in this House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Wellington-Waterloo, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure today to join in the debate on 
the budget.
<P>
	In response to some of the comments about the group of 
Liberals here today, they are different from some Liberals from 
the past. It is the nature of the times. They have come with a 
different perspective and it has shown up directly in the budget.
<P>
	The overriding goal of the government since it came to power 
has been jobs and growth. We believe good economics and good 
social policies are one and the same thing. The most 
fundamental way good social policy begins is with a job. We 
must respond to the challenges of our times. We must adapt to 
the new economy and the new infrastructure based on ideas and 
innovation. The very nature of government must change. We 
must develop a new notion of responsibility. The time has long 
past when governments can or should do everything.
<P>
	Several major things have happened. The world economy has 
become truly integrated. We must think globally. Trade barriers 
have been brought down. Communications are instant and 
transportation is swift. Markets never sleep. There are no longer 
any islands. Like it or not, there is no place to hide.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	Since 1984 our debt has risen by three times. Compound 
interest is gobbling us up and the government now has a two 
track approach to sustained and sustainable economic growth. 
Growing economies produce jobs; economies that are not 
producing do not produce jobs.
<P>
	The key to growth is productivity, which is how well ideas, 
workers, resources and investments are brought together in the 
country's economy. It is about ingenuity, better management 
and paying attention to the common sense of our workers.
<P>
	How do we get high productivity growth increases, the only 
way we can increase real incomes? We must first improve our 
skills. We must have better innovation. We must provide a 
welcoming climate for investment, and let no one forget it. We 
must remove any disincentives we have created for people and 
business. Those were disincentives created by government. We 
must get our fiscal house in order.
<P>
	The budget's plan introduces far reaching action to restore 
fiscal health which is essential for a strong, growing economy. 
The budget will fundamentally reform what government does 
and how it will do it. It will bring permanent change in the way 
government does business. The object is to get government right 
so it can fill its social and economic mandates and be more 
effective and sustainable. This will include deep cuts in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11398"> 11398 </A></B>
<P>
federal  program spending, not simply lower spending growth 
but substantial reduction in actual dollars.
<P>
	That is fundamentally the philosophy of the majority of the 
governing side of the House. In a party of the Liberal Party's 
size there will be some who want to go further right and some 
who want to go further left. However, they do realize the 
government cannot be in every aspect of society.
<P>
	I will comment on two or three things, overview of budget 
details and the program review undertaken, the underpinning for 
all of the cuts and directions of the government.
<P>
	The budget is about getting government right so it can do a 
better job of helping to get the economy right by sustaining 
growth and confidence in creating new jobs while preserving 
our ability to help those in need. To meet this goal the budget 
delivers our commitment to cut the deficit to 3 per cent of the 
economy in two years. Some say that is not enough. Believe me, 
unless there is a target one can see on a daily basis, one will not 
hit the target.
<P>
	Despite the impact of higher than expected interest rates, if 
economic performance is stronger than our prudent forecast, the 
deficit could fall at a steeper rate than was forecast. Our fiscal 
actions will total $29 billion in reductions over the next three 
years, more than any budget since the post war demobilization. 
In two years, program spending will be $10.4 billion less than 
today. It is a cumulative cut and will go on forever.
<P>
	Just as important, the budget also changes the very nature of 
how government operates. This will ensure spending will be 
restrained beyond our two-year target period. The deficit will 
continue to fall, reflecting our commitment to eliminating it 
completely.
<P>
	To achieve these results the budget takes fundamental action 
across government programs and operations. It implements the 
results of the program review, which I will speak to in a few 
moments, a comprehensive examination of departmental 
spending. We will focus on what is essential and do it better. The 
budget of some of the departments will be cut by one-half.
<P>
	The budget also acts on a new vision of the federal 
government's role in the economy, one that includes substantial 
reduction in business subsidies. These will drop by $3.8 billion 
this year to $1.5 billion in the year 1997-98. The budget reforms 
major transfers to provinces, modernizing the 
federal-provincial fiscal regime, making it more effective, 
flexible and affordable.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	These wide-ranging reforms mean a smaller public service. 
Some 45,000 positions will be eliminated, but we will manage 
this difficult process as fairly as possible, including the use of 
early departure and early retirement incentives.
<P>
	This is also fair to the taxpayer. That is why the budget does 
not increase personal income tax. However, there are measures 
to improve tax system fairness. We eliminated the deferral taxes 
on investment income earned by private holding companies and 
we eliminated the ability of people to earn business or 
professional income by the ability to pick their own fiscal year 
end, an option that helps defer taxes, albeit only for the one year.
<P>
	We are also eliminating all tax advantages of family trusts. 
We are temporarily reducing our upper limit on the RRSP 
contributions to $13,500 so benefits do not flow to people who 
earn more than two and a half times the average wage.
<P>
	It is clearly a budget that places absolute priority on the 
expenditure reduction. It delivers nearly $7 in spending cuts to 
$1 in new tax revenue.
<P>
	Let me speak of the program review. The budget agenda is not 
a plan for smaller government; it is a plan for smarter 
government and for the reform of the very structure of 
government and how it spends. The budget reflects the results of 
the program review we launched a year ago, and the actions 
taken to date secure structural reform irrevocably and deliver 
significant savings beyond the two fiscal years for which we 
have set firm deficit targets.
<P>
	Achieving this goal demands wide-ranging bottom line 
action, and that is what the budget delivers. The size of 
government will be reduced substantially over the next three 
years. Departmental spending will be reduced by 19 per cent 
from the 1994-95 levels. For some departments, spending will 
be halved.
<P>
	I mentioned that in my previous statement, but I cannot 
overestimate the realness of these kinds of cuts. In total, these 
actions will deliver a three-year saving of almost $17 billion. 
Let me be clear. These are real cuts in absolute dollars. They are 
not measures that try to pretend that a drop in the rate of 
spending growth is somewhat of a spending reduction.
<P>
	Government programs are being redesigned by this review to 
make them more efficient and cost effective. Regional 
development agencies, for example, will play newer roles and 
will focus on small and medium sized business, and assistance 
will emphasize repayable loans, not grants.
<P>
	A basic philosophy of the program review was that the federal 
government should not be doing what someone else can do 
better. As a result, we are devolving some programs to other 
levels of government and we are privatizing other activities. For 
example, fisheries and oceans will devolve fresh water 
responsibilities to the provinces. Forest and mineral 
development agreements with the provinces will be 
discontinued. Airports and recreational harbours will be 
transferred to local authorities, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11399"> 11399 </A></B>
<P>
and the Minister of Transport will move this year to privatize 
CN.
<P>
	There was a lot of work done on all aspects of government. 
The government we will see two years from now will be far 
different from the government we saw at the beginning of our 
tenure.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
for the benefit of Canadians watching today, I would like to 
repeat that this is a debate on the budget implementation act. 
That does not sound like a very gripping topic, but it is very 
important. Really what it means is that we are talking today 
about how our government spends our money.
<P>
	It is important to emphasize to Canadians that governments 
have no money of their own. They simply use our money and 
they use lots of our money. In many cases, Canadians feel that 
we are supporting government instead of government 
supporting us.
<P>
	Be that as it may, it is very important that we examine 
carefully and very logically how governments spend our money. 
Because I am a human resources development critic for Reform, 
I would like to spend the minutes I have to discuss the budget 
implementation act and talk about how social program spending 
is handled in this budget.
<P>
<B>(1350 ) </B>
<P>
	First, this budget is rather shockingly vague about how social 
programs, particularly very important social programs, are 
going to be handled by this government. For example, the 
budget says that unemployment insurance will be cut a 
minimum of 10 per cent. How much would be the maximum? We 
do not know. The budget is silent. Who is going to be cut? How 
are the cuts going to be made? When are they going to be made? 
We do not know. The budget is silent on that and so is the budget 
implementation act. We have big questions about that big 
program that are not answered in this budget.
<P>
	The second thing the budget says is that the two pillars of the 
pension plan are going to be re-examined in order to make them 
more sustainable. When are they going to be re-examined? We 
are not sure. We were supposed to have a paper, promised by this 
government, months ago. Now the government says it thinks it 
will be in the fall. Canadians hope so, but experience has shown 
that the time lines of this government are a little flexible, to say 
the least.
<P>
	Here we have the pillars of the pension plan, the Canada 
pension plan and the old age security; they are going to be 
re-examined. There are going to have to be some changes. 
Those are code words for cuts, because we know there is no extra 
money. But we do not know when. We do not know who. We do 
not know how. There is a lot of vagueness in how important 
programs are going to be handled.
<P>
	The budget implementation act in part IV does talk about how 
this new transfer to support health care, post-secondary 
education and welfare is going to be handled. The transfers from 
the federal government to the provinces for these three 
programs have now been rolled into one big transfer of block 
funding. Now this block has been given a nice name by Liberal 
spin doctors. It is being called the Canada health and social 
transfer.
<P>
	Really the bottom line is that the moneys that used to go to the 
provinces for these three programs are being cut substantially. 
That in itself probably would not concern Canadians because 
they know that we cannot keep funding these programs on 
borrowed money. We cannot keep mortgaging our children's 
future to pay for these programs. The real concern is that there 
seems to be no coherent plan at all about the future of these 
programs.
<P>
	We can live with cuts; we accept that cuts are necessary. But 
we need to know where that leaves us. Where is this going to 
take us? Where it takes us is a big question mark. There are 
absolutely no long-range plans, no game plan, on what is going 
to happen, for example, to the funding for the Canada Health 
Act, the medicare plan, our health care.
<P>
	The provisions that are being put in place, the cuts that are 
being made, are simply for the next two or three years and then 
there is a commitment to talk to the provinces, to have some 
kind of consultation. Then we will see what comes out of that.
<P>
	I would suggest that health care is one of the most important 
things to Canadians. All of us know our vulnerability to health 
care problems. Yet here we have a very important program for 
Canadians being cut, but there is no long term plan. One has to 
wonder why this government could not have had a consultation 
with the provinces, put together a long term plan in consultation 
with other major players, and then come out with changes to the 
game. But no. This government simply sat on the sidelines and 
made changes to the rules of the game in mid-game, with 
absolutely no idea of where this is all going to take us on a very 
critical plan.
<P>
	I do not think that is good management on behalf of 
Canadians. Canadians deserve a lot better than that.
<P>
<B>(1355 ) </B>
<P>
	We have had several promises to come up with papers to deal 
with pensions and the changes that are going to be needed in our 
social programs. However, there is nothing for Canadians to 
give us any idea of where we are headed on these matters. We 
know we are losing our programs. We know they are being cut 
back, and cut back without consultation with the provinces. For 
example, about one-third of all provincial spending is on health 
care alone. Yet changes are being made without any consultation 
with the major players.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="11400"> 11400 </A></B>
<P>
	The second thing that concerns me in this budget 
implementation act is the punitive approach that is being 
escalated in the matter of transfers from the federal government 
to the provinces.
<P>
	In the past, if the provisions of the federal government were 
changed or not adhered to by the provinces, then transfers for 
those programs could be cut. Now, under this budget 
implementation act, any transfer to the provinces from the 
federal government can be cut, even it if it is not referable to the 
social programs that the provinces are trying to change.
<P>
	The federal government has promised certain transfers to the 
provinces. Now it can hold them hostage if it does not like what 
the provinces are doing in any area.
<P>
	These powers are very arbitrary. It gives arbitrary power to 
the health minister to become the sole guardian of the Canada 
Health Act. If the minister is ``satisfied'' that a province is not in 
line with her own interpretation of the Canada Health Act, then 
she has the authority to effectively become the judge and jury of 
the provincial health system and can then ask cabinet to cut any 
federal transfer to the provinces.
<P>
	This is just unacceptable when we are dealing with such 
critical programs. We need some certainty for our provinces.
<P>
	When the health minister is asked how she is going to enforce 
these new arbitrary powers that she has been given, she says she 
will enforce them flexibly. However, when one examines the 
legislation there is absolutely no reference to any flexible 
interpretation of the Canada Health Act. In fact, we have 
members of the government and the Prime Minister standing up 
and saying: ``The provisions of the Canada Health Act will be 
very firmly enforced by this government''.
<P>
	So we are hearing again two different interpretations of what 
is going to happen. If we are going to get our House in order and 
if we are going to ensure personal social security for Canadians, 
we need to have a great deal more certainty than we find in this 
bill.
<P>
	It is incumbent upon the government, when it is bringing 
forward this kind of spending legislation, to tell Canadians how 
it is going to work, to give them a plan that they can count on, 
and to work with the provinces to make sure that the programs 
we have can be counted on and have some type of long term 
management rather than this cut and paste approach to what 
have become very important programs for Canadians.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It being two o'clock, we will now proceed to 
statements by members.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday, Sunday, April 2, the members of St. Stanislaus-St. 
Casimir's Polish Parishes Credit Union held their 50th annual 
meeting in the constituency of Parkdale-High Park.
<P>
	Founded in 1945 by Father S. Puchniak, pastor of the St. 
Stanislaus parish in Toronto, the Polish Parishes Credit Union 
takes pride in being today the largest parish based credit union in 
the world, with over 37,000 members and total assets of $223 
million.
<P>
	This unique credit union provides a full range of financial 
services, including personal, mortgage and business loans, 
RRSPs, RRIFs, OHOSPs, and automated teller services 
worldwide.
<P>
	The success of this progressive credit union, with branches in 
Toronto, Etobicoke, Mississauga, Hamilton, Kitchener, Guelph, 
Oakville and Windsor, reflects the growth and prosperity of 
Canada.
<P>
	It is creating together opportunity not only for its members

	<B>Mr. Réjean Lefebvre (Champlain, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
weekend's annual meetings of the Mouvement Desjardins are 
proof once again of the huge success of the co-operative 
movement founded in 1900 by Alphonse Desjardins. The total 
assets of the Mouvement Desjardins have increased by 33 per 
cent and are now worth $73.8 billion. Furthermore, this 
institution has declared surplus earnings of over $314 million.
<P>
	The Mouvement Desjardins has mirrored Quebecers' 
dynamism, since its inception. In encouraging Quebecers to 
invest their savings in Quebec, Claude Béland, the president of 
the Mouvement Desjardins, said, and I quote: ``We have no hope 
of winning the development war if we hand over our arms to 
others''.
<P>
	The success of the Desjardins movement is the result of an 
economic development model based on co-operation. Quebec's 
economic prosperity requires all participants in the Quebec 
socio-economic scene to work together in the fight against 
chronic unemployment.

Speaker, less than three weeks ago I asked the Minister of 
Justice how he could guarantee responsible gun owners that his 
gun registration system would be safe from computer hackers. 
He accused me of fear mongering and conjuring up images that 
frighten Canadians. Then he went on to state that without his gun 
controls we would end up with a gun culture and would go the 
way of other countries. We have not had his gun control laws for 
the last few centuries and we do not have a gun culture yet. I 
have to ask: Who is doing the fear mongering?

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADASOCIALTRANSFER">CANADA SOCIAL TRANSFER</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, with its 
Canada social transfer, the federal government claimed it was 
giving the provinces greater autonomy and flexibility with 
respect to social programs. But in implementing this Canada 
social transfer, Ottawa is set to impose national standards for 
social assistance and post-secondary education, totally 
disregarding provincial jurisdiction over these areas.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister talk about flexible federalism 
when his government is not only withdrawing from social 
programs but also threatening to further penalize those 
provinces that do not comply with the new national standards, 
which amounts to imposing its views while at the same time 
denying provincial jurisdiction over social programs?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, what we plan to do is to ensure that adequate services 
are provided to all Canadians. The hon. member should have 
noticed that there are ongoing consultations among the 
provinces and between the federal government and the 
provinces to ensure harmonization from coast to coast. This will 
give Canadians access to acceptable and adaptable services 
wherever they go in the country.
<P>
	There is already a high level of co-operation among the 
provinces. The role of the federal government is to ensure that 
the agreements reached are as uniform as possible so that people 
can move freely across the country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, how can 
the Prime Minister have the gall to ask the provinces to make up 
the shortfall resulting from the federal government's 
withdrawal, while at the same time relegating them to a mere 
advisory role in developing new and much more restrictive 
national standards, particularly with respect to health?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, health is covered by legislation. The five major 
conditions governing health care in Canada-universality, 
portability and the rest-are in the act. There is a clear 
commitment by this Parliament with respect to maintaining 
these five principles.
<P>
	As for their implementation, discussions are under way 
between the Minister of Health and her counterparts. We are 
looking for the best solutions. If services are to be accessible to 
all Canadians, when Canadians travel across the country, 
whether on vacation or business, they must be able to rely on the 
same services in other provinces as in their own. Everyone 
agrees that Canada's health system is one of the best in the 
world. We must ensure that it remains that way as much as 
possible.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, are we 
to understand from the Prime Minister's answers that, for him, 
flexible federalism means that Ottawa is responsible for social 
programs and the conditions under which these programs are 
provided to Canadians, while the provinces are concerned only 
with their administration, when they are facing enormous 
financial difficulties following his government's withdrawal?

actions of all the governments so the people of Canada can have 
very good services in health, education and in the welfare

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister. The Minister of Human 
Resources Development continues to claim, and I quote: ``That 
is the whole point of consolidating the existing transfer system, 
to give the provinces the freedom of choice to look at 
programming which suits the individual needs of their own 
areas. At the same time, it is a national program. There are basic 
conditions and those conditions must be met''.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister realize that this federalism, based on 
the imposition of national standards, is radically opposed to 
Quebec's wish to have control over the intervention tools, 
particularly in the manpower training sector?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, not at all. Under the 
proposed consolidated transfer the provinces will have a great 
deal of flexibility in choosing priorities as to which issues they 
wish to handle and how they wish to handle them.
<P>
	Moreover, as we have put in the omnibus bill, there are some 
basic fundamental principles such as those contained presently 
in the Canada Health Act or those presently in the Canada 
assistance plan which protect residency requirements that 
provide the bear minimum requirements we expect the 
provinces to adhere to.
<P>
	When it comes to choosing programs or priorities it is up to 
the provinces. We are giving them the flexibility to make those 
as opposed to many of the restrictions that held back provinces 
from doing the kind of innovative work they wanted to do which 
was clearly and explicitly put forward as one of the assessments 
and recommendations from the House of Commons committee 
which assessed this problem as part of the social review.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
government's position includes two components. The first one 
talks about flexibility, while the second one provides that, if 
necessary, national standards will be applied to other social 
programs.
<P>
	Is the Prime Minister prepared to convene a 
federal-provincial conference to inform the provinces that, 
from now on, his government will impose its views, not through 
its spending power, but by making deeper cuts in the transfers, if 
the national standards are not complied with?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Human Resources Development will 
consult the provinces on his reforms. We are currently 
reviewing the committee report on this issue. In the coming 
weeks and months, the minister will hold bilateral meetings 
with his provincial counterparts.
<P>
	If necessary, and if he feels that it is everyone's wish to have a 
meeting of federal and provincial ministers, I am sure that the 
Minister of Human Resources Development will have no 
objection. Consultations will take place. We do not intend to act 
unilaterally. On the other hand, it is our responsibility to make 
sure that adequate services are provided to all Canadians.

good health. She is sometimes better than her leader, so we are 
happy to have her here.
<P>
	For the last six years that she has been here she has not minded 
being trapped. Now that she knows she is trapped she wants to 
get out. It is kind of a coincidence because we never heard about 
that when she was to be trapped.
<P>
	This is a subject I find terribly disappointing. As of tomorrow 
I will have been a member of Parliament for 32 years. I have 
contributed to the pension plan 15 years too many. What I do not 
like about that kind of question is the implication that when one 
is a member of Parliament one does not earn every cent for the 
service one renders to one's constituents and the people of 
Canada.

<P>
	When I see good members of Parliament like her 
downgrading her own value by telling people she is overpaid, I 
must tell her she is not overpaid. None of us is overpaid. 
Concerning those who are overpaid, the people of Canada will 
do the right thing and kick them out in the next election.
<P>
	I find it ridiculous for the Reform Party to think that members 
of Parliament, who make half the salary of the lowest paid 
hockey players in the NHL, are overpaid.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
are talking about pensions here, not pay. It is hardly any surprise 
to the Prime Minister that I have been talking about MP 
pensions. I have spoken about this for six years.
<P>
	The ratio is that for every dollar I and other members in the 
House contribute the government is putting in six to seven 
dollars. That is the problem people have. We are locked into this 
pension plan.
<P>
	I want to opt out, the voters in Beaver River want me to opt out 
and the Canadian taxpayers probably want all of us to opt out or 
at least make it fair. It is up to the government to find a way. Like 
the songwriter, I am saying please release me, let me go.
<P>
	Why will the government not go beyond what the President of 
the Treasury Board said and make more than cosmetic changes, 
real changes to the MP pension plan?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the member does not want a pension, she wants a pay 
increase. The commission said that at this time perhaps the ideal 
situation would be to give a better salary to MPs and reduce their 
pensions. However, at this time the salaries of bureaucrats and 
all other government employees in Canada have been frozen.
<P>
	Members of Parliament and the public service have had no 
increase for the last three and a half years. Perhaps in the 
package they were overpaid in terms of pension but they are 
certainly underpaid in terms of salary. The balance is pretty 
good for those who are very good members of Parliament. In my 
judgment there are very few members on my side who are not 
earning every cent they are paid.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
government has said it cannot let all MPs opt out because it 
needs to protect the stability of the pension plan.
<P>
	The only things the government is trying to protect are the 
lavish payouts to the Liberal frontbenchers, of whom there are 
many. Perhaps their noses are firmly planted in the trough. Pay 
and pension are different things. Let us bring them into line.
<P>
	Will the government let the Deputy Prime Minister, the 
immigration minister, the fisheries minister, the finance 
minister and even the Prime Minister opt out of this lavish 
pension plan when they have six or more years of service, yes or 
no?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr.

of Canada.
<P>
	In many ridings I see directors of hospitals and chiefs of 
police and dozens of other people being paid out of public 
money making more than members of Parliament. I am not 
ashamed to face the people in my riding and tell them what I earn 
and what members of the House earn.

cannot get the support of the people on the real problems of the

The minister claims that negotiations between Canada and the

witnessing a hardening of the position of spokespersons for the 
European Union, especially Mrs. Bonino, European

that if there is one interest, if there are some people who have an

of the skippers, some of the captains and some of the owners of 
those vessels.
<P>
	Any agreement approved by the Government of Canada 
subject to the mandate set out by the Prime Minister personally

<P>
	The Canadian advisory council on the status of women has

out of a job. Despite this, the Secretary of State for the Status of 
Women keeps Simms on the government payroll until the end of 
October.
<P>
	Both the Prime Minister and the President of the Treasury 
Board have stated in the House that if you do not have a job, you 
do not get paid.
<P>
	How can the government justify this extravagant waste of 
taxpayers' dollars?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there is sometimes a need to keep people who have 
been working for us on the payroll to help us finish a job and put 
everything in order.
<P>
	There is another element to that. When you make an arbitrary 
decision to terminate an employment you give some time to a 
person to adjust to the new reality. It is on these two points that 
we have decided to keep that very competent woman on the

time to adjust to the new reality.

colleagues in her department are packing their bags, Mrs. 
Simms and her assistant are packing theirs to go on this 
wonderful trip to the Philippines.
<P>

redundant and frivolous, will the government commit here and

<P>

question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Page 88 of the Liberal red book states the Conservative 
regime has deliberately undermined our national cultural 
institutions. Given this fact, how can he justify putting a former 
Conservative cabinet minister behind the wheel of the CBC, 
unless it is to score cheap political points for patronage?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I had the opportunity to observe Mr. Beatty in the 
House of Commons when he was a member of the government. 
He has a lot of experience on the Hill. He was elected some 20 
years ago and he has learned a lot.
<P>
	He was available to do the job and I know he will do his best to 
ensure the CBC becomes an organization which will adjust to 
the new realities. His experience in Parliament will help him a 
lot in communicating that goal to employees of the CBC and to 
the Canadian public.

amazing how things change. A year ago the former cabinet

	Given that the general public is fed up with making 
millionaires of defeated politicians and then watching them 
being appointed to federal boards and agencies, and given the

date, will the Prime Minister undertake to restore integrity, as he 
promised in the red book, to the appointment process by 
removing his exclusive franchise on the selection process and 
creating a non-partisan board to make these appointments, of 
course with his final approval?
<P>

continues to increase.
<P>
	Can the Minister of Justice confirm that the Canadian Human 
Rights Commission intends to reduce services to the public once 
again by closing its six regional offices across the country 
because of the Liberal budget cuts?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my information is that 
the Canadian Human Rights Commission is reducing the 
number of regional offices and centralizing the services it offers 
to the Ottawa location.
<P>
	The commission is a body that operates at arm's length from 
government. Its resources have been reduced in recent years 
because of fiscal realities. The way it chooses to respond to that 
reality is a matter of policy for the commission. If it has 
concluded that it can provide the services in the way that has 
been decided on, then that is the way it will proceed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, given that 
Commissioner Max Yalden has expressed concern over the rise 
of intolerance in Canada, does the minister not agree that 
closing these regional offices will undermine the protection of 
rights in federal jurisdictions?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would have thought, 
based on the speeches and comments made by the chief 
commissioner, that his primary concern about the lack of 
tolerance in Canada has not had so much to do with the number 
of regional offices the commission has, but rather the attitudes 
in some quarters about human rights themselves.
<P>
	The commission, which does its work so ably in serving the 
Canadian public, has had to decide, as we all must, how to meet 
its needs with diminished resources. It is apparently confident 
that it can meet those needs with centralized services from 
Ottawa.

	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in an 
article in the <I>Western Producer</I> the minister of agriculture is 
quoted as saying that farmers who have sold to the Canadian 
Wheat Board may have to pay the full freight rate for crops 
delivered before July 31.
<P>
	The minister is telling farmers that the WGTA benefit is 
actually ending before the end of the crop year and not next year 
as promised in the budget. This is unfair.
<P>
	Can the minister at least tell western Canadian farmers by 
what date they must deliver their grain to receive the Crow 
benefit?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when it comes to the 
termination of subsidy programs, obviously it is necessary to 
pick a date on which the subsidy terminates and after which 
payments will no longer be made.
<P>
	In the grains industry in Canada, the key date in terms of the 
crop year is August 1, 1995. It is on August 1, 1995 that the 
subsidy will come to an end.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, farmers 
get hit with the loss of the Crow benefit. Then they suffer more 
losses because of the rail strike and the other strikes. Now they 
cannot even be certain about which grains shipped in this crop 
year will be covered by the Crow benefit.
<P>
	I wonder if there is anything the minister can tell farmers for 
sure. Is the minister telling me that he cannot give them a 
certain, definite date by which they must deliver grain in order 
to receive the Crow benefit?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, obviously the hon. gentleman 
does not understand how the crop year works.
<P>
	Many events flow through the normal production season. It 
has always been August 1 of any given year on which the crop 
year ends and the next crop year begins while deliveries go on 
both before and after that date. One date must be chosen to make 
a determination when certain events will occur. We have picked 
August 1, 1995 as the only logical date that makes sense.
<P>
	In the hon. gentleman's reference with respect to the labour 
dispute that was settled a week ago by legislation, it might have 
been a little more helpful had the hon. gentleman been here to 
vote.

	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the federal government has representatives in 
Berlin today to engage in more talk about the need to improve 
the way that we as nations respond to the world's growing 
environmental crisis. At the same time here in Canada the media 
is speculating about the possible dismantling of Environment 
Canada because the department has become ineffective in 
dealing with our own domestic environmental problems.
<P>
	Can the government confirm today that it will stand with the 
same political will to strengthen the federal role on domestic 
environmental issues as it has shown in the defence of turbot 
conservation and in support of the country's well-meaning but 
nonetheless meaningless position at the Berlin conference?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr.

question is for the Prime Minister. It concerns an issue that he 
raised himself during question period about people being 
presumed innocent until they are found guilty.
<P>
	My question concerns the Pearson airport affair and the fact 
that during the election campaign on this very matter the Prime 
Minister said: ``The people have a right to know all the facts''. 
Since then we have found that there is no finding of fact 
whatsoever to support any wrongdoing. We have since learned 
that he has had a personal involvement.
<P>
	I would like to know from the Prime Minister and the 
government whether or not they will hold a public inquiry on 
this whole matter.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I regret very much that the hon. leader of the fifth party 
has not seen fit to recognize the fact that the Prime Minister 
stood in this House and denied categorically that he was 
involved in any discussions relating to Pearson and that deal. 
That was substantiated by a lawyer who allegedly had been 
present when such a discussion was allegedly to have taken 
place.
<P>
	With respect to Pearson and in response to the hon. 
gentleman's question, anybody who does not think there is 
something wrong with the Pearson deal would have had to be a

	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
have two petitions concerning the extradition of Leonard 
Peltier.
<P>
	The first petition notes that at the time of Leonard Peltier's 
extradition from Canada to the United States, the information 
provided to the Canadian government regarding Mr. Peltier's 
case was fabricated by the U.S. authorities. Since that time, new 
information has emerged which indicates that Leonard Peltier 
was framed for a crime he did not commit and for which he has 
spent the last 18 years in prison. Key evidence was suppressed, 
as found out under the freedom of information act. Perjury was 
rampant throughout the trial and the key witness, Myrtle Poor 
Bear, recanted her evidence publicly.
<P>
	Therefore, the petitioners request that Parliament lobby the 
U.S. government for Mr. Peltier's return to Canada.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, the second petition is similar to the first.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11414"> 11414 </A></B>
<P>
	It asserts that Leonard Peltier is innocent but still remains in 
prison after 18 years. Under the U.S. freedom of information 
laws it was found that the FBI had withheld certain evidence 
which would have been helpful to Mr. Peltier's case. At Mr. 
Peltier's first appeal in 1986 the court concluded that his 
defence at the trial had been hampered by misconduct and 
perjury.
<P>

advocate on behalf of Mr. Peltier to obtain a prison transfer to 
Canada.

offenders are being paroled prematurely or are being released 
without proper treatment and rehabilitation. They also believe 
that those convicted of dangerous and sexual offences should 
remain incarcerated until they have successfully undergone 
treatment and can demonstrate unequivocally that they have 
been completely rehabilitated.

<P>
Question No. 105-<B>Mr. Cummins:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>With regard to the mandatory use of mefloquine by Canadian forces 
personnel, (<I>a</I>) what clinical or field studies did the Department of National 
Defence undertake or fund into the possible adverse effects including the 
impairment of judgment of the mandatory use of mefloquine by Canadian forces 
while in Somalia, both while the personnel were in Somalia and on their return to 
Canada, (<I>b</I>) what clinical or field studies did the Department of National Defence

judgment of the mandatory use of mefloquine by Canadian forces while in

(<I>c</I>) what amount of alcohol was available on a daily basis to Canadian forces 
personnel in Somalia and later in Rwanda who had received the mandatory 
dosage of mefloquine, what adjustments or precautions were made to the dosages 
by those administering the drug and what advice was given to persons required to 
take mefloquine who might be expected to use alcohol during their tour of duty, 
(<I>d</I>) what screening and other precautions were taken by those administering 
mefloquine, and what advice was given to Canadian forces personnel in regard to

the Canadian forces were not subject to the mandatory use of mefloquine in either 
Somalia or Rwanda and why were they not subject to the mandatory requirement 
to take mefloquine and (<I>f</I>) why is the effective dosage of mefloquine taken by 
Canadian forces stronger than the equivalent dosage given U.S. military 
personnel and what are the possible adverse effects of such stronger dosages?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> (a) 
None was conducted and none was deemed necessary.
<P>
	(b) None was conducted and none was deemed necessary.
<P>
	(c) The specific policy regarding the consumption of alcohol 
is left to the field commander who determines the amount of 
alcohol permitted per day during deployment. In Somalia, 
members were not permitted any alcohol during the first six 
weeks of their deployment, following which each member was 
allowed two beers per day, except on special occasions where no 
restrictions were imposed, e.g. regimental birthday. In Rwanda, 
members are permitted two beers per day for six days of the 
week with no alcohol one day a week. The field commander may 
remove these restrictions for special occasions.
<P>
	Until quite recently, there was no scientific evidence that 
personnel taking mefloquine were at an enhanced risk of a 
serious adverse interation when drinking alcohol. Further, the 
prescribing information for mefloquine does not mention 
concern about such an interaction. Thus, when Canadian forces 
members were deployed to Somalia and Rwanda, there was no 
evident need to warn those taking mefloquine about an 
interaction with alcohol. However, a Canadian medical journal 
has recently, on February 15, 1995, reported a  single case of a 
likely serious interaction between mefloquine and copious 
alcohol ingestion which resulted in a temporary psychotic state 
in the patient. This is the first reasonably documented reported 
case among the millions of persons who have taken mefloquine 
worldwide in the last decade, many of whom likely drank 
alcohol, even substantial quantities, hence the risk of such an 
interaction would seem quite small. In light of this report, it is 
felt by the Surgeon General that it is prudent specifically to 
caution members taking mefloquine against the concurrent 
excessive use of alcohol; the necessary direction is being drawn 
up. Reducing the mefloquine dosage to minimize potential 
<P>

<B><A NAME="11415"> 11415 </A></B>
<P>
mefloquine/alcohol interaction was not and is not recommended 
since this would enhance the risk of getting malaria.
<P>
	It is important to state that responsible use of alcohol is 
already the expected norm in the Canadian forces for other 
substantial reasons, e.g., injury control, whether inside or 
outside Canada.
<P>
	(d) The usual precautions for the prescribing of mefloquine 
were employed. The Canadian forces have an education based 
drug and alcohol prevention program, DAPP, to which personnel 
are to be exposed annually. The Canadian airborne regiment had 
a DAPP session for the junior non-commissioned members in 
the fall of 1992 and for senior non-commissioned members and 
officers before departure to Somalia. At the time of deployment, 
there was no published literature that indicated an adverse 
interaction between recreational drugs and mefloquine; 
therefore, specific advice was not given to those who might use 
recreational drugs when taking mefloquine, although it is 
standard policy that recreational drugs are not to be taken by 
Canadian forces members.
<P>
	(e) There has been a longstanding caution against using 
mefloquine among persons for whom dizziness might be 
particularly detrimental. While there is no evidence that this 
caution is necessary, out of prudence, the Canadian forces 
follows it and mefloquine was not and is not used in certain 
occupational groups, primarily pilots and divers. Hence, in 
Somalia and Rwanda, pilots and divers were not to be prescribed 
mefloquine.
<P>
	(f) Mefloquine marketed in Canada is the European 
formulation which has 250 mg of base drug. The U.S. 
formulation has 228 mg of base drug, or 9 per cent less active 
drug. Medical studies have been done on both formulations with 
similar conclusions. It is unlikely that the minimally lower dose 
in the U.S. preparation is of practical significance.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-76, an act to implement certain provisions of the budget 
tabled in Parliament on February 27, 1995, be read the second 
time and referred to a committee; and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Wells (South Shore, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to speak on Bill C-76, an act to 
implement certain provisions of the 1995 budget. I would like, 
however, to preface my discussion on the specific aspects of this 
bill with a few general comments about the budget.
<P>
	The Liberal agenda with regard to deficit reduction was 
clearly outlined in the red book and has been reiterated by the 
Minister of Finance many times over the past 18 months.
<P>
	Unlike the Reform Party we have not made unrealistic 
promises to reduce the deficit overnight. Rather we have set, and 
will continue to set, realistic goals until such time as the deficit 
is eliminated.
<P>
	There is no denying that some of the measures announced in 
this budget are tough. However, the reality is that the time has 
come to make these changes. The Liberal Party campaigned on 
providing good government, and this budget underscores that 
commitment by taking on the challenge of reducing the deficit 
and modernizing government. I acknowledge that adjustments 
will have to be made, but I believe that this will be for the long 
term good of this country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11416"> 11416 </A></B>
<P>
	Personally, I was relieved to note that the cuts announced in 
the budget are fairly uniform from region to region. Unlike last 
year, for instance, when I had to deal with the closure of two 
Canadian forces stations in my riding, Atlantic Canada has not 
received a disproportionate share of the cuts.
<P>
	That said, I would now like to concentrate on the bill before 
us. Where possible I would like to discuss the various aspects of 
this legislation by focusing on the effect that these measures will 
have on the province of Nova Scotia and, in particular, my riding 
of South Shore.
<P>
	One of the most important facets of this legislation is the 
establishment of the Canadian health and social transfer. This 
initiative, which converts established programs financing for 
health and education and the Canada assistance plan into a 
single consolidated block transfer, is a fundamental structural 
change that will result in decisive deficit reduction. The result 
will be a transfer system that is fiscally sustainable and more 
effective in meeting contemporary needs.
<P>
	This approach provides real benefits to both levels of 
government and will reduce a number of longstanding irritants. 
For example, the provinces will be free to pursue their own 
innovative approaches to social security reform and will have 
more control over how they meet their priorities. They will no 
longer be subject to rules stipulating that certain expenditures 
are eligible for cost sharing and others are not. As well, the 
expense of administering cost sharing will be eliminated.
<P>
	Some people have expressed concern that this change in 
funding methods will result in the disintegration of national 
standards. This is simply not so. The transfer will not be totally 
unconditional, nor, as the Minister of Finance stated in his 
budget speech, does flexibility mean a free for all. The 
principles of the Canada Health Act will continue to be 
enforced. There will be no change in the principle that provinces 
must provide social assistance without minimum residency 
requirements. Rather a set of shared principles and objectives 
will be developed in concert with the provinces to underly the 
new transfer.
<P>
	It is also important to note that the equalization program will 
remain intact and will continue to grow. This ensures that 
provinces like Nova Scotia will have the ability to provide all 
Canadians with a reasonably comparable level of service 
regardless of where they live. Overall in the Atlantic provinces 
equalization growth offsets Canada health and social transfer 
reductions so that overall transfers will increase slightly to these 
provinces. In fact, in Nova Scotia the percentage change in 
provincial transfer entitlements has increased by .09 per cent for 
1996-97.
<P>
	The next facet of this bill that I would like to cover is the 
elimination of the Atlantic freight subsidies under the Atlantic 
Region Freight Assistance Act and the Maritime Freight Rates 
Act.
<P>
<B>(1520 ) </B>
<P>
	These subsidies were provided to rail, trucking and marine 
companies to defray the cost of shipping goods within the 
Atlantic region and to central Canadian markets. However, a 
recent analysis of this program has shown that they are no longer 
serving their original purpose.
<P>
	For instance, almost half of the $99 million spent annually 
goes to ship goods within provincial boundaries. High tariff 
barriers that restricted access by regional producers to markets 
in the United States and abroad no longer exist.
<P>
	Shipments to central Canada represent a small and declining 
portion of the Atlantic region's market. In fact, only 13 per cent 
of goods produced are sent to central Canada. Goods are also 
being shipped further than need be in order to collect the 
subsidy.
<P>
	The elimination of this tariff will lead to increased efficiency 
and, very importantly, will reduce the burden on taxpayers and 
shift the cost of providing transportation onto those who use and 
directly benefit from the system.
<P>
	I was pleased to note that Transport Canada will be providing 
$326 million in transitional funding to the Atlantic provinces to 
alleviate shipper hardship, upgrade highways and transportation 
infrastructure on a cost shared basis.
<P>
	By turning away from broad subsidization and toward focused 
and responsible investment in infrastructure and technology, 
Transport Canada is helping to build an integrated and 
affordable national transportation system, something that will 
benefit all of Atlantic Canada rather than just one specific 
sector.
<P>
	Bill C-76 also contains amendments to the workforce 
adjustment directive, the Public Service Employment Act and 
the Public Sector Compensation Act that will facilitate a fair and 
orderly downsizing of the public service.
<P>
	It is estimated that about 45,000 federal public service jobs 
will be affected by the measures implemented in this budget as a 
result of program review. Some of these jobs will be transferred 
to the private sector. Other reductions will be realized through 
attrition, voluntary departures and layoffs. The impact that this 
will have on the Atlantic region has not yet been determined, but 
all indications are that a large portion of these cuts will be made 
in the national capital region. This is due to the fact that 
approximately one-third of the total public service workforce is 
located in this region.
<P>
	These cuts are the unfortunate part of the transition from a 
public service that tries to be all things to all people to one that 
offers Canadians a more limited number of high value programs 
and services. The approach taken by previous governments of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11417"> 11417 </A></B>
<P>
implementing across the board cuts is no longer a viable 
solution.
<P>
	This government is at the point where such a measure would 
only result in good programs being penalized and working 
conditions suffering. For too long federal employees at every 
level have had to contend with heavier workloads and fewer 
resources. It is now time for government to change, to 
streamline its operations. As was noted in the 1994 budget 
announcement, it is time to ensure that government's 
diminished resources are directed to the highest priority 
requirements, to those areas where the federal government is 
best placed to deliver services.
<P>
	As a result of this review, it has become necessary for the 
government to enact changes to the various pieces of legislation 
that govern the public service. These changes are necessary to 
achieve our fiscal objectives.
<P>
	Over the next three years there will be major changes to the 
way government services are delivered. As a result, some 
temporary measures are required to ensure that where there is no 
work there is no pay.
<P>
	Another measure in this legislation will see the termination of 
payments under the Public Utilities Income Tax Transfer Act. 
This program involves the federal government transferring to 
the provinces and territories 95 per cent of federal income taxes 
paid by privately owned electrical and gas utilities. In turn, the 
provinces were to transfer this amount to privately owned 
utilities. Nova Scotia is the only province that actually utilizes 
the transfer as it was intended, and I anticipate that Nova Scotia 
Power and its customers throughout the province will bear the 
brunt of this budget measure.
<P>
	I am against this particular cut because it means that power 
bills in Nova Scotia will increase. However, I realize that other 
provinces are going to have to deal with the loss of this transfer 
money as well in one way or another.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to reiterate my overall support for the 
1995 budget. I am very pleased to be part of a government that 
has the will and determination to tackle this country's deficit 
problem. It is about time that concrete action was taken.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
unlike the members opposite, Bill C-76 leaves me with a bitter 
taste. I find it hard to believe that the Minister of Finance does 
not realize the impact, for the country as a whole, of this bill 
designed to implement major changes, particularly as regards 
those transfers to the provinces which relate to social, health and 
post-secondary programs, and also to the Canada Assistance 
Plan. The mere mention of these programs makes you realize 
that the government means business.
<P>
	Over the next three years, the Liberal government will cut $7 
billion in the transfers to the provinces. What should Quebec 
expect? In 1995, the reductions in transfers to Quebec will be 
minimal, for the obvious reason that a referendum is expected 
this year. The government does not want to make waves in 
Quebec with this budget. However, when you see how generous 
the federal government is with Quebec, you realize that, day 
after day, it is implementing several strategies, instead of 
governing and creating jobs, as it promised to do. In fact, the 
Liberals were elected precisely because they promised to create 
jobs. But, right now, they are only interested in implementing 
their strategy. In 1996-97, however, things will change 
drastically; they will get much tougher for Quebec, which will 
have to make do with a $650 million shortfall.
<P>
	It was recently said in Toronto that Canada had to make 
Quebecers suffer. That process has started. The government is 
starting to make Quebecers suffer with cuts in the transfers, and 
the process will continue until 1997-98. Quebecers are told that 
they will have to negotiate. How? Time will tell. Quebec has 
been trying to negotiate with this Parliament for decades, but we 
have never managed to agree.
<P>
	Consequently, I fail to see why the federal government would 
want to renegotiate the issue of transfers to the provinces. The 
government willingly complies with the demands of the rich 
provinces, particularly Ontario, British Columbia and Alberta.
<P>
	Is the government considering splitting the resource envelope 
for the main transfers by using as a criterion the provinces' 
respective populations? If so, Quebec would have to absorb 41.7 
per cent of the cuts to transfers. This would mean a shortfall of 
close to $2 billion for Quebec, between 1997 and 1998. The 
federal government is indeed deliberately trying to make 
Quebec suffer. What really hurts though is that it is Quebecers 
who do most of the damage, and I am thinking in particular of 
the Minister of Finance, the Prime Minister, and the Minister of 
Labour.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	Transfer payments to the provinces are not a bonus. These are 
transfers of tax revenues paid for by the workers in each 
province.
<P>
	When Quebec finally patriates the $30 billion in taxes that the 
people of Quebec pay the federal government every year, then 
we will have all the resources we need to govern ourselves.
<P>
	As a result of the federal government's cuts in transfer 
payments to the provinces between 1982 and 1993, taxes paid by 
Quebecers to the federal government increased 143 per cent. 
Meanwhile, federal transfer payments increased only 50 per 
cent.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11418"> 11418 </A></B>
<P>
	As usual, these cuts will come down hardest on the most 
vulnerable members of our society. They will cut the federal 
government's share of financing for social programs, from 37.8 
per cent to 28.5 per cent within four years. Is this just another 
way to hit Quebec? Cuts and more cuts, but they never refer to 
putting people back to work in this country. And working at well 
paid jobs, so they can work with dignity.
<P>
	As a result of this budget, the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean 
area lost 285 jobs at the Canadian Forces base in Bagotville, 
although Quebec has only 13 per cent of Canada's defence 
infrastructure and staff. And it seems that an experimental farm 
in Normandin is either going to be closed down or lose a number 
of jobs. There is still a great deal of uncertainty among 
employees at Radio-Canada in Chicoutimi and at the National 
Film Board. However, it is common knowledge that this area 
was hit hard by the recession and unemployment. For several 
years, it has had the highest unemployment rate. I do not think 
my region and my riding will be able to overcome these 
problems if we stay within this system.
<P>
	Do hon. members not realize that by putting the unemployed 
and welfare recipients back to work, we will increase tax 
revenues, and that these tax revenues will in the end help Canada 
out of its precarious financial position?
<P>
	And by the way, as we put people back to work, there is 
another way to save a lot of money: eliminate duplication and 
overlap of services in many departments, including the 
Department of Health and the Department of Human Resources 
Development, since the provinces already have similar 
departments.
<P>
	I would say that 90 per cent of the people who come to see me 
at my riding office are at their wits' end. They are no longer 
eligible for unemployment insurance, so they are on welfare. We 
have no way of helping them to get out of this morass. And I do 
not think that the bill before the House today is the answer to all 
these problems.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	I think we should take the surplus in the Unemployment 
Insurance Fund, give it to the provinces and let them select and 
conduct the courses and provide training that would be 
appropriate for these people. I am sure that everyone would 
benefit.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Anna Terrana (Vancouver East, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to the 
budget for several reasons, one being I believe it addresses 
Canada's present needs and prepares us well for tomorrow's 
challenges.
<P>
	The budget recognizes the need to remain within our fiscal 
parameters. It recognizes the fiscal realities with which we are 
faced and it reminds us that we as Canadians cherish certain 
fundamental values and principles.
<P>
	The other reason is I have a number of comments to make.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In the election campaign, the Liberal Party promised the 
deficit would be reduced to 3 per cent of the gross domestic 
product by the end of the 1996-97 fiscal year. This required 
drastic measures. Canadians have told us that they do not want 
tax increases and that they want cuts in government spending.
<P>
	I think this is what we have done. However, if government 
spending is to be cut, it means services have to be cut. I worry 
about this, even though the financial world is satisfied.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In nationwide budget consultations Canadians told us they 
wanted to be treated fairly and equitably. They wanted the 
government to reassess its priorities and they were prepared to 
undertake certain measures and see certain reforms if they were 
to pave the road and build the foundations for a stronger and 
more prosperous Canada.
<P>
	Vancouver East is no different in this regard. In a series of 
meetings with my constituents, one message was recurrent. In 
defining the role of government and reviewing Canada's 
problems and Canada's delivery of services we should be fair 
and equitable. The residents of Vancouver East wanted to see by 
and large a fairer tax system. The budget improves tax fairness.
<P>
	Large corporations are expected to make a larger contribution 
to help bring the deficit down. Both the large corporations tax 
rate and the corporate surtax were increased by 12.5 per cent. 
The capital tax on banks and similar large deposit taking 
institutions will also be temporarily increased, but we must do 
better. At the same time the government did not increase 
personal income tax for the second year in a row.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In an attempt to spread the cuts among Canadians, a lot of 
programs have been eliminated. This concerns me a lot. It 
concerns me particularly because women, immigrants, children 
and poor families need these programs.
<P>
	Lots of families in my riding of Vancouver East are in crisis. 
Lots of children in my riding will not complete their education. 
They are caught in a cycle of poverty they cannot escape. These 
children need help with programs that provide encouragement. 
The announced cuts could have dire consequences.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11419"> 11419 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The residents of Vancouver East told me they do not want an 
erosion of our social programs or the government to abandon its 
traditional role in preserving social programs.
<P>
	I support the government's continued efforts to encourage and 
instil in individuals a greater sense of self-confidence and 
independence. The government recognizes the need to protect 
the weak and the needy, those who are unable to care for 
themselves. We recognize there can be new partnerships that can 
result in greater efficiencies and greater responsiveness.
<P>
	The provinces will now have greater ability to design 
programs more suitable and appropriate rather than being bound 
by rigid rules. Nonetheless, there will continue to be national 
standards for the new Canada social transfers, and the provinces 
will be required to provide social assistance without imposing 
any minimum residency requirement.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Naturally the new system is not perfect. I fear that we will not 
be able to ensure all the provinces apply the programs 
uniformly, and, as a result, social programs could be seriously 
eroded.
<P>
	However, if these measures are not taken, we could find 
ourselves, in a few years, completely without social programs. 
The change in transfers will come into effect next year. The 
federal government is currently negotiating changes with the 
provinces in the hopes that the provinces will administer the 
social programs better, because they are more attuned to the 
needs of their population. These changes represent cuts in 
transfer payments of $2.5 billion in 1996-97 and $4.5 billion in 
1997-98.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	Despite these figures, the cuts to the provinces are not as deep 
as the cuts at the federal level. We have to work together to 
ensure that those who really need assistance are not abandoned.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As for immigration, we all know immigrants have played an 
important role in the building of our country and in the building 
of Vancouver East. Immigration has been a success story in 
Canada and doubtless Canada has benefited from the enormous 
contributions of immigrants to Canada. Immigrants have helped 
to build our nation and they will continue to help build our 
future.
<P>
	Vancouver East is evidence of the outstanding contributions 
of immigrants and is home to a cross-section of numerous 
ethnic cultures. Vancouver East is a culturally diverse riding, 
with half of the riding being comprised of immigrants, the 
largest group being the Chinese. Less than one-third of the 
residents of Vancouver East were born in British Columbia, one 
of  the lowest figures in B.C. We must continue to encourage 
immigration.
<P>
	Many individuals have communicated to me that effective 
integration of newcomers is essential to their success. On the 
other hand, some have noted the substantial cost of the programs 
and the need for everyone to live up to their responsibilities.
<P>
	A clear intention of the budget is to reduce the federal deficit. 
For the Department of Citizenship and Immigration this means 
re-examining its priorities. In the nationwide consultations 
conducted by the Department of Citizenship and Immigration 
the public stated immigration, refugee and citizenship programs 
were valid and necessary for the development of Canada and 
that there was little room for cuts to expenditures.
<P>
	More recently under both the budget and program review we 
have seen the implementation of cost saving measures and a 
shift in some of the cost burden from the taxpayer to those who 
benefit directly from our programs and services, including the 
introduction of a new right of landing fee set at $975 per adult 
over 19 years of age.
<P>
	I greatly hope the new fee will be fair and equitable in its 
practical application, that it will not unduly restrict or even 
remotely discourage immigration to our country, however 
alluring and magnificent our country may be. Granted, the 
program provides a loan option for those individuals less 
equipped to meet the new fee. However, we must be flexible and 
we must be accommodating.
<P>
	What if individuals come from deeply impoverished nations 
where opportunity of education is unavailable to all and where 
the skills and training required to function and be successful in 
our society are lacking? The loan option is said to be based on 
one's ability to repay the loan within a certain time period. How 
can these individuals without the necessary tools to acquire 
meaningful employment be realistically expected to repay the 
loans within a three-year period?
<P>
	I hope the requirement to repay the loans will be relaxed under 
certain circumstances to allow individuals sufficient time to 
develop the skills and training to allow them to find employment 
or the means by which they might better be able to repay the loan 
while at the same time independently maintain a decent standard 
of living.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The last measure I would like to discuss is Canada's health 
care system. The principles set forth in our health act must be 
defended and maintained. They are: universality, 
comprehensiveness, flexibility, portability and public 
administration.
<P>
	In the budget speech, we said, and I quote: ``For this 
government, those are fundamental''. We must continue to 
protect them, as they are. The government said it would abide by 
these principles and it will.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11420"> 11420 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I believe my task is to make sure the poor do not become 
poorer but are helped to get out of poverty, that women can 
realize themselves and can be assisted in their endeavours, that 
immigrants continue to be accepted and respected, and that 
families be helped through difficult times and stressful 
situations. That is a mammoth task which can be tackled only if I 
can count on my constituents and on all Canadians. I am looking 
forward to working with them for a better future. I know they are 
willing to work with me.
<P>
	Overall the budget is a success. We must be vigilant in our 
commitment to supporting the pillars of liberalism: freedom of 
the individual, equality of opportunity and compassion for those 
who have less. I am very committed to these fundamental 
principles and I know all of my colleagues are as well. Let us 
work together.
<P>
<B>(1545 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak on Bill C-76, the budget 
implementation act, which is intended to legislate into law 
certain aspects of the government's budget tabled in February. I 
would like to focus my remarks today on how this bill and 
budget impacts upon Canadians.
<P>
	``Government really does know what is best for you, rather 
than what you know yourself'', seems to be the message of this 
government. Where is its trust in Canadians? Where is its 
confidence in individuals, families and communities to make 
their own best choices? I will attempt to illustrate the reasons for 
my concerns in the next few moments.
<P>
	I want to review the four principles the government put 
forward in its budget. First, the government says it must get its 
own fiscal house in order and focus on cutting spending, not 
raising taxes. Before this budget was presented, I heard 
Canadians say they were taxed to death. I heard Canadians say 
they wanted no new taxes. Well, guess what? In this budget the 
government gave them new tax.
<P>
	The second principle is that the priorities of this country must 
reflect the needs of the people. Canadians need an economic 
plan that promotes jobs and growth. I do not think the 
government gets it yet, that government does not create real 
jobs; individuals create real jobs. The money left in the hands of 
taxpayers will create real and lasting jobs.
<P>
	The third principle it put forward was frugality, that every tax 
dollar counts. I ask this government, does that include the tax 
dollars that are going to go toward your pensions? Does that 
make those tax dollars count, obscene pensions by this 
government?
<P>
	The fourth principle is that we must be fair among regions and 
among Canadians. Again, I take that point. Is an illegal pension 
plan for MPs fair to Canadians?
<P>
	I would like to add a fifth item to this list of principles, and I 
wish the principles had been followed. This principle is one to 
add. We affirm the value and dignity of the individual person 
and the importance of strengthening and protecting the family 
unit as essential to the well-being of individuals in society.
<P>
	The Reform Party has recognized the importance of family as 
a principle since its very inception. The Reform Party has 
established a task force on the family, which I chair, that is 
developing policies that specifically address issues that directly 
affect the family. This government must shift its focus and 
seriously consider the impact of the policies, both in its budget 
and otherwise, and how they apply to the Canadian family.
<P>
	First, I would like to take a look at the debt-deficit 
circumstances of our country. This government, as with 
previous governments, is pursuing a reckless fiscal policy that 
sees our national debt mushrooming to alarming proportions. 
The total national debt as of today, April 3, 1995, stands at $540 
billion plus.
<P>
	The government has not laid out its plans to achieve a 
balanced budget yet. It has only set a target of 3 per cent of GNP 
for a deficit to GNP ratio. This target is totally unrealistic and 
duplicitous. Our debt continues to grow with an ever present 
deficit. The government's own statistics in its budget documents 
show that since it has been in power the debt will mushroom to 
$508 billion in 1993-94 and to a projected $603 billion in 
1996-97, all other things being equal, $100 billion more in debt 
within its mandate, and it considers this a wise budget.
<P>
	The percentage of net public debt to GDP will increase from 
71.4 per cent in 1993-94 to 73.4 per cent in 1996-97. World 
standards would say that is completely unacceptable. The 
interest payments on that debt have increased from $38 billion 
in 1993-94 to a projected amount of over $50 billion in 
1996-97.
<P>
	I go back to my original statement: What do these statistics 
mean to the Canadian family? First, it means Canadian families 
are overtaxed. They have less disposable income because of 
their high level of taxation, and that makes a virtual necessity 
for two income earners to support a household. This government 
is driving two parents out of the home to make a living.
<P>
	As Statistics Canada recently reported, family income has 
actually declined in real terms since 1989; that is, from $56,000 
to $52,000 in real 1993 dollars. That is a decline of 7.5 per cent 
from 1989 to 1993. Meanwhile, the number of dual income 
families has been forced to increase. The decline in family 
incomes from 1992-93 was 2.6 per cent alone. In the meantime, 
day care demands increased thanks to taxation and government 
policy.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11421"> 11421 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	The second thing these debt and deficit statistics mean is that 
money will not be available for social programs that Canadian 
families require.
<P>
	The interest on the debt is consuming one-third of our tax 
dollars. This means that with increasing debt and added deficits, 
less and less money will be available to fund our needed social 
programs. The government claims to be protecting the interests 
of Canadians and their families. Yet even in this budget, under 
the new Canada social transfers, block transfers to the provinces 
will actually decrease from $26.9 billion in 1996-97 to $25 
billion in 1997-98.
<P>
	What is needed? A fiscal remedy is needed. The focus of 
government spending on need and relief for the Canadian 
taxpayer and family is needed. A whole new approach and focus 
is needed by this government. Canadian families and 
individuals must be empowered to create opportunities for 
themselves and for their future. The government must get off the 
backs of Canadians. This is the Reform Party's approach.
<P>
	In February, before the government tabled its budget, our 
party released its taxpayers' budget, the Reform Party's plan to 
balance the federal budget and provide social and economic 
security for the 21st century. This unprecedented action of 
presenting a budget before the federal budget combines both a 
remedy and relief.
<P>
	First, this budget offers a clear solution for our fiscal 
problems and the debt-deficit crisis. This plan includes a 
balanced budget within the life of this Parliament. A balanced 
budget will result in a government that lives within its means.
<P>
	How do we achieve this? With $10 billion in savings from 
government operations and $15 billion in affordable savings 
from targeted social programs. The government has not yet 
released its plan for achieving this vital goal, whereas Reform 
has, both during the election campaign and now.
<P>
	It is interesting to note that in Reform's zero in three plan 
back in the election campaign, we predicted cutbacks of 30,000 
in public service positions. This government at that time said 
absolutely nothing. Now it throws 45,000 public servants out of 
work and still keeps digging a bigger debt hole. That is not 
giving the full story to the Canadian people.
<P>
	Reform, by contrast, reduces government spending honestly 
and realistically. At the same time, Reform offers a promise of 
empowerment for Canadian families. We define empowerment 
as the provision of better tools and increased opportunities for 
individuals, groups and provinces to improve their own social 
and economic security. This is relief.
<P>
	How would Reform empower Canadians and Canadian 
families? First, the taxpayer protection act, to give the taxpayer 
a say in how government spends their hard-earned tax dollars. 
This would say first, that government spending and taxes would 
have to be balanced over the business cycle. Second, total 
government spending and taxes could not exceed a constant 
proportion of national income and could only be increased by 
extraordinary legislative means. Such an act would prevent the 
reoccurrence or continuation of our debt-deficit problem, which 
has plagued government for so many years. It could be 
somewhat like a taxpayers' rehab centre for a government 
addicted to overspending. It would force discipline upon the 
spending addictions of both government and its politicians.
<P>
	Second, the empowerment of Canadian families would come 
through reform of our social security programs. Politicians have 
always worked with the premise that Canadians' personal 
security needs are best met by government. This has led to a 
centralized, bureaucratic, expensive system that is insensitive to 
individual needs. This has ignored both the ability and 
opportunity of many Canadians to help themselves and others.
<P>
	Right now total spending on social programs in Canada 
exceeds $140 billion. That is $18,000 for every family of four in 
Canada. Reform would suggest that government programs may 
in fact be the worst way of providing for the social security 
needs of some of those Canadians.
<P>
	We would like less government intervention in personal 
security. We have suggested the RPSP to put the future plans of 
Canadians in their own hands.
<P>
<B>(1555 ) </B>
<P>
	I would also like to see less government intervention in 
families, where, rather than a national day care program, 
government rewards and recognizes families for taking care of 
their own children. We need less, not more government. We 
need the empowerment of families, communities and local 
organizations.
<P>
	Reform has a vision for building a new and better Canada. The 
security of Canada is not in government but in allowing wise 
choices to be made by families and individuals in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos (Saint-Denis, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to stand in the House of Commons today 
to speak on Bill C-76. This budget shows once again our 
commitment to consulting Canadians.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance has delivered a fair and honest 
budget. It is a tough budget, some may argue, but the measures 
introduced are essential if we are to face economic realities and 
reach our fiscal targets.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	For the second year in a row, the Liberal government has 
refused to reduce the deficit at the expense of the Canadian 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11422"> 11422 </A></B>
<P>
taxpayer. This budget will allow us to meet our  deficit reduction 
goals without increasing personal income taxes.
<P>
	This budget illustrates the difficult choices that confronted us 
when we undertook to revamp federal programs in order to 
increase efficiency without compromising the priorities of 
Canadians.
<P>
	The budget reflects the most thorough review of federal 
programs ever. Through program review, the government 
identified $16.9 billion in cuts to programs over the next three 
years, not including transfers to individuals and to the 
provinces.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Some additional highlights of this year's budget I would like 
to highlight are the reform of government programs and 
procedures to eliminate waste and abuse and ensure value for 
Canadian taxpayers. We have just completed the largest 
program review ever initiated.
<P>
	The second is the move toward a fairer tax system, including 
tighter rules for tax deferrals, foreign and family trusts, R and D 
incentives, and higher taxes for corporations and large banks. 
For too long corporations have been more or less excluded from 
taxation. This is one step in the right direction in ensuring that 
everyone bears the burden of this deficit.
<P>
	Another highlight is the delivery of a new vision of the federal 
government's role in the economy that includes a reduction in 
business subsidies by 60 per cent over three years from $3.8 
billion in 1994-95 to $1.5 billion in 1997.
<P>
	At this point I would like to focus the House's attention on one 
aspect of the budget that unfairly affects many Canadians of 
Greek origin as well as other veterans. That is the announced 
changes to the war veterans allowance program that would 
return this program to its original intent. As a result, the war 
veterans allowance and related benefits have been discontinued 
for former members of the resistance. Also, all allied veterans 
with post-war residency are required to reside in Canada six 
months out of the year if they wish to continue to receive these 
benefits.
<P>
	These changes will affect approximately 2,895 former 
resistance members in the Montreal region of whom 90 per cent 
are Canadians of Greek origin.
<P>
	On March 2, 1992 the War Veterans Allowance Act was 
amended to remove the right of applicants with service limited 
to a resistance group to qualify for benefits. However, existing 
domestic resistance service recipients were to be grandfathered 
if they maintained their residency in Canada. Moreover, foreign 
resistance recipients were required to return to Canada and 
resume residency within one year or risk losing their entitlement 
to war veterans benefits forever.
<P>
	More specifically, section 6.1 provided grandfathering to 
those who qualified on or before March 2, 1992 and would 
continue for life if they remained residents in Canada. There 
were approximately 700 resistance  claimants who returned to 
resume residency in Canada. For some this brought on certain 
hardships: separation from their families residing abroad, 
resettlement, isolation.
<P>
	While Canada is the only country in the world to offer such an 
allowance to members of the resistance, the announced changes 
will bring on added hardships to all individuals who depend on 
this source of income.
<P>
	Many of my constituents have raised concerns about the 
problem of transferring individuals between the ages of 60 and 
65 from one social program to another. To date the government, 
through the Minister of National Defence and the Minister of 
Finance, have shown sensitivity and understanding toward this 
problem, especially regarding those people who are not yet 
eligible for old age security.
<P>
<B>(1600 ) </B>
<P>
	Benefits were initially scheduled to be discontinued about 
three months after the budget was tabled. However through the 
interventions of myself and other members of Parliament we 
have been given the assurance these cuts will not go into effect 
until August 31, 1995.
<P>
	I asked how much would the government really save by 
having a group of persons transferred from one social program 
to another, from war veterans allowance to welfare, or by having 
a group, the allied veterans, return to resume residence in 
Canada. There are about 740 in total living abroad. The average 
age of allied veterans is 75.
<P>
	We must compare the social impact of such a move. Would we 
really save by having these people return to Canada and take 
advantage of our social programs including health care?
<P>
	I consider the situation of these individuals as unjust and I 
made recommendations to the Minister of Finance and the 
Minister of National Defence on this issue, as have other 
members of the House.
<P>
	There has been some concern that benefits are being paid out 
to persons who are no longer living. Therefore, I and other 
colleagues have made recommendations that individuals could 
register with the Canadian embassy in their respective 
countries.
<P>
	I appreciate the government's interest in finding a just 
solution to this problem and thank the Minister of National 
Defence for agreeing to review this aspect of the program 
review in light of the difficulties these people will face in 
returning to Canada.
<P>
	I will continue to work with many colleagues in the House, the 
Hellenic Canadian Congress, the veterans associations of the 
Hellenic community and other concerned parties to see the 
concerns of these individuals are addressed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11423"> 11423 </A></B>
<P>
	Canada has not forgotten the contributions these veterans 
made to the preservation of democracy during World War II. It is 
the only country to offer this type of allowance to former 
members of the resistance. I am proud that Canada offered this.
<P>
	The issue of fraudulent claims has also been brought forward 
as a reason for terminating the allowance. While there may have 
been certain individuals who took advantage of the generosity in 
this program, the majority are deserving applicants. The 
government did not terminate the program because of the few 
individuals who took advantage of Canada's generosity.
<P>
	Cost effectiveness was the reason this allowance was 
terminated. The targets will not be met when we consider the 
cost to be incurred once these individuals cross over to welfare.
<P>
	Most significant in the budget is that it marks the beginning of 
a new era, a new way of managing the federation. It is a simpler, 
more efficient way that accords with provincial responsibilities 
to design and deliver key services. Many have seen this move as 
a move away from traditional Liberalism based on the principle 
of shared social responsibility.
<P>
	Over the years successive Liberal governments have shown 
their commitment to this value through their actions. Many of 
the laws and policies they enacted remain the basis of our 
system of social support through which we pool our resources to 
create programs that benefit all Canadians and help sustain 
people through difficult times.
<P>
	We are presently in difficult times. The test for our 
government will be to rise to the challenge and ensure the 
announced social program transfers will not jeopardize our 
standards of universal health care, unemployment insurance, 
old age security, the Canada assistance plan and the Canada 
pension plan.
<P>
	These are part of the Liberal legacy and must remain in place 
if we are to continue to be the country that is the envy of the 
world. Poverty remains a growing problem for Canadian society 
as we try to overcome the economic challenges facing our 
country.
<P>
	While the budget does not, as some members of the 
opposition would like to believe, make its cuts on the backs of 
our poor, their future must be brighter. Furthermore, the 
structure of the economy is changing. As a result the family 
structure is also undergoing changes. There have been enormous 
increases in single parent families and in families with both 
parents working and in families living in poverty, as is the case 
in my riding.
<P>
	The failed economic and social policies of the Conservative 
government have left over 4.2 million Canadians living in 
poverty, of whom 1.2 million are children. Sixty-two per cent of 
families headed by single mothers are living in poverty with 
their incomes failing.
<P>
	The Liberals made a commitment in the red book to work 
toward greater equality of social conditions among Canadians, 
to redistribute opportunity more broadly so that many more 
people have a decent standard of living and can build good lives 
for themselves and their families, allowing them to live with 
dignity and respect.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We must do everything we can to maintain our social 
programs at current levels despite expenditure cuts. Like all 
Canadians, we believe that we must strive to balance the budget. 
We will achieve this responsibly and realistically, without 
compromising the gains we have made over the last 16 months 
in the areas of job creation and economic growth, and without 
compromising the values and priorities of all Canadians and of 
the Liberal government.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, education, health and social assistance come 
under provincial jurisdiction. Over time, however, Ottawa has 
gradually encroached on these areas of provincial jurisdiction 
through its spending powers. The provinces must abide by these 
standards in order to receive federal funds. In seeking to enforce 
its national standards, the federal government was compelled to 
put in place a large public service, thus duplicating the 
provincial public service.
<P>
	These expenditures, also known as overlap or duplication, are 
costing us roughly $1 billion a year at the Department of Health 
and $1.8 billion a year at the Department of Human Resources 
Development, at a time when there is so much whining about 
budget difficulties. Bill C-76, an act to implement certain 
provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on February 27, 
1995, does exactly what its title indicates, that is, allow the 
government to implement certain measures announced in the 
finance minister's last budget.
<P>
	It is crucial that all Quebecers understand this bill, which may 
appear daunting at first because it deals with financial 
management links between the federal government and the 
provinces. These realities are very far removed from our fellow 
citizens. Quebec men and women have better things to do at 
supper time than talk about equalization, established programs 
financing, or the Canada Assistance Plan. It is, however, 
essential to pay attention because these three programs alone 
represent transfers to the provinces in the order of $38 billion 
for 1995-96.
<P>
	Federal contributions to these programs are falling 
dramatically and systematically from year to year. According to 
Quebec's Minister of Finance, ``Between 1977 and 1994, the 
federal government's share of social program funding in Quebec 
for health, education and social assistance dropped from 47.6 
per cent to 37.8 per cent. The finance minister's budget points to 
a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11424"> 11424 </A></B>
<P>
dramatic decline in the federal share, which would fall to 28.5 
per cent by 1997-98''.
<P>
	It is essential that citizens pay attention to equalization, 
established programs financing and the Canada Assistance Plan, 
because it is there that the federal government is hiding a large 
part of its cuts. Some refer to this as the offloading of the federal 
deficit onto the provinces. These cuts will cost Quebec 
taxpayers close to $2 billion in 1997-98.
<P>
	It is essential for the men and women of Quebec to understand 
how these programs work and the changes proposed today 
through Bill C-76, because this bill is the basic element of the 
federal proposal in the referendum debate.
<P>
	Quebecers may have heard the Minister of Foreign Affairs 
speak of renewed federalism before the budget was tabled. He 
travelled throughout Quebec saying, ``You just wait and see, 
after the budget is tabled, we will talk about a new Canada''. 
Others may have heard some federal spokespersons talk about 
decentralized federalism. The people must be told that these 
proposals are based on the bill before us today and that is why I 
urge them to pay particular attention to this bill.
<P>
	The finance minister's budget wants to impose on us what we 
rejected in the 1992 referendum. Let us have a closer look at the 
federal government's proposal as compared to the sovereignty 
option offered by the Quebec government to its people.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	To do so, we must understand how tax transfers are made 
between the federal government and the provinces. For social 
assistance, health and education, these transfers are made under 
three major programs.
<P>
	The first one, the fiscal equalization program, is prescribed by 
the constitution. It is the program under which wealth is 
redistributed among the wealthier and poorer Canadian 
provinces. Quebec is now one of the poorer provinces. In 1982, 
the federal government capped the amount of equalization 
payments.
<P>
	Last January-that is, January 1994-the Liberal government 
extended this cap for another five years with Bill C-3. By 
putting a cap on equalization payments, the federal government 
is defeating the very purpose of the program, which is to help 
bridge the gap between wealthier and poorer provinces. Since 
the equalization program was dealt with in another bill, namely 
Bill C-3, there is nothing about it in Bill C-76.
<P>
	The second major program governing fiscal relations between 
the federal government and the provinces is called established 
programs financing (EPF). Through this program, the federal 
government provides financial assistance to the provinces in the 
areas of health and postsecondary education.
<P>
	When the EPF was first introduced in 1977, federal transfers 
were supposed to be calculated on a per capita basis and 
indexed. But as the federal government sees its financial 
capability shrink away, it transfers less and less money.
<P>
	The third major program is the Canada assistance plan, also 
known as CAP. This program governs federal transfer payments 
to the provinces for social assistance. In Quebec, the payments 
made under this program cover 50 per cent of social assistance 
costs.
<P>
	What does Bill C-76 provide for regarding established 
programs financing and the Canada assistance plan? It calls for 
these programs to be abolished and replaced with a new program 
called Canadian social transfer. And the proposed changes 
would take effect in 1996-97.
<P>
	The Canadian social transfer has two main characteristics. 
First, it will save the federal government some money. Indeed, 
the government is taking advantage of this change to 
substantially reduce its contribution to the new program. The 
second feature of the CST is the fact that, even if the federal 
government provides more limited financing, it reserves the 
right to impose standards and requirements to the provinces, as a 
condition to that financing.
<P>
	In 1996-97, the first year of the new system, the federal 
government will contribute $2.5 billion less than what it is 
currently providing to the provinces through the programs 
which it is proposing to replace. In Quebec's case, this means a 
loss of $650 million. In 1997-98, the resource envelope for the 
provinces will be reduced by $4.5 billion, which could mean a 
$1.2-billion loss for Quebec.
<P>
	All told, the federal government is reducing its current 
transfers to the provinces for health, social assistance and 
post-secondary programs by $7 billion. Moreover, it does so 
while introducing a new program called the Canada Social 
Transfer.
<P>
	The government should at least say: ``We have run out of 
money and are forced to stop contributing to the financing of 
these programs which, in any case, fall under provincial 
jurisdiction. Consequently, we leave you with the responsibility 
of managing these programs''. If the government did that, it 
would eliminate duplication and overlapping, and it would also 
save close to $3 billion in administrative costs. But that is much 
too simple and logical for this government.
<P>
	The federal government would rather continue to raise our 
taxes, on gas, for instance, waste our money by duplicating 
provincial initiatives, among other things, and reduce by $7 
billion, over the next two years, transfers to the provinces. This 
is what I call to dump the responsibility for the deficit on the 
provinces.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, beside the Rideau Canal there are some information 
panels from the National Archives. One panel shows the 
beautiful Parliament Buildings when they were first completed 
in 1866.
<P>
	The text explains that when they were built, Centre Block, 
East Block and West Block were supposed to house not only this 
place and the other place but also the entire federal public 
service.
<P>
<B>(1615 ) </B>
<P>
	Clearly, successive governments have vastly inflated the 
federal role compared to its image at the time of Confederation. 
If a percentage of that increase of federal size was due to things 
like population growth, I would guess that same percentage of 
expansion of the federal government could readily be offset 
today by a full and thorough application of new technology. 
Personally, I am strongly opposed to having so much federal 
government with too many employees processing far too many 
forms and thinking up even more rules and regulations to tie up 
the private sector in red tape rather than producing real wealth.
<P>
	How do we stop this expansion? One way would be to support 
the motion of the Bloc Quebecois to hoist Bill C-76 for six 
months, presumably leaving the federal government with no 
way to pay its bills. However, I regard that suggestion as very 
irresponsible and I urge my colleagues to vote against the 
amendment. A much better way to downsize the federal 
government is to eliminate federal interference in areas which 
the Constitution clearly says fall under provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	As forestry critic for the Reform Party, I want to focus on the 
ending of federal moneys going to industry on a 50/50 cost 
shared basis with the provinces under the forestry resource 
development agreements, or FRDA. They expired in most 
provinces last week but have one more year in British Columbia 
and Quebec.
<P>
	FRDA II in British Columbia had a five year budget originally 
set at $200 million, half from B.C. and half from the federal 
government. One way to judge the probable impact of FRDA II 
is to compare its budget to other spending on forest management 
activities in the province responsible for roughly half of 
Canada's forestry production.
<P>
	This is according to the Compendium of Canadian Forestry 
Statistics for 1993, the national forestry database as published 
by the Canadian Council of Forest Ministers. On page 138 it 
shows a B.C. total of public funding spent on forest management 
including silviculture, protection, resource access and other 
management expenditures for the years 1990, 1991 and 1992 of 
$1,518,956,000. Net expenditures by industry in B.C. for those 
same purposes across the same years was an additional 
$1,837,027,000.
<P>
	In other words the $181 million which FRDA management 
committee correspondence indicates will be its total 
expenditure across five years must be compared to the 
$3,355,983,000 of total public and industrial spending for just 
three years. Clearly, the budget of FRDA II was only a tiny 
fraction of overall spending on management of B.C. forest 
lands.
<P>
	According to the midterm evaluation of FRDA round two in 
B.C. by Deloitte &amp; Touche: ``The major impacts, which can be 
quantified during the agreement period, should come from the 
incremental silviculture investment projects. Approximately 
$100 million worth of these activities are planned over the five 
year agreement period''.
<P>
	Regarding overall program evaluation, Deloitte &amp; Touche 
wrote on page 18 of the midterm evaluation: ``The total net extra 
returns over costs and social return on investment or economic 
gain expected from these silviculture operations to June 30, 
1993 is in the order of $46 million''.
<P>
	In other words, the major activities undertaken under FRDA 
II have produced an economic net gain rather than a cost to the 
public purse. Therefore, it should be no economic hardship for 
the provinces to take over these activities themselves. At the 
same time it frees the provinces from federal interference and 
frees private industry from federal-provincial overlap in this 
area which the Constitution clearly says comes under provincial 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	Section 92A of the Constitution Act, 1982 specifies the power 
of the provinces in the areas of ``development, conservation and 
management of non-renewable natural resources and forestry 
resources'' including ``the rate of primary production 
therefrom''. Nevertheless, because forestry is the number one 
industry in Canada and produces a significant part of the entire 
federal government revenue, the federal government has shoved 
its way into aspects which really should be provincial.
<P>
	When I say forestry produces a significant part of the federal 
government revenue, I base that on a Price Waterhouse study 
published in May 1991 entitled: ``The Forest Industry in British 
Columbia 1990''.
<P>
<B>(1620 ) </B>
<P>
	Based on cubic metres of B.C. coast 1990 log harvest, the 
total of all taxes and payments per cubic metre was $69.19 
including $1.44 for municipal government, $29.47 for the 
provincial government and $38.28 for the federal government 
for direct taxes, employee taxes and payments like UI and CPP. 
Although more than one-half of all government revenues per 
cubic metre went to the federal government, it is the province 
which bears the major costs of administering regulations for day 
to day forestry practices.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11426"> 11426 </A></B>
<P>
	This example is according to a brief entitled ``The Cost of 
Regulation in the B.C. Coastal Forest'' prepared by the Council 
of Forest Industries of B.C. in September 1992 for the 
Vancouver region for 1990-91. The actual provincial costs of 
regulating the industry were: harvesting, $9.97 million; basic 
silviculture, $20.42 million; inventory, $1.2 million; integrated 
resource management, $2.7 million; research, $750,000; and 
administration, $22 million. The total is $57,065,000.
<P>
	If my mathematics is correct, the province picks up the costs 
but the federal government's share of income received from the 
coastal crown allowable annual cut of 19.02 million cubic 
metres, which was the average of 1988-91 was $728,085,600. I 
remind my hon. colleagues, that is the federal take from only 
one B.C. region out of a total of 36 regions. This should provide 
ample federal funding for the international role on forestry as 
well as help the overall economy.
<P>
	Of course, since this study was completed, the B.C. 
government has introduced a whole new program of forest 
regulations in an entire series of booklets which makes earlier 
regulations look like child's play.
<P>
	Although many B.C. municipal councils have been writing to 
complain about the ending of the federal funding to FRDA II, I 
am also hearing from my constituents that they want a balanced 
federal budget as soon as it can be achieved without undue 
hardship for those truly in need.
<P>
	Based on the figures I have mentioned today, I believe I have 
demonstrated that ending federal funding for FRDA should not 
have a significant impact on the forest industry, nor impose 
undue hardship, generally speaking. Moreover, by helping to get 
the federal government out of day to day forest management, 
ending federal funding to FRDA can help downsize our bloated 
federal bureaucracy. Since long term returns from FRDA 
activities are a net asset to the public purse rather than a 
liability, this is one way to downsize the federal government at 
no loss to the provinces.
<P>
	Finally, last year's report by the House Standing Committee 
on Natural Resources said in recommendation number 11 that a 
possible third round of FRDA should go to ``development of 
forest ecosystems and landscape management techniques and 
the continuation of financial assistance to private woodlot 
owners''. Even the private woodlot owners in Nova Scotia when 
I visited there were complaining about the bureaucracy and 
overlap of FRDA and did not expect FRDA to continue.
<P>
	In conclusion, I wish to oppose the BQ amendment to Bill 
C-76 on budget implementation. I give my support as the 
Reform forestry critic to federal downsizing in the realm of 
natural resources as demonstrated by the ending of the forest 
resource development agreements.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the budget brought down by the government should be 
given points for public perception, and the federal government 
for improving its image. The impression is given that the 
government has hit hard. The impression is given that it has 
reduced the deficit and done everything it possibly could to turn 
Canada's economy around.
<P>
	I heard a number of comments in this House that were 
extremely frustrating for me. One was that this budget was fair 
and equitable, hard but equitable.
<P>
	According to the press clippings I read after the budget was 
tabled, those who complained loudest were the banks, who said 
it was a very harsh budget.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	All the banks said that this government hit their profits very 
hard, including the president of the Royal Bank. Which means 
the government came down very hard. In fact, in the budget the 
banks were asked to contribute $50 million annually, but only 
for two years, which means a total of $100 million.
<P>
	Consider that last year, the six chartered banks made a net 
profit of 4.3 billion dollars. I am talking about net profits, what 
the banks have left after covering all their expenses and salaries. 
These are net profits: pure profit. The banks raked in 4.3 billion 
dollars last year alone for their shareholders and owners.
<P>
	When the government says in the budget that the banks will be 
asked to contribute $50 million for two years, this means barely 
1 per cent of their net profits for last year. This is all part of a 
general trend we are seeing in a government that is probably 
following the example of its Conservative predecessors by 
supporting the wealthiest in our society. That is very obvious. In 
fact, not only is the banks' contribution towards paying off the 
debt extremely small, their taxes have been going down 
compared with the kind of profits they make. There are statistics 
and studies that show this very clearly.
<P>
	I am, of course, referring to those who are among the 
wealthiest members of our society. The president of the Royal 
Bank, Mr. Taylor, pocketed over $2.5 million in salaries, 
bonuses and loans last year. The story is the same for other bank 
presidents.
<P>
	Very clearly, this government favours the rich, and the rich 
are getting richer with this budget and the government's 
mentality. The proof lies in the fact that the government did 
nothing about family trusts, that it did not tighten corporation 
tax credits, and that even subsidies to Canadian business were 
reduced by only 60 per cent over three years. All this to say that 
the government has demonstrated its intention to protect the 
strongest and richest.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11427"> 11427 </A></B>
<P>
	If we go to the other end of Canada's social map, we see this 
government's hard-heartedness, its immorality and its lack of a 
sense of justice in cutting $300 million in the public housing 
sector in its budget. Cutting three hundred million dollars in this 
sector means asking society's most vulnerable people to pay a 
share three times that of the banks. People who live in public 
housing earn an average of $10,161 a year-a very long way 
from Mr. Taylor of the Royal Bank, who earned $2.5 million last 
year.
<P>
	In the public housing sector, the government has called for 
cuts of $100 million this year and the next three. This means 
that, since 1994, not a single cent has been spent on new housing 
construction.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	Since January 1994, this government has put the key in the 
door, has not invested a cent in new housing projects even 
though the demand for low-rent housing has continued to 
increase. There are 80,000 homeless in Canada, the most 
beautiful and the best country in the world, as some members of 
this House would say. Yet this country has 80,000 homeless. 
Canada needs 600,000 new housing units. Yet not only has this 
government not invested a cent in new housing, it has cut $300 
million from the social housing budget.
<P>
	That is no longer cutting the fat. However, cutting $50 million 
is hardly even trimming the fat from the banking industry. 
Cutting $300 million for social housing is not trimming the fat, 
it is cutting to the bone with an axe. They are asking the most 
needy and vulnerable in society to cough up even more than the 
president of the Royal Bank of Canada. Is that what you would 
call a fair and just budget? I ask you, Madam Speaker. Not in my 
opinion. Any Liberal who rises in this House to say that it is is 
guilty of the greatest hypocrisy of all times, because there has 
never been a bigger need for social housing in the history of 
Canada, and it is a basic need.
<P>
	A $300 million cut to social housing represents a 10 per cent 
cut in the annual operating budget of each low-rent building in 
Canada. That means that the window that lets in the cold will not 
get repaired this year. The roof will go unrepaired. That means 
that the building itself will continue to deteriorate.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It is being abandoned.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand: </B>Indeed, we have abandoned this sector. That 
means that the standard of living of these people will go down. 
And who are these people earning an average of $10,161 per 
year? They are single-parent families, widows, seniors, and 
handicapped people. We are asking the most vulnerable people 
in society to make contributions that they cannot make. It will 
push these people further into squalor than they already are. Are 
these measures fair for Canadians?
<P>
	I can accept, along with everybody else in the House, that real 
measures must be taken to reduce the deficit, but not at the 
expense of the most needy, the most vulnerable. In its budget, 
the government directly attacks, head on, blindly, the families 
and individuals who are the weakest and most vulnerable in 
society, and hits their essential needs. It is like saying to the 
weakest, infants, babies, children, that they will have to eat less. 
It is like taking away from these people their ability to meet their 
most basic needs.
<P>
	It is unfair. I am for debt reduction, but why did the 
government not take the $300 million from the banks in its 
budget?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> It is my duty, pursuant 
to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to 
be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the 
hon. member for The Battlefords-Meadow Lake-Canadian 
Wheat Board; the hon. member for Chateauguay-MIL Davie 
Shipyard; the hon. member for Don Valley North-Human 
Rights.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to participate in the debate on Bill C-76, the budget 
implementation act.
<P>
	I have been here all day listening to the speeches of my hon. 
colleagues. I get an uncanny feeling that we are seeing the 
results of the Peter Pan school of economics at work. You 
remember Peter Pan, Madam Speaker. He was the person who 
said: ``If you really believe you can fly, you will fly''. What I am 
hearing from countless members is that if we cut deeper, if we 
lay off public servants and if we dismantle all kinds of social and 
economic programs, watch Canada prosper. That requires an 
awful lot of faith in something.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	I see across the aisle my hon. colleague from 
Notre-Dame-de-Grace. He was one of the few government 
members who had the courage to say that the kind of programs 
that decade after decade of parliamentarians on behalf of 
Canadians have struggled to build are being dismantled in a 
matter of hours by the government.
<P>
	It is no mistake that Canada is the number one country in the 
world in which to live and raise families. However, the reason 
for that is the whole set of very progressive social programs that 
the government is in the process of dismantling as quickly as 
possible.
<P>
	Today reminds me of a story I read when I was a kid. I think it 
was Robert Louis Stevenson who wrote <I>The Wreckers</I>. This book 
was about a group of people who lived on an island in the South 
Pacific. On one side of the island was a rocky shoal out in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11428"> 11428 </A></B>
<P>
surf. At night they would often put lanterns out on the rocks to 
give the impression to passing ships that it was the harbour 
entrance. As the ships entered this so-called harbour, which in 
fact was a shoal of rocks, the ship smashed up  into pieces and 
these unscrupulous pirates and others went out and looted the 
ships. They misrepresented the harbour entrance.
<P>
	I have a feeling this is what we are doing here. I cannot believe 
what I am hearing my colleagues say. For example, I heard a 
number of my Liberal friends say that the red book set out a 
whole number of promises and they have kept them. I remember 
the red book stating: ``This NAFTA deal with the United States 
and Mexico is not good for our businesses and our working 
people and we will dismantle this program unless massive 
changes occur''. There were virtually no changes at all. Now the 
Prime Minister has not only signed us into NAFTA, he is trying 
to sign us into an extension of NAFTA with countries like Chile 
and others. It was one of the major commitments that was made 
to the Canadian people and was the basis on which they gave the 
Liberals their support.
<P>
	The other crucial one was the GST. I remember my Liberal 
opponent in Kamloops saying: ``If you elect me as a Liberal 
representative we promise to abolish the GST''. As a matter of 
fact, the deputy leader said: ``If that GST is not abolished I will 
resign my seat because I am so committed to doing this''. Here 
we are, 18 months into the Liberal term of office, and nary a 
whisper about the GST's abandonment. As a matter of fact they 
did suggest we change the name. Maybe that was their version of 
abolishment, to abolish the name of the GST because we are sick 
of it.
<P>
	Those were two major promises given to the electorate. 
Another one was child care. I remember the hon. member from 
Winnipeg on countless occasions standing up in the House of 
Commons saying that child care was crucial to the economic 
development of the country's future. With increasing single 
parent families and two spouses in the workplace, child care is 
not a luxury or a social program, it is critical to economic 
development. Was there even one mention of child care in the 
budget? Nary a mention. When I put the question to the Minister 
of Human Resources Development he said: ``We will be working 
on that as long as all of the provinces agree''. I can predict the 
outcome of that.
<P>
	Then the environment was going to be a priority. That was 
critical because we all agreed that all of these other programs 
were essentially irrelevant unless we really came together and 
worked hard to preserve the quality of the Canadian 
environment. What have we done? Wait and see. I bet that in a 
matter of weeks we will be dismantling the environment 
department. It has been virtually gutted of any consequence, 
therefore we might just as well toss it out. I can see that 
announcement coming.
<P>
	I could go on and on about broken promises but I think they 
are well known and I do not have to keep it up.
<P>
	However, government members have been saying: ``We had a 
balanced, just and fair approach''. Fair for what? I remember my 
friends opposite giving a standing ovation to the Minister of 
Finance on budget day. I will read from the budget: ``First, the 
existing large corporations tax will be increased by 12.5 per cent 
effective immediately in order that big companies contribute 
more to help bring the deficit down''. People rose to their feet 
and applauded because the Liberals were getting tough on the 
big companies, on capital.
<P>
<B>(1640 ) </B>
<P>
	Let us look closely at that. The capital tax is 0.2 per cent. It is 
going to skyrocket from 0.2 per cent to 0.22 per cent. Now 0.22 
per cent is an increase of 12.5 per cent, but it is infinitesimal. It 
is virtually meaningless. You can imagine the big corporations 
snickering when they heard that. However, the impression was 
that there was balance because the government was hitting big 
corporations hard.
<P>
	The government also said in the budget it would take on the 
banks. The government imposed a temporary tax for one year. 
What does that mean, a temporary tax for one year? Nobody in 
the House would dare to stand and suggest that the banks were 
getting a tough ride, so the government said that it would get 
tough and impose a temporary tax which would only last one 
year.
<P>
	Where is the balance? I do not think there is a single person 
who would not admit that the victims of the recession are the 
hardest pressed today. Where are the major cuts coming? The 
major cuts are coming from training programs, educational 
programs, health care programs and all social service programs. 
Who benefits from those programs the most but the victims of 
the recession, the unemployed and the poor people of the 
country. Those are the people who the government is hitting. A 
little tap on the nose for the big corporations, a little tap on the 
head for the big banks, and everyone else will get whacked.
<P>
	We have a deficit problem. We have a serious debt problem. 
However, let us ask the question. What was it that caused the 
debt? How did we get into this bloody mess? We have to go no 
further than to ask Statistics Canada. In 1991 Statistics Canada 
conducted a major study into the cause of the debt. The study 
indicated that our $560 billion debt was caused by three items.
<P>
	Fifty per cent of the debt is the result of compound interest, in 
other words, monetary policy. The government set a certain 
monetary policy which we heard about the other day when it 
became clear that the Minister of Finance and the Governor of 
the Bank of Canada had entered into a sweetheart deal. The 
Minister of Finance promised that he would not allow inflation 
to rise above 3 per cent. He said he would do anything to keep it 
down, which meant high interest rates. Today we  have one of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11429"> 11429 </A></B>
<P>
the highest interest rates in the industrialized world. Fifty per 
cent of our accumulated debt is the result of that.
<P>
	Forty-four per cent of our accumulated debt is the result of 
tax exemptions. There are all sorts of tax exemptions, tax 
programs, tax loopholes, et cetera. $38 billion a year is lost 
through that sieve. Again, $38 billion has not been collected as 
the result of a whole set of tax breaks. I am not going to suggest 
for a moment that none of them are any good. However, virtually 
none of them do the things that we want them to do. Forty-four 
per cent of our accumulated debt comes from tax breaks.
<P>
	Let me ask my Liberal colleagues across the way if they really 
support the notion that escort services should be a legitimate tax 
deduction. If they do not they should stand up and say it. Do they 
really believe that luxury boxes should be written off as a tax 
exemption? If they really do not believe that they should stand 
up and criticize these things. There are huge holes in the tax 
system which allow $38 billion to remain uncollected year after 
year.
<P>
	Now we come to the crunch. Six per cent of the government's 
accumulated debt since the mid-1970s is as a result of 
government programs like the armed forces, the RCMP, health 
care, pensions, et cetera. If we only look at social programs it 
comes to 2 per cent. What did the government do? It focused on 
the 2 per cent that caused the debt as opposed to the other 98 per 
cent.
<P>
	The government has actually got it reversed. Rather than 
dealing with monetary policy and tax reform, it decided to take 
on those who have been victimized by the recession. I say to my 
Liberal friends: Shame on you. To my Reform friends I say: 
Double shame.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise 
to speak on Bill C-76, an act to implement certain provisions of 
the budget. I guess one could call this an omnibus bill because it 
deals with measures regarding the public service, health and 
social transfers, fiscal stabilization, the Public Utilities Income 
Tax Transfer Act, veterans, securities, fees for passports, the 
Atlantic freight assistance program and the Western Grain 
Transportation Act. That is quite a handful all wrapped up in one 
bill.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	While I have some serious concerns about many of these 
measures, today I am going to focus on only three of these areas. 
Being a westerner from Alberta and representing farmers in my 
constituency, the Western Grain Transportation Act of course 
comes under serious scrutiny.
<P>
	The Reform Party has always supported the elimination of 
subsidies, but we do not see any particular reason why the 
farming community should be singled out for elimination of all 
the subsidies in their particular area when everyone else can 
continue on at the public trough, collecting billions and billions 
of dollars.
<P>
	We are seeing the Western Grain Transportation Act subsidies 
eliminated. That of course raises serious concerns for the grain 
farmers in the western part of the country.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance in the budget said that there will be a 
one-time payment of $1.6 billion to the owners of prairie 
farmland. While I can appreciate that many farmers rent their 
land from landowners, it seems rather strange to me that the 
landowner would be the recipient of a subsidy based on the 
production of the land when it is the farmer who does the 
farming who incurs all the costs of growing the grain, fertilizing 
it, harvesting it, storing it, shipping it. He bears all the risk, yet 
the $1.6 billion is going to the owners.
<P>
	It is an unfair way of phasing out this subsidy, one, because 
farmers are being singled out for the elimination of the subsidy, 
and two, because this money is going to the landowners and not 
the farmers themselves.
<P>
	In my riding we have an alfalfa plant, which has also been a 
recipient of the Western Grain Transportation Act subsidies. 
Alfalfa may not be a household name or a product that everyone 
buys, but they do produce 850,000 tonnes of alfalfa pellets and 
cubes valued at more than $100 million. Over 90 per cent of 
their production is exported. The elimination of this subsidy is 
going to have a devastating effect on this particular industry in 
my riding.
<P>
	Alfalfa pellets are a high volume, lower value product than 
grain. Therefore, the transportation costs make up a much 
higher percentage of the total cost of the product when it is 
landed in a foreign country such as Japan, which is one of the 
major importers of Alberta alfalfa. The elimination of this 
subsidy is going to have a devastating effect.
<P>
	Last week we legislated back to work the workers on the 
railroads. If we thought the elimination of this subsidy was tied 
to or coupled with the increase in productivity on the railroads, 
then we would be able to keep the transportation costs under 
control. I do feel that the alfalfa plant in my riding is going to be 
particularly hard hit by these measures without offsetting help 
in some other area through, as I mentioned, increased 
productivity in the railroads.
<P>
	Canada as a whole of course is going to suffer. Here is $100 
million in export sales that is in jeopardy; there are 1,000 jobs in 
jeopardy. I think the minister of agriculture should take these 
things into serious consideration and perhaps make some 
representations to the Minister of Finance regarding what 
should happen to the alfalfa industry in western Canada.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11430"> 11430 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1650 ) </B>
<P>
	In the area of the public service, Bill C-76 implements some 
changes to the workforce adjustment directive. These changes 
allow the President of the Treasury Board to declare 45,000 
public servants a surplus commodity. As Reformers we have a 
very deep and real concern for the civil servants and their 
families who are going to be losing their jobs through the 
workforce adjustment directive.
<P>
	Since the election we have talked about the need to get the 
cost of government under control, that downsizing has to be 
done. We realize that is important. But we must also remember 
that the Liberals are the ones who said: ``We are not going to 
touch the workforce adjustment directive; we are going to leave 
it where it its''.
<P>
	In July 1994, in a letter to the Professional Institute of the 
Public Service, the President of the Treasury Board stated that 
the workforce adjustment directive will only be changed 
through negotiations. I do not think Bill C-76 is negotiating 
with the public service. This is a big, heavy hammer that is going 
to say that for the next three years the workforce adjustment 
directive is set aside and we are going to eliminate 45,000 civil 
service jobs.
<P>
	If this is the way the Liberal government negotiates and the 
way it has handled the economy, the deficit and the debt and 
when it says one thing and does the opposite, we will have no 
idea where this country is going. The litany of broken promises 
made in the red book gets longer and longer every day.
<P>
	The workforce adjustment directive is only being set aside for 
three years. I was wondering how the government can honestly 
say that government downsizing does not require the 
elimination of the directive altogether. Is this just another empty 
promise of the Liberal government when first it said: ``We are 
not going to touch it,'' and now it is saying: ``We are going to set 
it aside but only for three years''? Let us hope that in three years 
it is not in a position to express an opinion on the workforce 
directive because it is likely that in three years it will find 
another reason to set it aside for a longer period of time.
<P>
	I think this government should do its homework and should 
come to realize that government should be fundamentally 
changed and downsized. It should come clean with the public 
service and honestly say that the directive may have to be 
eliminated and not suspended.
<P>
	These short term politically expedient measures with the 
previous Tory government bought labour peace through 
granting job security. I think we are seeing another situation 
where the government says one thing and the long term policy 
may be quite different.
<P>
	The government is allowing these people who are declared 
surplus to stay on the job for six months, with or without work. 
Then, for 12 additional months after they are gone, if a job is 
found they can be brought back without putting the jobs out to 
competition.
<P>
	We are seeing all kinds of ways that the Liberal government is 
waving the wrong flag.
<P>
	We are debating employment equity, where the merit 
principle is thrown out the window. Now they are saying they are 
going to reserve the right to bring workers back within 12 
months and eliminate the competition for jobs. All these things 
say that fairness is being flouted and that the Liberals are 
governing without any real sense of direction as to how to set an 
example in this country.
<P>
	In the short time I have left I would also like to register my 
opposition to the elimination of the Public Utilities Income Tax 
Transfer Act. It is patently unfair to Alberta because it will bear 
the brunt of this at $173 million in additional costs to the utility 
services. It is going to add 7 per cent to the price of electricity in 
Alberta. In Alberta the utilities are privately owned and they 
now have to pay federal income tax. But Ontario Hydro, Quebec 
Hydro, B.C. Hydro, and all these other crown corporations of 
provincial governments are exempt from federal tax.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	Therefore, I would like to be on record as opposing that 
particular item in Bill C-76.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
rise to participate in the debate on Bill C-76, an act to 
implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament 
on February 27, 1995. I had the honour to second the motion 
moved by my colleague, the hon. member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, last Thursday, March 30, 1995.
<P>
	The purpose of this motion is to send the finance minister 
back to the drawing board to redo the budget he dared table in 
the House, which the Bloc Quebecois is doing its utmost to 
denounce. I am proud to have seconded this motion because the 
finance minister's budget hides its true nature and claims merits 
it does not have.
<P>
	For the 1995-96 fiscal year, the budget does not introduce any 
changes as far as transfers to the provinces are concerned. 
Everything is being postponed until next year so that Quebecers 
will not find out before the referendum that federalism is a 
failure. However, starting in 1996-97, the federal government 
will arrange to shift its deficit to the provinces to the tune of at 
least $7 billion.
<P>
	This is how the government will go about it. First, it will 
eliminate two major programs under which funds are transferred 
to the provinces, namely the Canada Assistance Plan and 
established programs financing, replacing them with a new 
program called the Canada Social Transfer. This new program, 
the Canada Social Transfer, will have to take into account the 
cuts announced in the finance minister's budget. These cuts will 
amount to $2.5 billion in 1996-97 and $4.5 billion in  1997-98 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11431"> 11431 </A></B>
<P>
for a total of $7 billion. The amount of these cuts are in the 
budget.
<P>
	By reducing transfer payments to the provinces this way, the 
federal government is transferring its public finance load onto 
the provinces while at the same time keeping the related tax 
points and the spending power in every area. In spite of all the 
good things promised in the budget, clause 48 of Bill C-76 is 
unmistakably clear; under this clause, Quebec will be deprived 
of $650 million in 1996-97.
<P>
	In 1997-98, the budget for the new program, the Canada 
transfer program, will be divided among the provinces based on 
a criterion that remains to be negotiated. If the criterion 
ultimately chosen is the one currently in use, this would mean a 
$1.2 billion shortfall for Quebec in 1997-98. It could even be 
steeper, because no decision was made yet regarding on what 
basis calculations will be made.
<P>
	In fact, the federal government seems to grant the requests of 
wealthier provinces, notably Ontario. Equalization aside, the 
government is seriously considering distributing all major 
transfers to the provinces on a per capita basis. If that were the 
case, Quebec alone would have to bear 41.7 per cent of the cuts 
in transfer payments in 1997-98 on account of its population. 
Therefore, Quebec would see its shortfall for 1997-98 increase 
from $1.2 billion to $1.9 billion.
<P>
	This goes to show that this budget claims to have merits it 
does not have, as glaringly evidenced by the cuts to be expected 
next year. Another clear indication is the government's 
commitment to maintaining national standards. Bill C-76 
maintains health national standards and provides for the 
introduction of new national standards for social assistance and 
post-secondary education.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	Federal support will be withheld if the provinces do not 
comply with these standards. This centralizing and arrogant 
form of federalism has nothing to do with decentralization. 
These national standards will limit the provinces' autonomy in 
their own fields of jurisdiction, at their own expense. Again, the 
new standards which will be implemented coast to coast will not 
serve the interests of Quebec's distinct society, particularly in a 
sector as vital as education.
<P>
	The bill provides for new national standards before 
negotiations have even taken place. The federal government is 
announcing the outcome of such negotiations before they are 
even underway. There is nothing in this legislation to indicate 
that the federal government needs a consensus among the 
provinces to implement new national standards. Let us not 
forget that the federal government has the authority to 
unilaterally impose such standards through legislative 
amendments. If the provinces reject these standards, they will 
lose federal support, which, ironically, is provided with the 
money collected from provincial taxpayers.
<P>
	Therefore, the new Canada Social Transfer will impose a 
$7-billion cut to the provinces. In addition to that, clause 48 of 
Bill C-76 provides that a province must make mention of the 
Canada Social Transfer in all its advertising and documents 
related to the health services provided by that province.
<P>
	Let me give you another example: As the critic for Veterans 
Affairs Canada, I noticed that Bill C-76 seeks to reduce 
benefits, allowances and compensation. Clause 42 provides for 
the gradual elimination of education assistance to children of 
deceased veterans.
<P>
	Clauses 68 to 72 eliminate allowances to allied veterans in the 
Resistance, as well as allowances to uniformed allied veterans 
who immigrated to Canada. Finally, clause 73 provides that any 
compensation paid to a veteran attending a review committee 
hearing of his application for disability pension will be 
eliminated. These provisions amount to a loss of benefits for 
veterans. This is a case of penny-pinching.
<P>
	In short, this budget truly reflects what federalism is all 
about. The federal government would like to be perceived as the 
almighty protector and authority. But Quebecers will not be 
fooled and they will not hesitate to express their dissatisfaction 
with this system and say that the trickery is over and that they 
are prepared to take control of their destiny once and for all. In 
the meantime, it is essential to postpone second reading of Bill 
C-76 for six months, to give an opportunity to the Minister of 
Finance to do his homework. This is the purpose of the motion 
which I seconded and which I still support.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak today on Bill C-76.
<P>
	A lot of misinformation has gone on recently with respect to 
the budget. I would like to correct some of those statements.
<P>
	The budget is going to sound the death knell for many things 
we hold dear to our hearts as Canadians, in particular the social 
programs of the country we have spent so many years and 
decades forming. These social programs have set us apart from 
countries like the United States; set us apart from countries that 
do not take care of those who are underprivileged in society as 
we in Canada have done much to the envy of people in other 
countries.

	Contrary to what many people believe, the budget poses the 
single greatest threat to those social programs. It is not 
something we should be proud of, but rather ashamed of. I will 
explain why.
<P>
	The big ogre in all of these talks about budget and finances is 
not the deficit. The big ogre in this is the debt, that huge 
expanding volume, almost impossible for us to comprehend, 
now at about $560 billion and three years from now will be about 
$660 billion.
<P>
	Where will we get the money to pay even the interest on this? I 
will show the House. Imagine what we spend every year to be a 
pie. That pie would be circular and would represent $160 billion. 
Of that pie, $40 billion goes to pay the interest on the debt. The 
$120 billion remaining goes to pay for government programs 
and social programs.
<P>
	Three years from now with an added $100 billion to the debt 
we will see interest rates on the debt at $50 billion, not $40 
billion. That will force our country to decrease its spending on 
government programs and social programs from $120 billion to 
$102 billion.
<P>
	I ask the people of the country to ask themselves where we 
will get the money to pay for those social programs if we will 
have $18 billion less to deal with. There are two options. Either 
we have increased growth in the economy, which should occur to 
some extent, or raise taxes. The latter is not an option but will be 
something the government and provincial governments will be 
forced to do to pay for the programs we have come to enjoy. If 
we do not we will have to decrease services in important areas 
like health care and education. These are very important 
programs we have come to enjoy.
<P>
	I will give some real time examples of the first option, one 
very close to my heart. Here are some facts about health care in 
British Columbia. Prince George, a city in northern British 
Columbia which actually serves one-half of the province, has 
lost 80 per cent of its orthopedic surgeons. That leaves one left 
to serve one-half of the province. It has lost 50 per cent of its 
obstetricians and gynecologists and its only neurosurgeon, 
among other specialists.
<P>
	Why have these people left in the last year and a half? Not 
because they want to get more money but rather they found it 
intolerable to work under the fiscal restraints imposed on them 
not only by the province but by the federal government. There is 
dual culpability in this situation. It is not held by one arm of the 
government or the other.
<P>
	The reason is twofold. We have increasing demand for health 
care services and more expensive technologies and we have less 
money to pay for them. We also have an expanding and aging 
population. As we look into the future, if we look at the 
demographics of the population in the country, we can see that 
situation will not change  for the better but rather for the worse. 
Those demands will increase.
<P>
	Some tragic situations have occurred in northern British 
Columbia. People have to be flown out of that hospital. Doctors 
working there have to find spots in Edmonton, Calgary and 
Vancouver for people to be treated, people sometimes with life 
threatening injuries, people whose injuries are being treated too 
late for them to get the adequate treatment required to survive 
and to come back to functional normality. In a rich country like 
ours that is an embarrassment and a crying shame. All we need 
to do is speak to those people to see what happens.
<P>
	What happens in northern British Columbia is not isolated. 
This also happens in Victoria. A colleague called me and said he 
has a 40-year old patient. She is getting vertigo, which means 
the room spins. They think she has a tumour in her brain stem, 
part of her brain. She will wait two months to get her CAT-scan 
and her MRI scan is booked on the 12th of never.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, if you were that lady, what would you think? 
What a tragedy to have that happen in our country. If she had 
enough money she would go to the United States and get these 
services done in a matter of two or three weeks. That is a 
two-tier system; a health care system which we have right now, 
contrary to what government members say.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	On one hand the government says it will take money away 
from Canadians under the guise of cutting, that is remove $8.4 
billion from provincial transfer payments, and it will bring 
down the federal deficit. That is simply not true. All the 
government is doing is putting the onus back on to the taxpayers 
and the provinces. It is not fair.
<P>
	I suggest a constructive alternative solution. It requires a 
change in philosophy, an openness of mind and a desire to 
change things for the future. It is a leap of faith which would 
provide a better health care system for all Canadians.
<P>
	Let the federal government take it upon itself to define the 
essential health care services and ensure all Canadians, 
regardless of income, are covered. Nobody in this party wants to 
see anybody have any part of their essential health care services 
withheld because they cannot pay for them. That is something 
we are fighting against and it is something we will continue to 
fight against in the future. We want to ensure that every 
Canadian is covered by these essential services. However, we 
cannot go on expecting public health care to pay for everything 
in existence. It simply cannot do that. Therefore let us define 
those services and ensure they are covered across the country.
<P>
	Let us give the provinces the power to raise money to pay for 
their health care services. That would entail amending the 
Canada Health Act. It would not destroy it, it would amend it. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11433"> 11433 </A></B>
<P>
There are many good aspects to the Canada Health Act the 
Reform Party wants to preserve.
<P>
	However, the government cannot on one hand take money 
away from the provinces and on the other hand tell them they 
cannot raise funds. That is not fair. Let us enable them to raise 
funds. That would perhaps provide for a two-tier system in 
which there is a private system and a public system.
<P>
	We must understand the federal government can take the 
responsibility and say to the provinces that if they have a private 
health care system only private moneys would be exchanged. 
Not a penny of taxpayers dollars would go into that private 
system. It is a fallacy to assume we in this party want to have 
taxpayers money going into a private system.
<P>
	It would enable the public system to have decreased waiting 
lists and it would also provide more money for the public 
system. Some would choose to use the private system. The 
bottom line is that people on the public system would receive 
their essential health care services in a more timely, more 
expeditious and more efficient fashion.
<P>
	This is an unequal system but we have an unequal system now. 
Is it not better to have an unequal system which provides better 
health care for all Canadians than to have the present system 
which will worsen as time goes on? The Canadian public, when 
it understands that, would agree. We in this party would support 
the government if it would take the initiative and do that. To 
stick its head in the sand and say nothing is wrong is completely 
untrue.
<P>
	The provincial government in British Columbia was forced to 
implement a stop gap measure of $18 million just to lower the 
MRI waiting list and the waiting list for coronary artery bypass 
grafting. Those lists have 700 or 800 names. If a person is 
waiting for open heart surgery, I am sure they would find it 
extremely disconcerting to find out they have to wait five 
months. Senator Keon mentioned the waiting list for 
non-emergency heart surgery in Ottawa is now five months. 
That is a travesty.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
the great national party and defender of the most vulnerable, the 
party that used to lean more towards the NDP than towards the 
Reform Party, the party that was so full of the words pride and 
dignity is no more. It has caved in to repeated attacks from the 
wealthy and the financial community who just happen to be 
friends of the party.
<P>
	Yesterday's Liberal Party has turned into a kind of 
progressive conservative reform party. That is what we can call 
that party now, whose members sit across the way. With this 
latest budget, the members opposite, these progressive 
conservative reform members, have abandoned their basic 
principles. The vulnerable, the sick, people in substandard 
housing, the unemployed and the elderly, all these people who 
need the government's  special attention, have been abandoned 
in the name of deficit reduction.
<P>
	The message from the government benches sounds hollow. It 
is also less than forthright, because it would have the public 
believe that all these vulnerable people and our social programs 
are to blame for the fact that the federal government is bankrupt. 
This is a misrepresentation of the facts, and it is unacceptable. 
By sending this kind of message, members opposite, which I can 
no longer call Liberals or ``Rouges'', are questioning the very 
role of government.
<P>
	Is this role not supposed to be to help the weakest in our 
society, to ensure that everyone has a decent standard of living, 
that our collective wealth is distributed equitably and that those 
who have a measure of wealth should participate in this 
collective effort? Is this not the government's mandate?
<P>
	Unfortunately, members opposite, those former Liberals with 
their millionaire Minister of Finance, are stupidly caught up in a 
one-track economic and financial mind set, totally oblivious to 
social principles and human values. Pretty soon, if we replace 
the Minister of Finance with a calculator, no one will notice the 
difference. The government will add and subtract without 
considering the disastrous impacts of these cuts.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance of this new progressive conservative 
reform party represents the exact opposite of Robin Hood. 
Instead of taking money from the rich to give to the poor, the 
Minister of Finance takes money from the poor to give to the 
rich.
<P>
	Could we expect anything else from a failed Robin Hood who 
is himself a millionaire and who admitted that he was familiar 
with the whole range of tax exemptions? He even owns a fleet of 
ships, some of which fly flags of convenience to avoid Canadian 
taxes. What a wonderful example of sharing and participating in 
our collective responsibilities! He prefers to protect his wealthy 
friends at the expense of those who are less well off.
<P>
	I am thinking of those notorious family trusts-billions of 
dollars sheltered from the tax man. In this case, the minister 
decided to protect his friends for another five years. I think it is 
shocking to protect The Cadillac crowd and cut benefits to the 
unemployed.
<P>
	What about the government's fiscal options? For instance, the 
banks are taxed a modest $100 million while the Royal Bank 
alone, a good federalist, made more than $1.2 billion worth of 
profit last year. How do you justify this fiscal decision, when 
last year, taxes paid by seniors increased by $500 million?
<P>
	What about the thousands of businesses that pay no tax, while 
workers just keep paying more?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11434"> 11434 </A></B>
<P>
	The choice of the members opposite is clear in this budget. 
Their preference for the rich is obvious. The federal government 
is the protector of the well-to-do and the financial community.
<P>
	In the end, it is the lower and medium income taxpayers, 
always the same, who are affected. The unemployed, the 
disadvantaged, the sick and the homeless are paying for this 
budget, in which the government lacks the courage to reach into 
the impenetrable pockets of the more well off. This budget will 
mean real hardship: lower UI benefits, fewer assistance 
programs and shrinking health insurance.
<P>
	Seniors are given a break, this year. However, it is not hard to 
guess the intentions of the Minister of Finance.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	Following the referendum, he will once again go after old age 
pensions and cut seniors' income, which in many instances, is 
the bare minimum. Our seniors are entitled to reasonable living 
conditions. They are also entitled to certain small pleasures.
<P>
	When the minister's axe falls next year, I fear these small 
pleasures will disappear, and their quality of life will decline. 
Women will be hit even harder by the federal government's 
choices. The concept of family income to be included in various 
programs affects them directly, because they are the least well 
off and the most dependent on their partners. By a single stroke, 
program universality will end for many women, who will thus be 
condemned to continued economic dependence and poverty. It is 
a real scandal.
<P>
	The fact is that the disadvantaged and the middle class are 
getting poorer. The other fact is that the rich are getting richer. 
And the government is biting into these facts with gusto-it is 
broadening the gap between the poor and the rich with its budget 
and tax choices. What shameful choices.
<P>
	The budget of the millionaire of finance is just for show. A 
series of cuts here and there, cuts without vision. And the 
members opposite are all pleased and smug about this 
ineffective budget, designed solely to provide a short term 
response to financial markets. For over 17 months now, the Bloc 
Quebecois has been asking the government to do its work 
seriously. The Bloc demands that the government get to the real 
root of the problem: duplication and deep, structural 
unemployment.
<P>
	The Finance millionaire ignores these two issues. But, 
remember the credo of the red book, the bible that was shelved 
immediately following the election: jobs, jobs, jobs. Where are 
all of the jobs so promised, which were supposed to kick-start 
economic recovery? Obviously, the opposite has happened. 
Economic recovery is creating jobs, jobs, jobs, not government 
action. Inaction is more like it.
<P>
	Nice election promises will not fight poverty. One of the best 
ways of doing it is to give people the opportunity to acquire a 
certain wealth through employment. That is a solution seriously 
worth considering.
<P>
	Work, employment combat poverty. Where are those major 
and effective job-creating measures? Nowhere to be seen. The 
federal government's infrastructure program distributed mere 
crumbs, and, now, the government is idling. The people opposite 
are bragging about jobs that were not created by them, but by the 
economic recovery which, for the most part, was powered by our 
neighbours to the south.
<P>
	The federal government does not want to recant. The system 
is made that way and the faith that the people opposite have in 
their system is as tough as nails. The decentralization that they 
say they are going to implement in the budget is an empty shell, 
a cover for a vast offloading operation onto the provinces. In 
fact, it is the deficit that is being decentralized, not powers.
<P>
	Still, before the budget, the carrot they dangled was the 
possibility of the federal government withdrawing from 
provincial areas of jurisdiction and transferring to the provinces 
the corresponding financial resources. Nothing but smoke and 
mirrors. The budget does the opposite: it perpetuates a 
domineering central government and ten subservient provinces.
<P>
	Quebecers will soon make a decision on their future. I am 
convinced that they will reject this domineering federalism and 
this government which is eating away at the social fabric to 
please financiers.
<P>
	Quebec needs all of the tools available if it wants to build a 
fairer society based on something other than purely pecuniary 
values. Globalization of markets, international competition, 
profits, economic development at any price are all well and 
good. But, what use are they if the population is abused and 
neglected? Quebecers will make their own choices.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
it gives me pleasure to speak on this bill.
<P>
	During the last couple of months since the bringing down of 
the budget, I have been a little disappointed at many of the 
things I have heard. Members on the government side have 
talked about the number of occasions they have gone into the 
communities and towns throughout Canada and have talked to 
people at various gatherings and now government has a clear 
understanding of what Canadians want. Government then comes 
down with what it did and the rhetoric begins.
<P>
<B>(1725 ) </B>
<P>
	I find it strange because I too have been out to various areas, 
not just in my own riding but throughout the country. Maybe I 
operate a little differently than government members do but my 
conversations are with farmers while sitting on the tailgate of a 
pick-up truck or  with a policeman while riding around in his 
cruiser. I do that rather than sitting with top bureaucrats or other 
elites.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11435"> 11435 </A></B>
<P>
	When I go into a prison I do not spend my time in the warden's 
office. I get to the grassroots population, the guards and people 
who work closely with the inmates. I go to the coffee shops and 
meet with nurses coming off shift from the hospital. I sit down 
and listen to what they have to say. Government members say 
they have conferred with people but I would like to know why 
they did not get the same message I got.
<P>
	People ask such questions as: ``What are they doing? We do 
not quite understand. Why will they not accept the idea that the 
pension is gold plated and at least be willing to say that they 
should do their part?'' When we look at the figure of $1,239,000 
going to this gold plated pension plan, we sit over here and 
complain. They do not have the guts to stand up and say that yes, 
they should do their part but they do not.
<P>
	I have pulled some figures out of the public accounts and if I 
can pull these out of public accounts, anybody can. People 
should be told that the public accounts indicate that last year this 
government spent $374 million on language instruction. In the 
immigration and citizenship section the figure is $298 million. 
People would like to know what that is all about.
<P>
	The funny part is that when we get into multiculturalism we 
see these big million dollar figures. Most of the people I talked 
to are immigrants and they asked: ``What are they doing? Why 
are they spending their money on these things? They are nice but 
at the same time our health programs are going down the tube. 
Education is going down the tube. Protection is going down the 
tube and even defence which is important is being cut and going 
down the tube''.
<P>
	There is welfare out there for the needy. In a pig's eye, it is for 
the greedy. There are single mothers who ask: ``Why can I not 
get some help? I am single. I have kids. I am divorced and 
having problems. Why can I not have some help?'' I do not know 
the answer.
<P>
	All you people on that side do is chatter. You do not give 
answers to anybody. You play the old political, yap, yap, yap, 
blah, blah, blah and say nothing. You have been doing that for 30 
years. Now we wonder why we have a $560 billion debt and this 
huge deficit every year?
<P>
	People tell me they do not understand. I tell them: Come and 
listen to the Liberals and you will understand. That is the way 
they have been operating for 30 years. They will not even give 
up their little blue cars. On occasion a minister might walk or 
take the green bus like the rest of us. But no, leave the cars 
sitting out front with a driver. Let the engines run, it does not 
matter. Then they walk in here and talk about the millions of 
kids who are living in poverty, while their cars are running and 
their chauffeurs are waiting. That is what they do. There is no 
sign whatsoever that they are interested in giving up  anything 
that would help. A selfish lot right from day one.
<P>
<B>(1730 ) </B>
<P>
	We talked to the people and we came up with a taxpayers' 
budget. They say we have priorities and why do the Liberals not 
have priorities. This is what the people are saying. Obviously 
their budget does not match what people are saying. Three per 
cent of GDP means a $25 billion deficit in three years. Is that not 
wonderful? We will be paying $50 billion in interest. We will 
have another $25 billion worth of debt.
<P>
	We are doing our part but perhaps we should listen to the NDP. 
There is bound to be a pile of dollars out there that we can gather 
in because we need more revenue. Tax them more. Spend more. 
Do everything we possibly can.
<P>
	With respect to justice, it costs $40,000 per year to house our 
inmates and we have something like 17,000 inmates. If we 
multiply that-we do not have to be too sharp, we can even be a 
school teacher to do that-we come up with millions and 
millions more dollars. It is $40,000 to take care of an inmate.
<P>
	Even one of the Liberals said we have 1,700 from other 
countries and perhaps we should deport them. I applaud that. 
That is a good idea. That came from the other side of the House. 
Good grief, why do the members not listen to that member? We 
have 1,700 non-citizens sitting in our jails and it is costing us 
$40,000 a head. Let us send them back. Let us deport them to 
their countries. That would probably be the worst punishment 
they could get. Why do we not come up with solutions to what is 
happening in our judicial system?
<P>
	If the member for Halifax would only pay attention she might 
even learn something; I doubt it but she might. I would imagine 
she has opted out of her pension plan so she can talk a lot.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> No she has not and she will not either. You may 
quote me.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I will quote her, she will not either. Of course 
I did not expect any different.
<P>
	I can recall not too many years back I was told by certain 
officials in the justice department that once upon a time there 
were countries interested in negotiating a deal by which they 
would contract and house our convicts for us, that they would 
save us a lot of money. Perhaps we need to start looking at that. 
Perhaps we need to contract with other places to help us with this 
problem.
<P>
	The whole crux of this is coming from the people of this 
country. When we talk to the people, when we talk to their 
bosses, even though they do not act like bosses-the taxpayer 
happens to be their boss, I will remind members just in case they 
have forgotten-they are quite upset that we do not seem to 
come up with priorities in the House and say we have to take care 
of health, education, protection, we do need a defence, we want 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11436"> 11436 </A></B>
<P>
to make sure the needy are well looked after when  it comes to 
our welfare system. We have put together their thoughts.
<P>
	I doubt if anyone sitting over there even took time to read it. 
After all, that did not come from a Liberal, so why look at it. It 
cannot be any good if it does not come from a Liberal. For the 
past nine years before the Liberals came it was not any good if it 
did not come from a Conservative. Before that it was not any 
good if it did not come from a Liberal. We play this silly game 
year after year. We all say we need to do something different.
<P>
	I have not seen anything different; different name, different 
faces but the same old Tories, same old stories. Nothing has 
changed.
<P>
<B>(1735 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. While 
the hon. member for Wild Rose was speaking about the 
government hearing the message of the people, asking why it 
was not hearing the right message, the hon. member for Halifax 
made the comment ``because people in the east are smarter''. 
This is an affront to western Canadians-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry, that is a point 
of debate and not a point of order.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
it is a pleasure for me, in the next few minutes, to speak to-
<P>
	Madam Speaker, would it be possible to have quiet?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Order!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rocheleau:</B> Madam Speaker, as I was saying, it is a 
pleasure for me to speak to Bill C-76, An Act to implement 
certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on 
February 27, 1995. Ultimately, in practical terms, the purpose of 
this bill is to modify certain legislation, following the tabling of 
the budget with its sometimes devastating consequences.
<P>
	As I examined this bill, my attention was caught, in particular, 
by some of the legislation affected, including the first part on 
public sector compensation, where we can see the results of the 
government's consistency. If this bill is passed, 45,000 federal 
public servants will eventually lose their jobs, and yet you will 
recall, Madam Speaker, that ``jobs, jobs, jobs'' were what the 
red book promised.
<P>
	The ideology continues to be the same. Faced with labour 
relations problems last week, the government did not hesitate to 
impose back-to-work legislation on workers who wanted to 
avail themselves of their right to strike, but who did not even 
have the time to do so, having first been locked out and then, 
twelve hours later, legislated back to work. Sometimes, this 
government is only too consistent.
<P>
	I also noted that the Western Grain Transportation Act will be 
adjusted, and yet we know that following the abolition of these 
subsidies in the West, there will be compensation of three billion 
dollars, while subsidies to Quebec dairy producers will be cut by 
30 per cent, with no mention of compensation. We realize that 
the member for Brome-Missisquoi will not be leading the 
protest.
<P>
	Finally, of course, there is the main body of this budget, which 
announces cuts in transfers to the provinces over the next three 
years of $7 billion, including $2.5 billion-around 40 per 
cent-in cuts to the Quebec government. Quebec, with only 25 
per cent of the population, will assume 40 per cent of the cuts. 
And this is consistent too, not just for this government, but for 
the entire Canadian federal system.
<P>
	It is consistent because, if one looks at the figures since 1982, 
Quebec has been cut $14.3 billion over 12 years. In other words, 
the government of Quebec, regardless of which party was in 
power, averaged cuts of over a billion dollars. It is no wonder 
that the impact of these perverse cuts is being felt in education 
and health and throughout the system. One only has to think 
about the community organizations that face repeated cuts 
resulting from this system based on concealment, on shifting the 
burden to the provinces and on irresponsibility.
<P>
	They may laugh, especially since they come from Quebec and 
have just been elected. Some have not yet realized it. Some 
people are slower than others. All these cuts and those to come 
are to be implemented without any changes in Quebecers' tax 
rates. Quebecers will continue to send between $28 billion and 
$30 billion to Ottawa. For over a decade, we have seen that 
compensation in the form of subsidies and tax transfers is 
steadily declining, while Quebecers' tax rates are being 
maintained.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	In this regard, it is sad that these cuts are being implemented 
on the backs of the most disadvantaged in our society, that is, 
patients in hospitals, the unemployed, welfare recipients, 
retirees and seniors. We feel that these people are being 
sacrificed because of an administrative choice, a societal 
choice, an ideological choice made by this government. My 
colleague, the hon. member for Laurentides, talked about this 
earlier. In light of the finance minister's situation, it is difficult 
to make different choices.
<P>
	I am very happy about the movement that was born in my 
riding last week, which is going to sweep across Quebec. This 
proposal by the Trois-Rivières chapter of Solidarité Québec 
will be put to all of Quebec through Solidarité populaire 
Québec, a movement that will result in a national Quebec 
petition calling for a commission of inquiry on taxation. I want 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11437"> 11437 </A></B>
<P>
to commend the people of the CEQ, the CNTU, the FTQ, the 
nurses' federation, the union of professional employees of the 
Quebec government and the union of Quebec public servants,  
who joined forces to put together a massive petition denouncing 
the federal government and calling for an inquiry on taxation.
<P>
	In the end, when they talk about social programs, what do they 
really mean? We are talking about redistribution of wealth. And 
when less and less is being distributed, what happens? Wealth is 
concentrated. That is the evil-the cancer sapping the economy 
not only in Canada but also throughout the Western world- that 
has to be denounced and dealt with quickly. Wealth should be 
distributed, not concentrated as is presently the case.
<P>
	The government appears to want to distribute wealth, but one 
must not mistake appearance for reality because, in reality and 
at the expense of the provinces, it is merely standardizing. It was 
already standardizing the area of health while at the same time 
reducing funding. Now, it will do the same not only in the area of 
social assistance but also, and this is a precedent, in the area of 
postsecondary education, killing two birds with one stone. On 
the pretence of bringing the debt under control, the government 
interferes in a totally unconstitutional way in a area of 
jurisdiction which, as we know, is very dear to the Government 
of Quebec in particular and, in Canada as we know it today, is 
recognized in the constitution as an area of exclusive provincial 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	Where will this lead? When cuts are this extensive, it means 
that social programs will have to be chopped as well. It will 
become necessary to either cut back funding for education and 
social assistance or raise taxes or both. But what is disgusting 
and wicked about all this manoeuvring on the part of this 
government is that it is designed to pass the buck so that it can 
wash its hands of the matter. That is what Lise Bissonnette was 
referring to when she spoke of imperial federalism.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> A dictatorship.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rocheleau:</B> Finally, I would like to say a word about the 
future of Canada, because this whole process is part of a vast 
operation. This is not our saying; it was reported in <I>Le Journal 
de Montréal</I> on March 30, 1995, that two Liberals were fearing a 
fiscal attack against Quebec. The two Liberals in question, 
Jean-Claude Rivest, recently appointed to the Senate, and 
Claude Forget, former Liberal minister in the Quebec 
government, both distinguished and well known Liberals, said 
that the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada was preparing a major 
administrative and tax reform in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Rivest added that, in his opinion, there was nothing to fear 
at the constitutional level but the same could not be said at the 
fiscal level; there is an opportunity for initiatives, whether 
constitutional or not, that could change the rules of the game one 
way or the other. That is was is happening.
<P>
	So, on the eve of this historic public consultation in Quebec, I 
hope that, in the Canada of the future, as it now appears, 
Quebecers will make the right decision.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
the hon. member referred to the fiscal coup which is in the 
making, which could also be called the Stéphane Dion strategy, 
and which seeks to hurt Quebec after the referendum. We are 
bracing ourselves for that.
<P>
	On the other side of this House I see Quebec members who 
support this legislation, who smile and who do not dare get up to 
protect Quebec's interests, as they claimed they would do when 
they were elected. Now that they are here, they are a lot more 
polite and conciliatory. They are members of a party in office, so 
they want to protect their personal career. This has priority over 
the interests of the people, the riding and the Quebec nation 
which they are here to represent.
<P>
	I want to say a word about the last federal budget and its major 
component, which is the new structure of transfer payments. 
This is an extraordinary camouflage exercise, and I will tell you 
why. The government is trying to make us believe that it will be 
more flexible, that things will go better and that the same 
services will be provided with less money. Less money, more 
standards and probably more controls.
<P>
	I participated in an English radio talk show, in Montreal, with 
the Minister of Human Resources Development. The moderator 
asked: ``Does this new Canada Social Transfer mean that the 
federal government will no longer have control over transfer 
payments''? The minister replied: ``No, quite the contrary. We 
will have more control than ever before. We did not have 
controls in certain areas before, but now we will''. All this 
remains to be defined.
<P>
	Of course, the federal government will invite the provinces to 
come and negotiate with a loaded gun to their head: ``If you do 
not want to lose even more federal support, then approve these 
standards''. An internal document circulating among party 
ranks indicates that this is just the beginning. Other financial 
objectives will be set.
<P>
	After these initial cuts of $7 billion to transfer payments, 
which will primarily affect Quebec, the process will continue 
since we must solve the federal government's financial 
problems. This, without any consideration for the problems 
which will result from this process, particularly for some 
provinces, including problems related to their credit rating and 
to the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11438"> 11438 </A></B>
<P>
imbalance which these measures will create in provincial 
budgets.
<P>
	Let me put transfer payments in their proper context, because 
this is a complex issue. I want to point out some specifics for the 
benefit of those who are listening to us. There are currently three 
main types of transfer programs. First, there is the Established 
Programs Financing, second, the equalization program, and 
third, the Canada Assistance Plan. Let me review them briefly 
one by one.
<P>
	First, under Established Programs Financing, taxpayers pay 
taxes to the federal government who, according to certain 
criteria, sends part of the money to the provinces for their health 
and post-secondary education programs.
<P>
	As for equalization, it is a measure of wealth redistribution or 
rather a measure of redistribution among the provinces of the 
capacity to generate income. Seven provinces benefit from the 
equalization program; the amounts they were entitled to were 
recently capped. Whenever something is expensive, they put a 
limit to it so that the costs will not increase too much in the 
future.
<P>
	So, one of the first bills that the government tabled before the 
Parliament was Bill C-3, to limit equalization payments so that 
they would not increase too much. And yet, the objective of this 
program is to redistribute wealth. Consequently, that bill meant 
limiting the ability to redistribute wealth.
<P>
	Obviously, the Liberals have lost this concept in the last few 
weeks or months, or even in the last years. They should now be 
called the old Liberals, since they look more and more like 
Conservatives. Even if they do not like to hear that, they must be 
called by their name, they must wear the hat that fits them.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	The third type of transfer payment is the Canada Assistance 
Plan. That is mainly in the welfare sector. The government is 
funding a part of provincial spending in that sector.
<P>
	So, there are these three components. Let us take equalization 
payments from that, because they are not affected by the new 
Canada social transfer. All there was to say on this is that the 
government has limited the potential growth of that system.
<P>
	In the new Canada social transfer, the two other types have 
been amalgamated: the Canada Assistance Plan and Established 
Programs. They become one single program.
<P>
	Obviously, because this government intended to cutback 
post-secondary education and attended the demonstrations 
made by students-I remember well seeing them on the 
Hill-they said: ``It is true. When they are told directly that 
education or health will be cut, they react. Therefore, we should 
mix everything together and proceed with cuts thereafter. This 
way, they will not be able to say that we have made cuts in a 
specific area, be it education, health or social welfare. 
Provincial governments will be totally free to choose where to 
cut. That is flexible federalism''. That is what you are told.  You 
are free to choose in what area you will cut: education, health or 
social welfare. That is what this government is defending, 
almost with a smile, in joy and almost with conviction. This is 
veryastonishing.
<P>
	This new Canada social transfer will reduce the amounts 
transferred by $2.5 billion, not this year, obviously, because it 
knows perfectly well that this is a very important year on the 
Canadian political scene because of what is going on in Quebec. 
Therefore, it is waiting. Since it does not want to decide now 
how to define the new Canada that it wants to build, it will 
reduce the amounts transferred by $2.5 billion next year and by 
$4.5 billion the following year, without saying who will be 
affected and to what extent. All that is known is that it will 
happen in the second year, that $650 million of the $2.5 billion 
will be cut in Quebec, and that in the following year, as much as 
$1.9 billion of the $4.5 billion could be cut in Quebec.
<P>
	Quebec would assume more than its share since the criteria 
used for allocating funds under the Canadian social transfer are 
going to be reviewed. Given the lobbying efforts which will be 
made by the wealthiest provinces, such as Ontario, one can be 
sure that these provinces are going to try to get a bigger share.
<P>
	Furthermore, we are all aware of the upcoming election in 
Ontario and of the possibility that their Liberal colleagues will 
be elected. They are going to show great compassion for their 
colleagues and no doubt help make their transfer payments more 
generous. Again, Quebec would assume more than its share. As I 
said earlier, these cuts could add up to $1.9 billion.
<P>
	During the two minutes remaining, I will show how 
intolerable it is to implement all these cuts while insisting on 
maintaining the same standards and probably raising them. All 
the while federal members of Parliament are strolling through 
their ridings, patting themselves on the back and claiming that 
we have an extraordinary health care system. They say to their 
constituents that they will be protected, that they will define 
standards. They will do it and the bill will be paid not by the 
federal government, but by provincial governments. They are 
the ones who will be stuck with the difficult job of deciding how 
to do it. The federal government will only ask them to adhere to 
standards-that will probably be raised-with less money. Go 
figure.
<P>
	We do not want to allow for flexibility or to leave the 
governments some room to adjust. We prefer to remain good 
members of Parliament and, as such, protect the principles and 
preserve the universal aspect of social programs. So we let them 
manage the monetary aspect of the matter.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11439"> 11439 </A></B>
<P>
	This is basically what this budget does, although it tries to 
hide it. Here is another point that I was just about to forget. This 
budget talks about tax points, equalization and cash transfers. 
What is being cut by the budget are the cash transfers to the 
provinces. This is the part which is changed and remixed.
<P>
	The government adds up cash transfer payments, equalization 
and also tax points, on which it has no control whatsoever, and 
says: ``Look how little we are cutting''.
<P>
	This is a terrible cover up by people who, during the election 
campaign, were going around with their red book in hand saying 
that their objective was a more open, a more transparent 
government, so transparent in fact you could almost see through 
the front cover of the red book. They were going around 
everywhere saying: ``We are going to have something very 
understandable, very clear so that people know what the 
government is doing''.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	This budget manipulates, messes around with and monkeys 
with figures to make people believe that they will hardly be 
affected. This is what we have to expect from a Liberal 
government which has become more conservative than the 
Tories and has grown more and more like the Reform Party. This 
is the kind of Canada this government is shaping. For our part, 
we are going to have to explain all this to people who will have a 
choice to make.
<P>
	We will have the opportunity to conduct the same debate in a 
few months since the government will only implement its new 
vision next year, being afraid of doing it before the referendum. 
We will be there to remind Quebecers, before they make a 
choice, that they have to find out who these people who govern 
us are, where they are leading us and what will the consequences 
be.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is interesting to hear the debate on the 
budget and whether or not it should be delayed. I believe that 
although the budget is not really what I would have liked to have 
seen, the government had better get on with it and start 
instituting some cost cutting measures. If the government were 
to be prudent, it would come up with another budget in the fall to 
continue the process and start working toward a balanced 
budget.
<P>
	I come from a province that is often criticized for living in a 
different world. It is the province of British Columbia. It is quite 
true, we do live in a part of the country that is quite different 
from the rest of Canada. The Rocky Mountains separate us from 
the rest of Canada. Because of our separation from the rest of 
Canada, our trade has been north-south. Our communication has 
been with our neighbours to the south.
<P>
	My riding is on the Canadian-American border. We are not 
afraid of Americans. We are not afraid of trading with them or of 
being friends with them. We have established in our province a 
relationship with the states of Washington, Oregon and 
California that has developed its own economy. It is very 
distressful for me to see, because of the strength of the flow of 
goods and commerce north and south, that some Canadian 
businesses in my riding and in neighbouring ridings have chosen 
to move their businesses south of the border. They have not only 
chosen to move their businesses south of the border, but they 
have taken jobs south of the border. The reason they gave me is it 
is because of the cost of doing business in Canada. A lot of the 
cost of doing business in Canada is made up of high taxes and 
regulations that governments impose on the business 
community. It troubles me that these businesses are taking their 
money and their jobs and moving south.
<P>
	It gives me some encouragement when I hear of groups such 
as Cascadia, which is an economic union between some of the 
northwestern United States and some of the western provinces 
of this country. I believe it is a union that includes Alaska, 
Washington, Oregon and northern California, with Alberta and 
British Columbia. It is an economic union that has some 
powerful economists and business people who are looking at the 
potential of a more secure economic union between western 
provinces and the western United States. That gives me some 
faith that there are other ways of addressing some of the 
problems that are created by the government.
<P>
	I would hate to think that this economic union, which seems to 
be blossoming, might ever become a political union. It is 
important that I represent my constituency and my country in 
saying that this government has a mandate from the people of 
this country to try to reduce the cost of government so that 
businesses, not only in my constituency but in all constituencies 
across the country, will stay in Canada, will keep the jobs in 
Canada and will keep the money in Canada.
<P>
	It is my concern that this government take seriously the task it 
has at hand, to make sure it is up front with Canadians as to what 
reducing government spending will cost. The government must 
be honest, it must be forthright, and it must look to the future of 
this country, not just to what is happening today.
<P>
<B>(1800 ) </B>
<P>
	It is very important for the government to get on with the 
business at hand, not to delay implementing the budget, but to 
get on with implementing it today. It is just as important for the 
government to look at coming back with another budget, a 
mini-budget if you will, that will carry it forward until the next 
budget year.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11440"> 11440 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to think this is only a first step, albeit a small 
step, in a process of the government balancing a budget. 
Canadians expect that. The Reform Party, in listening to what 
constituents are telling us, has come up with a vision which 
seems to be lacking from the government. It is a vision that 
looks at balancing the budget in the near future, not in 10 years 
when it is too late.
<P>
	It is very important that we balance the budget as soon as 
possible. Only then can the government start eliminating an 
interest payment, or at least reducing an interest payment, and 
start eliminating the debt that has accumulated to over $550 
billion. Our children and grandchildren can expect nothing less 
from all of us but to look at that very real problem, the problem 
that in three years time, if the government continues with its 
plan, we will be paying $50 billion in interest payments.
<P>
	At least the Reform Party has acknowledged the problem, has 
identified the solution to the problem is short term pain for long 
term gain. In its taxpayers budget, the Reform Party has been up 
front, honest and has shown the Canadian public what is 
necessary for the country to get its financial house in order. The 
Reform Party has shown vision when it has talked about other 
ways for people to look after their own interests, to look after 
their own economic needs.
<P>
	We have been visionary in looking at what is wrong with the 
system as it stands today and where we can go with it. When we 
talk to Canadians about the potential of an RPSP, a personal plan 
where they invest in their own future to look after their own 
needs, it is something Canadians can understand and they look 
for.
<P>
	I do not know how many constituents I have talked to have 
contributed to the unemployment insurance plan and find that 
after 30 years of working it is not there for them when they need 
it. I do not know how many Canadians I have talked to in my 
constituency have contributed money to the civil servant 
pension plan or the RCMP pension plan or the defence pension 
plan, the armed forces pension plan. They think that money is 
sitting there in a pension plan, that it is protected. In reality that 
money is in the big black hole and is part of our national debt.
<P>
	There is no security in there for any of these people who are 
looking at the Canadian pension plan or the individual pension 
plan. That concerns them. They look at this visionary RPSP 
where they are contributing to a plan that is there for them when 
they need it. They decide how much they will take out to assist 
them when there is unemployment or any other situation. They 
look at that as a new way, an interesting way, an interesting 
concept and something they can really get into.
<P>
	I look forward to the days and months to come of expanding 
on that idea and sharing with Canadians how that can work for 
them. Canadians are looking to their government to have that 
kind of vision, for their  government to be able to look for new 
ideas, not always falling back on the old way of doing things.
<P>
	The old way of doing things which the Liberals brought in 
many years ago, 30-odd years ago, in deficit budgeting followed 
by the Mulroney Conservatives, has put us in this position. It is 
incumbent on the government to start taking the lead from the 
Reform Party with a newer vision and to start looking for some 
real answers instead of doing things the stale old way that only 
gets us deeper and deeper into debt.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, in 
speaking to Bill C-76, I would like to draw the attention of this 
House to what is really at stake in the budget tabled last 
February 27 by the Minister of Finance. This bill is supposed to 
be an act to implement certain provisions of the budget, 
according to the wording in the bill.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	These provisions will change the financial and social 
framework of this country, independently of any constitutional 
or administrative agreement with the provinces.
<P>
	The creation of the new Canada social transfer to replace the 
Canada assistance plan and the program to fund established 
programs will completely change the division of financial 
resources between Ottawa and the provinces in the future.
<P>
	Through this Canada social transfer, the federal government 
will reduce drastically its contributions to the funding of health 
and social programs. Clause 48 of part V of the bill mentions, 
and I quote: ``Subject to this part -for the purposes of (a) 
establishing interim arrangements to finance social programs in 
a manner that will increase provincial flexibility; (b) 
maintaining the national criteria and conditions in the <I>Canada 
Health Act</I>''.
<P>
	Despite the talk of greater flexibility for the provinces, the 
federal government is going to reduce its financial contribution 
substantially and the provinces will have to implement all 
aspects of the Canada Health Act, including the key components 
of public administration, comprehensiveness, universality, 
portability, accessibility, extra billing and user charges. How 
can the provinces be flexible when they must comply with all 
provisions of the Canada Health Act while Ottawa is reducing its 
financial contribution to health care and social programs in 
general?
<P>
	Given the current overtaxation of the middle class, which, it 
must be said, remains the real cash cow of all levels of 
government, and the chronic indebtedness of the federal and 
provincial governments, the provinces will have no room left to 
manoeuvre. Although the federal government is withdrawing 
from financing, it will continue to make the rules.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11441"> 11441 </A></B>
<P>
	For 30 years, the provinces have been fighting against federal 
government interference in areas of provincial jurisdiction. 
Until now, Ottawa used to compensate for invading provincial 
jurisdictions by footing part of the bill. Today, Ottawa is 
interfering even more, even if it is paying less. It is transferring 
onto the provinces the horrible task of increasing taxes and 
cutting elsewhere. The federal government is literally putting 
the provinces in a straitjacket. It even goes as far as forcing the 
provinces to refer to the Canada Social Transfer in all their ads 
and documentation concerning the health services they provide. 
All this window-dressing only to cut $7 billion on the backs of 
the provinces through the implementation of the Canada Social 
Transfer.
<P>
	So, Bill C-76 will offload the federal deficit onto the 
provinces; since the legislative framework for health-related 
matters will stay the same, the federal government will only 
have to transfer its deficit.
<P>
	Because of the pressure exerted by the richer provinces, the 
federal government is seriously thinking about changing the 
envelope for the main provincial transfers, except of course for 
the equalization payments which will in any way be 
significantly reduced beginning in 1996-97. As I was saying, 
the government is thinking about reducing the envelope for all 
provincial transfers according to the population figures instead 
of the wealth index which is now being used. If distribution is 
based on population, as the government is contemplating, then 
Quebec will have to deal with almost 42 per cent of all the cuts 
made to the provincial transfers in 1997-98.
<P>
	Bill C-76 even provides for new health criteria and paves the 
way for new criteria in the areas of welfare and post-secondary 
education. Is this what the flexible federalism the Liberal 
government has been pushing for is all about?
<P>
	Education is a very sensitive area for Quebecers who make up 
a distinct minority in Canada. The prime minister's centralizing 
federalism does not recognize this reality, and that is why more 
and more Quebecers do not want to be part of a country whose 
government shows so little sensitivity to their cultural identity 
and their most legitimate aspirations.
<P>
	Quebecers are puzzled about one thing: Quebec's debt is at 
$70 billion, whereas the Canadian government has borrowed 
about $126 billion in the name of Quebecers since 1972. 
Therefore, Quebec's share of the federal debt is 45 per cent 
higher than its own provincial debt, although the latter remains 
high.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	Quebecers have come to wonder how a federal government 
that has done so poorly in managing their hard-earned money 
can still be trying to impose its will upon a Quebec government 
that is also closer to them from a cultural standpoint.
<P>
	By withdrawing its funding and by forcing the provinces to 
comply with new national standards, the federal government 
will be dealing, in a few years, with provinces whose tax base 
will be considerably weakened. This will give yet more power to 
the central government which will have greatly reduced its 
fiscal obligations and which will be in a position to interfere 
even more in areas under provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	The newspapers reported last week that Jean-Claude Rivest, 
an independent senator, and Claude Forget, former health 
minister in Quebec, fear a fiscal coup by Ottawa after a victory 
for the ``no'' in the Quebec referendum. My colleague from 
Trois-Rivières talked about it very eloquently a while ago.
<P>
	Mr. Rivest and Mr. Forget, who have good connections within 
the federal government as reported in the <I>Journal de Montréal</I> 
on March 30, have no reason to worry.	With this Bill C-76 and with the budget tabled on February 27, the federal government has already launched its fiscal coup against Quebec, even though the referendum in that province has not yet taken place.
<P>
	Neither the finance minister's budget nor the bill before us 
today contain any provisions about the tax system, especially as 
it applies to families and young households, the only ones that 
would be likely to stimulate consumption and economic activity 
and to give some breathing room to provinces, which could 
intervene more freely and more energetically on their territory 
and in their particular jurisdictions by involving the 
stakeholders.
<P>
	The centralizing federalism practised by the Liberals goes 
against every attempt at decentralization toward the provinces. 
Therefore, we must strongly reject Bill C-76.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak to the amendment the 
Bloc has put forward. It wants to delay the implementation of 
the budget for six months. I am sure it has a political agenda 
behind this amendment. I would imagine that it is to try to add 
more credence to its failing sovereignty program. I can think of 
no other reason for an amendment like this.
<P>
	However, I suggest the government delay the implementation 
of the budget for eternity. This is not a budget the Canadian 
people were asking for. While the hon. member for Halifax a 
short time ago said eastern Canadians were smarter than western 
Canadians, there are a whole lot of western Canadians who 
apply some good, common sense to getting this financial crisis 
and the House in order.
<P>
	I want to paraphrase part of a speech by Mackenzie King in 
the House in 1935. What he was saying applies to the situation 
we have today. He said that when a government loses control of 
its currency and credit in effect all talk of democracy in the 
country is both useless and futile. That is exactly the situation 
the country is in. We have lost control of our currency and credit. 
Every  decision we try to make in the House is influenced by the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11442"> 11442 </A></B>
<P>
fact that we are some $500 billion in debt. We have an annual 
interest payment of some $47 billion.
<P>
	As we discuss issues in the House, no matter what they are, 
industry and trade, Indian affairs and northern development, the 
health problems or the social problems, they are influenced by 
the fact that our country is seriously hemorrhaging in debt. 
Every decision we make has to take into account that we owe 
$500-plus billion and we are paying an annual interest rate to 
service that debt of some $47 billion. We are being held captive 
by the irresponsible spending that was started during the 
Trudeau administration and carried on by the successive 
governments under Tory prime ministers Clark and Mulroney.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	Before the Trudeau administration came to power we were 
basically running a balanced budget. We had a small national 
debt that was perfectly manageable. Somehow the special 
interest groups got to the Trudeau government and said: 
``Listen, if you will give us more of this and more of that, we 
will vote for you''. The Liberal government heard that message 
and thought: ``This is a good thing. Let us go out and tell all of 
Canada they can have whatever they want and not to worry about 
paying for it. As long as they vote for us, we will give them 
whatever they want''. They instilled in this country, in the 
Canadian people, during those years an attitude of entitlement, 
that the Canadian people were entitled to every single thing they 
wanted. The government told them: ``Do not worry about paying 
for it. We will borrow the money and sooner or later we will get 
around to looking after the debt.''
<P>
	Well, now some 28 or 29 years later, look what this got us. We 
have a half a trillion dollar debt and an interest payment that 
would pay for all the social programs in this country if we did 
not have it. This government talks about its famous red book and 
its promises. This government is trapped by the promises in the 
red book. The Canadian people are demanding that the 
government get control of its financial house. The Liberal 
government knows what it has to do. The Minister of Finance 
knew what he had to do, but the soft-headed Liberals in that 
party would not let him make the drastic and severe cuts that are 
needed.
<P>
	They are trapped by the promises in the red book. The red 
book says: ``We will bring the deficit within 3 per cent of our 
GDP''. Big deal. That can be done by increasing the GDP. 
Spending does not have to be cut. That is fine as long as the 
economy stays buoyant. But what happens if there is a downturn 
in the economy, as was forecast in <I>The Globe and Mail</I> just a 
couple of days ago?
<P>
	Under the government's budget plan and deficit reduction 
plans, if we have another downturn in the economy our fiscal 
house is headed for disaster once again. The government will 
use the same excuse the Tory  government used. It will say: 
``Well, there is nothing we could do about it. We inherited this 
debt from the Tories.'' The Tories said: ``There is nothing we 
could do about it. We inherited the debt from the Liberals.''
<P>
	The Canadian people are sick and tired of excuses. They want 
action. The people who invest in business in this country are sick 
and tired of excuses. They want action. Everywhere we go in this 
country people are saying: ``We want a balanced budget''. The 
Liberals say: ``Oh, no. Sorry. Canada does not need a balanced 
budget. You do not know what you are talking about. We have a 
plan that is going to cut the deficit to $25 billion in 1997 and 
everything is going to be okay. It is a feel good budget''. At the 
same time they are going to add $100 billion to our debt and 
maybe another $10 billion to the interest payments.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, any economist will tell you that if you are 
deeply in debt-as a matter of fact, my wife will tell you, 
because she runs our household budget and does a darned good 
job, that the time to reduce your debt is when things are good, 
when you have a good paying job. Let us apply that same simple 
principle to this budget. This government should apply that 
same principle. Things are pretty good in this country right now. 
Now is the time to make some drastic cuts and get rid of the 
deficit. Get the fiscal house of this country in order.
<P>
	The Canadian people, the consumers in this country, have no 
confidence in the financial affairs of this government. If they 
did, consumer spending would be far higher than it is now. The 
investors in this country have no confidence in the future of the 
financial plans of this government. If they did, investment 
would be higher now. That is where we have to target. We have 
to get back people's confidence in the investment community.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	I would like to tell the Liberals how they can be heroes. All 
they have to do is balance the budget. Give the Canadian people 
a definite time line to balance the budget. Regain the confidence 
of the Canadian people in the way the government handles the 
fiscal problems. Get rid of the deficit. Say to the people: ``We 
have shown you that we have our financial crisis under control. 
We have eliminated the deficit''.
<P>
	Once there is a balanced budget the Liberals can say to the 
Canadian people: ``We think you have confidence in us once 
again. Here is what we want to do. About 30 per cent of our 
national debt is foreign owned. Let us bring that foreign owned 
portion of our debt home. We are going to issue something 
similar to a war bond. We are going to declare war on our foreign 
debt. We want all Canadians to invest in these war bonds''. That 
is something saleable, but only when Canadians are confident 
once again that the government is in control of its financial 
house.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11443"> 11443 </A></B>
<P>
	I think many Liberal members would agree with that. I thank 
the hon. member for her support. I think it is a good idea.
<P>
	This budget should be thrown out the window. This 
government should bring in a budget with a definite time line on 
balancing it. If it is 1997-98, so be it; if it is 1998-99, so be it, 
but give Canadians a light at the end of the tunnel. Show 
Canadians the government is serious about getting the deficit 
and debt under control. Only then will confidence be returned to 
this government.
<P>
	I can assure you that confidence will be returned once again in 
1997-98 when the Reform Party of Canada forms the 
Government of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is my pleasure to participate in this debate on the 
Bloc amendment with respect to Bill C-76, the budget 
implementation act.
<P>
	What we have seen is an effort by the Liberal government 
opposite to try to get a handle on its budget without considering 
the effects on the economy in western Canada or the effects on 
the national economy.
<P>
	What this budget has done is described in one word in terms of 
an impact on the province of Saskatchewan and on rural Canada. 
The day after the budget there was a one word headline in big 
bold black letters across the front of the <I>Leader Post</I>. The word 
was ``devastated''. Western Canada and rural Canada have been 
devastated by two major planks of that budget. I refer 
specifically to the elimination of the Crow benefit and the 
abandonment of rail lines in rural Canada.
<P>
	The present minister of agriculture used to be a parliamentary 
secretary to Minister of Transport Otto Lang back in the 
mid-seventies. At that time the Liberal government attempted 
to commence the dismantling of the Crow rate as it was called 
then. The minister of agriculture who sits in this government 
today was defeated in 1979. He was defeated in 1980. He was 
defeated a number of other times provincially after that 
involvement with Otto Lang and the Liberal government to 
dismantle the Crow rate. He was re-elected in the 1993 election 
and was appointed minister of agriculture. In one fell swoop of a 
budget not only does he dismantle the Crow benefit but he also 
eliminates it entirely from the rural Canadian population.
<P>
	What we see as a result of this very treacherous act on farmers 
who supported him in the last election is an act of betrayal. The 
minister of agriculture has stood in this House and betrayed 
rural Canada with the elimination of the Crow benefit. For the 
members opposite, as a result of this budget, I predict that not 
this summer, not this fall, perhaps not even next year, but in the 
next election which is held in this country no Liberal members 
will be elected in the province of Saskatchewan.
<P>
<B>(1825 ) </B>
<P>
	The budget and the elimination of the Crow benefit will be the 
major reason for the defeat of the minister of agriculture and all 
of his Liberal colleagues from Saskatchewan.
<P>
	What is the argument for abolishing the Crow benefit? If the 
argument is that the Crow has to be cut to conform with the 
GATT, farmers do not buy it. The requirements of GATT can be 
otherwise met. At least that is an argument. If Canada cannot 
afford the subsidy, at least that is an argument. What is the 
argument for essentially scrapping this transportation policy 
and putting nothing in its place? It is not fair.
<P>
	It is also not fair to reduce dairy subsidies by 30 per cent, but 
transport subsidies to Saskatchewan grain farmers are cut by 
100 per cent. We know Ottawa has a deficit and debt problem, 
but we must do our bit. This means we should tailor the suit to fit 
the cloth.
<P>
	The scrapping of the Crow has left serious questions 
unanswered. In the short term the issue of who gets the $1.6 
billion payout and how and when it will be distributed must be 
answered now for the farmers in very clear terms so they can 
make informed decisions about this year's operations.
<P>
	More important, Ottawa must look at the long term because 
these long term costs will be high. The former chairman of the 
agriculture committee, who is participating in this debate from 
his seat, is quite upset with the fact that farmers are upset with 
his government and his party for having eliminated the Crow 
benefit.
<P>
	I can assure the member that when the next election is called 
even the Alberta members in the Liberal Party will be defeated 
as well and perhaps also those from the Liberal Party in 
Manitoba.
<P>
	I want to recognize the impacts to farmers in Saskatchewan of 
the abolition of the Crow benefit. Swift Current is a city in the 
western part of the province. The tonnage, the freight rate for a 
tonne of grain, will increase from $13.82 in 1994-95 to $28.58 
in 1995-96. That is about a 125 per cent increase. Also, the 
projection for 1996-97 shows the freight rate for a tonne of 
grain will increase to $32.28, a further increase.
<P>
	In the eastern part of our province, the southeast where we 
have a Liberal member sitting, in Estevan district, the increase 
will be from $11.80 per tonne in 1994-95 to over double, $23.48 
in 1995-96. For 1996-97 the projection is $34.64, tripling the 
current rate.
<P>
	Those in the eastern part of our province will be hardest hit. 
The overall result barring crop adjustments will be a loss of 
$320 million a year in net farm income in Saskatchewan alone. 
This represents a drop in income of about 50 per cent for farm 
families, and any shortfall in grain prices will compound their 
loss.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="11444"> 11444 </A></B>
<P>
	At the same time, federal safety net funding is to be cut by 30 
per cent over the next three years, again hitting mostly the grain 
sector. We see substantial increases to transportation in Atlantic 
Canada for highways and roads but we do not see any 
comparable increase for the loss of the Crow benefit which will 
severely impact our good road system in Saskatchewan.
<P>
	Ottawa's changes to the regulatory system mean that as of 
January 1, 1996 some 500 miles of light steel rail lines will be 
subject to abandonment with no review, affecting 48 
communities in Saskatchewan. Another 3,000 miles of branch 
lines become eligible for abandonment after an as yet undefined 
review process, affecting another 383 cities, towns, villages and 
hamlets. This fast tracking of branch line abandonment means 
higher trucking costs and the further one is from a main line, the 
higher those costs will be. For instance, the distance from Kyle, 
Saskatchewan to the nearest main line is about 70 kilometres; 
from Val Marie it is about 150 kilometres.
<P>
	What about the higher road maintenance costs to support this 
increased trucking? Who pays for this? I am encouraged Ottawa 
finally recognized the road impact, but the $300 million 
adjustment spread over six years and across three provinces with 
only part of this designated for roads-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Your time has expired.

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADIANWHEATBOARD">CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I would like to thank you once again for giving 
me the opportunity to address questions to the government 
which the people of Saskatchewan, particularly farm people and 
the communities they support, are concerned about.
<P>
	On March 17, on behalf of the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food and the Minister of Finance, the Minister of 
Transport answered, inadequately, two important questions I put 
to the government in regard to the Liberals' plan to eliminate the 
Crow benefit.
<P>
	First, I want more information with regard to the future of the 
Canadian Wheat Board and its request for regulatory control 
over freight rates. The minister was aware that the Canadian 
Wheat Board asked the federal government to give farmers a 
short term break on freight rates and I agreed with the board.
<P>
	There is no debate about how the elimination of the Crow 
benefit will affect the increased costs of shipping grain by rail. 
Those costs will increase dramatically. In fact, for the benefit of 
those who are uninformed here in the Chamber tonight, it should 
be noted that when taken to its lowest common denominator, the 
average benefit of the Crow rate to a Saskatchewan farmer in 
1994-95 terms is $15.63 per tonne out of a total grain freight 
cost of $30.35 per tonne. On an average sized farm this means an 
average increase in costs of $10,000 to $12,000 per year per 
farm as of August 1, 1995. As members heard me say in my 
speech in the House last week, this means a community increase 
of about $1 million for every delivery point in the province.
<P>
	Given no other changes, the government's decision to 
eliminate the Crow benefit will result in a doubling of farmers' 
shipping costs at the same time that farm income support from 
the federal government will drop by 30 per cent over the next 
three years. There is nothing to say that when the federal 
government removes itself from the business of helping to move 
grain to port by rail that the railways will not immediately 
increase the cost of the freight. The Canadian Wheat Board, 
most Saskatchewan farmers and I would like to see some sort of 
regulatory control put in place to ensure that there are no 
immediate or later unnecessary increases imposed on farmers 
during this most vulnerable time.
<P>
	On March 17 I also raised the question of the future of the 
Canadian Wheat Board because no studies have been done on 
this subject. The government is eliminating the Crow benefit 
with the stated intention of reducing the amount of grain grown 
on the prairies in favour of more crop diversification. With less 
grain, especially wheat, and with the need of the Canadian 
Wheat Board to have a secure supply of product on hand for our 
many customers around the world, I want to know if the 
government has spent any time studying what the long term 
implications of the decision to eliminate the Crow rate will have 
on the Canadian Wheat Board and the security of its supply.
<P>
	In a supplementary question I expressed concern about the 
pending payout of $1.6 billion. It is already acknowledged that 
farmers' costs will be increased by the elimination of the Crow 
benefit and it was speculated from day one that land values 
would decrease. Now it seems that the Liberals are 
acknowledging that land values will decrease and, as a result, 
they are putting in place a financial compensation package 
which seems to only address the decrease in land values.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am responding to the hon. 
member's question of March 17.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="11445"> 11445 </A></B>
<P>
	The WGTA reform will have a major impact on our grain 
handling transportation system. The Ministers of Agriculture 
and Agri-Food and Transportation, in consultation with all 
stakeholders, have developed plans and strategies to assist 
farmers in making the transition to a new market environment.
<P>
	This will include a legislative and regulatory framework 
which will assist in the achievement of efficiency gains. For 
example, the provision of the National Transportation Act will 
help to foster competitively priced grain transportation services 
and cost savings for farmers and shippers. A system will be put 
in place to ensure the provision of necessary information, 
monitoring and review processes. These in turn will be used to 
track system revenues, costs, efficiency achievements and an 
appropriate sharing of benefits. In other words, provision has 
been made to pass efficiency savings on to the farmers.
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	Regarding the hon. member's concerns related to the 
government's ex gratia WGTA payment, it is important to note 
that the transportation subsidy had an impact on land values. 
With the elimination of the subsidy, the payment addresses the 
subsequent changes in these land values.
<P>
	In addition, the payment is decoupled. This means it will be 
market neutral with respect to future production and marketing 
decisions of producers. It is also in keeping with Canada's 
international trade obligations.
<P>
	It is important to note the government's assistance is not 
limited to this payment. Saskatchewan will share in a $300 
million adjustment fund.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="MILDAVIESHIPYARD">MIL DAVIE SHIPYARD</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
my remarks tonight follow up on my question to the Prime 
Minister on December 8, 1994, about the contract awarded to 
Saint John Shipbuilding without a call for tenders; the MIL 
Davie Shipyard, which had submitted a bid, was wronged in the 
process. Here is the question I asked:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>How can the Prime Minister explain that, despite the clear directive issued by 
him to the president of the consortium, Mr. Ken Hall, Hibernia has refused to 
redress the injustice to which he has himself so strongly objected?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Prime Minister answered:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I think the company should not have acted in this way. I have said it clearly, 
but since we own only 8.5 per cent of the company's shares, we cannot force it to 
change its decision. I still think it is a bad decision for both the Newfoundland 
shipyard and the Quebec shipyard.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The answer given by the Prime Minister is not complete. In 
my opinion, it is not true that the federal government is not in a 
position to force its views on the Hibernia project. It is true that 
the federal government owns 8.5 per cent of the shares in the 
Hibernia project for $340 million, but the Prime Minister forgot 
to tell us  that the government invested $400 million more in 
1992, when Gulf pulled out. The federal government also pays 
almost $100 million in cost overruns. It granted $1 billion in 
subsidies and gave $1.7 billion in loan guarantees. More over, it 
undertook to pay the difference in production costs between the 
market price and $25 a barrel.
<P>
	Let them not pretend the federal government is just any other 
investor. It is the main investor in the project with $3 billion out 
of $6 billion. The Prime Minister should have taken a tougher 
stand and demanded that the consortium follow his directive. 
Hibernia is the perfect image of Canadian federalism with the 
lobbyists making the decisions and the Prime Minister carrying 
them out. As a result, we have policies which lead to waste and a 
debt of $500 billion, megaprojects which are ruining us and will 
never be profitable.
<P>
	Of the five modules ordered for the amount of $100 million, 
two were made in Korea, two in Italy and one in Newfoundland, 
following construction of a shipyard 25 per cent of which was 
paid for out of our tax money. We were told that the study 
recently claimed that MIL Davie was not profitable, but who 
produced this study? It was Ernst &amp; Young, which contributed 
$116,452 to the Conservative and Liberal Parties in the last 
election and received federal contracts worth $2.4 million in 
1993-94. Can Quebecers trust such a partisan study? What I 
would like to know is if the Prime Minister will make a 
commitment to ask the consortium to grant the contracts for the 
construction of future tankers to MIL Davie as was done for 
Saint John Shipbuilding, that is without a call for tenders?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased to respond to the 
member.
<P>
	The hon. member was not satisfied with the response of the 
Prime Minister to his question of December 8, 1994. The 
question at the time related to the process followed by the 
Hibernia consortium last fall when it became necessary to 
remove some work on drilling modules that had commenced at 
the Marystown shipyard in Newfoundland. The work had fallen 
seriously behind schedule.
<P>
	In order to avoid jeopardizing the schedule for the entire 
project, an outcome which could lead to severe cost overruns, 
the Hibernia Management Development Company decided to 
place the completion of this contract in the hands of another 
shipyard on relatively short notice.
<P>
	The contract was transferred to Saint John Shipbuilding for 
completion in New Brunswick without giving the MIL Davie a 
formal opportunity to rebid on the remaining work. The member 
knows that MIL Davie had submitted a bid on the contract when 
it was originally tendered but lost out to Marystown.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="11446"> 11446 </A></B>
<P>
	After the Canada-Newfoundland Offshore Petroleum Board 
reported on the process, followed by the HMDC, the 
Government of Canada and the Prime Minister again asked the 
Hibernia consortium to review its decision. The owners did 
review the decision and four out of five concurred with the 
chosen course of action.
<P>
	With an 8 per cent ownership interest in the project, the 
Canadian government is not in a position to direct decisions 
taken by a basically private sector consortium.
<P>
	I hope this clarifies the matter for the member.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> It being 6.41 p.m., this 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.41 p.m.)
