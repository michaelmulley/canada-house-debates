</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise 
today in this House to table a bill intended to restrict the sale 
of toys which incite children to violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tabling this bill marks an important milestone in an 
undertaking begun more than two years ago by a lady in my riding, 
Mrs. Martine Ayotte. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This mother of five was spurred to action when she purchased 
a doll which came with the suggestion that certain unsavoury 
treatments be visited upon it, the details of which I shall spare 
this House.  She then took steps to ensure that the toys available 
to children would be less violent and more respectful of the values 
we are trying to transmit to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mrs. Ayotte enlisted the support of a large coalition of 
organizations and individuals.  Her petition against violent toys 
has collected 260,000 signatures.  Moreover, it is in jigsaw form

biggest such puzzle in the world.

government from incurring deficits, except under extraordinary 
circumstances.  The Minister of Finance would be accountable to 
Parliament for his management.  Another new element is the fact 
that this bill contains provisions to monitor changes in the

<P><A NAME="LINK25"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
following questions will be answered today: Nos. 72 and 74. 
.[Text] 
<Question No. 72—<B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the settlement of the federal employees' pay 
equity issue: (<I>a</I>) at what stage are the negotiations; (<I>b</I>) 
when will they be finished; and (<I>c</I>) when will the affected 
persons receive their cheques? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK26"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasure Board and Minister 
responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Negotiations were 
undertaken in April 1997 to resolve the longstanding pay equity 
complaints filed by the Public Service Alliance of Canada PSAC. 
The negotiations were based on job evaluation data being 
considered by the Human Rights Tribunal. The tribunal is 
currently deliberating on the issue of a methodology to measure 
and correct pay inequities between predominantly male and female 
occupational groups. The tribunal is expected to render a 
decision sometime after March 31, 1998. While the tribunal is 
deliberating, there remains an opportunity for the employer and 
PSAC to resolve the complaints through negotiations. However, 
after several meetings PSAC tabled a counter proposal valued at 
approximately $5.3 billion. PSAC was informed that this counter 
proposal could not serve as a basis for further discussions and 
that a more reasonable conter proposal was required. No further 
meetings have been held since December 8, 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If no further progress can be achieved through negotiations, the 
parties will await the ruling by the Human Rights Tribunal. At 
this time no further meetings are scheduled between the parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issuance of cheques will be automated to the extent 
possible. Departments are also doing some preparatory work to 
accelerate the issuance and delivery of cheques. Once the final 
amount of the pay equity adjustments has been established, 
cheques to current employees should be issued within weeks. 
Cheques to former employees will follow. 
<Question No. 74—<B>Mr. Ted White:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the House of Commons Intercity Telephone System, 
which is accessed by members via local telephone numbers in some 
cities and via a 1-800 number elsewhere in Canada and the USA: 
(<I>a</I>) are any parts of the system automated so that members can 
use touch tone input to enter their access code and connect to 
the chosen telephone number, and if so, which areas of the 
country have automated systems; (<I>b</I>) what timetable does the 
government have to fully automate the system across Canada, and 
what are the projected annual cost savings for carrying out such 
automation; (<I>c</I>) where is the operator centre for the system 
located, how many people are employed as operators, and what is 
the annual cost for those staff; (<I>d</I>) what is the total annual 
cost of maintaning the system and what is the cost comparison 
with contracting for provision of the services using private 
sector suppliers; and (<I>e</I>) what is the total number of minutes 
carried by the system each year within Canada and to the USA, and 
what is the average cost per minute carried to each of these 
countries? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK27"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government 
Services, Lib.):</B> Presently the only part of the system that is 
automated is within the metropolitan free calling area of 
Montreal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is planning to issue a RFP, request for proposal 
for this service in the first quarter of fiscal year 1998-99. 
Projected annual cost savings cannot be determined until all bids 
are received and analysed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The operator centre for this system is located in Ottawa. The 
contract for the operator services/centre was tendered and 
awarded to Bradson Personnel who employs 40 full and part time 
people. The value of the contract for the staff is $650,000 
annually and provides government directory assistance in addition 
to operator services for the Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The total annual cost for maintaing the system is $4 million 
which is 37% cheaper than other commercially available services. 
We expect further reductions and or savings once the service is 
tendered next year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The traffic for this service is carried on the Government 
Intercity Network. The cost of the calls on the network in Canada 
is 7.25 cents per minute, and calls to the United States are 
12.5 cents per minute.  Last year the total number of minutes 
carried was 13.4 million in Canada, and 586,000 in the United 
States.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> moved: 
<A NAME="LINK32">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House censure any action by the federal 
government in the area of education, such as the introduction 
of the Millennium Scholarships program or national testing. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, today we are putting a very important 
issue before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important, because we feel we must decry the disease 
affecting the federal Liberals, which I would call chronic 
dominating federalism.  It is an infectious disease they caught 
from the Conservatives and is characterized by the search for 
better ways to intrude in provincial jurisdiction, despite the 
Constitution's precluding it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The disease recently led the Liberal government to establish 
the millennium scholarship fund.  An integral part of the financial 
assistance for students section of the Canadian opportunities 
strategy, the Canadian millennium scholarships foundation will have 
an initial budget of $2.5 billion in order to support access to 
knowledge and skills for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is $2.5 billion worth of pretences because if it were really 
committed to access and to reducing the debt load of Quebec students, 
this government would not deny the Quebec government the right to opt 
out with full compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government, which praises the knowledge-based economy, will 
have cut approximately $3 billion in education in Quebec alone between 
1993 and 2003. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This same government championed in this House, in December 1995, a 
motion recognizing the distinct character of Quebec and explicitly 
reassuring Quebeckers that every federal government department, 
institution and agency would take this into account in making decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This same Liberal government claimed in the 1996 Speech from the 
Throne that it would stop using its spending power to develop programs 
in provincial jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government, which stated left and right that all it is trying 
to do is to work in co-operation and partnership with the provinces, 
disregards provincial jurisdictions and priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This action translates into a net loss for the Quebec education 
system. This money could have been used to improve the grants and loans 
system in Quebec, thereby helping to considerably reduce the student 
debt load, as pointed out by the Fédération étudiante universitaire du 
Québec when it testified before the Standing Committee on Human 
Resources Development last November. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear to the Bloc Quebecois that, by establishing the 
millennium scholarship fund, the federal government intrudes in an area 
under Quebec's exclusive jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The evil separatists are not alone; other stakeholders in Quebec 
have commented on this federal intrusion. On February 18, Alain Dubuc 
wrote in <I>La Presse</I>: “The federal system is based on a system of checks 
and balances, like the division of powers, which must not be upset. This 
is especially true in education, where Quebec's distinctiveness is most 
visible. In fact, one wonders why, after establishing its scholarship 
fund, the federal government would not let the provinces manage the fund 
should they wish to do so.—Clearly, while it would rather go it 
alone on this issue, the federal government must reconsider and agree to 
let the Quebec government manage the millennium scholarships awarded in 
Quebec”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, on February 25, in speaking about these 
scholarships, the leader of the opposition said he would have 
preferred to see the jurisdictions of Quebec and the other 
provinces respected fully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Sherbrooke is in the paradoxical situation, on 
the one hand, of supporting a Canadian fund for excellence in 
education, which is just as much an interference in Quebec's 
jurisdiction as the millennium fund and, on the other, thinking of 
running as a candidate in a party that has always opposed the 
federal government's systematic intrusions in provincial 
jurisdictions, particularly education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I understand correctly, he could become leader of a party 
that is part of a broad coalition calling for the respect of 
provincial jurisdictions, while the policy has shortcomings that 
only Liberals and Conservatives understand well enough to explain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I forgot to mention that I will be sharing my 
time with the member for Témiscamingue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us leave aside the disagreements of the Liberals and 
Conservatives and look more closely at this government's reasons 
for creating the millennium scholarship fund.  The government 
recently said that it was the provinces that requested it, and that 
it was necessary to meet the expectations of students in difficult 
economic straits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not go back over this government's failure to respect 
provincial jurisdictions, but will instead focus on what students 
in Quebec and in the rest of Canada want. 
It says in the finance minister's latest budget that these 
scholarships will be awarded to individuals who need help in 
financing their studies and demonstrate merit.  Is this what 
students really want? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the Liberals create this millennium scholarship fund? 
I personally asked the Prime Minister what he had had in mind.  On 
February 26, the member for Shawinigan said in the House:  “We 
think every Quebecker should know that the taxes they pay to the 
federal government give them something in return”.  They are going 
to know it in this case, you can be sure.  The cat is out of the 
bag, or rather the maple leaf is out of the envelope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Prime Minister said, his goal was to use this program as a 
promotional tool to increase the federal government's visibility, waving 
maple leaves everywhere in Canada and, of course, in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government wants to gain visibility at the expense of 
debt-burdened students. Did Quebeckers see through this scheme? 
On March 7, Sondagem published the results of an opinion poll 
about this millennium scholarship fund. Conducted from February 
27 to March 3, this survey is probably a good reflection of 
public opinion in Quebec. The results reveal that 42 per cent of 
the 1000 respondents think that the federal government wanted to 
score political points among the student population, while 20 per 
cent think that this project is aimed at promoting federalism in 
Quebec. Only 22 per cent believe that the only purpose of 
Ottawa's initiative is to help students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we can see, Quebeckers are not fooled by the federal 
government's manoeuvres. 
The president of the Fédération des étudiants universitaires du Québec 
stated in the <I>Journal de Montréal</I> that the millennium fund was only a 
“visibility exercise” on the part of the federal government, and even an 
”ego trip”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of strong pressure, the budget does not provide any right 
to opt out so that provinces like Quebec can control their share of the 
$2.5 billion the federal government wants to spend on higher education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the plan introduced yesterday is still vague and undefined 
and nothing in it justifies the control of the fund by Ottawa, except 
perhaps the desire to see a maple leaf on the cheques distributed to 
students. Maple leaves were good in Nagano. Visibility does not make the 
provincial education systems better or more efficient; it only creates 
duplication and overlap. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jennifer Story, of the Canadian Federation of Students, said, and 
I quote: 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<“questioned why it's necessary to create a new funding mechanism 
to deal with it.  Why not put the money towards the existing 
Canadian Student Loan Program?  Why create something entirely 
new?” 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec is not the only one to say what we are saying today. There 
is a large consensus among students and universities, but the government 
turns a deaf ear to them.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I also have a message for those who held a protest yesterday in 
front of the Quebec National Assembly. These protesters, who are members 
of the various student associations, were asking for an end to cuts in 
the education sector. I support this generation which, in fact, is my 
generation. However, these young Quebeckers should look across the 
Ottawa River, they should look at this Parliament to find those 
responsible for these cuts. The dumping of responsibilities starts here, 
with the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I often wonder, because we hear all this talk here about building 
a forward-looking society, a society based on skills. But the federal 
government imposed cuts of over $3 billion on Quebec, and it is now 
coming up with another program which essentially seeks to give more 
visibility to this government. 
As a society, we have to ask ourselves some tough questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that, during the course of this century, life 
expectancy increased by some 20 years. Since we are now living longer, 
it is vital to invest in education. Instead, the government is making 
cuts, thus making the system ineffective or less effective. We have to 
ask ourselves some tough questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me tell you how I see things. These are the facts confronting 
my generation. There is an increasingly wider gap between the people and 
their elected officials. As I said earlier, the public supports social 
values and goals, while this government seeks visibility. When are we 
really going to try to close this gap between elected officials and the 
public? 
It is urgent that we answer this question.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign 
Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did he consider the possibility of applying to this issue the 
principle of subsidiarity advocated by the European Union, and applying 
the principle of joint management or association between the two levels 
of government, as regards scholarships? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, did the hon. member consider the possibility of a bilateral 
agreement on education between Quebec and Ottawa, patterned on the 1978 
Cullen-Couture agreement? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, one thing seems rather obvious. 
I tend to be more forward-looking than fixated on the past. And when I 
look at the future, what I look for is value for money and equal 
opportunities for all, meaning that those who want a complete education 
should be able to get it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do hope that everyone here supports this principle and agrees 
that we must seek the best and most efficient means to reach this goal. 
At one point in history it was decided that the province was the most 
efficient level of government to manage education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am willing to believe that it is possible for Quebec and Ottawa 
to reach agreements; the Constitution, which says that education is an 
area of provincial jurisdiction, is supposed to be such an agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given this premise, I wonder what the federal government is trying 
to do with its millennium scholarships. Is it an agreement or an 
intrusion to gain visibility? It is making no bones about what this is 
all about. I heard the Prime Minister—not a backbencher, but the Prime 
Minister himself—say that what he was seeking was visibility. Therefore 
I have serious misgivings regarding the return on investment we will get 
out of this fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not against helping students, indeed we believe student 
assistance to be a basic principle. But what is at issue here is 
cost-effectiveness. 
Canadians and Quebeckers are taxed to the hilt and deserve the maximum 
return on their tax dollars.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Education is an investment. As I said before, with life expectancy 
constantly increasing, it is not uncommon for students to stay in 
university well into their mid- or late 20s. But today, people can no 
longer afford this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is my answer. I could go on for another hour, but I will try

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime

phrase, he has acknowledged that it will help students.  That is 
the fundamental essence of the Canadian millennium fund.  He is

which can be and will be discussed.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to make one thing clear. 
If the government opposite promises to give Quebec the right to

not because I do not want to see a maple leaf. That does not 
bother me.  What I want is a good return on the money to be 
invested in education.  The incredible, costly duplications in 
the program that the government is implementing adversely affect 
the cost-effectiveness of this investment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my turn to talk 
today about Ottawa's old fantasy of meddling in education.  We have the 
feeling that for the federal government it is a way of correcting 
somewhat a mistake made at the time the constitution was drawn, that is 
giving provinces jurisdiction over education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not something new or particular to this government.  This 
was also in the platform of other political parties during the last 
election campaign.  Several even wanted to go further and institute 
national testing.  That is precisely why our motion refers to national 
testing.  We know that this is occasionally mentioned in the corridors 
of power in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its Speech from the Throne the government also mentioned studies 
to evaluate the readiness to learn of Canadian children.  Why would the 
federal government want to gauge the readiness of our children to enter 
the school system if it is not to intervene in some way at some time in 
the future?  And we are not talking about giving provinces money to do 
the job.  The federal government wanted to do this evaluation on its own 
and, to my knowledge, it is still committed to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are people in Quebec and elsewhere—I will come back to 
that—opposed to this interference in education? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to speak for other provinces, but Quebec people are 
of a different culture, have a different background—a view not 
necessarily shared by the present Liberal government, I admit. 
Priorities are also different and education is a key element of a 
people's social and economic development. 
It only makes sense that the Government of Quebec, being closer to its 
citizens, would want to set its priorities in the field of education. 
It only makes sense that it be in charge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is precisely why the Constitution of Canada gave the provinces 
exclusive jurisdiction over education, although Ottawa has tried ever 
since to intervene in that field.  Paradoxically, the very government 
asking the Supreme Court for an opinion on the constitutional 
acceptability of Quebec's separation also included in its budget new 
education initiatives that violate the Constitution.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now it takes sovereignist members of Parliament from Quebec to come 
and ask the federal government to respect its own Constitution. It is 
somewhat surprising to see these great champions of the Canadian 
Constitution refusing to respect it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the same people who, following the referendum in Quebec, 
adopted a resolution here in the House of Commons—a trivial motion 
without any authority, as we have seen in that case—recognizing 
Quebec's distinctiveness. We may be called “unique” in other 
constitutional camouflage processes, but for them, we are unique and 
distinct only as long as we are like the others. This is yet another 
blatant federalist contradiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No member of this government will argue today that, according to 
this motion, Quebec should effectively be allowed to deal with its own 
priorities in the area of education. One after the other, they will 
support the millennium scholarships program and speak highly of this 
nice action by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, what will be the impact of the federal government's 
intrusion in the area of education? It starts with millennium 
scholarships, but how do we know it will stop there? We do not know. But 
even with regard to the management of this program, Ottawa does not have 
any infrastructure. It will therefore have to put in place a new 
bureaucracy. It will try hard to cover it and to pretend the program 
will somewhat be managed by the private sector, by some people who will 
be designated by the Liberals, friends of the people in power, but the 
federal government will still need a network to assess student requests, 
to receive the forms, to develop them and to change them in order to 
justify their jobs. 
Therefore, these people will be there and the federal government will 
have a structure, a bureaucracy, while the provinces already have their 
own infrastructure, particularly in the case of Quebec, which has its 
own loans and scholarships program. That is the first impact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other impact, without going further into the debate, because 
this is what provincial parliaments should be doing, but is it in fact 
the real priority in education to give scholarships based on performance 
to students who are already at the post-secondary level? Does the 
education system not have more urgent needs and needs other than this 
one? Many people have talked about this in Quebec. Major reforms are 
being made in the areas of health and education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps some elements should be consolidated. Perhaps there are 
other priorities. The drop-out rate is high at the secondary level. It 
is not by giving millennium scholarships to students who are doing well 
in university that this problem will be solved. 
The federal government is doing this under the guise of so-called access 
to equal opportunities, but that has no relation to real facts. Access 
to equal opportunities should mean striving to give everybody access to 
post-secondary education, but the federal government does not dare to go 
that far. It is proceeding gradually, starting with post-secondary 
education, an area it has already stepped in through its spending power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal spending power, this constitutional plague, allows 
Ottawa to intrude in any area and in any way it sees fit. It has used 
its spending power to set up joint health and education programs, but 
the feeling now is it is not getting enough visibility from transfer 
payments to provinces. It would be better off if it sent 100,000 
individual $3,000 cheques instead. 
The maple leaf and the federal government would be visible all over the 
place. After a while, it reviews its contribution, transfer payments are 
cut and it gives back a symbolic amount in order to achieve greater 
visibility. This is obviously nothing but a political game. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to come back briefly to the spending power. Over the 
years, this spending power has become the power to get into debt. The 
federal government stepped in when it did not have the money to do so. 
It has invaded provincial jurisdictions on borrowed money. Now that we 
have a balanced budget, I bet things will only get worse. The federal 
government is raking in much more revenues that it needs for its own 
priorities and jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provincial governments are responsible for health care, education, 
welfare, municipalities, and their tax capacity, in the case of Quebec 
anyway, is hardly higher than the federal government's. But the federal 
government has no qualms about taking in tax revenues in order to look 
after foreign affairs, national defence, things it deems less visible. 
So, it intrudes in provincial jurisdictions and keeps taxes at an 
outrageous level. Even their great mentor, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, 
expressed that point of view in <I>Cité libre</I> before becoming the leader of 
the Liberal Party. 
I will have the opportunity to come back to this later today. I do not 
mind quoting him to his followers among the members opposite.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we, in the Bloc Quebecois, the only ones to think so? Are we 
seen like a handful of space creatures for taking up this position? No. 
A lot of people in Quebec agree with us, from the most federalist among 
them to the most sovereignist of all. Let me start by quoting someone 
who certainly cannot be considered a true sovereignist. I am talking 
about Alain Dubuc, editorial writer of <I>La Presse</I>. 
What does he think about this? The day after the budget was tabled, in 
his review, there was a small paragraph on the millennium fund, where he 
said: “Nothing in the somewhat fuzzy and still undefined project 
announced yesterday justifies the decision made by Ottawa to manage this 
fund themselves, unless it is to become more visible and to have the 
maple leaf on every cheque handed out to the students”. This is what a 
Quebec federalist who usually supports the central government said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, let us see what the people in the education area had to say. 
Mr. Roch Denis, president of the Fédération québécoise des professeurs 
d'université, said: “The federal government is sprinkling grants here 
and there, just to make its meddling in the education area a little more 
legitimate”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Pierre Tessier, vice-chairman of the Conference of Rectors and 
Principals of Quebec Universities, said the exact same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And I could go on and on and quote the president of the Centrale 
des enseignants du Québec, Mrs. Lorraine Pagé, Mr. Gérald Larose and 
many more. The harshest criticism came from Mrs. Lysiane Gagnon, who 
describes the whole situation quite well. She is not known as a 
sovereignist, at least, you cannot tell from her writings. She said: 
“Ottawa can praise its famous zero deficit as much as they want, the 
real question is how they managed to get rid of the deficit. Answer: It 
was easy, they did it on the backs of others. They only had to dump it 
onto the people below them”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She compares the millennium scholarship fund to candy the federal 
government is handing out to gain maximum visibility. 
A direct gift to citizens brings in more in terms of votes than sending 
a comprehensive envelope to provinces”. For all those who would submit 
that the federal government has a role to play in that area, she writes 
“Contrary to the federal theory, it really is interference, as indirect 
as it might be, in the content of education”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is what she says in her last paragraph “If Mr. Chrétien was in 
the least sincere in his desire to stimulate education, he would have 
helped schools through the governments that have jurisdiction over them. 
But of course we understand that in terms of votes it is more profitable 
to hand out cheques with a maple leaf on it to students, all the more so 
because they, unlike the children in elementary schools, have the right 
to vote”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That sums up the political ploy very well. We see here a government 
more concerned with visibility than efficiency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by moving an amendment to the motion put forward by 
my colleague for Lac—Saint-Jean. I move:

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North—St. Paul, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, for the information of the member who just spoke and 
before we agree to the amendment, let me remind the member that 
in the budget, in case he missed it, the foundation announced 
would be at arm's length from the federal government.  It is on 
page 79 of the 1998 budget plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the Council of Ministers of Education Canada 
representing provincial governments as well as the post-secondary 
community will have a role in identifying directors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the legislation creating the foundation will provide the 
administrative flexibility required to meet the partnership 
objective.  Last, the foundation will also have the authority, 
subject to mutually agreed needs, merit and mobility criteria, to 
contract with appropriate provincial authorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is that flexibility envisioned for the foundation and 
there are also the partnerships with the provinces.  There is 
nothing to fear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to focus on the fact there is $2.5 billion from the 
federal government to help 100,000 Canadian students across the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the member still refuse to see the beauty of the 
millennium fund? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien:</B> Mr. Speaker, that question allows me to deal with 
another aspect of the issue. The millennium fund is nothing more than 
the political legacy of the prime minister, who wants to leave his name 
on something before retiring. He will probably sign all the cheques to 
students for the 10 next years to make sure that he is remembered in 
some way after his retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I ask the hon. member, since he seems to have missed the 
essence of my speech, does he really think that all the people 
questioned on the subject or who took position on the fund, like the 
vice-president of the Conference of Rectors, did so without thinking or 
without even looking at what was said in the budget speech? 
Of course they knew what they were talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week-end, the <I>Gazette</I>, which cannot be suspected of supporting 
Quebec's sovereignists, took exactly the same position as we did when it 
declared that Quebec's Deputy Premier, Mr. Landry, was right and that 
Ottawa should put the money into transfer payments instead, which could 
then be used to cover expenditures in education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A foundation managed by government's chums will not change 
anything. They make me laugh with their speeches on flexibility. Before 
concluding on this point, I will quote for the hon. member Pierre 
Elliott Trudeau, the great federalist mentor who is a source of 
inspiration to him and his colleagues. This is from something he wrote 
in the <I>Action nationale</I>, before he entered federal politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said this about the federal government “This government is 
clearly guilty of going against the principle of proportional taxation, 
which underlies our federal system. It collected moneys for education, 
which is not under its jurisdiction. That money, left to the provinces, 
could have been used or not to fund universities, depending on what the 
electorate and the government in each province wanted”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the words of Pierre Elliott Trudeau. Did his opinion 
change since then?  Maybe a little. But before entering partisan 
politics and being subjected to all kinds of lobbying here in Ottawa, 
that is what he deeply felt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude on flexibility. In Quebec, we know perfectly well what 
it means. Flexibility means leaning always on the same side, that is 
toward Ottawa. We want nothing to do with that kind of flexibility.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member talks 
about a constitutional cancer in relation to the spending power. When he 
was a minister in Ottawa, his mentor, Lucien Bouchard, spent $1 billion 
on literacy. If the federal government had not used its spending power, 
there never would have been a national health system. We could not have 
invested in universities or in the student loans and scholarships 
program since 1961. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member believe it is more important to invest directly in 
reducing student indebtedness instead of engaging in petty politics and 
working for Pauline Marois, who cannot do her job? Two thousand students 
and 2000 professors agree that she cannot do her job.

great political wisdom, that, if it were not for the federal government, 
there would not be any health system or universities in Quebec. I think 
no one will be fooled by that statement, which makes as much sense as 
its author. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, many people in Canada and Quebec tried to use the 
Meech Lake accord to cure the constitutional cancer I referred to with 
regard to the spending power, but all the efforts to limit the federal 
government's spending power were killed by the members across the way. 
<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (Secretary of State (Federal Office of Regional 
Development—Quebec), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like 
to mention to the House that the agency of which I am responsible is no 
longer known as the Federal Office of Regional Development—Quebec, 
but as the Canada Economic Development for Quebec Regions Agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to rise today to speak to the motion brought forward 
by our colleagues from the Bloc, a motion which, once again, if one 
analyses it—and it need not be a thorough analysis—is designed 
essentially to deceive the people of Quebec and to launch a 
constitutional debate on a fundamental issue. Moreover, the Bloc wants 
to do that at the expense of future generations, of students who, 
tomorrow, will form the Canadian society that we are building today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion talks about the Canadian millennium scholarship fund as 
well as national testing in education. Let us begin with the Canadian 
millennium scholarship fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that not only is the government making a noble effort, but 
its vision is also extremely noble. 
On the eve of the next millennium, we had the opportunity to invest in 
infrastructure projects, which are strictly brick and mortar projects. 
It is not that these projects are not important, but we also had the 
opportunity to invest in future generations to ensure that Canada can 
enter the 21st century with pride, knowing that our young people are 
well equipped to face the new challenges that lie ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These challenges are legion. First of all, we have to prepare our 
young people and give them the tools they need to compete in the 
knowledge based economy. Secondly, there is the issue of globalization. 
Obviously, this is no longer a utopian concept, no longer hypothetical. 
Globalization has come to our society, to all of our communities. 
Whether we live in the regions or in large urban centres, we must all 
position ourselves to face the new realities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about the millennium scholarship fund, we talk 
basically about a vision, about giving our young people the tools they 
need to deal with the new realities of the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, the strategy outlined in the budget of my colleague, the 
Minister of Finance, is aimed at giving all Canadians equal 
opportunities and access to continuing education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are taking measures to support the provinces. 
As we know, education is a provincial jurisdiction and the budget 
measures are intended to support the provinces in areas related to 
education but which also come under the responsibility of the federal 
government. We want all Canadians to benefit from the educational 
resources made available to them by all the provinces, including Quebec.

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members across the way say that the millennium scholarship fund is 
an intrusion in an area of provincial jurisdiction. Let us take a closer 
look at this fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the fund, which amounts to $2.5 billion over 10 
years, is to enhance learning opportunities. Each year, some 100,000 
Canadians will benefit from this fund and enjoy better access to 
post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An equally important aspect is the fact that the government has set 
up the fund so as to promote co-operation with the provinces and avoid 
any form of duplication. What does that mean? 
It means that basically we have created an independent foundation based 
on partnership. The members of this foundation will come from all walks 
of life. The mandate given to them by the government is to hold 
consultations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They will, of course, consult the private sector, the academic 
community and above all the student population, which is the most 
directly concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members who say that the foundation will be encroaching on 
provincial jurisdictions do not know what they are talking about, for, 
at this time, the plans call for a foundation whose board of 
directors will hold consultations and establish procedures based on 
rules which have yet to be defined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important fact is that the mandate of the foundation gives 
it enough flexibility to conclude agreements with the provinces. 
This means that ultimately the foundation could use all the channels put 
in place by the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take Quebec, for example. If memory serves, the province 
opted out in 1964 and implemented its own scholarships program. Since 
then, it has added a process for analyzing students' needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way the foundation is set up, it could use the channels put in 
place by Quebec to avoid any duplication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is very simple. If, as a Bloc member just mentioned, 
they do not mind seeing Canadian flags in Quebec, I wonder why they are 
making such a fuss about the fund, given that its operation will fully 
respect Quebec's jurisdiction, particularly if it uses the existing 
channels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Why not to the students? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Martin Cauchon:</B> The answer is very simple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, someone spoke about a contagious disease spreading on this 
side of the House. I must say that, across the aisle, in particular 
amongst Bloc members, an illness is also spreading— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> But it is not contagious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Martin Cauchon:</B> No, thank God, it is not contagious. 
It is not a contagious disease in the sense that the type of nationalism 
they have developed is not shared by everyone in the province of Quebec. 
Theirs is basically a doctrinaire nationalism intent on getting Quebec 
to break away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This nationalism is ultimately designed to divide, divide the 
country and divide the Quebec people among themselves, which is an 
aberration. On the other hand, the type of nationalism that we on our 
side advocate is one which includes all Quebeckers and is designed to 
ensure that it can have an impact both domestically, within the Canadian 
federation, and internationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude, as I can see that time is quickly running out. The 
issue of national testing was raised. There again, I think they cannot 
distinguish between facts and their dreams, aspirations and even 
fantasies. All they are trying to do is to make sure the system does not 
work. 
The Canadian government is blamed left and right for all that is going 
wrong in the world.

<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In education, regarding national testing, we do not want to 
establish national tests. That is a totally false statement. We want to 
accentuate co-operation between the provinces in developing tools of 
comparison, which will contribute not to standardizing but to adjusting 
their education systems, ultimately to provide better education for 
their students, who are the next generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I think that, with respect to the Canada millennium 
scholarship fund in particular, the Canadian government has done an 
outstanding job. 
The work accomplished by my colleague, the Minister of Human Resources 
Development, who is meeting today with his provincial counterparts, is 
also praiseworthy as it is designed to strengthen the Canadian social 
union, and this is a fine effort. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, the secretary of state surprises me. 
We must not forget that this is the secretary of state responsible 
for regional development in Quebec.  He wants to know right off who 
initiated the debate and how such a motion came to be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We moved it, because the federal government initiated it by 
bringing in the millennium fund, which intervenes directly in the 
education sector.  The federal government does not recognize its 
own Constitution.  This is the first thing we can say about such 
remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second thing concerns the minister himself.  I find it 
shameful that the minister responsible for regional development in 
Quebec is promoting the millennium scholarships instead of 
returning the money through transfer payments. 
Our regional education networks—the University of Quebec 
campuses in Rimouski, Lac-Saint-Jean and Abitibi and cegeps 
throughout Quebec—are being strangled by the federal cuts.  For 
every dollar cut by the Government of Quebec in health care and 
education, 75 cents comes from the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can this minister, responsible for regional development 
in Quebec, rise and tell us that it is better for his government to 
put money into the millennium scholarships and let Quebec's 
educational institutions shrivel and do so in the knowledge that it 
will threaten the situation in Quebec and deny the province vital 
strategic advantages?  I have great difficulty understanding the 
minister's position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For my last point, I will use his own words.  He talks about 
Bloc Quebecois members, who may or may not be contagious. 
I say that we were quite infectious, because our position was 
caught by Alain Dubuc, the editorialist of <I>La Presse</I>, the 
spokesperson for all of the university rectors throughout Quebec, 
and the Liberal Party of Quebec.  You are familiar with this party. 
It is the federalist party that hopes to again form the government 
in Quebec and is asking you the same questions we are.  The Quebec 
Liberals are telling you this, as are all the economic stakeholders 
in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude my remarks here.  I wonder whether the 
secretary of state responsible for regional development is not 
contradicting himself in opposing the consensus of Quebeckers, 
which, in this House, is expressed by the members of the Bloc 
Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Martin Cauchon:</B> Madam Speaker, what is interesting about the 
members of the Bloc Quebecois is that, when they are told the truth in 
a very rational way, they themselves become irrational. You just saw my 
colleague opposite; he really seemed to be at a loss for words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, that is typical of the reaction members of the Bloc have 
each time my colleague, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, 
speaks very calmly and very rationally about fundamental issues. Unable 
to respond to these sound arguments, the members opposite become 
completely irrational. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the member made an interesting point. I want all 
Canadians to understand, particularly in Quebec, that the 
Canadian government is indeed involved in the areas of 
post-secondary education, health, assistance to student and 
welfare through the Canada health and social transfer, which was 
reformed when we came to power in 1993. This transfer allows us 
to maintain a good standard of living everywhere in Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, it is interesting to see that, the more we tell the 
truth, the more the members opposite raise their voices. It is also 
important to note that, when we were re-elected last year, one of the 
first things we did was to increase the CHST, to increase transfers to 
the provinces following a request that was made to that effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been hearing nasty things from the opposition. 
If the members of the Bloc are serious and they are really making this 
a jurisdictional battle, based on what I said earlier, the foundation 
could be expected to use the channels already put in place by the 
province of Quebec for student loans—which means that it would 
respect Quebec's jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why then are they so upset? Only because they do not want to have 
a federal presence in Quebec.  When people see the benefits of 
the federal presence in Quebec, it threatens the Bloc's wonderful dream 
of separation, which is not shared by all Quebeckers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am glad we have an opportunity to talk about education 
for young people in Canada in terms of what the government has 
and has not done and what the federal government should and 
should not do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has had a longstanding and strong commitment to 
education for Canadians, to retraining for older Canadians and to 
post-secondary education for younger Canadians.  The 1993 
election was the first federal election we participated in on a 
national basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, I am sorry but it is very difficult for me to 
speak with the noise in the House. Could I ask for the 
co-operation of hon. members. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> Yes, the member is quite

show a little respect. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I would like you to check for quorum because I do not see 
any Liberals in the House and I am not sure there is a quorum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  We will check for 
quorum.  Call in the members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>And the bells having rung:</I> 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Resuming debate, the 
hon. member for Calgary—Nose Hill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Madam Speaker, Reform has 
consistently affirmed the critical importance of education to 
Canadians and to Canadian society.  During the 1993 election 
campaign, even though we knew there was a huge deficit, that we 
were running in the red, we campaigned on no cuts at all to 
education and health.  Even though the Conservative government 
had put us far into the red, we knew those were programs that had 
to maintain support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the last election we campaigned on restoring some of the 
terrible cuts to education and health care made by the Liberals. 
Our commitment to education has been strong and consistent and 
will continue to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read from the Reform policy on education.  The Reform 
policy believes that the federal government should: one, transfer 
the funding of post-secondary education to the provinces; two, 
promote and stimulate research and educational excellence in the 
national interest through public and private research grants; and 
three, institute a federally funded income contingent loan plan 
that is as near to being interest free to students as is 
possible.

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our policy also states that the Reform Party supports national 
standards in all levels of education and apprenticeships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through co-operative interprovincial agreements, the federal 
government should foster:  one, the development of national 
standards in education and vocational training; two, stronger 
partnerships among higher education institutions, professional 
associations and public authorities, business and other 
organizations that have a stake in the quality of higher 
education and research; and three, internationalization in 
post-secondary education, because of course we operate in a 
global society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to put on the record and say to Canadians watching 
this debate today that education is a very, very critical issue 
for our country.  Reform has very strong and vigorous policies to 
make sure that we do not slip behind in this important area of 
Canadian life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also have a few words to say about the Reform position on 
respecting provincial jurisdiction.  Section 93 of the 
Constitution states that in and for each province, the 
legislature may exclusively make laws in relation to education. 
We believe that the Constitution means something and that the 
framework for how our country should operate should be respected. 
The Reform Party respects the constitutional jurisdiction of the 
provinces in relation to education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform has put forward an alternative vision to unify our 
country.  It is an alternative to the status quo federalism that 
has brought the present instability into place.  It is an 
alternative to the separatists just giving up on the country.  It 
is an alternative that says let us give the powers to the 
provinces that would allow each province to best take advantage 
of and manage the unique opportunities and needs of that 
individual province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason we have put forward this alternative vision is that 
our country needs the kind of flexibility we have been talking 
about.  We need to respect provincial jurisdiction in the area of 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal record in the whole area of education is not a happy 
one. In fact it is a tragic record.  It is a record of slashing 
and burning and destroying the strength and stability of this 
country's educational institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last four years the Liberals have cut $7 billion from 
essential transfers to support post-secondary education.  We know 
the tragic results of the Liberal gutting of this important area 
of Canadian society:  difficult and limited access to 
post-secondary education; high student debt; and real fear and 
concern among young Canadians about getting a proper education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have also slashed support for essential research 
that is carried out by our educational institutions.  Medical 
research alone, much of which is carried out at our universities, 
has been cut 13% by the Liberals since 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because the Liberals are so insatiable for money, they are now 
forcing students with part time jobs or summer jobs to pay into 
the EI system even though they cannot collect a dime. They are 
taking money from students who desperately need it for their 
education to put into an already bloated surplus in the EI fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have continued with high taxation and debt policies 
which have led to a 16.5% unemployment rate for youth.  Our 
students are not only struggling to get an education, but even if 
they do manage to get one, they are also very fearful about 
building any kind of future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are heavily taxing training programs that are 
provided to older Canadians by companies and businesses.  They 
call them a taxable benefit rather than encouraging this kind of 
training and retraining. 
This tragic record of this government is certainly deserving of 
censure and in that I think all members of the House should 
concur.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an interesting development which began in 1967 called 
the Council of Ministers of Education. It is a good example of 
provincial partnerships where all ministers of education in the 
country, from all the provinces and territories, meet regularly 
on a co-operative basis. They began to give national tests in 
1989.  I notice that the Bloc motion talks about national tests. 
I would like to say a few words about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994 the federal government helped the Council of Ministers 
of Education with their national testing program to the tune of 
$1.5 million.  I guess the Bloc does not like that kind of help 
by the federal government since they are condemning this kind of 
action, but the Quebec Minister of Education is very much in 
favour of this kind of testing.  She is a member of the Council 
of Ministers of Education and was present in 1993 to approve 
something called the Victoria declaration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to quote from the declaration, which was approved by 
Quebec's provincial government along with all the other 
provincial and territorial governments.  “We are placing a 
priority on the following activities”, one of which is “a new 
joint Council of Ministers of Education and Statistics Canada”, 
a federal institution project to develop pan-Canadian indicators 
of education performance, including such measurements as 
completion rates for all levels of education, successful 
transition to work and student, educator and public 
satisfaction”.  The CMEC also operates a Canadian information 
centre for international credentials in collaboration with the 
federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is that the Bloc would have us say that the federal 
government has absolutely no legitimate role in the area of 
education.  I do not believe this is the case.  The federal 
government should ensure secure funding for education, should 
make sure we have strong research grants, should use its 
resources in assisting the setting of national standards, should 
facilitate and work together for partnerships with business and 
industry, professional associations and international bodies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the Bloc motion is misguided.  Certainly the 
federal government has badly fumbled the ball in the whole area 
of education but it does have a role to play.  That should be 
strengthened and made better, not done away with altogether. 
<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it was very sad when the 
Reform member said that the record of the government is a tragedy 
in terms of post-secondary education when she spoke of the 
research cut and so on. If we had followed what the Reform Party 
suggested back to when we started in 1993, that would be a 
tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is known that we had to share in the reduction of the 
deficit, and for that Canadians did sacrifice.  Now that we have 
achieved a balanced budget, why can Reform not acknowledge that 
the millennium fund is truly a breakthrough budget as the 
president of Canadian universities and colleges has said?  Why 
can Reform not acknowledge that such funding has been increased 
with the present budget?  Why do they continue to dwell on the 
past when the present is already in progress?  The member is 
smiling.  I hope that is a smile of approval. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Madam Speaker, it is a smile of 
disbelief.  It is very sad to have to point out the government's 
record in the area of education.  Its recent past slashing and 
burning of funding for education and research is a fact.  The 
Liberals have now given back a few pennies and want to forget 
about the slashing and burning of the past.  That is not going to 
happen because students and Canadians who are in training deserve 
better than that. 
This millennium scholarship fund is something that does deserve 
to be talked about.  I wish I had time.

standards in education. What kinds of standards could the private sector 
set in philosophy, history, literature and certain areas of social 
studies? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am under the impression that we no longer live in a country where 
decisions are made by the elected members, and that we will soon find 
ourselves with a board of directors instead of a parliament. 
In the end, we will not be citizens any more, but mere consumers. Those 
of us who are not fit for business will not be fit for anyone. At some 
point, I think we will have to come back to more human values so that we 
have not only consumers but also citizens in this country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Madam Speaker, it is interesting 
what other people sometimes hear when you talk.  I am happy that 
the member has given me a chance to correct a misconception that 
he obviously has about my speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said that the federal government should assist with 
co-operative initiatives between business, educational 
institutions, industry, professional associations and 
international bodies in setting standards for our workers.  That 
does not mean that the private sector alone should be setting 
standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does mean that we need to have their input because in the 
private sector there are organizations that utilize the skills 
and abilities that we gain from our educational experiences.  We 
need to know from the private sector who does the hiring and 
firing:  what do you need, what skill sets are appropriate, what 
are you willing to pay for, what will give our workers good jobs 
with good incomes and therefore some future security.  The 
private sector input is critical but that does not mean it should 
be given exclusive jurisdiction in setting standards.  If the 
member got that impression, of course that is incorrect.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to rise today as the education critic 
for the NDP to present our party's views on this motion presented 
by the Bloc Quebecois in their opposition day motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the NDP sympathizes with the frustrations that are 
expressed in this motion that we are debating today in the House. 
I think there is a great sense of frustration not just from the 
Bloc but also from other political parties, and more important 
from the people of Canada and from students who have been 
affected by a very great crisis in post-secondary education in 
terms of how the announcements were made about this millennium 
fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to recognize that the millennium fund that has been the 
showpiece of the Liberal budget was announced with absolutely no 
consultation.  There was no consultation with the provinces. 
There was not consultation with professionals nor with students 
in the post-secondary educational field.  This announcement came 
out of the blue after the throne speech, allegedly from the Prime 
Minister as his legacy to his term in political office.  We have 
to ask the question, is that any way for the government to do its 
business? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard a member from the government ask earlier why is the 
opposition shouting so loud about this motion and about the 
millennium fund? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1125"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Opposition members, certainly those in the NDP, are shouting 
loud because we understand that the millennium fund has more to 
do with political grandstanding, has more to do with political 
image making, than it does with solving the very deep crisis that 
we have surrounding post-secondary education in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The millennium fund was announced to stave off the severe and 
growing criticism that has come from students, academics and our 
post-secondary educational facilities because of the crisis that 
we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk a bit about the funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard that this fund will be $2.5 billion.  That sounds 
to me like an enormous amount of money.  I cannot even visualize 
what $2.5 billion looks like.  However, I do understand this.  By 
the time this fund begins in the year 2000, we will have lost 
$3.1 billion from post-secondary education.  The $2.5 billion 
will only begin, over a 10 year period, at $250 million a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We really have to put this into context and understand that 
because of what the Liberal governments have bled from the 
system, their slash and burn approach to post-secondary 
education, we have lost billions of dollars.  This announcement 
of $2.5 billion does not come anywhere close to replacing what 
has been taken from the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The figures are well known.  The millennium fund will help 
approximately 7% of Canadian students.  We are talking about 
100,000 students a year.  What is more serious is that the choice 
the government made to hand out cheques to students will not 
address the systemic problem which we have in post-secondary 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The millennium fund and the other measures which were announced 
will not decrease tuition fees or set the stage to ensure that 
tuition fees will remain stable.  What the government chose to do 
was to help in a very small way students who are facing an 
increasing debt load without increasing funding by way of 
transfers to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other question which needs to be addressed is that we still 
do not know whether the millennium fund will be a needs-based 
program or whether it will be a scholarship program.  Every 
indication is that it will be a program based on scholarship. 
Again this is a mistargeted, misdirected program which does not 
address the key issue of students who are in financial need 
because of skyrocketing tuition fees which are a direct result of 
lack of government funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern which we have in our party, and certainly one 
which I have heard from students in my riding of Vancouver East, 
is over the complexity of the system.  A whole new level of 
grants or scholarships is being put into place.  It is a 
privately run foundation.  I pity the poor student who has to 
figure out what it is they are able to access, even if it is a 
few hundred dollars, under the new system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concern which I believe is the most serious is that the 
government has set up a private foundation to administer the 
millennium fund.  It has already been stated that the president 
or the chair of the new foundation will be the CEO of Chrysler 
Canada.  I believe there is a real danger that this government is 
taking us down the slippery slope of privatization and 
corporatization of post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should have restored public funding and public 
confidence to these facilities, to the universities, colleges and 
technical institutions which are crying out due to the lack of 
provincial funding caused by the lack of federal funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we now have is a privatized foundation which will be 
setting the direction, the criteria and the rules which we will 
not be privy to.  We have no idea what they will be.  They will 
be left to the private foundation to decide and there will be a 
creeping and growing corporate influence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of our party have listened very carefully to what 
students and academics in the educational community have said in 
Canada.  We have been listening.  I want to ask the government 
why it has not been listening.  The message from students and 
others in the field has been loud and clear.  In fact, the 
leadership which has been shown by organizations such as the 
Canadian Federation of Students and provincial education 
ministers has been loud and clear.  The Liberal government has 
turned a deaf ear to the pleas which have come from that 
community.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we needed to see and what we wanted to see was national 
standards in terms of the budget and a new era for post-secondary 
education.  We believe that passionately in the NDP.  We need a 
federal government that is willing to work co-operatively with 
the provincial and territorial jurisdictions, including the 
people of Quebec and the Government of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must have a new national standard for accessibility in 
post-secondary education.  That is something the government has 
not been willing to canvass.  It has not been willing to sit down 
at the table to work out a co-operative and collaborative 
approach with provincial jurisdictions or to say that federal 
money will be tied to accessibility for students to ensure they 
have access whether they are low income or are affluent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now the tragedy is that basically education is no longer a 
right.  It has become a privilege only for those who have the 
affluence and the means to afford it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would also want to see put forward a tuition freeze.  In my 
province of British Columbia the provincial government has shown 
leadership for the third year in a row with a tuition freeze.  We 
have called on the federal government to work with the provinces 
to show that same kind of leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The measures announced in the millennium fund will in no way 
provide stabilization for tuition fees.  We will continue to see 
them skyrocket. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have called, students have called and others in the field 
have called for a national grants program.  This is something 
that we expect to see from the federal government in terms of 
vision and leadership.  It would not be a private foundation but 
a national grants program in co-operation with the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The students of Canada and others have been demanding an 
adequate level of funding.  It is scandalous that, despite all 
the claims by the Liberal government, program spending in the 
federal budget has actually decreased from $106.5 billion to $104 
billion.  By the year 2000 we will have lost over $3 billion from 
post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The students of Canada need help today.  They need provincial 
governments including the province of Quebec working with other 
provincial governments and the federal government and showing 
leadership to provide assistance to young people and to ensure 
accessibility for students.  Regrettably the evidence is clear 
that the latest measures by the Liberal government are not taking 
us in that direction.  They are taking us in the direction of 
privatization and corporatization of our publicly funded 
post-secondary education system. 
<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I have been listening to the debate carefully.  I heard the 
member talk about the $7 billion being taken out of 
post-secondary education, which is absolute nonsense.  She is 
talking about the CHST which includes post-secondary health care 
as well as social services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are also only talking about the cash component.  If they 
included the tax points seconded to the provinces, the tax points 
increase in value over that same period is probably in the 
neighbourhood of $3.5 billion on a net basis.  They are simply 
wrong in the numbers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a precise example in the province of Ontario alone the 
reduction of the transfers to the province of Ontario was only 
$850 million, whereas the province of Ontario reduced income 
taxes at a cost to the coffers of $4.3 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provincial priorities seem to be something other than health 
care or education.  They seem to be totally out of line with the 
priorities of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also raised an issue when she talked about freezing 
tuition.  Tuition is a provincial jurisdiction.  I do not know 
whether the federal government can be blamed for all the 
decisions of the provincial government.   She clearly stated that 
we do not know what the millennium scholarship is all about.  She 
said directly that it was for scholarships. 
That is not true.  I looked in <I>The Budget Plan 1998</I> 
document where it says that scholarships will be awarded to 
individuals who need help in financing their studies and 
demonstrate merit.  Clearly some merit has to be established so 
that students will be successful in undertaking post-secondary 
education, but the principal element also includes the basis of 
need.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue for the member seems to be tuition based, whereas the 
whole discussion with regard to the Canadian millennium 
scholarship fund concerns accessibility.  I know her colleague 
who sits nearby has confirmed the issue is not tuition and 
student loans.  It is accessibility for those Canadians who do 
not even have the opportunity to go to school. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member at least concede that we cannot, in a year that 
we finally balance the budget, turn on the taps and do absolutely 
everything we would like to do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather, we should at least start the process of investment where 
Canadians can be assured the education of our youth is one of the 
most important investments we can make for the future of Canada. 
Accessibility is an important priority.  The millennium 
scholarship fund is dealing directly with the accessibility 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question.  I am astounded that the member and the 
government try to defend the numbers, the billions of cut 
dollars, whether we talk about education, social programs or a 
health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has no credibility to debate this point.  It can 
throw mud at provincial governments and say that they are at 
fault.  The record shows that because of the dehabilitating 
demise of funding for these programs, particularly education, we 
are now in the crisis we are in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member says that somehow the millennium fund should be based 
on merit, that this is a legitimate issue.  I remind the hon. 
member that what he read from his own material was merit.  If 
students are in post-secondary education they have already gone 
through that test.  They have already gone through the entrance 
requirement and demonstrated that they have the merit to be 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue the government has to tackle is the issue of financial 
need.  To set up another scholarship program, another merit 
program, is a totally misdirected political grandstanding 
exercise. 
<P><A NAME="LINK46"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
the resolution reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House censure any action by the federal government in 
the area of education, such as the introduction of the millennium 
fund scholarship program or national testing. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our caucus will be voting against it.  In the beginning I must 
say that I agree almost completely with the member for Vancouver 
East who just spoke.  She sort of put the problem with students 
in perspective.  We will be voting against the motion for three 
or four reasons.  However, in reality there is only one reason 
and that is students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a crisis in student education, student debt loads, 
student access to employment and educated students who are 
leaving the country.  Any parent or any student realizes that 
students in this modern age require the best education that is 
humanly possible to achieve and receive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is simply not happening in Canada any more.  Somewhere down 
the road there will be significant problems with our economy, 
with our society and with our social structure because we have 
not allowed as many people to become educated to their limit as 
should have happened in this industrial age, this information age 
and beyond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are supposedly 50,000 high tech jobs that we cannot fill. 
The Government of Canada actually changes the immigration laws to 
allow people to come into our country to fill those jobs.  At the 
same time 1.5 million Canadians are unemployed.  Of those 1.5 
million Canadians, over 400,000 are young people below the age of 
25.  That is a very significant problem and a real shame. 
On the one hand we have people who are unemployed and on the 
other hand we have jobs that go unfilled by Canadian people. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1140"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have the problem of education.  That is where the 
correlation comes in.  Why do we have jobs unfilled and people 
unemployed?  It is because we do not have the high level of 
education these people absolutely require.  There is a direct 
correclation between employment and education.  This is why we 
have, especially with our youth, an unemployment rate of 18% and 
over every single day, every single month in every single year in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the government took office we have had an unemployment 
rate for youth in excess of 18% on average.  If we break down the 
averages and take a look at what the unemployment rate is for the 
uneducated, we will probably see that for those with less than 
high school the unemployment rate is in excess of 40% every day, 
every month in every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Education is obviously the means to an end to make the country 
strong, to allow us to export and to allow us to conduct research 
and development.  We cannot do that with an uneducated populace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is so huge that it requires all participants to be 
involved and to co-operate.  When I say all participants, I mean 
first and foremost the students themselves who must realize the 
value of an education and what they can contribute to themselves, 
their families and the country if they are educated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parents of all students must be involved and must realize that 
the best thing they can do for their children is to encourage 
them in all ways possible to get the best education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also a case where our universities, vocational, trade and 
technical schools and private schools have to make education as 
accessible as possible, which means keeping tuition fees under 
control and providing good research opportunities.  It also means 
provincial governments have to be involved in a very aggressive 
and meaningful way to make sure that our students are educated to 
the very best of their individual abilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are voting against the resolution.  The Government of Canada 
has to be involved in showing leadership by supplying funding to 
make sure that Canada and Canadian citizens, especially those in 
the weaker financial provinces like Newfoundland, have equal 
opportunity with every other province of Canada.   It should be a 
joint partnership of students, parents, institutions, provinces 
and the federal government to try to solve this terrible sickness 
that has overtaken our education system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real reason we are voting against the motion is that we do 
not think any government or any political party should deny 
access to funding for students simply because of jurisdictional 
disputes.  The problem is too grave.  I sincerely doubt if any 
parent in Newfoundland, British Columbia or Quebec would turn 
down lower tuition rates or a scholarship for one of their 
children if it makes education more accessible and more 
financially available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The student situation, as I say, is by far the most pertinent. 
However funding of post-secondary education has always been a 
joint venture between the Government of Canada and the provinces. 
This is not something new. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nobody in the House would deny that education is and always has 
been a provincial responsibility.  The direction of education 
within the provinces, the setting of policies and the choosing of 
curricula are all provincial responsibilities with which we fully 
agree.  We have no intention of encouraging the Government of 
Canada to interfere in any way with the rights of the provinces 
to deliver the education system that the people and the 
government of a province put in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am from the province of Newfoundland and represent St. John's 
West.  I do not see it as a federalist plot to destroy the 
economy of Newfoundland and Labrador if a cheque comes to a 
student attending one of our schools that is flying a Canadian 
flag.  We see it as a case where the federal government has a 
responsibility and if it has the financial wherewithal we will 
happily take its contributions if it allows more of our students 
to be educated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a couple of other reasons.  We have problems with the 
millennium fund, but I acknowledge the finance minister's budget 
at least began to address the problem. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1145"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not think the millennium fund was the way to do it but I 
will give credit to the finance minister for identifying in the 
budget that there is a huge problem in post-secondary education 
in the country, and at least by recognizing it hopefully he will 
address it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will also give great credit to the student groups of this 
country who have put significant pressure on all levels of 
government and all politicians to try to somehow address this 
very serious problem of the cost of education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree there are serious problems with the millennium fund. 
The $2.5 billion will not be refused by any of the students in 
Canada but the real problem of advanced education is the fact 
that there is tremendous debtload today.  We have 1.5 million 
students in this country and many of them have never worked a day 
in their lives except for part time work.  This means 1.5 million 
young Canadians owe $7 billion.  They will spend most of the next 
20 years or 25 years trying to repay it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think that is the sickness of the Canadian post-secondary 
education system.  It is the reason why we think the federal 
government should be involved. Somehow we have to make education 
both accessible and affordable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government must take responsibility because it has 
caused this crisis in education by unilaterally cutting back to 
the provinces on transfers to education and social programs. The 
cutbacks amount to 37% or well over $6 billion to education and 
health care in the last five years.  It is a shame because it has 
simply transferred the tax burden from the federal government 
which has balanced its books to the provinces which cannot 
balance theirs.  The provinces pass it on to universities, and 
universities and schools pass it on to students, and students in 
many cases pass it on to their parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a very serious problem with our post-secondary 
situation and the only way to deal with it is to put more money 
into the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also against any unilateral action by the federal 
government.  I want to make that absolutely clear to my 
colleagues from the province of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unilateral action by the federal government is what got us into 
so much trouble with both health and education.  We are not 
saying, even in the area of national testing, that there should 
be unilateral action. Our party has recommended it because we see 
it as a tremendous need for the country to know where our 
students stack up, whether they are from Newfoundland, Quebec or 
B.C., and where Canadian students stack up against those from 
Sweden, the U.S. and other countries with which we compete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are against unilateral action but we are very strongly in 
favour of co-operation among all the agencies, including the 
federal government which has leadership and the financial 
wherewithal to try to resolve the problem of the post-secondary 
education system in Canada.  For those reasons we will be voting 
against the motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, my colleague began by suggesting he agreed with some of 
the comments of my colleague from Vancouver and I would like to 
compliment him on his speech.  It is always refreshing to see how 
those of us from the east can clarify the issues in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He did mention the millennium scholarship fund and I would ask 
him if he would agree with me that by cutting the transfer 
payments to the provinces for education and then putting a little 
money in the hands of students what the federal government has 
really done is make the universities, because they are not 
getting any increase in funding, compete against each other for 
the bit of money that will go into the hands of the students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently universities like Memorial in Newfoundland may end 
up competing against universities like the University College of 
Cape Breton in my own riding for the same student base, watering 
down what they can offer students and losing some of the 
excellent programs they already have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Power:</B>  Madam Speaker, I fully agree. There is 
now getting to be tremendous competition among universities and 
even among private schools for the limited amount of funding 
available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Minister of Finance did was realize there is a 
tremendous sickness or malaise in the post-secondary system.  It 
is like going to the hospital when you have a brain tumour and a 
wart on your nose.  The Minister of Finance does a little 
cosmetic surgery, takes the wart off your nose and sends you home 
while saying you are healthy.  In effect you are not healthy, you 
still have the brain tumour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem of Canadian student debt and accessibility still 
remains.  It has not been dealt with and until it is dealt with 
we are going to have some significant problems.

is a politically motivated fund which does not kick in for three 
years and already has a politically appointed selection board. 
Does the member think it is possible that in this whole process 
of it growing politically the recipients will somehow be affected 
politically? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member not see that as a direct possibility? I am sure 
the member for Vancouver East would agree that is a direct 
possibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Power:</B>  Madam Speaker, I agree it is very 
politically motivated.  The student groups we spoke with prior to 
the budget debate could not understand why there was all this 
talk about the millennium scholarship.  To direct two and a half 
billion dollars toward scholarships somewhere down the road will 
at most help 100,000 students or 7% of the total.  That is great 
but there will still be a million and a half students in this 
country with very serious debt problems.  We thought the money 
could be directed in a different way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our members and the members of the Bloc have a right to be 
suspicious of some of the things the Liberal Party does. There is 
no question that it can manipulate and finagle any program 
available.  When the Liberal Party of Canada is going to appoint 
this board I suspect that along the way it will be like the 
recent Senate appointments.  Along the way it might be a little 
easier to get a scholarship if you are the son or daughter of a 
prominent Liberal than if you are not.  Do not be at all 
surprised if it happens because that is the way this thing goes 
on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I still think the millennium scholarship is not what it could 
have been.  With two and a half billion in taxpayer dollars, all 
of our dollars, an awful lot more good could have been done. The 
government could have wiped out close to 50% of all student debt 
for the one and a half million students in school today with that 
two and a half billion dollars.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
first like to mention that I will be sharing my time with the 
member for Rosemont. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion by the Bloc member reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House censure any action by the federal government 
in the area of education, such as the introduction of the 
Millennium Scholarships program or national testing. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In moving this motion today, Bloc Quebecois members want to 
find out whether the federal government still views education as an 
exclusively provincial jurisdiction. 
If it opposes the motion, the government will once again show its 
true colours, providing proof positive that, in creating the 
millennium scholarship fund, it is interfering in provincial 
jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is using the fund as an excuse to barge 
into education, an exclusively provincial jurisdiction, uninvited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is obviously not helping Quebec reduce student 
indebtedness or fund universities and post-secondary educational 
institutions.  It is just after additional visibility.  It is 
obvious to everyone that this program runs directly counter to 
Quebec's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We already know that the fund was dreamt up by the Prime 
Minister and that even his most influential ministers could not 
persuade him to change his mind.  I think that the term ego trip 
says it all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One has to wonder whether the Prime Minister is prepared to 
put everything on the line just so he will have a place in Canadian 
history books.  I can tell the House that his latest whim will be 
written up something like this: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shawinigan, 1934; destroyer of Canadian unity, henchman

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Enough pleasantries.  I must now set the record straight, for 
the year 2000 is right around the corner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the Prime Minister and his government to 
understand the reality of today's young people.  Not all that long 
ago, I was a student myself.  Thanks to the Quebec government's 
system of loans and bursaries, I was able to get my degree and thus 
improve my chances of a job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Needless to say, I still have debts, but I am nonetheless far 
better off than many others, because I am working.  My purpose in 
saying all this is to point out that debt is the main concern of 
students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So when the government refers to scholarships based on some 
criterion of excellence, it is obvious that it is way out in left 
field.  But that is excusable, because it has not been tuned in to 
the reality of the people of Quebec for a long time—if ever it 
was, that is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the Prime Minister's predecessors agreed that education 
ought to be administered by the provinces.  Even Pierre Elliott 
Trudeau, not a sovereignist, or at least never an avowed one so 
far, said the following back in 1957, in connection with government 
intrusion into education: “We are entitled to suspect the federal 
gifts of being in bad faith—which is insulting for the 
provinces—and contrary to the principles of representative 
democracy”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the federal government really wants to help young people, 
and in particular to ensure them of a future, thus reducing their 
debt load, why does it not try to create jobs for young people? 
One more promise we will never see kept. 
My generation has had its fill of empty promises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young people are not fools.  They do not want to turn down 
generosity, no matter where it comes from. But as the president of 
the Fédération des étudiants universitaires du Québec so aptly put 
it, “The greatest possible number of students must be reached, and 
the system best placed to meet that objective is the Quebec student 
aid system”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will repeat his words more slowly, so that the Prime 
Minister and his colleagues can grasp them fully:  “The greatest 
possible number of students must be reached, and the system best 
placed to meet that objective is the Quebec student aid system”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a federation, whether it qualifies itself as renewed 
federalism or not, where education is an exclusively provincial 
jurisdiction, the situation becomes complicated. 
This time, the big bad separatists cannot be blamed because even the 
other provinces do not agree with the eligibility criteria. The 
government might be well advised to listen. Worse yet, to be sure Quebec 
would not withdraw from the millennium scholarship program, the federal 
government went as far as creating an independent foundation. It smacks 
of bad faith and is oddly similar to Option Canada. I wonder if students 
will receive their check even before they apply for it. As far as I am 
concerned—and there are many others like me—this is clearly another 
federal propaganda trick played on the back of students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it not have been preferable to help institutions or simply 
transfer the money to the  provinces? Oh, no. What the federal 
government wants is uniformity from coast to coast, wrapped in the 
Canadian flag. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For my part, I see it as provocation. The Quebec people is getting 
used to provocative manoeuvres on the part of the federal government, 
but enough is enough. This operation seduction does not take into 
account the root cause of the problem, namely the massive cuts in 
transfer payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government claims it had to make choices according to 
priorities. Its own priorities. Does its millennium scholarships fund 
mean that encroachment in a field of provincial jurisdiction is one of 
its priorities? What happened to its commitment to create jobs and fight 
against poverty? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the budget reflects the government's priorities, does it mean 
that women are not a priority? I must remind the government that women 
were unanimous in asking for an increase in the Women's Program budget. 
But I forgot, this government's priorities are areas of provincial 
jurisdiction, however the Women's Program is a federal program. 
What a pity! 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to add that students did not ask for such a program. 
What they demanded was for transfer payments to the provinces to be 
restored at the level they were before the finance minister hacked them 
out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not listen to people's demands instead of catering to the Prime 
Minister's whim? I can hardly wait for the day.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am somewhat 
disappointed with the rhetoric because, fundamentally, the most 
important thing is to ensure that we can reduce student debt loads. We 
are in a knowledge and information era and the important thing is indeed 
to ensure that we can establish an opportunities strategy. Therefore, we 
are not dealing with skills, but with accessibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a few short questions for the member. First, does she think 
that the loans and grants system is exclusively provincial? I already 
have the answer, but I want to see if she knows it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, does she think it would be appropriate for Lucien Bouchard 
to go around trying to play politics with a bunch of cheques with the 
Quebec flag on them when 90 per cent of that money would come from the 
federal government? Does she not agree that her first priority is not 
the students, but in fact ensuring that Quebec's separation is promoted 
once again? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If she believes we should work toward reducing student debt loads 
and for greater accessibility, why does not she support the government 
in its millennium fund initiative? The very day it was announced, we saw 
what students thought of it, not people who have titles or who have 
infiltrated the system because of the separatists. What did students 
say? “We are not interested in the squabbles of Pauline Marois and 
others”. What are they interested in? In having access to that 
scholarship. They even asked unanimously that we stop this petty 
rhetoric because they agree with us on the scholarship issue. 
I would like to know what the member thinks about all this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire:</B> Madam Speaker, in terms of true demagogy, 
this beats everything. I guess the hon. member for Bourassa longs to 
become Minister of Education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> That's right, at the federal level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire: </B>I hope it will not be at the federal 
level. At least not as long as the Bloc Quebecois is here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to remind the hon. member for Bourassa of what the editorial 
writer for <I>La Presse</I>, Alain Dubuc, who must not be a sovereignist, had 
to say: “This does not justify the reflex, the paternalistic approach of 
those who say that Ottawa would do better in a field it does not know 
anything about”. I do not think Mr. Dubuc is a sovereignist. I can quote 
many other people who do not agree with this millennium scholarship 
foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, the federal government is totally disconnected and refuses 
to listen to what the people in the field have to say. It would be nice 
if the federal government were to listen to what the people tell them. 
Michel Auger said: “We will do what we have to do to ingratiate us in 
the eyes of the public in the short term and later we will dump it onto 
the provinces when it starts to get too costly or less popular”. What 
does the hon. member for Bourassa think about this? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
the member mentioned youth unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member will probably know that for those youth who have a 
university education the unemployment rate is only about 6.5%. 
University students pay approximately 30% of the cost of their 
education, while taxpayers pay the rest. As well, those who have 
the highest debt are usually those students who are in 
professional programs, such as dentistry or medicine.  When they 
graduate they will be earning high incomes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we go down the list we will see that high school graduates 
have an unemployment rate of somewhere in the range of 15%. Those 
who are high school dropouts, about 52% of all unemployed youth, 
actually have an unemployment rate which approaches 23%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member is really concerned about youth unemployment and 
how we can attack it, I wonder if she would like to comment on 
what she thinks the Quebec provincial government—since she wants 
to say it is provincial jurisdiction—should do about high school 
dropouts.  Quebec has the highest rate of high school dropouts. 
It is approximately 40%. These people are Canada's poor in 
waiting.  These are the kids who need help.  She thinks education 
is in the provincial jurisdiction.  Why does she not think we 
should do something about addressing the levels of education even 
prior to post-secondary education? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire:</B> Madam Speaker, I want to thank my 
colleague for his question. I can see that he is also concerned about 
the unemployment issue. I would like the government to show as much 
concern and to create jobs, instead of meddling in provincial areas of 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have nothing against helping young Canadians, quite the 
opposite, but we do not agree with the way they go about it. So, if the 
government really wants to act with good intentions, why do they not 
transfer the money to the provinces, who will see that it is properly 
managed?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am very pleased 
to address the opposition motion tabled by my colleague, the hon. member 
for Lac-Saint-Jean, that this House censure any action by the federal 
government in the area of education, such as the introduction of the 
Millennium Scholarships program or national testing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After all these years, it is deplorable to have to rise in the 
House to once again remind the government of the consensus among 
Quebec's stakeholders in the education sector, under the current and 
past provincial governments, which has served as the basis for what is 
now called Quebec's traditional demands in the education sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise today because this government, in its last budget, is 
getting involved in education, in an area that is under Quebec's 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise today because the Liberal Party is proposing to introduce 
national standards in education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also rise today because the federal government is proposing to 
young Quebeckers solutions that are increasingly centralizing and that 
are far from addressing their concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind you that there is a consensus among all political parties 
at the Quebec National Assembly, to the effect that the federal 
government must respect Quebec's jurisdiction over education. Even the 
former leader of the Quebec Liberal Party, Daniel Johnson—whose job 
may be taken over by the current Conservative Party leader—recently 
expressed his disappointment at the announcement of the millennium 
scholarship program. On February 24, he said “I would have preferred to 
see Quebec's jurisdiction and that of the other provinces 
respected”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to being an unspeakable intrusion in an area of 
exclusive provincial jurisdiction, the millennium fund is far from 
meeting the needs of young Quebeckers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to point out some flaws regarding this $2.5 billion fund. 
The interest on this fund will be used to grant some 100,000 
scholarships, of an average amount of $3,000, to low and middle income 
students who will have satisfied a criterion based on merit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first problem is the criteria relating to income and merit. The 
government should know that students from wealthy families do better, 
partly because they do not have to worry about finding money to continue 
their education. It should come as no surprise if scholarships are not 
awarded in accordance with the initial objective of helping low income 
students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the reason behind this statement of the Fédération des 
étudiants et étudiantes universitaires du Québec: “If the federal 
government intends to give scholarships on the basis of merit or 
excellence, we can only disapprove. Linking the subsistence of 
underprivileged students to their academic performance flows from an 
ideology we cannot endorse”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another fly in the ointment. The millennium fund is being 
created at a time when the privatization of universities is being 
discussed more and more. Underlying these privatization suggestions is 
a strong movement that is putting into question the democratization of 
higher education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be remiss if I did not deal today with a problem that is 
getting bigger and bigger in this country that is desperately looking 
for its own identity. We are witnessing a quest for a Canadian nation at 
all cost. 
The notion of two founding peoples has now been excised from federalist 
utterances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the same vein, these staunch proponents of federalism refuse to 
give any status to aboriginal peoples who have already been recognized 
as nations in Quebec since the mid-1980s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like my colleagues have done, I have taken you through what I call 
the millennium blunders, and I would like to deal now with national 
standards in education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1867, Quebeckers are in a political straitjacket and a system 
they never had an opportunity to vote on. We are living ever since in a 
political entity that is ruled by a constitution of another age that was 
made with different goals in mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we review briefly the main elements of what Quebeckers 
considered a pact at the time and which is becoming a straitjacket, we 
notice that the four initial provinces got exclusive power over health 
care and education. Obviously, this was not done out of any great 
concern for decentralization, quite the opposite.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces were given responsibility for jurisdictions already 
occupied by civil society or by the various religious communities, which 
looked after both education and health services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Things started to change in the early 1960s I guess. In a very 
short time, the quiet revolution and the numerous ensuing reforms 
radically changed the face of education. We went from a denominational 
system operated by protestant or catholic religious communities to a 
network of educational institutions established by the government for 
the stated purpose of improving democracy in education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this brief look back in history today to show that, in 
Quebec, education is an integral part of our history and our identity as 
well. This prerogative has always been a provincial jurisdiction, which 
means that elected members of the Quebec National Assembly have been 
able to fashion our education system to fulfil the aspirations of their 
fellow citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently, this consensus has fallen into oblivion. We are dealing 
with a government that does not understand the meaning of traditional 
demands. According to the morning papers, there is not such thing as 
traditional demands. Is there such a thing as education? We do not know 
yet. What we do know is that this government has once again altered the 
meaning of this expression to directly invade a provincial jurisdiction. 
In the federal government, education no longer means education, but 
opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What opportunity are we talking about here? The opportunity to sign 
cheques printed with the maple leaf logo for the purpose of scoring 
political points of course. That is what we were told by a Prime 
Minister, who was apparently oblivious to the fact he was not making 
this statement to his pals in his living room but on television in the 
House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government does not have a monopoly on this centralizing 
vision of Canada. It is shared by many members of this House. That is 
why the role played by the Bloc Quebecois is so important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people cannot live in a beautiful imaginary Canada united by 
wonderful national standards any more. These national standards, so 
heavily criticized in Quebec, were one of the election planks of the 
member for Sherbrooke, who travelled across his beautiful country to 
promote them. Why not? This is a very popular theme in the rest of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces have different levels of education.  Not all 
provincial governments invest equally in education, and the federal 
government, forgetting about Quebec, may legitimately propose 
national educational standards to solve that problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what the hon. member for Sherbrooke did in the 
election platform that bears his name. He sacrificed Quebec in 
order to win Canadians over.  He forgot about Quebec in order to 
serve his own interests.  Avoiding any hasty judgments on his 
highly likely running for the leadership of the Quebec Liberal 
Party, as rumour would have it, let us review the ideas contained 
in the platform which bears the name “the Jean Charest plan for 
Canada in the 21st century”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The following objectives are set out on page 31 of the 
document. If the party of the hon. member for Sherbrooke is 
elected, the federal government will pursue “the highest standard 
in our schools”, “top ten placement in Math and Sciences”, “better 
accessibility to university” and “better transition from schools to 
the work force”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we must ask the hon. member for Sherbrooke if the word 
“schools” in his vocabulary is connected with “education”.  And 
during the next campaign, we will also have to ask him whether he 
considers university to be part of the Quebec education system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for his action plan's reference to the transition between 
school and work, we need to find out whether this is part of 
manpower training or of education.  If the transition is part of 
manpower training, the hon. member for Sherbrooke is 30 years 
behind the times in his knowledge of the Quebec system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is an education issue, along with academic excellence 
and university, he is more than 125 years behind the times, and 
would be well advised to reread the constitution before he sets 
foot in any assembly of the Quebec Liberal Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having referred to the general objectives of the Leader of the 
Conservative Party, let us now go into greater detail.  I will now 
read a quote that particularly surprised me.  On page 33 of the 
Plan, he says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Jean Charest Government will help ensure that all 
Canadian youth receive the basic knowledge and skills they 
need for their futures by instituting a Canadian Education 
Excellence Fund.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, the last words are “a Canadian Education Excellence 
Fund”. We 
wondered where the Prime Minister got the idea of a millennium 
scholarship fund. Now we know. He read the platform of the member for 
Sherbrooke and leader of the Progressive Conservative Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will this fund be used for? Listen to this: it will provide 
“matching funds to provinces and territories that participate in 
establishing interprovincial standards for Common Curricula”. Yes, 
interprovincial standards and common curricula in education. This 
excerpt clearly shows that the provinces that will not take part in this 
beautiful Canada-wide program will simply not be eligible and will not 
get anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, the Liberal Party leader and Prime Minister, and the 
Conservative Party leader have the same objective: to compel and to 
force Quebec to fit in the Canadian mould. The member for Sherbrooke 
wants exactly the same thing as the leader opposite, but he refrains 
from saying so to Quebeckers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by saying— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry, but the hon. member's time is up. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, some people are 
worried about the next provincial election. They have so little to say 
about the millennium fund that they are targeting a possible candidate 
to the Quebec Liberal Party leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike opposition members who keep repeating the same old things, 
I want to talk about real things. I want to talk about young people, I 
want to make sure that this budget—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> The public understands. Of course Bloc members 
are not pleased. I did not hear them talk about tax breaks. They are not 
saying anything about what the Minister of Finance did to give students 
a tax break. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire:</B> What does political interference 
mean? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> It is the same thing.  The millennium fund 
is part of a strategy to offer equal job opportunities in the 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire:</B> You are off to a bad start as

</I></B></P><P align=left>Pauline Marois was probably not impressed with the 
demonstration yesterday in which 2,000 young people and professors 
banded together to say, finally, that the Government of Quebec and 
especially the Quebec department of education were not doing their 
job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing is sure, people understand the subject is not 
jurisdiction.  We are not getting involved at all in the field of 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> We are talking about accessibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not 
only that, work— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> That is not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> Can you hear them.  They are raising a 
ruckus opposite, because the truth is upsetting, the truth hurts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know what the member for Rosemont thinks of 
the fact some that students said, on the very day of the budget, 
“We want to look at the program and to have access to these 
grants”.  Why does the member for Rosemont, who was speaking on 
behalf of young people on the weekend and whose work in other areas 
I respect, not join with the government on the issue of the 
millenium scholarship fund, so that, together, those of our 
generation can give young people access? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon:</B> For heaven's sake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin:</B> You have no business there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> The first problem is young people's debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have assumed our responsibility to ensure young people's 
access. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon:</B> After cutting transfers to the provinces by 
$10 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> Instead of listening to the member for Quebec 
who is whining as usual, I want to know what the member for Rosemont 
think about accessibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is he one of those who think that scholarships are strictly under 
provincial jurisdiction, when we know that it has been a shared cost 
program since 1964 and that, if the federal government had not gotten 
involved, there would have never been a scholarship program? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras:</B> Mr. Speaker, I can see that the member for 
Bourassa listened carefully to my speech. He seems pretty worked up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He just said a lot of things in two minutes. He talked about 
student debt. Yes, student debt is a reality in Quebec. However, I would 
remind him that the average student debt is $11,000 in Quebec, compared 
to $25,000 for the rest of Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the facts. That means that our scholarship system works. 
The member opposite talks about accessibility. Does he not recognize 
that the present system helps only those who are in a particular 
situation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does indirectly what it cannot do directly. But I remind the 
member that Quebec has a very effective loan and scholarship system and 
does not need any lesson from the member opposite, let alone from the 
government opposite. 
<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, before asking 
my question, I would simply like to correct certain remarks that were 
made previously in this House by the Secretary of State for Regional 
Development. I think his figures were wrong and I want to take this 
opportunity to correct them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said that the federal government has increased transfers to the 
provinces. I want people to know that, in reality, these payments were 
reduced by $7 billion. They were at $18 billion in 1993 and they are now 
at $11 billion. That money was invested in education. I wanted to make 
this correction so that everybody has a good understanding of the 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member for Rosemont to talk again—maybe I did 
not catch what he said—about student debt in Quebec compared to the 
rest of Canada. 
I would like to hear again the statistics he just gave, and maybe he 
could elaborate on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras:</B> Mr. Speaker, just a quick answer. As I 
have just said, it is true that Quebec students have the smallest 
debt load—let me quote the figures again—with an average 
student debt of $11,000, compared to $25,000 in the rest of the 
country. Of course, the whole situation is quite bad, but when we 
compare our situation to that of others, what the member opposite 
does not seem to understand is that the system we have in Quebec 
is rather efficient.

<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to 
say how much of a pleasure it is to get the opportunity to speak 
this afternoon, not only about one particular component of the 
Canadian opportunities strategy, the central piece of that 
particular strategy, but the direction that this government is 
taking for the betterment and future of the young people of this 
nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two themes in the budget that will go down in history 
as very important turning points.  As we all know and will 
continue to read and hear about in the history books long after 
we are gone, one is the fact that for the first time in my voting 
life we have a government which has produced a balanced budget. 
No matter what the opposition or people feel about what was in it 
or not in it, that will always be the central theme that people 
will remember. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one other very important central theme and one only in 
essence because this is the most important budget in our 
generation as it relates to post-secondary education and to 
students, that is that this is an education budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the two themes in this budget that people will 
remember the most as years go by.  They will not remember the 
machinations of the Bloc Quebecois or Reform or the Tories saying 
we should have done this or that.  Those are the two themes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In those themes I want to deal extensively with the Canadian 
opportunities strategy.  In that strategy there is one 
fundamental issue as it relates to the Government of Canada, and 
that is access to post-secondary education for our young people 
today and tomorrow and to help those who have gone through the 
system in the last few years and have accumulated a very large 
debt after completing university, college or some other 
institutional program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go back just a little bit and look at the most 
fundamental part of the Canada opportunities strategy, which is 
the Canada student loans program.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not hear members of the opposition complaining about the 
Canada student loans program which has been giving billions of 
dollars to students since its inception in the early 1960s. Since 
1975 and into 1995, the number of Canada student loans program 
recipients rose by 148% while university enrolment increased by 
54%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That program, instituted by the Government of Canada, helped 
generate the access to post-secondary education that was missing 
before my generation.  It came into being at the beginning of my 
college and university days.  There were many people in my age 
group and a little older who would have never gone to college or 
university if it had not been for the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not hear the members opposite telling us not to continue 
with the Canada student loans program because it is a bad program 
or that it is jurisdictionally unacceptable to be involved in 
education in that regard because of the provinces.  As a matter 
of fact, they are involved in only one particular aspect today. 
It is because of their fear that the federal government has again 
launched another initiative that is going to help students obtain 
access to education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to read something to our NDP friends who continue to ask 
why we are putting in a millennium scholarship fund for the year 
2000 when there is a need to do something today.  I will read 
what was in the federal budget that will help students 
immediately.  We have recognized that there are some problems as 
they relate to students not only in accessibility but in planning 
for tomorrow and for dealing with debts today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the measures in the budget are easing student debt load; 
helping parents save for their children's education; promoting 
lifelong learning by allowing Canadians to make tax free 
withdrawals from their RRSPs to upgrade their skills and 
knowledge; and increasing funding for SchoolNet in the community 
to help bring the information technology into more classrooms and 
communities across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our goal is to continue to introduce steady and progressive 
reforms to the Canada student loans program to meet those 
evolving needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make sure for the record that people understand when 
they listen to this debate that it is not just about the 
millennium scholarship or the Canada student loans program.  It 
is about the whole issue of accessibility.  More important, it is 
about partnership with students, with parents and of course with 
provincial governments.  I put these in their proper order 
because that is where they belong.  The partnership has to be 
with students, their parents and, lastly, with the provincial 
governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new measures announced in the budget will do these things. 
They will provide a new study grant of up to $3,000 for students 
with dependants beginning August 1 of this year.  Well over 
25,000 full and part time students in financial need who must 
support children or other dependants are expected to be eligible 
for this grant.  For the first time, the government will provide 
expansion of interest relief to students who are experiencing 
difficulty making repayments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next year graduate interest relief will be introduced for others 
based on income.  It will provide a measure to protect borrowers 
from defaults and bankruptcies due to high student debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members can see, the Canada student loans program is 
evolving, changing and improving to continue to allow the 
children and parents of today and tomorrow the opportunity for 
post-secondary education.  Why should we, as a federal 
government, be concerned about that?  If we listen to the head 
waiters of the provincial governments in the opposition, they 
think the federal government should not be involved in these 
things because they are provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot dissociate social policy from economic policy. It is 
impossible to do that sort of thing.  I have said this in the 
House before and I will say it again:  The unemployment rate for 
those who have a post-secondary education drops to 5%, half the 
rate of unemployment in Canada. 
That is the rationale for the federal government being involved 
in post-secondary education and in access to post-secondary 
education now and in the future.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A central piece of this strategy besides the Canada student 
loans program is the new millennium scholarships fund.  I 
appreciate the opportunity the Bloc has given us to promote the 
Canada millennium scholarships fund and to bring it to the 
attention of all Canadians.  It is a lot cheaper to promote it 
standing here while people listen than it would be to spend money 
on sending promotional material and booklets across the country. 
It is a good saving for taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would anybody be opposed to a millennium scholarships fund? 
It is at arm's length from the government.  It is a foundation. 
Those appointed to look after it will be people with experience 
in education who understand the needs of students across the 
nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An interesting aspect is that the private sector has an 
opportunity to put money into this foundation.  The $2.5 billion 
we start with will not be the end of it.  We could end up with a 
$5 billion foundation for scholarships if the private sector 
comes to the table to help us and if the provinces see fit when 
they have surpluses, like Alberta, to put some of their money 
into the foundation.  They could do this instead of whining and 
bellyaching about what the federal government should not do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one most important attitude which federalists and 
Canadians should have. For years the federal government has 
helped in areas of provincial jurisdiction because we believe in 
partnership.  We believe in partnership with citizens, not 
necessarily with governments. Those are institutions created to 
serve people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The millennium scholarships fund, the Canada student loans 
program and the Canadian opportunities strategy are intended to 
deal with partnerships with students, partnerships with parents 
and partnerships with those levels of government that have the 
fortitude and long term vision to understand what this will mean 
for future generations and for the country as an economic trader 
and exporter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am thankful for the opportunity to say why this is such an 
important undertaking.  The budget we have just submitted to 
Canadians will go down in history as the budget that balanced the 
books for the first time in my generation.  It is giving Canadian 
young people an opportunity to be successful in a global economy.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I listened very 
carefully to the hon. member. One thing he seems to be forgetting in 
this debate is that—in the Fall of 1995, I think it was—the House 
passed a resolution on Quebec's distinct society. As usual, members 
opposite have forgotten all about it, of course. At the time, we kept 
saying it was wishful thinking and we have been proven right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say to the hon. member who just spoke that regional 
development depends quite a lot on manpower training. He voted in favour 
of Quebec's distinct society. If we were to go through <I>Hansard</I>, we would 
see that the hon. member has acknowledged it. 
Quebec, as a distinct society, can adjust its regional development 
according to its manpower training or can train its manpower according 
to its regional development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, if Quebec were to decide to focus its manpower 
training and education program on the aircraft industry and the federal 
government, just to please the Reform Party, were to centre its manpower 
training program on the cross-breeding on corn, this could very well 
hamper the manpower training and regional economic development 
initiatives of the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one part of the problem that the hon. member opposite, 
despite all his good intentions, I am sure, as well as the government 
tend to forget. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1235"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT31"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT31"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1235

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not time for him to recognize that economic development is 
closely linked to the quality of manpower training? When we talk about 
manpower training, we are also talking about schooling leading to it. 
This problem has been completely ignored by the Prime Minister and his 
finance minister in the budget he recently brought down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, my question to the member is this. How does he reconcile 
the maple leaf, Quebec regional development and the quality of manpower 
development? 
Can we find all this in the millennium fund or is it only window 
dressing to bring young Canadians to realize how heavily subsidized they 
are by the federal government, that the Liberal Party of Canada is their 
only hope for salvation, that only through the narrow ways of the 
Liberal Party of Canada will they go to heaven, and that besides that 
there is no salvation? This is what the federal government is trying to 
show us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is basically linked to economic, social and demographic 
considerations. Manpower training should meet our needs. I would like 
the member to comment on this. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert D. Nault:</B>  Madam Speaker, I have to tell the 
member it is obvious I am a strong federalist and I have no 
reason to be ashamed of such.  I am a Canadian first and 
foremost.  I do not have a lot of time for this parochial kind of 
discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I tell my children and the people I talk to at high schools very 
quickly that we can be Canadians and we can be different.  There 
is nothing wrong with being distinct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I go from northern Ontario across the border to Manitoba, 
which happens to be a two hour drive, I do not think I am in 
another country.  I do not think I am somewhere distinct even 
though Manitoba has a very distinct and different culture from 
northern Ontario.  There are a lot of francophones.  There are a 
heck of a lot of francophones in St. Boniface and Richer.  In 
places near Winnipeg there are a lot of franco Manitobans. Many 
of them are related to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I am trying to make to the member is if he is 
disappointed or disagrees with the federal government's 
involvement, why does the Quebec government take the transfer 
payments in social programs?  We believe as Canadians that we 
should all have equal opportunity no matter where we live, 
whether we live in Newfoundland, British Columbia or in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not too long ago when Alberta was a have not province and 
the federal government helped it.  Now Alberta is helping others. 
We help Quebec in a lot of ways and we will continue to do that. 
The millennium scholarships will be given to Quebec students 
simply because it is the right thing to do for them. 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, for the 
people watching this debate, I thought it would be instructive 
just to repeat what the motion is.  It says that this House 
censure any action by the federal government in the area of 
education, such as the introduction of the millennium 
scholarships program or national testing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since we are talking about education today it seemed appropriate 
that we look at various report cards.  The report card on the 
educational system in Quebec says that at best, its educational 
system is mediocre.  Many reports confirm this.  For example, 
only one youth in two finishes secondary school grade 11 in the 
Catholic school commission of Montreal. After Alberta, Quebec has 
the highest dropout rate of any secondary level in Canada. 
Thirty per cent did not complete high school.  It is 40% in 
Montreal compared to 15% in New Brunswick.  We spend $7,132 per 
student at primary and secondary levels, the highest rate in 
Canada and one of the world's highest with unimpressive results.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is alarming to me when I hear a number of members from that 
province stand up and object to our assisting each other in 
moving along as a country with higher technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conference Board of Canada has just reported that some of 
the main problems we have had competing in the world have been 
because our productivity and our ability to embrace new 
technologies is lagging behind many of our competitors.  A big 
portion of this lag has to do with access to higher education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The millennium scholarships program recognizes that a number of 
children who graduate from secondary institutions for one reason 
or another find it very difficult to make that leap into 
post-secondary education. It is for very profound reasons that 
the federal government has moved in this area.  It realizes that 
our future, our greatest resource, and we used to talk about 
Canada being a great resource based country and indeed it is, but 
our greatest resource is between our ears. The budget generally 
talks to those resources and specifically with the millennium 
scholarships fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the opportunity to visit a classroom in Chicoutimi about a 
year ago.  I talked to some of the students and I was amazed by 
what they told me.  They told me that this country is very much 
part of all of them and they want to continue with that vision of 
Canada. It makes me feel good today to realize that as a federal 
government, we can help all citizens of Canada whether they are 
in Quebec or any other province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has not just been the millennium scholarships fund.  We have 
also changed the registered education savings plan.  This will 
have a tremendous impact on parents in that province who want to 
save for their children's post-secondary education. It is the 
federal government in partnership with parents and students.  A 
$2,000 deduction is going to be backed up with a $400 grant from 
the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who are the benefactors of all these programs? Ideally of course 
they are the students.  But do not forget that money is being 
spent in post-secondary institutions mandated by the province. 
The reality is that the money from the millennium scholarships 
foundation is being paid over to institutions which are mandated 
by the province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know why this would concern the hon. members.  Do they 
think they have a possessory right to the grey matter of the 
people in their province?  I do not understand. I would have 
thought they would be standing here today with us rejoicing in 
the fact that we want to empower those people to have a great 
future.  That is what this is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague mentioned as well the ability of people to 
take money out of their RRSPs.  We paid a lot of lip service to 
the concept of continuous learning.  We have come to the 
realization that it is for real. The reality is people are going 
to change their careers two, three or four times during their 
lifetime.  We have to find a way to make that viable, to make 
them make those transitions, to make them continue to be useful 
to their employer. They may not change their actual employment 
but even within their employment, their job descriptions are 
going to change many times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was another positive way in which the federal government 
could say “We know you are saving money in your RRSP for your 
retirement, but maybe what you really need is a down payment on 
improving your skills today”. That is the best retirement 
program people can have. It is going to continue assisting them 
with their economic well-being during their lifetime. 
It allows the resources to build up savings for their retirement, 
$10,000 in any one year capped at $20,000.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not care if they are federal or provincial governments when 
it gets right down to it.  The reality is governments owe one 
thing to their people and that is to give them a good education, 
to give them those resources that are going to help them in the 
future to secure good employment conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just read the report card.  Why would the members not be 
rejoicing in moving in this general direction?  It is not that we 
are telling the people in their province what educational 
programs they can have, what institutions they can sign up for. 
I do not think anybody would want to have that kind of power. 
The money is being spent in provincially mandated institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding I have Durham College.  It was also mentioned in 
the budget.  The president of the college slapped my back and 
thought that was the greatest thing.  He did not care whether the 
money came from Ottawa, Toronto or anywhere else.  He thought it 
was great that we had empowered students to get a good education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have great difficulty with the members across the way who can 
actually stand there today and complain about it.  It seems odd 
to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second thing they have complained about is the concept of a 
national testing program, as if we are going to put everybody in 
the litmus of a focus and that the federal government is going to 
pass or fail people across the country.  Nothing could be further 
from the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The program they are referring to is called the national 
longitudinal survey of children and youth.  Although I have not 
read it intensely, my understanding of this program is basically 
to go across the country and measure how well children are doing. 
It is not just education.  It is about health and all kinds of 
other things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk a lot in this room about young offenders. If you go back 
behind those statistics you will find children of neglect in 
various forms.  Sometimes it is nutrition.  It seems to me that 
as a government if we want to really solve some of these problems 
we have to get at them before they happen rather than after the 
fact.  The provinces are partners in this and they participate in 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of things it does is measure the capacity for lifelong 
learning skills.  It also measures a number of other aspects such 
as the third international mathematics and science study which is 
part of this.  I presume this is something that really bothers my 
hon. colleagues.  Others are the international adult literacy 
survey, the pan-Canadian education indicators program. Quebec is 
a member of a sponsoring association as well as the council of 
ministers of education of which Quebec is a member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am at a loss today as to know what this motion is for and 
whose best interest it is promoting.  I do not see how it 
promotes anybody in this country. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I do not know if I 
will be able to bring my colleague opposite to understand why in Quebec 
we demand a different solution to a problem which is different. When the 
federal government is offering millennium scholarships across Canada it 
is showing us it knows nothing about the needs of the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is as if the federal government had decided to make access to 
school easier by providing bus transportation for every child in Canada, 
including those living in the North Pole. It might have been a better 
idea to provide snowmobiles to students in the North Pole so that they 
could go to school. It might have been a better idea to provide bicycles 
for those living downtown and school buses for those living in the 
suburbs a bit further from the school.

</I></B></P><P align=left>But the federal government, which claims to be quite familiar with 
the needs of each of the provinces, says: “This year, we will give 
snowmobiles to everyone so that children can have access to schools, 
even in summer. There will be no school buses. The federal government is 
generous, it realized there is a problem with access to the schools and 
it is offering snowmobiles, whether you like it or not”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we criticize the federal government for is not that it makes 
money available for education. We criticize it for wanting to do so by 
meddling in areas it knows nothing about. 
If it wants to help Quebec students have better access to education, it 
should give that money to Quebec, which is more familiar with its own 
needs and knows how best to ensure that more students have access to 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the member does not know that there are hundreds of 
thousands of children who go to school in the morning without a piece of 
toast or a single glass of milk in their stomach. Perhaps the member 
does not know that, in Quebec, the suicide rate among high school 
students is one of the highest. Will millennium scholarships reduce the 
suicide rate in our secondary schools? Will it increase the number of 
teachers, who, in some regions, must teach three different classes at 
the primary level? Will it provide more psychologists and guidance 
counsellors at the secondary level to help students who are desperate, 
who cannot find their way or who need assistance and supervision? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through its transfer cuts, the federal government has taken away 
from us the means to pay for these student services. We cannot provide 
them now, because it has taken away the money that it used to give in 
transfer payments. It has taken it away in the areas where we needed it 
and it now wants to give it back in areas where the need is less urgent. 
This is what we are trying to tell the federal government when we say: 
“Do not intrude in provincial jurisdictions. Give us the money that 
comes from the same taxpayers and we will take care of these needs, 
because we know them better than you do”. This is all we want.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Alain Dubuc, editor of <I>La Presse</I>, has condemned this federal 
encroachment in education through the millennium scholarships program. 
Moreover, the Quebec Liberal Party, which represents federalists in 
Quebec, pointed out that this kind of scholarship made no sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is this feeling so unanimous in Quebec? Is it just a matter of 
safeguarding one's jurisdiction? I do not think so. I feel the issue is 
much broader than that. 
Over the last 34 years in Quebec, we have developed, following many 
rounds of consultations and a debate that have been quite fierce at 
times, a financial assistance system made up of loans and scholarships 
to students, so that their average debt load when they graduate is about 
$11,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other Canadian provinces did not go through the same exercise, and 
students there have a much bigger average debt load of some $25,000. 
Canadians in other provinces have to find a way out of this problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their solution is to have the federal government take this kind of 
initiative. It may be the way the rest of Canada wants to go, but it is 
certainly not what Quebec wants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is also clear is the intrusion of the federal government in 
this area. Government members ask us why we are proposing motions such 
as the one now before the House, or whether we are trying to start a 
constitutional squabble. The truth is that the federal Liberals are out 
of touch with what is happening in Quebec. They cannot understand that 
this matter was settled long ago in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The money must be made available through the transfer payments. 
This money comes from taxpayers. The federal government does not just 
print money. It collects this money by imposing taxes and then 
redistributes it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What Quebeckers want is for the money to be redistributed through 
transfer payments, because we realize that the cuts made in the last few 
years have had a severe impact on the education system in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seventy-five cents out of every dollar that the Quebec government 
has had to cut in health and education since 1994 can be traced back to 
the federal government's cuts to transfer payments. We are looking for 
a way to put our hands on enough money so that our educational 
institutions and our students can have access to the resources they need 
to meet the requirements of the next decade. We want to train students 
who are going to succeed, who will be ready to face the labour market 
and who will be able to adapt to the new realities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec has no need for scholarships based on merit. Gifts of $3,000 
or $5,000 to a minority of students will not do much for Quebec's 
education system as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a bit like a house owner deciding that next year, he or she 
is going to invest in repainting the house. 
His uncle decides he will put up $5,000, on condition that it is 
used for a chimney and a fireplace.  An attempt is made to explain 
to the uncle that what the house needs is not a chimney and a 
fireplace, but paint.  But the uncle has a bee in his bonnet, and 
so does the federal government.  It wants its visibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been a member for four years, but the most astonishing 
statement I have heard in the House was made only recently.  The 
member for Lac-Saint-Jean, one of the youngest members here, asked 
the Prime Minister if it was not purely for the visibility that he 
created the millennium fund.  The Prime Minister candidly replied 
that yes, it was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is terrible.  They are repeating the same mistakes that 
were made 25 years ago.  They had to be careful for three or four 
years because of the catastrophic financial situation. 
But, as soon as there is money available, the first thing the 
federal government does is say:  “How can we rope in a group that 
is more attached to Quebec than to the Canadian federal system? 
How can we buy them?”  That is what they are trying to use this 
fund to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think there is an important message for all Quebeckers and 
all Canadians as well in this.  It is echoed by the Premier of 
Ontario, Mike Harris, and by Saskatchewan Premier Roy Romanow. 
These are not sovereigntists from Quebec, but people living in 
Canada, people who have read the Canadian Constitution and who say 
that education is a provincial responsibility.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They too realize they have educational needs that will not be 
fulfilled by the millennium scholarships. They are telling the federal 
government the same thing the people of Quebec are telling it. The 
concrete, realistic, appropriate thing to do would have been to put the 
money back into transfer payments to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To ensure visibility in this regard, you could just have written on 
the largest poster in the world the amount paid back to the provinces. 
At least, that would not have been as ineffective as the millennium 
scholarships will be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I hear members suggest that Quebec should let the millennium 
scholarships be integrated into its system, I cannot believe my ears. 
The days when Quebeckers bent over backwards to please the federal 
government are over. That is a thing of the past. Today, people want 
programs to be effective and to have a positive impact. That is what we 
want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen Quebec students take to the streets these past few 
weeks. The staff of educational institutions in Quebec did the same. 
They are knocking at the Quebec government's door knowing that education 
is an area under the Quebec government's jurisdiction. In addition, they 
now realize that Quebec was economically strangled by a choice made 
deliberately by the federal government not to put the money back into 
its transfers payments to the provinces and that, as a result, Quebec is 
caught in the middle between students with substantial debts and 
educational institutions that need funding to operate, on the one hand, 
and the federal government, which is turning off the tap, on the other 
hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is really what today's motion is all about. We are saying that 
the federal government does not have the right to get involved the way 
it has been doing for a long time in the education sector. This is no 
longer tolerable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our motion also points out that we do not want national standards. 
What we have before us does not only reflect a position of the Liberal 
Party of Canada, but a federal practice that has been in effect for many 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regardless of which party sits across the way—positions can 
vary—the federal bureaucratic steamroller decided a long time 
ago that Canada should have a national department of education, 
that these issues should be settled in Ottawa, because the 
solutions come from Ottawa. Ottawa is the one that understands 
how things work and how money should be spent. 
The branch offices will merely have to administer the programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebeckers do not share this vision of Canada. Nor do most people 
in the other provinces. People want provinces to be responsible for 
education. If Quebec and the rest of Canada have a different model, then 
let us respect what was established in 1964. It was 34 years ago that 
Quebec developed a successful student loans and grants program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It definitely has nothing to envy to the federal initiative, 
considering that, in the rest of Canada, the average debt incurred by 
students is $25,000, compared to $11,000 in Quebec. We can certainly 
understand that Quebec students would want to have a smaller debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But giving money to students by going over the heads of the 
provinces is not the way to ensure the future of the education system, 
because it will have a major negative impact on education networks. The 
money must be made available so that educational institutions can have 
adequate curricula and provide proper training, and so that students 
will want to attend these universities, thus alleviating the current 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by saying that while Quebec has a problem with 
students dropping out, the federal government is proposing a scholarship 
program based on merit for those who have successfully pursued their 
education. This is not what we want in Quebec. We want concrete 
solutions to our problems. But the federal government is once again 
showing it does not have the right solutions. This is what we are saying 
on behalf of all Quebeckers. 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I have 
listened to my hon. colleague with great interest.  It seems to me 
that there is a common denominator, practically the same in every 
case, running through several fields.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taking the application of the 1867 Constitution as one 
example, we know very well that Quebec and Canada have never 
managed to reach agreement on this.  As far as trade versus free 
trade is concerned, we clearly remember how Mr. Turner said in 1984 
that, if he were elected, he would tear the agreement up.  In a 
word, if Canada is involved in free trade today, it is because 
Quebec dragged it into it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taking Canadian pensions as another example, the Minister of 
Finance recently stated that he had been dreaming for 30 years of 
a fund identical to the Caisse de dépôt et placement in Quebec. 
Today we see Canada moving into another area, education, with the 
millennium scholarships, once again because of the success we have 
had in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, the question I would like to ask my colleague is this: is 
the problem between Quebec and Canada not due to the fact that 
Quebec is always 25 or 30 years ahead of Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
Châteauguay for his comment and question.  I do not know whether 
Quebec is 25 or 30 years ahead of the rest of Canada in all areas. 
But I do know that different paths have been taken in certain 
sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is somewhat of a heritage of the Pearson years.  I 
believe that history might have been very different if Trudeau had 
not succeeded Pearson. But today we cannot change the past, only 
the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member cited the Caisse de dépôt et placement as an 
example.  The loan and bursary system might be as well, along with 
the use of the tax points obtained by Quebec during those years in 
various sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, in many of these instances, Quebec has performed far 
better than the rest of Canada. 
It is not necessarily because Quebecers are smarter than other 
Canadians, but because Quebec is very aware of the needs in areas such 
as education, which is under provincial jurisdiction, it had a chance 
that the other Canadian provinces did not have with regard to loans and 
scholarships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe, if British Columbia had decided to opt out 30 years ago, 
members from that province would join us today in saying that this kind 
of action on the part of the federal government makes no sense at all. 
I think that, in a sense, the position expressed by Mike Harris and by 
Mr. Romanow, on behalf of all the premiers, is a recognition of that 
phenomenon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many provinces in Canada have realized that letting the federal 
government administer their money, letting it decide that federal taxes 
paid by Canadians will be used in a variety of ways that are not in line 
with each province's policies, has led to our current failures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, and this may be the most important message today, on 
this issue, the Bloc is speaking on behalf of all Quebecers. I will 
quote what Alain Dubuc wrote in <I>La Presse</I>. “In spite of growing 
pressures, the budget does not allow provinces such as Quebec to opt out 
so they can manage their own share of the $2.5 billion that the federal 
government wants to invest in higher education. 
Nothing in the still vague and undefined project presented yesterday can 
justify the fact that Ottawa wants to manage these funds itself, other 
than the desire to be visible and to see a maple leaf on the cheques 
that students will receive”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no greater irresponsibility for a government than choosing 
visibility over effectiveness, and that is the message we want the 
government to understand today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am keen 
to take part in today's debate for, as the deputy critic on human 
resources, I am extremely interested in the funding of education. 
I am also aware of the real problems in Quebec.  What the federal 
government is doing is not suited to Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion tabled today by my colleague from Lac-Saint-Jean 
focuses on a debate on the importance of the future of education in 
Quebec and the threat the federal government is posing to the 
entire system of education in Quebec.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House censure any action by the federal 
government in the area of education, such as the introduction 
of the Millennium Scholarships program or national testing. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we so upset by the new measures in the budget the 
Minister of Finance has just delivered?  Because the Minister of 
Finance, through the creation of the millennium fund, is meddling 
in a provincial jurisdiction and preventing Quebec from withdrawing 
from the program with all sorts of shenanigans. 
We know they are tricky. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also want to have national testing and this too is 
clearly an indication of just how meddling the Liberals and the 
Conservatives can be.  This testing reveals the Liberal 
government's bad faith and bad habit of trying to introduce 
national testing in education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What have they written about it?  I will read it to you.  It 
is contained in the action plan on page 30 of the red book written 
in 1993.  So it is not the freshest strategy.  This desire of the 
government to meddle in the jurisdictions of the provinces has been 
around for a long time. 
I will read just a short passage.  “A Liberal government, in 
collaboration with provincial governments, will introduce a 
voluntary National Achievement Test in math, science, and 
technology so that students and their parents will be able to 
compare their work in this area and track the progress of our 
educational systems in meeting the goal of higher achievement for 
our students in math and science”.  What business does the federal 
government have interfering?  And they have just told us they do 
not want any conflict.  When you do not want any conflict, you 
respect your partner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They tell us they want a genuine partnership, but what kind of 
partnership is possible with such an associate?  This centralizing 
attitude is not confined to education. 
Take the drinking water bill, which is a direct threat to the 
activities planned in this field in Quebec, and the Canadian 
Securities Commission, which would mean the short or long term 
transfer of all activities in this exclusively provincial field to 
Toronto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the government up to and why is it making such a deal 
of it?  Is it trying to win over a group that has to be won over? 
Is it a question of partisan visibility?  This visibility precludes 
effectiveness.  That is the Liberals for you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They want millennium scholarships to be awarded on the basis 
of merit.  Once again, they will not reach agreement with Quebec 
because Quebec does not want to focus on merit alone.  Need is also 
important. 
Is the government really going to alleviate the problem of 
indebtedness? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a period of ten years, beginning in 2000, a budget of over 
$2.5 billion has been earmarked for the fund.  The provinces have 
just been cut $10 billion and there are cuts in provincial transfer 
payments.  The figures show that we have dropped from 23.5% in 1992 
to 15% today.  Provincial transfer payments have been cut by 
over 8%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why interfere in an area of provincial jurisdiction, such as 
education?  I can understand that the other provinces do not have 
systems as well established as Quebec's, but Quebec is entitled to 
serious compensation.  We have just heard a motion about respect 
for a distinct society.  This will be accomplished not just through 
words, but also through actions.  This government's actions with 
respect to the millennium scholarships are at odds with its fine 
words, its empty motions to show us it cares. 
Quebec was cut $3 billion to be put towards the millennium 
scholarships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are they bent on interfering in Quebec's jurisdictions? 
I think it was a wish to mark the new millennium.  As my colleague 
said earlier, they could just have put up a great big flashy sign 
pointing out that the federal government was giving $3 billion, 
say, to Quebec as it entered the third millennium.  But no, it 
prefers to go and cosy up to clients, and I find that completely 
unacceptable and partisan.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier I heard a member opposite telling us “We are well aware of 
the student debt problem”. If Quebec is not aware of the problem, this 
is not what we are hearing in the field. On average in Quebec the 
student debt is $11,000 against $17,000 to $25,000 in English Canada, in 
the other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for tuition fees, the Quebec government is well aware they have 
to be kept very low; they are $1,700 in Quebec against $3,200 elsewhere. 
This is what students are telling us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people are against the creation of the millennium 
scholarships. 
The population was polled on this issue. Several stakeholders in the 
education field told us “This is a waste, a bad strategy”. If we were to 
believe the Liberal members, they hold the key to the truth. They told 
us a while ago we were talking through our hat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Polls tell us that 48.5% of the population wants the provinces to 
manage these scholarships. A meagre 16% said the federal government 
should manage them. And only 22% said they were designed to help 
students. This poll was carried out by Sondagem for <I>Le Soleil</I> and <I>Le 
Devoir</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another poll carried out by Angus Reid for <I>The Globe and Mail</I>, I do 
not believe it is a sovereignist daily, showed that 71% were in favour 
of prioritizing transfer to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the premiers told the Prime Minister at the June 
conference. But the Prime Minister always goes for half-truths. 
They talked about the student debt, but they said the issue 
should be dealt with through an agreement with the provinces. 
When you want to reach an agreement with someone—as you and I 
know, this is how its is done in a couple—when you want to agree 
on something with your spouse you do not play a trick on him or 
her as the government just did. The way to go about it is to sit 
down and say what you plan to do. If you are seeking a different 
arrangement, you know when you are listened to that you are 
respected; this is not what I am seeing on the part of the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some columnists are not very favourable to sovereignty. We are 
often told that in Quebec we have sovereignist plans in mind. Lysiane 
Gagnon from <I>La Presse</I> said “This is a glaring case of 
duplication”. She 
then added, and I quote “In Quebec, these scholarships will be grafted 
onto an already well subsidized system with a proven track record. 
The criteria are different”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, how are we going to agree if the criteria used by the 
federal government and the province of Quebec are different? She adds 
“Provincial policies will be thwarted”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did Alain Dubuc, from <I>La Presse</I>, have to say? “The cat is out 
of the bag”. This is bad federalism and these politicians belong to 
another generation. They are out of touch and already one of them is 
realizing that her older colleagues are hanging on to an outdated 
attitude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has no right to act as it is acting, 
according to Alain Dubuc, who often agrees with the positions of the 
Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, we were told that we, the members from Quebec, were to 
blame. But even Daniel Johnson said that the provincial areas of 
jurisdiction have to be respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether you read the red book or the blue book, it is six of one 
and half a dozen of the other. The red book is entitled <I>Preparing Canada 
for the 21st Century</I>. The blue book is Charest's Plan for Canada in the 
21st century. What the Conservatives and the Liberals are proposing is 
the same thing. They agree that provincial areas of jurisdiction must be 
respected. What we are asking for is real respect for provincial areas 
of jurisdiction, which is why we have moved this motion today. This 
motion asks that the provincial areas of jurisdiction be respected. It 
is not a minor motion concerning the distinct society that will be voted 
on in the House of Commons and forgotten about when the time comes to 
match actions to words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me conclude by saying that I hope the Liberal government will 
listen to what Quebec wants in this area.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, my colleague 
from Quebec was saying that this government has some difficulty putting 
its words into action. We would have expected, in the spirit of the love 
demonstration, in the spirit of the resolution approving Quebec as a 
distinct society, that the government would recognize Quebec as such and 
would allow it to exercise some of its powers to live up to and improve 
on its 
distinct characteristics. But we see these are words without any 
meaning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote someone. This is a little like a riddle. I 
would like you to guess who said these words. I will help you at the 
end. 
This is a text that goes back a while, to 1957, under Liberal Prime 
Minister Louis Saint-Laurent, who wanted to establish a federal fund for 
universities, a fund similar to the millennium fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The person I am quoting said “Unconscious, but nonetheless 
specious, paternalism. How can the central government be so 
hypocritical? We are entitled to suspect that the federal government's 
gifts are made in bad faith. This is insulting for the provinces. This 
is harmful to the principles of representative democracy”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Later on, another individual responded to him, and that ended this 
special edition of a Quebec magazine called <I>Cité libre</I>. The person who 
was talking at the end was Pierre Laporte, a former Liberal minister. 
He said “The majority of supporters of federal assistance to 
universities say that autonomists are latecomers. Not only is the 
autonomists' argument defensible, but it will have to prevail if we want 
French Canada to be well prepared for the tasks of the future”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who said the first part about federalism, paternalism and all the 
rest? It was the great mentor, the person who inspired many policies of 
this government. Pierre Elliott Trudeau. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin:</B> So, this must be true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien:</B> Exactly. I hope this will be food for thought 
for the Liberals. They accuse us, the separatists, of being the only 
people to defend a position such as the one we are defending today. 
Pierre Elliott Trudeau, if he were here, should agree with us. 
We would be able to count on his support. Let us hope that his pupil, 
his spiritual son, will think likewise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like my colleague to tell me what she thinks about the 
words of that distinguished politician who inspires the Liberals, Pierre 
Elliott Trudeau. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon:</B> Madam Speaker, I thought he was asking me 
to guess. My answer would have been Pierre Elliott Trudeau. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, we are wondering why the Liberals keep encroaching on 
provincial jurisdictions. We know, actually, but we can always ask the 
question. The President of the Treasury Board stated last year that once 
Quebec was forced to cut, the federal government would be in a position 
to show they can safeguard social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is bad faith. I would not like to associate with a partner 
having so little credibility. They are trying to demonstrate that only 
Canada can save Quebec, and that is part of the plan B strategy. The 
Prime Minister should perhaps call Mr. Trudeau to get the benefit of his 
influence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ordinary people are the ones who will suffer because of this. Every 
time the federal and provincial governments discuss standards, the 
people, particularly students in this case, end up paying the cost. What 
we need is a real strategy to reduce student debt loads. The Fédération 
des étudiants du Québec and the Fédération des collèges du Québec are 
asking for a new strategy, and they want the money returned to the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The dropout rate in Quebec is a problem. Universities and colleges 
are underfunded. Quebec students have already begun to ask for a freeze 
on tuition fees. This cannot be done without restoring transfers to the 
provinces for education. Otherwise, how are we going to maintain the 
quality of education we in Quebec have achieved? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an insult. Mr. Trudeau should be consulted about the 
millennium scholarships. Would he change his mind? I doubt it. The 
Liberal and Conservative governments are all the same. They all favour 
a centralizing federalism that is insensitive to the provinces' needs.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Madam  Speaker, I would first like to 
thank the member for Lac—Saint—Jean for a bright and 
interesting intervention.  If I may say so, he has a promising 
career ahead of him.  I will be sharing time with the member for 
Waterloo—Wellington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me enter into the substance of the debate.  The Prime 
Minister has stated, and it is the reality of our times, that the 
next century is the knowledge century.  Without knowledge, we are 
left behind in the competition of historical forces, not simply 
the economic forces and the social forces, and education is the 
key to that.  The key to this element in the federal budget 
strategy was the recognition of a national emergency, that we 
have fallen behind other countries and other post-industrial 
societies in the educational battle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has no specific relationship to Quebec, but the provinces 
have not fulfilled a constitutional mandate in education.  They 
have invested federal moneys in many cases that were intended for 
education, in highways or other projects that were no doubt 
interesting, but they did not direct it to the main element of 
the time, that is to say education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Facing this situation of national emergency the Prime Minister, 
with proper constitutional advice, decided on the series of 
measures members have seen in the last federal budgets; the 
Foundation for Innovation which is dedicated to creating new 
infrastructures for medicine, science, technology, engineering; 
the centres for network excellence, the moneys again for advanced 
research in science, medicine, technology; the greatly 
ameliorated programs for student assistance, student loans and 
aids to their parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, you would say if we were addressing this to all the 
provinces, where is our constitutional base.  If I may say so, 
one of the elements of sadness that I have with the 
constitutional debate as it has developed to date is that it 
began so promisingly and has dissipated into rather sterile and 
mundane arguments over constitutional divisions of power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can remember the early days of the “quiet revolution”.  I can 
remember my students from the University of Toronto Law Faculty 
saying to me, as they came to give evidence before the Bilingual 
and Biculturalism Royal Commission, why do we not have a 
revolution ourselves?  What a pity there is not a “quiet 
revolution” in English Canada because the thinking is not 
enlightened, the thinking is not exciting and there are no new 
feisty ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hearken back to the days of Paul Gérin Lajoie, Gérard 
Bergeron, my dear friend Jacques-Yvan Morin, Jacques Brassard, 
Claude Morin and Gérald Beaudoin, who is in the other chamber 
here.  The “quiet revolution” had a lot of interesting ideas. 
I do not see much advance in federal thinking in either English 
speaking Canada or French speaking Canada.  This is one of the 
“what might have beens” of the “quiet revolution”, the lack 
of contribution to a general process of constitutional 
modernization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I took part in the B.C. unity panel.  The Prime Minister was 
asked to delegate a member.  He asked me to sit on this.  The 
message we conveyed to the members of this panel was that in this 
period, act with generosity, do not seek quid pro quos, recognize 
the uniqueness of Quebec, recognize it generously without 
demanding return, and that was done.  It is a dramatic reversal 
of the 70%:30% vote against the Charlottetown accord in the 
referendum in British Columbia.  It is a unilateral act of good 
will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One might ask on the other side could you not offer something in 
relation to federalism.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality of federalism is that the studies in Canada as a 
whole have been sterile studies rooted in the a priori truths of 
British scholars who never themselves lived under a federal 
state.  Their new prime minister, Mr. Blair, has taken them 
kicking and struggling into a new century by recognizing that 
perhaps Scotland and Wales are unique societies and that they 
should do something about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The British have never lived under federalism.  They exported it 
to their dominions and gave us essentially a very rigid sterile 
system of federalism in which the debate was about division of 
powers in the abstract without focusing on the fundamental issues 
which the European Union is now facing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are social problems and the problem of community decision 
making.  If we try to solve the problems and agree on the 
solutions, the issue of who has the power will fall logically in 
place.  That is key to the concept of subsidiarité that the 
European Union is concerned with.  It is already clear in Canada 
that many of our problems were viewed by the privy council and 
others in the old days in watertight compartments, either federal 
or provincial, which do not yield themselves to intelligent, 
useful, long range solutions if one government acts alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Co-partnership, cogérance and co-management are the order of the 
day.  All the new federal systems, the non-Anglo Saxon federal 
system, realize that.  I regret that in some ways this debate 
remains an abstract exercise in a priori concepts instead of 
facing up to the modern issue of what to do about solving the 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is an approach to power sharing in this area, come and 
join us.  The facts are that no province has moved substantially 
to modernize its educational system to face the demands of 
post-industrial society.  That is the real tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who can object to money being spent on students?  Why cannot any 
government take the initiative?  Why cannot other governments 
join in and say “we will join with you; we will share with 
you”?   That was the real challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I noticed my colleagues, the lady members of the House, are 
honouring the people involved in the persons case with a monument 
on the Hill.  Not to denigrate the ladies, but I would say the 
real hero of the persons case was Lord Sankey, an unknown British 
Liberal lawyer in the House of Commons who was suddenly promoted 
to lord chancellor.  The Labour government did not have any 
Labour lawyers so it put him there.  Lord Sankey discovered the 
elemental truth that it is obvious that women are persons.  He 
gave the ruling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Later he announced the doctrine that the constitution is a 
living tree.  It is not rooted in the concepts of 1867.  The 
period at the end of the century we are approaching requires a 
new attitude to constitutional powers, a new emphasis on power 
sharing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last few days, in his response to the B.C. unity panel on 
the fisheries issue, the B.C. premier who was widely viewed as 
intransigent on fisheries matters indicated areas of co-operation 
with the federal government.  If we are to beat the Americans on 
the Pacific salmon treaty the federal and provincial governments 
have to work together with no issue of division of power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the immigration issue, Quebec and Ottawa have worked 
together.  René Lévesque signed the Cullen-Couture agreement with 
Prime Minister Trudeau.  Quebec and Ottawa share power on 
immigration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to education the question is come and join us in 
this new adventure.  Education is the key element in constructing 
the new society for the new century.  That is the challenge in my 
view that this debate has not fully responded to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that particular attitude I will end my formal comments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I always enjoy listening to my learned colleague.  My 
question will not be negative but will ask for his background to 
a very important question.  I believe it is important to the 
provinces and to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces have very jealously guarded section 93 of the 
British North America Act concerning education since its 
inception.  We are into a new era, a new world in which we will 
have to see a greater amount of co-operation at the provincial 
level.  We are being motivated by a new global educational 
system, one of universality.

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would my learned friend not agree that we should do everything 
we can from this level, albeit the provinces want to hang on to 
their traditions, cultures and so on in that given area?  I agree 
with that, but we should have more universality and a more 
national scope in our education curriculum and planning than we 
have now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his thoughtful question.  I am glad he cited section 93 
which, interpreted literally, would have made Quebec a prisoner 
of a religious school division system.  Quebec came to us—and it 
was arguable on constitutional grounds—and said that it wanted 
to switch to a language system of school organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The better, the modern and the progressive constitutional view, 
but not the most accepted view, was that we could not do it.  It 
was in the spirit of Lord Sankey that the notion of the 
evolutionary interpretation of constitutions was applied.  As I 
recollect, the House virtually unanimously accorded that change. 
We did it under the simplest form of constitutional amendment, a 
federal-Quebec resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that area I think we have responded to the notion of the 
evolution of a constitution.  The member is right that the 
imperatives are now world standards in medicine, engineering, 
science and languages.  The notion that one can be bilingual and 
that is sufficient is dead.  The student of tomorrow will have to 
be trilingual and quadralingual.  Every Canadian student will 
need an Asian language in addition to English, French and other 
languages. 
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
always enjoy listening to the erudite and lucid remarks of the 
hon. member for Vancouver Quadra.  Coming from Nova Scotia, the 
cradle of higher education in Canada, education is very important 
to me and to my constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the hon. member about his feelings relative 
to national testing.  It is an issue, especially with each 
province investing differently in education.  The investment in 
education in given communities is largely based on the municipal 
tax base.  Thus a poor municipality, like the one I grew up in, 
for instance, has significantly less money in its education 
system than one in a wealthier area.  The quality of 
opportunities for young people are not equal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would appreciate the member's feedback on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for that thoughtful question.  Let me personally excuse myself. 
When I criticized the provinces I should have exempted the poorer 
provinces of the Atlantic region.  They have invested in 
education.  They have set an example for wealthy provinces like 
British Columbia, Ontario and others that have shortchanged the 
educational system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prime Minister Trudeau once remarked when he got an honorary 
degree from a Nova Scotia university:  “It is amazing that I 
became a prime minister without being an alumnus of Dalhousie 
University”.  The maritimes are poor provinces but they exported 
their wealth, their educated people, to other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has identified a key problem.  It is out of date and 
wrong in our federal system to put education essentially in the 
hands of people who are the creatures of the provinces, the 
municipalities.  A modern federal system recognizes three levels 
of government:  federal, provincial and municipal.  Under the 
German system the three levels of government all share the tax 
revenues, the tax sharing agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The municipalities are underfunded.  I have already suggested to 
the minister of immigration that we make grants for English as a 
second language training directly to the municipalities because 
the burden is impossible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the member identified one of the key problems in 
education. 
<P><A NAME="LINK66"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, in speaking to the motion I note there is a sad honesty 
about it.  It exposes the shortsightedness in the provincialism 
that the Bloc Quebecois brings to all issues of public policy. 
It proposes to “censure any action by the federal government in 
the area of education”. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1340"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Bloc is trying to run away and hide from a world 
where all levels of government have a duty to be concerned about 
the education of our youth.  The reason is obvious.  Canada is 
part of a fast changing, competitive and interdependent world 
economy that is increasingly knowledge based. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not only because of the new high skilled jobs in high 
tech industries.  There has also been a steady rise in skill 
requirements in all sectors of the economy and in all types of 
jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The facts speak for themselves.  Since 1981 jobs for Canadians 
with a high school education or less dropped by two million, but 
more than five million jobs were created for those with higher 
qualifications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Education and knowledge are the keys to personal opportunity, 
security and growth.  This has become a fact of modern life.  I 
know this firsthand as a former educator and secondary school 
teacher with the Waterloo County Board of Education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also a fact of modern life that not all Canadians are in a 
position to access the knowledge and skills they need throughout 
their lifetime to find and keep good jobs in a changing labour 
market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Barriers, most often financial, reduce access to post-secondary 
education for many.  While the federal government cannot ensure 
that every Canadian will succeed, it can enhance the quality of 
opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what our government has done in the 1998 budget.  It has 
introduced the Canadian opportunities strategy which builds on 
actions in the 1996 and 1997 budgets and introduces historic new 
measures.  This strategy addresses a core reality of the 21st 
century life: to get a job, to keep a job, to move on to a better 
job.  There is only one resource that will equip Canadians to 
succeed, and that is to develop the best skills they can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly the Bloc would rather see Quebec students, parents and 
educational institutions do with less rather than be part of the 
national strategy.  By taking this stance the Bloc demonstrates 
clearly and brutally that it puts its own parochial politics 
ahead of the future of young Quebeckers and all other Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government will not retreat from the international challenge 
of our young Canadians and what they face.  That is why we have 
launched the Canadian opportunities strategy.  This includes the 
Canadian millennium scholarship foundation, the largest single 
investment ever made by a federal government to access and 
support post-secondary education.  The government will fund the 
foundation with an initial 10 year endowment of $2.5 billion. 
This investment will provide over 100,000 scholarships to low and 
medium income students each and every year over the next decade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The scholarships will average $3,000 per year.  They will be 
awarded to Canadians of all ages for part time as well as full 
time students.  Students at all public institutions, not simply 
universities but colleges, CEGEPs and vocational and technical 
institutes, will be eligible to apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The foundation will be a private body operating at arm's length 
from the government.  It has been designed to be sensitive to 
provincial jurisdiction and differences.  Once established, the 
directors will consult closely with provincial governments in the 
post-secondary education community.  Their goal will be to award 
scholarships in a manner that avoids duplication in any province, 
to build on existing provincial needs assessment processes and to 
complement existing provincial programs.  The foundation will 
have the authority, subject to mutually agreed criteria, to 
contract with provincial authorities for the selection of 
scholarship recipients. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The millennium scholarship has drawn the most obvious attack in 
today's motion, but let me remind the House of the other 
components of the opportunities strategies that I am confident 
are being supported by the majority of Canadians including 
Quebeckers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the opportunities strategy recognizes that the cost 
of study can be particularly acute for people who have a family. 
To help them, Canada's study grants of up to $3,000 per year will 
be made available to over 25,000 students in financial need who 
have children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second thrust of the Canadian opportunities strategy takes 
bottom line action to help address student debt.  The need is 
pressing.  In just eight years the average debt load after a four 
year program has almost doubled to $25,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget announces that for the first time ever all students 
will be given tax relief on interest payments on their student 
loans.  This will be provided through a 17% tax credit.  For a 
student graduating with a $25,000 debt this will mean more than 
$500 less in taxes in the first year alone.  Over a 10 year 
paydown tax relief could be as high as $3,200. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For individuals who still face difficult circumstances the 
government will extend up to five years the period in which it 
will pay all or part of the interest costs of student loans. This 
will benefit up to 100,000 graduates in financial hardship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our third action is responding to the fact that in today's 
information age, ability to continue earning depends on ability 
for new learning.

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The educational credit is a major form of tax assistance to 
students.  So far it has been available only to full time 
students.  Now part time students will have access to the credit 
as well.  This will assist 400,000 students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1996 budget enabled full time students who are parents to 
claim the child care expense deduction against all types of 
income.  Part time students will now become eligible to do this, 
which will benefit as many as 50,000 students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about working Canadians who want to upgrade their skills 
through full time study but do not have reasonable access to the 
financial resources this requires? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian opportunities strategy meets this challenge as 
well.  Effective next January, Canadians will be able to make tax 
free withdrawals from their RRSPs to support full time education 
and training.  This can be repaid over 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian opportunities strategy is not just concerned with 
today's immediate needs.  It also looks ahead to the students of 
tomorrow, assisting parents to prepare and plan for their 
children's future education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will provide a Canada education savings grant to supplement 
new contributions made to RESPs.  For every dollar contributed, 
up to an amount of $2,000 a year, the government will provide a 
grant equal to 20% of the total which will be paid directly into 
the child's plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year's budget created the Canada foundation for innovation 
to provide facilities at our hospitals, universities and colleges 
which will support world class research, underscoring our strong 
commitment to research and development and the culture which that 
cultivates.  That is very important for Canada and for the jobs 
it creates for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year we are providing new support for researchers 
themselves so that the best and brightest can fulfil that 
promise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Effective immediately the budgets of the three research granting 
councils, the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council, 
the Medical Research Council and the Social Sciences and 
Humanities Research Council, will be restored to their 1994-95 
levels.  By the end of the year 2001 they will have received $400 
million in additional resources, bringing their budgets up to 
their highest level ever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A further element of the strategy reaches beyond the lecture 
hall and the lab to address another problem confronting young 
people, the dilemma of no experience, no job; no job, no 
experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are introducing two measures to support the private sector 
and others in the challenge of hiring and training youth.  First, 
over the next two years employment insurance premiums paid by 
employers will be eliminated for new jobs they create for 
Canadians between the ages of 18 and 24.  Second, the 1998 budget 
doubles the resources devoted to the youth service Canada program 
to assist those particularly between the ages of 20 and 24. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Computer skills have now joined reading, writing and arithmetic 
as one of the basics of learning.  Having access to a computer 
puts the world literally at your fingertips. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To bring that goal ever closer for Canadians and communities the 
government is boosting the resources available to both SchoolNet 
and the community access program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the Canadian opportunities strategy is based on a 
very straightforward proposition that people, regardless of their 
income level, who are serious about getting an education should 
have that opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course there will always be a political issue here.  There 
always is.  Education is a matter of provincial jurisdiction.  We 
understand that.  The budget makes clear that we respect that 
profoundly.  As the Minister of Finance said in his budget, we 
are not talking here about the content of what is being taught. 
What we are talking about is equal access to opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to finish my remarks by looking back 35 years when 
two Canadian writers, an anglophone and a Quebecois, published a 
series of letters addressing issues of Quebec and Canada.  One of 
the issues was education.  Gwethalyn Graham wrote to Solange 
Chaput Rolland: “If French Canada is going to continue to insist 
that matters of education are exclusively the business of the 
provinces, then it will indeed be arguing that the rules are more 
important than the game”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government knows that the rules are important.  We are 
confident that our measures do not violate these rules and that 
they do not infringe on or jeopardize provincial responsibility 
and authority.  However, we also recognize that helping young 
Canadians to master and win the knowledge game is even more 
important.  That is what the Canadian opportunities strategy is 
designed to do.  To censure such an initiative is to censure our 
government for putting people's future ahead of the Bloc's 
political grandstanding.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like 
to make a couple of comments in response to the remarks by the last 
two speakers from the Liberal Party.  One of them spoke of sharing 
powers, and the other had essentially the same opinions, but 
expressed them differently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know how a power can be shared effectively. 
Powers and jurisdictions can be shared.  If there are 10 
jurisdictions, one level of government can look after five of them 
and another level can look after the other five.  You could call 
that sharing jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, what this government is trying to do is to share a 
single jurisdiction. 
It is as if two cooks were preparing the same soup.  One of the 
cooks adds salt and the other adds a little more to the soup to 
ensure a salty taste, and get the credit for it.  The result is a 
very salty and unpleasant soup.  That is the problem with 
jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We tell the federal government that we have no objections to 
its keeping some jurisdictions, like national defence, for itself. 
But education is ours.  We know this field best.  Get out of it. 
The federal government insists on having its own cook add salt to 
the soup.   If need be, it will remove some of the ingredients 
Quebec uses and use some of its own instead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we were after the truth.  I asked the question of 
a Liberal member after the budget. 
I told her that the millennium fund did not suit Quebeckers and the 
students in Quebec, because we already had our own system.  Her 
response was that it was fine, there would be an extra scholarship 
for her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is important, as far as the Liberals are concerned, as I 
could see from the remarks of the Liberal member, is the failure to 
see whether the need was consistent for all students.  That was not 
the case.  What counted was to ensure all students would enjoy the 
same measure so that the federal government would be visible. 
It is more important to meet the individual needs of each of the 
provinces than to use the same remedy for all students to ensure 
the federal government gets the credit for adding the last of the 
spices to the soup I used as an example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would therefore ask the member who spoke just before me to 
explain this sharing of jurisdictions, as he sees it.  Does he 
share the opinion of the federal member who told me she would have 
an extra scholarship?  Is that really the focus of this government? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Madam Speaker, I want to thank the hon. 
member opposite for the question.  This is not about soup or salt 
and spices but rather it is about access to opportunity for all 
Canadians, especially our young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are talking about here is not about what is content in 
education, which is solely under the jurisdiction of the 
provincial governments.  We understand that, we know that and we 
respect that.  What we are talking about here is access to 
opportunity for our young people who deserve that very first and 
important first chance.  That is what this government is talking 
about, that is what we are proceeding on and that is precisely 
the kind of thing that Canadians from coast to coast want, demand 
and need. That is what this government is providing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an educator I have to tell hon. members that I am very proud 
of the fact that we can proceed on this basis and provide the 
kind of solid training and background and ability to our young 
people and in the process ensure that they get the kind of 
opportunities that are all important for their future.

light of the hour, I wonder whether it would be more appropriate

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  There is not 
unanimous consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Madam Speaker, it is very interesting 
to rise on this motion proposed by the Bloc.  I find the motion 
totally negative.  That is perhaps not the best way to approach 
the education of our young people in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be absolutely appropriate to bring to the focus of this 
House what is needed in education in Canada.  I have difficulty 
with the millennium scholarship fund in that it will affect only 
about 6% of the post-secondary students in Canada today. The cuts 
the Liberal government made earlier will affect every student. 
There is an unfairness in the whole proposition. Not only do I 
want to address that part, I want to address a positive direction 
that ought to be taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The biggest criticism I have of the millennium scholarship fund 
is that it has no substantive direction to education and to the 
education of our young people in Canada today.  Let me put the 
context together for us.  It is pretty clear that we are moving 
to a knowledge based economy.  Knowledge based industries are 
going to be the big thing.  Canada is rapidly moving from a 
resource based economy to a knowledge based one.  Many factors 
are influencing that change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moving and sharing information has become the new economic 
engine.  Outfit and employment are expanding the fastest in the 
knowledge intensive service sectors such as education, 
communication and information.  This is where our young people 
ought to be trained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The costs of communication and information processing have 
fallen dramatically.  Today's computing costs are one-one ten 
thousandth of what they cost 20 years ago.  This has swelled 
computer use and has heightened international trade and 
accelerated globalization.  These factors have profound effects 
on the way people live, work, play and learn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this means is, for example, microchips today are doubling 
their ability to process every 18 months.  To succeed in the face 
of such rapid change means continual vigilance to keep current 
with the technological status quo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Competition is going global.  We need to recognize that distance 
is no longer a relevant issue.  I was speaking to someone who is 
doing a major telecommunications expansion and developing a 
program into China.  I asked this gentleman if he is going with a 
line system into China or with wireless digital communications in 
terms of telecommunications.  He said wireless digital 
communications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the developments of low orbiting satellites it will be 
possible for literally every nation on this globe to be serviced 
by wireless digital telecommunications.  Where are the young 
people who have the skills to meet that new world? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there was thing this scholarship fund should have done 
it was provide some incentive for our institutions to provide the 
kind of preparation for graduates to meet that kind of demand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw the House's attention to a recent article, February 21, in the 
<I>Financial Post</I>.  It says very clearly that we are 
experiencing a shortage of skilled people in our knowledge based 
industries.  Many of the courses that our universities and 
post-secondary institutions are offering are not adequate in 
order to meet the demands for new graduates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had appear before the Standing Committee on Industry 
immigration people and HRDC people who said very clearly that we 
are scouring the world to find adequately trained and skilled 
people who can help us bring our computers to meet the demands 
for the year 2000 transition when we are going to have to be 
ready for a whole new system.  We do not have them here in 
Canada.  A large group of about 1,800 have just been brought in 
on the emergency immigration system to do exactly that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a major issue before us.  This program should have moved 
in that direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see in light of the time that my remarks will carry on after 
question period.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
Justice Krever concludes that the treatment of victims in 
Canada's blood scandal has been unequal and that compensating 
some needy sufferers and not others cannot be justified. Yet the 
federal health minister still continues to deny compensation for 
the estimated 60,000 Canadians who contracted hepatitis C from 
tainted blood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More insulting to many of these victims is the likelihood that 
the federal government will in a truly meanspirited gesture only 
offer compensation to those who contracted the disease between 
1986 and 1990. Apparently the bean counters and lawyers over at 
justice and health are confident they can limit the government's 
financial liability by cheating about half the victims who 
contracted hepatitis C out of compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers call upon this government to immediately offer 
compensation to all hepatitis C victims and not just those who 
contracted the virus after 1986.  Shame on this health minister 
for not having done so already because to those seriously ill or 
dying, justice and compensation delayed is justice and 
compensation denied.

the regime.

whatever happened to the national children's agenda?  Where are 
the funds to match the announcement that the Liberal government 
is committed to helping children and families in need? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to get the answer to this question because in 
Vancouver a unique and excellent proposal has been developed by 
the Vancouver school board, the Vancouver Richmond regional 
health board, the provincial government, the city of Vancouver 
and community organizations.  If supported, it will provide a 
significant investment for healthy child development in 
Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Windows of opportunity is a powerful reminder that action is 
urgently needed.  The Minister of Human Resources Development has 
received the proposal and we hope for a prompt and positive 
response.

they will join me to secure the necessary funds.  Windows of

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, Bill C-3, the DNA Identification Act was tabled in 
the House last September. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we must ensure that any piece of legislation that 
creates a DNA data bank should be balanced to protect the privacy 
rights of all Canadians. Although this issue is fundamentally 
important, DNA analysis is not just about the potential threat to 
the right to privacy.  DNA analysis is an opportunity to make our 
justice system more efficient, effective and fair. Not only does 
DNA evidence help police solve crimes, it also helps to ensure 
that innocent people will not be unduly prosecuted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my opinion that Bill C-3 in its present form does not go 
far enough.  The preconditions to collect DNA evidence samples 
are so strict that they limit the opportunities for police to 
take full advantage of such an important crime fighting tool. 
They also extend the period for which innocent people remain 
cloaked in a veil of suspicion.

<P><A NAME="LINK98"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the auditor general says the government has violated the 
rules of public sector accounting and he might not even sign off 
on the Prime Minister's budget without a serious disclaimer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister hopes that this will be written off as some 
argument about accounting methods but this is a lot more than 
that.  It is about using unethical tricks to hide billions of 
dollars in surpluses from taxpayers who should get that surplus 
in tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whose idea was it to hide the surplus from the taxpayers?  Was 
it the Prime Minister's idea or was it the finance minister's 
idea? 
<P><A NAME="LINK99"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, there is no hiding of anything.  If anything, the 
auditor general is saying that we are too open. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian people did better than previously.  At the end of 
the year we took $2.5 billion and put it aside so that there will 
be 100,000 scholarships a year for 10 years for young Canadians 
to be ready for the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is so open that everybody knows about the money even before 
anybody receives any. 
<P><A NAME="LINK100"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the auditor general did not see transparency, he saw 
trickery in the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general says he cannot trust the Prime Minister's 
budget because of accounting tricks that misrepresent the size of 
the surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday the finance minister said he learned these tricks in 
the private sector.  But suppose the management of a public 
company did not want to pay a dividend to its shareholders so it 
used accounting tricks to hide the surplus. Today that treasurer 
would be making licence plates in some penitentiary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the Prime Minister playing fast and loose with the 
financial statements of the government? 
<P><A NAME="LINK101"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, this is the first time that a government is being 
criticized because it is doing much better than anybody 
predicted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes indeed we had $2.5 billion available at the end of the year 
and we decided that the money would be used to have the greatest 
millennium project of any country in the world, to invest it in 
young people for the 21st century. 
<P><A NAME="LINK102"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister's memory needs to be jogged.  This is 
not the first time that the auditor general has raised questions 
about his financial statements. This is the third year in a row 
that the auditor general has raised those questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said he found serious breaches in accounting rules.  There is 
a pattern to these breaches.  Every one of them works against the 
taxpayers' interest in tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do the Prime Minister's dubious accounting practices always 
work to the disadvantage of the taxpayers? 
<P><A NAME="LINK103"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

say it is a very good thing for the scientists to prepare Canada 
for the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, a year ago we invested $800 million for innovation to 
prepare Canada for the 21st century in science and this year we 
are investing $2.5 billion in the young people of Canada to have 
them ready for the 21st century.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on November 5, 
1997, the Minister of Canadian Heritage received a memo saying that 
Option Canada had not followed the procedures set out for that kind of

</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, that very same day, the minister told the committee: “I 
checked to see if these funds were spent in accordance with Treasury

does not happen again.

1997, she told the heritage committee that everything was fine, that 
everything had been done properly, when a report dated March 31, six 
months earlier, said that only two of the 22 conditions had been met? 
How can she justify that? 
<P><A NAME="LINK113"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr.

done is the follow-up with the documents, and I have already sent a 
letter on this subject to the parties concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am troubled by the fact that, yesterday, the member for

730,000 Canadians off unemployment insurance and on to welfare, 
and 1.4 million Canadians remain unemployed.  In my province of 
Nova Scotia alone 51,000 people cannot find work.  Yet in Halifax 
this very day high tech firms offer $1,000 finders fees to get 
the employees they need because of a skills shortage of 20,000 
software programmers.

<P><A NAME="LINK120"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

government has slashed $1 billion from federal training funds. 
That is a 50% reduction.  Seven hundred million dollars was cut 
from EI training alone.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is the phasing out of the ports police has been done to

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no more pointed paradox today than that of the tens of 
thousands of information technology (IT) positions left unfilled 
in a Canadian economy in which some 1.4 million people are 
without jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a time when advertised positions in many sectors draw a 
deluge of qualified candidates, organizations across the country 
are having to strategize and scramble to hire vital IT skills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“This society's use of information technology is growing by 15 
to 20 per cent per year, according to some estimates”, says

</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need information technology.  This morning on the front page 
of the <I>Globe and Mail</I> a headline reads $1,000 if you know 
the name of a person who can qualify for a competent software 
position in Halifax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a millennium scholarship fund which does not address 
this shortfall in our economy.  What is happening? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The executive director of the Canadian Advanced Technology 
Association, Mr. Nakhleh, said that many of the courses in 
electrical engineering have not changed since he was a university 
student in the discipline 25 years ago.  In other words, the 
courses have not changed.  We are moving into information 
technology.  It accounts for 15% to 20% of entries on an annual 
basis and we are still offering the same courses we offered 25 
years ago.  Something has to be changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Universities are not getting the resources to expand their 
efforts in the field.  Quebec has said to the universities they 
cannot raise their tuition fees and it will not give them more 
money.  That is the government of the Bloc which has proposed 
this motion today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a bright light. It is coming from private industry. 
Nortel announced yesterday a scholarship fund of $360,000 for 
students pursuing technology.  That is the issue.  That will 
provide in the Ottawa area $3,000 for a summer job and $1,000 for 
a scholarship toward university tuition for up to 30 high school 
students.  That will give the budding techies hands on lab 
experience in Nortel's research and development facility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nortel people, who employ a lot of technology people, have 
some advice to give to the universities and to our post-secondary 
technical institutes.  Nortel suggests that other priority areas 
for business and universities include expanding the highly 
successful co-op work in education programs, internship programs 
and programs such as distance learning, video conferencing and 
virtual classroom concepts.  These can lower costs and increase 
student access.  Companies could encourage university professors 
to spend sabbaticals in private sector labs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need collaboration, co-operation and partnership among 
universities, private industry and the general public.  That is 
what needs to happen.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This millennium scholarship fund simply perpetuates what has 
always been.  We need new thinking.  We need innovative thinking 
and Nortel is showing us the way.  When will the government 
listen to the people of Canada and do what is right in the 
interests of Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a whole other area that we have not talked about, the 
preparation of graduates.  There is a shortfall of money in this 
country today that is available for basic research.  This is 
probably one of Canada's greatest shortcomings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada should be on the leading edge, and is in certain areas, 
telecommunications, for example, where Canada is recognized as 
being a leader in the world, and yet as we speak we recognize 
universities are being short changed in terms of money for basic 
research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, we have the wonderful statement made in the budget where 
the funding to the granting councils, MRC, NSERC and SSHRCC has 
been raised to the 1994-95 level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of industry says this is new money.  It is nothing 
of the kind.  It is simply replacing the money that was there in 
1994-95.  What has this shortfall done?  This shortfall has 
brought about a deterioration of the infrastructure that is 
necessary for researchers to do their jobs. It has lowered the 
number of positions available for these researchers.  We need to 
address the shortfall. 
<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
must say I was a little confused about the member's commentary 
about fitting the programs that students are taking to the jobs 
available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fail to see how the need for software programmers, engineers 
and all kinds of other high tech and knowledge based training 
that will be necessary is somehow the responsibility of a 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have three children.  They go to school.  I think they are 
taught in a number of disciplines.  They get guidance 
counselling.  They know from their guidance counsellors and from 
what is happening in their lives where the opportunities are. 
This is not a secret.  It is certainly not the responsibility of 
the government to somehow conduct some social engineering to 
steer people into things that we want as opposed to dealing with 
what they want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member concluded, therefore, that the millennium scholarship 
fund was a failure because it did not address directing students 
into programs that they want.  These are the kinds of things that 
are the responsibility of the schools before post-secondary. 
These are the responsibilities of individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The millennium scholarship fund, if the member did not follow 
the budget, has to do with the issue of accessibility.  The 
member well knows that one cannot simply say we are going to 
provide all funding for all things we need in the very first 
budget of a mandate.  The direction is here and the priority was 
established that accessibility to post-secondary education was a 
very serious problem.  With the endowment of $2.5 billion there 
was going to be 100,000 scholarships provided over 10 years, not 
just on the basis of merit but on the basis of need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It really has to relate to those students who probably have the 
ability to be successful at post-secondary education. I know this 
member knows how important that is.  However, they are not 
prepared or able to take on the financial burden because of their 
personal family circumstances of not only tuition but the living 
costs and ancillary costs of an education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would simply ask the member whether or not he would like to 
reconsider the issue about not having enough software programmers 
and whether or not he really believes that this is a role for the 
federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would be delighted to 
answer that question.  If the hon. member will go back to 
<I>Hansard</I> tomorrow or later today, he will recognize that not 
once did I use the words directed toward students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I did say was that this scholarship fund fails to recognize 
where the shortfall is.  That is what I said.  The shortfall 
occurs in the provision to the universities for the kind of 
resources that are essential to develop. The first is research 
funds. 
Second, we need to develop the kind of infrastructure that will 
attract the students and instructors that are necessary.  Third, I 
also said that we need to be sure that the kinds of courses that 
are being offered in the universities are ones which the students 
really need.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that we need incentives.  This is not an incentive 
program.  All this does is provide some money and an apparent 
return of money for the money that the kids lost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me put this in perspective.  Every post-secondary student 
lost when the government cut funds to education.  Now comes this 
scholarship fund which is available to whom, to everyone? 
Absolutely not.  It is available to perhaps 6% of the group.  That 
is not equitable and it is not going to solve the problem of the 
shortfall.  It is not going to provide the universities with the 
kinds of incomes they need in order to build the infrastructure 
and develop the instructional talent and skills that will educate 
our young people toward those kinds of things that will lead them

running out but I would like my colleague to explain something to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's motion deals with the need to respect exclusive provincial 
jurisdiction over education. I would like him to tell us what his 
party's position on this issue is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he agree with us in the Bloc Quebecois that education is a 
provincial jurisdiction? I appreciated every point he made and I agree 
with him when he says that transfer payments to the provinces must be 
maintained to support research grants in high technology and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Simply put, what is the position of the Reform Party on the need to 
respect the provinces' jurisdiction over education? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is a good question. 
The answer is that education is constitutionally a provincial 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have over the years developed a certain partnership that now 
exists between the provinces and the federal government with 
regard to post-secondary education.  There was a time before this 
when federal money was put into vocational high schools in 
particular.  Hundreds of millions of dollars went into that 
program.  The reason it went into vocational high schools at that 
time was to bring about the educational skills the people needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same thing today.  We need a partnerships. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in the House to say how disappointed I am with the motion before 
us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though I agree with the underlying principle of the motion, 
its wording prevents me from supporting it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the principle of the motion since I recognize that 
education is an area of provincial jurisdiction and I agree with the 
Bloc that the millennium scholarship foundation is in violation of this 
principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I believe the Bloc erred by wanting to censure any action 
by the federal government in the area of education. If I could have 
amended the motion, I would have clarified the issue of transfer 
payments because the Reform Party believes it is a federal 
responsibility, which is not clear in the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Besides, I believe the issue of national testing is a separate 
issue. The relationship between federal and provincial governments in 
the area of education must be clarified in order to maintain national 
standards without encroaching on provincial powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Reform Party agrees with the Bloc to condemn the 
millennium scholarship foundation. We believe it has nothing to do with 
education but everything to do with the political image of the Prime 
Minister of Canada, who made this announcement two years ahead of time 
just to look good.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government is trying to hide the fact it cut $7 billion 
out of health care and post-secondary education, and is making up for 
these cuts by promising $325 million a year starting in the year 2000. 
This money will only help 6% of Canadian students while the other 94% 
will get no help whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover this fund will do nothing to lower the present debt load 
of students. The average student debt is around $20,000. A $3,000 
scholarship for 6% of students will not improve the situation very much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eligibility criteria are fuzzy. Will the scholarships be granted on 
the basis of merit or need? If it is on the basis of need, they will 
overlap the Canada students loan program as well as provincial programs. 
If it is on the basis of merit, a whole new bureaucracy will be created 
to decide who will get help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By making the foundation a private and independent body, the 
Liberal government is creating a new opportunity for patronage. This 
fund will only benefit a minority of students, whereas an increase in 
the CHST would have benefited every student. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned in my speech, and I would like to go over that 
one more time to make it clear, the Reform Party is committed to 
education.  We campaigned on that during the last election 
campaign.  We wanted to reinvest $4 billion back into health care 
and education.  It is not a question of Reform not being 
committed to education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen that on the part of the Bloc too.  Its amendment 
and the direction that it is heading with this motion is quite 
clear.  It cares about education. I would agree with the Bloc. 
As I mentioned, education is a provincial responsibility.  We 
have said in past debates that the Reform Party would like to get 
back to the constitutional sections that show exactly what are 
the provincial responsibilities and the federal responsibilities. 
We do agree with the Bloc on that level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was reluctant.  I really wanted to support this motion but it 
was so vague in its explication of how the relationship of the 
federal government to the provinces in education would actually 
develop.  There still has to be some sort of a relationship in 
the area of transfer payments and in the area of potentially 
national standards.  As I said, that is up for debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion does not at all address that issue and that concerns 
me. I know that one of the things that educational institutions, 
especially at the post-secondary level across this country, have 
had to do is catch up with the heartless cuts that we have seen 
on the other side of this House.  That is something that we can 
share in our feelings of dismay with the government and this 
attempt with this millennium scholarship fund.  We have no idea 
who it is going to help and how and what sort of bureaucracy it 
will create in the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that frustration that we in the Reform Party feel with the 
Bloc, I can understand and share that same sense of frustration. 
We want to see more of the responsibilities that are provincial 
responsibilities returned to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very, very important that we have this definition clear as 
to what it will mean when we start changing the relationship 
between the federal and the provincial governments.  We are open 
on this side to that debate.  In future maybe the Bloc could have 
some correspondence with some of the other parties in developing 
motions.  Maybe we can work together to create something better 
in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the Bloc's motion, but I am sorry I cannot support 
it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would be tempted 
to contradict, to react strongly to the Reform member's words, but 
I am obliged to acknowledge two things first of all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, that in his desire to address the students and 
people of Quebec, he spoke in French, and I congratulate him on 
that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, he shows some open-mindedness.  He says he is in 
agreement with the motion because they too would like to see 
education a provincial matter.  But, having said so in French and 
in English, he then says the Reform Party is demanding $4 billion 
more for the federal government's intervention in education.  It is 
an art to be able to contradict oneself within less than ten 
minutes on an entire position, not just a detail.  I would tell the 
hon. Reform member that, if they want to gain points in Quebec, 
they will have to be more consistent than this.  A person cannot 
say two contrary things within one speech.> 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member from the Reform Party describes our motion as 
too vague, too broad. 
I would like to remind him of the wording of our motion: “That this 
House censure any action by the federal government in the area of 
education, such as—and here it is very precise—the introduction 
of the Millennium Scholarships program—to which he has expressed 
opposition—or national testing”.  This is the wording of our 
motion. It is very specific.  I am therefore raising the matter of 
this contradiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like his help in understanding it better.  If he does 
not see this as a contradiction, fine, but it is obvious that 
either one agrees that jurisdiction over education is a provincial 
matter, or one does not.  I would then understand a position like 
the Liberal government's stand on education.  It wants to interfere 
in education precisely in order to gain visibility with young 
Quebec students. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will try to clarify my 
point once again for the hon. member who asked me the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think I contradicted myself at all. The Reform Party 
has always said that we have been committed to reinvesting in 
health care and education.  We made that clear during the course 
of the last campaign.  I do not think that has anything to do 
with the jurisdiction as it relates to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not saying how the provinces should spend that money on 
education or health care.  We realize that disparities exist 
throughout the country in how some provincial governments deal 
with certain problems.  They are most effective in dealing with 
those problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All we have said is that we believe transfers should be 
continuous and increased to those provinces to allow the 
provincial governments to supply funds to health care, education 
or whatever the matter may be.  I am not contradicting myself. 
Actually I am saying that the federal government should remove 
itself from creating policy on how the provincial governments 
spend the money once it is transferred to them.  I am actually in 
favour with the Bloc on that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the member referred to the Bloc's motion he himself made it 
clear that the motion says the federal government should remove 
itself from all attempts at creating any relationship with the 
provinces in education.  That is what is not clear.  As I have 
outlined, the federal government still has a responsibility for 
transfer payments to the provinces.  That is not clear in the 
motion.  I wish there had been more thought put into the motion 
because as I said there is something that we could have agreed on 
in the principle behind the motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the member caught my interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Early in the debate the talk was about increasing the transfers 
to the provinces to take care of these so-called problems in the 
post-secondary area.  The member mentioned a very important point 
regarding the fact that there would be no strings attached and 
they would not be told how to spend it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given what happened in the province of Ontario where the 
reduction and the transfer was only $850 million yet the tax 
break passed on was $4.3 billion, how do we determine whether or 
not the moneys that are transferred from the federal government 
to the provincial government are actually used to either enforce 
national standards or to go to the area into which they were 
directed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the reason lots of 
provincial governments have had to struggle in order to make up 
for the lost funding over the last number of years is that the 
member's government has cut close to $7 billion in transfers in 
education and health care. 
Unfortunately that is what some of the provinces had to do.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am of the slate of people who believe in the provinces and 
believe in the administrations of the provinces to start putting 
money toward areas where it is needed. The Liberal government 
should consider giving more trust to the provinces.  It should 
start reinvesting back into them in the form of transfers.  Those 
governments can take care of the problems more effectively than 
we have seen with anything the Liberal government has created.

my heart because it concerns the future of young Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am all the more happy since I just attended a meeting with 
provincial social affairs ministers and our discussions with them were 
very constructive and beneficial to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been a member of this government for two years. I can tell 
you that, with regard to social cohesiveness, we have made considerable 
progress in vital areas that are of concern to all of us, especially 
those that relate directly to the well-being of people, families and 
children across the country.

my time with the member for Mount Royal.

development, employability, labour issues, these are all areas where my 
provincial counterparts, myself and this government have worked together 
to strengthen Canada's social fabric so we can be ready to meet the 
challenges of the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We owe this progress to the openmindedness, the good faith and the 
co-operation of provincial and territorial governments, which each have 
their own concerns, but which also share certain goals and objectives 
and a common vision of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This vision is the vision of a Canada that is preparing to enter 
into a new century and a new millennium and that must be able to rely on 
a population that is strong and well equipped to meet the challenges 
that lie ahead.

about co-operation with the provinces, about developing partnerships, 
and about extraordinary achievements to improve people's skills and 
knowledge in this country and help us face the new millennium, I am very 
interested in the Bloc's motion, because this is what we have been doing 
for the past two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result of the efforts we have all made for a while now in our 
daily lives are such that economists from the Conference Board and other 
experts are predicting that Canada will enjoy the best growth rate among 
G-7 countries. Thanks to a collective effort by Canadians, and to the 
co-operation of various levels of government, we are back on the road to 
fiscal balance and prosperity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The quality of our human resources is as important for the 
country's prosperity as are our research and development initiatives, 
and our economic infrastructure. Our collective effort is guided by the 
vision that we must continue to build on what has been achieved in 
recent years in the context of our social union, and this is what we are 
about to do as a government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In this connection, the Canadian government has a 
responsibility to support the individual efforts of each Canadian, 
each province and each territory, to ensure that all citizens of 
the country have the same opportunities to contribute to collective 
prosperity and to profit from it individually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada and its provincial partners have 
worked very hard in recent years to battle child poverty, as well 
as to put some order in the manpower area, transferring the 
jurisdiction over manpower and active employment measures to the 
Government of Quebec. 
All of this is part of our effort to modernize our country, to work 
collaboratively with the various levels of government in order to 
ensure that our efforts complement each other and share similar 
goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are moved by a spirit of co-operation, and I feel this is 
the best service we can render to Canadian society at the present 
time.  The time is ripe for demonstrating that Canadians, 
Quebeckers included, are best served when both levels of government 
show a willingness to work together in good faith to improve and 
enhance the future prospects of each and every citizen and to 
reinforce our social union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question of interfering in each other's areas of 
jurisdiction.  We are combining our means, our resources and our 
strengths in order to fulfil Canada's destiny, one which will be 
more promising than ever. 
This is the form of federalism I am calling for, one which will 
equip our country with the tools it needs to meet the challenges of 
the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We shall be approaching the eve of the third millennium in less 
than 16 months time.  We in Canada have chosen to mark this 
passage from one millennium to another by creating a special 
non-recurring fund, not part of the permanent program and 
transfer structure, but one which will provide 100,000 young 
Canadians over 10 years with the opportunity to earn a 
post-secondary scholarship of up to $3,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not interfering in education.  We are not interfering 
in curricula, the management of institutions, and tuition fees.  I 
would be the first to object to the Canadian government meddling in 
education.  But it is the responsibility of the Canadian government 
to ensure equality of opportunity across the country, for all 
citizens from coast to coast, so that everyone has the best 
possible chance of pursuing post-secondary studies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues and I are convinced that the millennium fund 
does not duplicate anything already being done by the governments 
of Quebec and of the other provinces.  I want this foundation to 
complement the provinces' existing mechanisms for defining needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe in a resolutely modern federalism, a federalism that 
is effective and respectful of provincial jurisdictions, a 
federalism that serves the interests of all Canadians. 
That is why I am going to make sure that the millennium scholarship 
fund is implemented in a spirit of respect and solidarity and, 
above all, in the interest of young Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The millennium scholarships will give an greater number of 
Canadians from low or middle income families the opportunity to 
pursue post-secondary education.  We will be sure to work very 
closely with the Government of Quebec.  We made sure, as we said in 
the budget speech, that the foundation responsible would operate 
independently of the government.  Its mandate is to avoid any 
duplication.  We are even prepared to enter into contracts with the 
appropriate provincial authorities so that they can make the 
initial selection of scholarship holders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We live in a country that has decided to invest in the

traditional course of erecting a monument or whatever, as is done 
elsewhere, I can say one thing:  I see this as a vision, and I 
think it is a great deal more productive to celebrate the 
millennium by taking an interest in the generation of tomorrow, in 
knowledge, because that is what tomorrow's economy, and our 
country, will need.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, if I were 
a foreigner—which I may be—and I did know much about the news in 
Canada and just heard what the minister, for whom I have a lot of 
respect, had to say, I could only jump to my feet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his book, René Lévesque said that it takes 18 months for a 
Quebec minister to lose touch. I am sorry, but when they talk about 
co-operation, I cannot agree. There are many federalists, sovereignists 
and student associations who doubt the effectiveness of the millennium 
fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember that at the last referendum—I was not a member of 
Parliament yet—I heard many people saying “I will vote no, but if 
nothing changes, Stéphan—” 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:</B> In the Lac-Saint-Jean area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have no qualms about it, my 
own father voted no at the last referendum but he told me the same 
thing. He said “Stéphan, I will vote no, but if nothing changes, next 
time I will vote yes”. Everyone said “Things will change. Things will 
change”. Nothing has changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, back to the issue. The second thing the minister talked about was 
the growth rate. Let us talk about it. It is true that we have a good 
rate of growth at present, and that corporations are making record 
profits, according to the stock exchange index. There are numerous 
economic indicators showing that things are going well and it is true. 
But why are the members opposite creating poverty as never before? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993, there were 1 million children living in poverty in Canada. 
Now there are 1.5 million. 
I wonder what mechanisms they want to use to distribute wealth in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about the efforts of each and every Canadian, we must 
be cautious. Often, it is the provinces who make the efforts. But there 
is something else that we do not talk about often enough. I have done 
some serious research into the financial crisis that countries are going 
through, like Canada. I believe that countries, and not only Canada, are 
becoming poorer every day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that in the 1950s, the corporate sector paid almost 49% 
income taxes and that its share has dropped to 7% today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No wonder citizens have to pay so much tax and income tax. It is 
because some are not paying their share. Who benefits from economic 
growth? It is the corporate sector, businesses. 
I think this warrants serious debate, but it is not the subject of 
debate today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, if I came from somewhere else and were 
listening to the minister's speech, I would think it a fine speech. 
It is like finding someone hurt on the side of the road and 
offering a bandaid.  A praiseworthy gesture.  It takes courage to 
apply a bandaid, but perhaps it would be an idea to disinfect the 
wound first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc's opposition to the new loans and grants program is 
not because students should not be helped.  We are saying they 
should be helped efficiently and the most should be made of every 
dollar invested in education. 
But what are they doing instead?  A system of loans and grants 
already exists in Quebec.  It is one of the most effective in 
Canada, not according to me but to the president of the Canadian 
students association.  But what are they doing?  They are 
sabotaging that system by cuts in transfer payments to Quebec.  And 
then they cause duplication by setting up another system of loans 
and grants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore ask the minister: Where is the co-operation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:</B> Mr. Speaker, that is the fundamental 
reason why I decided to go into politics, this co-operation that the 
minister— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> He is not a minister yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:</B> Excuse me. That the member for 
Lac-Saint-Jean is talking about. You do have a future. That is 
good. I wish you the best. And we will see if it takes 18 months 
to adapt.

Human Resources Development is to redistribute the wealth and to allow 
Quebeckers, among others, to benefit from a broader Canadian tax base in 
the area of manpower, which we have transferred to the Quebec 
government. Even though Quebeckers pay 23% of contributions to the 
employment insurance fund, the budget that was transferred to Mrs. 
Harel, in Quebec, represents 31%. That kind of redistribution of wealth 
is certainly in Quebec's favour.

that selection using its own system of evaluation. It is all written 
down in the budget.

comforting way of contemplating our future.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is quite something to follow our Minister of Human Resources 
Development.  He is a most articulate as well as competent 
spokesperson in the interests of the well-being of transferring 
wealth in a fair and equitable way across the country, except 
sometimes I think Quebec gets more than its fair share. 
Notwithstanding that, as a Quebecker I am pleased to see some 
improvement in the state of the nation in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the level of unemployment.  The level of 
unemployment of our young people between 15 and 24 years of age 
increased from 13% in 1989 to 18.9% in 1996. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is an increase of nearly 50%. Moreover, young people with a 
low qualification level are more affected. For example, 56.4% of income 
security recipients under 30 years of age did not finish high school. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This last fact must be considered in the context of certain data on 
the evolution of jobs in Quebec according to the education level 
required. Between 1990 and 1997, data show that the number of jobs 
requiring a post-secondary or university degree increased by 471,000, 
whereas the number of jobs requiring a lesser level of education 
decreased by 384,000. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the combination of those figures. There has been 
a dramatic change in the employment portrait in Quebec for many 
reasons.  We are looking at 855,000 job shifts, 471,000 in the 
interests of those who have post-secondary education and a loss 
of 384,000 for those who have not as yet finished their secondary 
education. There is also a 56.4% dropout rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are figures from Madam Harel with whom I had the pleasure 
of working at the anniversary of the black community resource 
centre.  We discussed the importance of education and the 
importance of addressing the changing world of work in which we 
live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young people today need the proper kind of training and 
advantages so that they can face the new millennium with the 
newest of skills and the latest of technology at their 
fingertips.  If they do not have that, the potential for no jobs 
or poor jobs indicates a very sad reality for them. It becomes 
more and more important to look at what we can do to prepare 
people through education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Epidemiologists say that one measures a healthy society in the 
kind of efforts we put in as a government.  It is regardless of 
which government because basically members on all sides of the 
House are really interested in the well-being of the people.  It 
is a matter of how the well-being of the people is interpreted.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Our perspective of the well-being of people is we looked at the 
millennium fund.  As the minister so eloquently stated, rather 
than putting it into bricks and mortar, into fancy designs or 
houses or buildings, we have decided to invest in our 
intellectual capital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are investing in our young people so that tomorrow they will 
be able to face the world in a far more constructive and open 
minded way.  They will change jobs two or three times, unlike the 
situation with my generation where we took a job and we were 
there for life or until we got our gold watch at 65.  Now they 
will have to look at other options in life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The millennium scholarships fund is very exciting and dynamic. 
It is responsive to a changing world.  It shows we are a 
government with a vision which has been building along with 
governments before it on helping the future of our country.  It 
is your future and my future, your businesses and our businesses. 
It is extracting from the best the guidelines to the future for 
our families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I listened to much of this debate and the questions, I asked 
myself what I would think if I were an ordinary citizen in the 
world.  Would I not believe that investing in my children and 
grandchildren was the most wonderful thing a government can do? 
Would I not believe if the government plans for the future 
well-being of our total society by addressing the futures of 
those young people, that it is investing in our well-being? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Epidemiologists say that a well educated society is a much 
healthier society.  It will reduce the costs of our social 
services and health services.  It will improve the quality of 
life within our society.  That is why the finance minister has 
ensured a program of quality and worth which is worthy of praise 
rather than condemnation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I lived for nine years on the opposition benches.  I lived in 
opposition and I know it is the opposition's task, its job and 
its responsibility to pick and to criticize.  But even when I sat 
on that side, if something of quality was presented, I found it 
within my conscience, within my right and within my 
responsibility to respond to the needs of my electors, that even 
if I did not want to thank the government, at least not to use 
the kind of negativism I have been hearing from the other side of 
the House.  It is a shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one of the most exciting and dynamic approaches we could 
possibly want for the young people in my riding.  It is offering 
them an incredible scholarship procedure.  This is part of the 
building tool.  I hate to make it so mundane as to say it is the 
icing on the cake but really it is the top of the layers we have 
been building in the hope for the future.

which is appalling? This will not help anybody in Quebec and is not in 
our best interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not care what your political views are or wether you are a man

do not have a vision of the future.

with bright, intelligent young people who in many instances are

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is much in the millennium scholarship fund.  Hon. members 
should refer back to what the minister had to say and to the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles-A. Perron (Saint-Eustache—Sainte-Thérèse, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to comment on what the hon. member for Mount 
Royal, who is a very wise member of this House, said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In her comments, the hon. member dared to lecture us, and with good 
reason. I too feel very uncomfortable with the antics in this House and 
I agree 200% with the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, the hon. member for Mount Royal told us to look 
at the budget and added that it did not make sense in a state like 
Quebec to have such undereducated children and all the rest. I must tell 
the hon. member for Mount Royal that I did look at the budget. What was 
done about family trusts in order to help our poor children?  What was 
done about the tax breaks enjoyed by certain corporations in order to 
help poor children get a better education? 
What is being done? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I too would be very uncomfortable to rise in my place and say: 
“We 
are doing a lot”. Three thousand dollars a year for some students 
beginning in the year 2000?  That money is needed today, not in 2000. I 
too would be uncomfortable. I too would be unhappy to pass on messages 
and blame people. That is not the objective of our debate. The 
millennium fund does not make sense since it will start only in 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Secondly, we have the necessary tools to manage the money. Why 
spend money?  It should go to the students. They should be given money 
to go to school, not a meagre $3,000 a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the hon. member. How will she manage to make 
more money available to each and every government in Canada? 
Instead of cutting transfers, how can they give money to these 
governments so they can help poor people and the middle class?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Finestone:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my sense is that this 
is an important undertaking.  I enjoyed the fact that the Bloc 
Quebecois decided to use this opportunity to discuss in the House 
what has been done in the interest of children, youth, and 
seniors in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government chose to put $2.5 billion in a fund to be 
administered outside the government by quality leadership and 
with representation of youth and of the provinces.  This was at 
the request and consideration of the Council of Education 
Ministers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members choose to ignore the tax credits and child programs.  We 
have put $1.7 billion into the enriched child tax credit.  We 
have undertaken to ensure libraries and schools are 
interconnected with the Internet.  Every school will have a 
co-ordinator.  I find it sad that they cannot stand and say they 
agree because a lot has been done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First and foremost we have a balanced budget.  We have been able 
to put in order the finances of the nation.  It was not an easy 
task.  It was not easy for the population.  The people of the 
country tightened their belts and had less discretionary funds. 
They contributed to putting the financial house in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once the foundation is there we are able to build without undue 
cost.  We can move to further solidify that foundation and enrich

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise after my Bloc Quebecois colleagues in this debate on a 
motion moved by my party. The motion reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House censure any action by the federal government 
in the area of education, such as the introduction of the 
Millennium Scholarships program or national testing. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no secret that the famous millennium scholarship program 
announced in the recent Martin budget is a personal initiative of the 
Prime Minister who would like to draw the attention of historians away 
from other less glorious deeds of his going back to the Trudeau era. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Well, it seems that he will not make his mark in history books with 
this program which is being widely condemned by provincial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This comes after his attempt to destabilize the sovereignist 
movement in Quebec with a Supreme Court referral, a political football 
he deflated when he said yesterday it was a thing of the past. He was 
being asked about the eventual designation of the Progressive 
Conservative Party leader as the leader of the Quebec Liberal Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the Prime Minister to re-examine very soon his strategies, 
like he has done for the Supreme Court referral, and to listen more 
carefully to what students and their associations are saying in Quebec. 
They all ask him to do his homework concerning the millennium 
scholarships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the student federations that have condemned this program is 
the Fédération étudiante universitaire du Québec, whose president 
Nicholas Ducharme said it was no more than an exercise in visibility and 
a purely political operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He goes on to say that the federal government is duplicating 
existing structures. I can only agree with the federation that the 
federal government should have invested this money which comes from 
Quebec in the existing loans and scholarships system in Quebec. This is 
the Bloc Quebecois position.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebeckers have not been fooled. They know the source of the 
problem, of the difficult financial situation which Quebec students are 
in, and it is, as we all know, the massive cuts in transfer payments 
made by this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec has made major investments in its young people in the area 
of education. It has made some efforts to maintain tuition fees and 
student debt loads at reasonable levels and, in that regard, we have no 
cause to be jealous of the situation in the other Canadian provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, tuition fees are about $1,700 a year in Quebec, while they 
average some $3,200 in the rest of Canada. 
This significant difference explains why students in the other provinces 
are often in a more difficult situation than Quebec students. The 
average student debt in Quebec is $11,000, compared to between $17,000 
and $25,000 in the rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To counter this situation, the Chrétien government ignored its 
commitments at the last first ministers' conference and decided to 
intrude once again in a provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the prime minister's word worth? An appropriate answer 
would lead me to use unparliamentary language. I leave it up to you to 
answer it in all honesty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Bloc Quebecois consider that all Quebec students who want 
to further their education deserve some help, and this is the approach 
favoured by Quebec with its loans and grants program. 
That is not the case with the millennium scholarships, only a third of 
which will go to low and middle income students, and which will be 
awarded mainly on the basis of merit or excellence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This new duplication in the area of education concerns me a great 
deal, especially for my region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conseil permanent de la jeunesse recently specified in one of 
its studies that the Lower St. Lawrence, the North Shore and the 
Saguenay would see their population decline by 10 per cent by the year 
2016. This phenomenon is not new, but it seems to be increasing. 
Thousands of young people will emigrate to urban areas. We must help our 
regions keep their young people and it is the governments closest to 
these people that are in the best position to know and to initiate the 
corrective actions required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not surprise anyone by saying that in outlying areas there 
is a problem created by the fact that young people are leaving.  In the 
Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean region, we are trying to slow the process by 
developing our university as well as the colleges in Chicoutimi, 
Jonquière, Alma and Saint-Félicien.  We know full well that we have to 
offer a wide choice of education programs geared to the local job market 
and to regional development, in order to convince our young people they 
do not have to leave to study and to pursue a career. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been demonstrated that students who complete their studies 
and enjoy good employment opportunities in their region have a good 
chance of staying.  The association of alumni and friends of the 
University of Quebec in Chicoutimi offers scholarships to graduate and 
postgraduate students to encourage them to pursue their studies in the 
region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my region and in all of Quebec, we have been trying for a long 
time to promote access to higher education through a scholarships and 
loans program.  Also, by staying in their region students can save money 
by living at home with their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the federal government wants to meet the real needs of our young 
people, it should transfer the money to the Government of Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that the millennium scholarship fund proposed by the 
Chrétien government is out of touch with the Quebec reality, as are many 
other federal programs. In that area as in manpower training, the 
Government of Quebec must hold the levers of power to better meet the 
challenges of the next millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be said loud and clear: the millennium scholarships will 
not improve the quality of post-secondary education or substantially 
relieve the financial hardships of the students in our region. This 
misdirected program is a waste of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This $2.5 billion would have been better used if it had been handed 
over to the provinces, which are in a better position to know the 
education sector's priorities and needs. 
Moreover, these needs are being felt right now and will not appear only 
at the beginning of the next millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said previously, in cutting its transfers to the provinces, 
Ottawa struck a real blow at the funding of Quebec's educational 
institutions. Out of the $10 billion cut from education, $3 billion was 
in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sincerely believe that we in Quebec must focus our efforts on our 
education network, which was hard hit by these cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec loans and scholarships system is very efficient. This is 
certainly not the time to make financial assistance to students more 
complex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as he did with the reference to the Supreme Court, the Prime 
Minister could change his mind, review the millennium scholarships 
program and at least hand over management of this fund to those 
provinces that want it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the Prime Minister that he is the first and only Canadian 
Prime Minister to jump head first into education, an exclusively 
provincial jurisdiction. That is another action by the Chrétien 
government that will be remembered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask my colleagues opposite to think twice before they interfere 
again in this area, because they will face all Quebeckers early in the 
year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec population will not forget this new interference on the 
part of the federal government. There will be a final evaluation in the 
next referendum.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I enjoyed the remarks of the member for Jonquière.  I 
would like to ask her a hypothetical question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think she would agree that a national government has to be 
concerned about all Canadians even if she feels very strongly 
that her first allegiance is to the people of Quebec. 
Nevertheless a national government, as on this side of the House, 
has to be concerned about all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recent tests in science and mathematics conducted across the 
country disclosed that students in Quebec scored higher than the 
national average on mathematical and science questions.  Other 
provinces, particularly my own province of Ontario, scored very 
low. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it were turned around and Quebec students had scored very low 
as the result of governments of Quebec which had not paid enough 
attention to education whereas other provinces were much higher 
in the quality of education that the students were receiving, 
would it not be right and proper for the national government to 
want to intervene in order to ensure that those students in 
Quebec receive the same quality of education as was received 
elsewhere in the country? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my kind 
colleague for his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe he did not understand what I just said. I want to tell 
him that everything regarding education has always been well managed by 
Quebec and the provinces. What happened to education is that transfer 
payments to the provinces were cut. I said it before in my remarks. With 
its cuts to transfer payments the federal government made a mess of 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us decide what we want for our students. We want nothing but 
the best. We are parents and we are close to our children. We know what

I also listened to the comments.  I am absolutely astounded that 
the member spent all her time talking about jurisdictional 
authority and boasting how the provinces are the ones that are 
most aware of the needs of students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member may know that with regard to youth unemployment, 
university graduates in Canada under age 25 have an unemployment 
rate of about 6.5%.  University graduates in Canada as a whole 
have an unemployment rate of only about 4.5%.  High school 
graduates have an unemployment rate of about 15%, and high school 
dropouts have an unemployment rate in excess of 20% and in fact 
peaks at about 23%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Notwithstanding that this member suggested that the provinces 
know best how to deal with the needs of our students, this member 
probably does not know, but should know, that the dropout rate of 
students from high school in the province of Quebec is almost 
40%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member should also know that high school dropouts represent 
Canada's poor in waiting. These are the people who will be 
totally dependent on the rest of the taxpayers because they have 
not got the education they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member totally ignored the concept of accessibility of 
post-secondary education, which is the focus of the millennium 
scholarship fund.  It is not necessarily to provide assistance 
for existing educational programs or to provide financial 
assistance with student loans, et cetera.  It is to address the 
issue of accessibility for those students who are unable to take 
on any amount of financial responsibility but have the ability to 
attend post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the member whether or not she agrees that the issue 
of accessibility of education is also an important priority which 
any level of government should have in its portfolio. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold:</B> Madam Speaker, I believe the member 
misunderstood me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been saying since the beginning that education is an area of 
provincial jurisdiction. In the past few years, the government has had 
the nerve to cut transfer payments to the provinces for education to the 
tune of $3 billion to Quebec alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has the nerve to tell me “Would it not be right and 
proper for the national government—” Let us take care of our own, we 
know what our students want.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased to 
support the motion of my young colleague, the hon. member for 
Lac-Saint-Jean. It is all nice and dandy to have a debate, but we 
must deal with the issue. The motion reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House censure any action by the federal government in the 
area of education, such as the introduction of the Millennium 
Scholarships program or national testing. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is clear. That is what it says. Let me give you my 
reasons for supporting it. First, as everyone knows, the Millennium 
Scholarship Foundation, which will begin in the year 2000, is primarily 
designed to give visibility to the federal government in the year 2000. 
Federalists anticipate that a referendum could be held in Quebec that 
year, or the year after. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is trying to influence young Quebeckers, 
because it knows that the last time, polls conducted by the CEGEPs 
always showed that over 75% of young Quebeckers supported sovereignty. 
We are no fools: this is the real purpose of their millennium 
scholarship fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this opportunity to congratulate the hon. member for 
Lac-Saint-Jean for his motion, and the other young Bloc Quebecois

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have five young members who are doing a mighty fine job. All day 
long, they led the debate. Since other speakers were required, they had 
to call on some of us in our fifties. I feel comfortable participating 
in this debate because before the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Jean took 
over as the Bloc Quebecois critic on training and youth, it was my job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will remind the House that, in those days, 15,000 Quebec students 
had rallied on Parliament hill against the reform proposed by the then 
Minister of Human Resources Development. There were students from all 
parts of the country, but more than 10,000 were from Quebec. Why point 
this out? 
Because last night, on the news, I saw college students rallying in 
Quebec City because they are concerned about potential cuts—they have 
a budget to balance in Quebec too—in education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this opportunity today to say that cuts were made in 
education and health because cuts are required in Quebec like in every 
other province. Ask our colleagues from New Brunswick and western 
Canada. All the provinces have had to make cuts in education and health. 
Why? Because the federal government, which tried to cut $48 billion just 
before the election, eventually cut $42 billion through the Canada 
social transfer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does this Canada social transfer include? It has three 
components: social assistance, health and education. In education, $10 
billion was cut back. 
Quebec's share, on the basis of its student population, came to 
approximately $3 billion for that period. A $3 billion cut in education 
was imposed on Quebeckers. And this year, the Minister of Finance has 
the gall to establish a millennium scholarship fund and a foundation to 
administer it, spending $2.5 billion right now for this purpose. This 
amount is slightly lower than the cut made previously in Quebec in 
particular. And this is going on across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objective is to provide assistance to 100,000 students starting 
in the year 2000. This will mean assistance for about 24,000 students in 
Quebec. But there are currently more than 300,000 full time students 
enroled in university. Add part-time students and the total number of 
students in college and university rises to 500,000. What should be do 
about all those who will not benefit from the scholarships? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was listening earlier to the Minister of Human Resources 
Development. 
I know this is not one of the minister's idea, but rather a pipedream of 
the prime minister—who shall remain nameless—who woke up one night and 
wondered what he could do for students in the year 2000. He came up with 
this initiative, convinced that it would keep up his good image and 
reach the sovereignists among the students and manage to confuse them 
somewhat. It could work in some cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week, I went to visit the Sainte-Foy cegep in my riding, where 
I met students and realized that some of them are in fact confused. 
These young Quebeckers were wondering if, as sovereignists, they should 
turn down a grant if they were among the lucky ones to benefit from the 
millennium scholarship fund. I told them no, but do not let the federal 
government fool you and keep a critical mind. I know young Quebeckers 
have a critical mind. 
They know how to read, they are educated and intelligent. They will not 
be fooled by this razzle-dazzle federalists are using to fool them and 
get them on their side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his speech today, the minister of Human Resources Development 
said that Quebec stands to lose its current structures, even though they 
are the best in Canada, Quebec students carrying half the debt load of 
the students in the rest of the country. Quebec is the only province to 
provide grants to 70,000 students for an average of around $3,800. No 
other province does it. The debt level is lower and the Quebec system is 
recognized as offering good financial assistance.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But now, since only about 6 per cent of students across Canada will 
benefit from the program, they want to leave it to Quebec, and maybe to 
the other provinces as well, to decide who will get a scholarship and 
who will not, because the number of scholarships will be limited to 
3,000. Millennium goodies. They want Quebec to get on board so it can 
get blamed by those who will not get a scholarship, while the federal 
government will enjoy greater visibility among those who do get one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No, the people of Quebec will not be deceived by this new attempt. 
They will not respond to the fantasies of the present Prime Minister, 
who at the same time follows plan A by distributing millennium 
scholarships or, with regard to regional development, by continuing to 
issue grants or loans to Quebec small businesses without consulting 
regional councils or taking their strategic plans into account, always 
with a view to promoting the maple leaf among Quebec people and 
businesses in order to obtain their political support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As long as Quebec remains a part of the Canadian system, we will 
ask for our fair share. Yes, we will accept financial aid coming from 
Ottawa because we pay for it. We pay our share of taxes, and as long as 
we continue to do so, we will demand programs, even those we criticize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember criticizing Youth Service Canada at the time of the 
referendum, and the Minister of Human Resources Development then told 
me: “Yes, but why is the member for Lévis criticizing a program which 
benefited an agency in his riding”? Yes, we must accept this system, 
even though it creates duplication, even though it competes with the 
provincial systems and does not respect Quebec's people and their 
convictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we so protective of our education system? It is a question 
of language. What do we teach in our schools? We teach the Civil Code 
and different traditions. In spite of the goodwill of some of the 
members across the way, they are not listening, they do not understand 
that we are different. We may not be unique, but we are different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not only a question of provincial jurisdiction. It is about 
respect for Quebec's distinctiveness, which they never accepted and are 
now trying to submerge with little flags, with stunts such as the one 
that occurred on February 26, and by issuing checks to about 24,000 
young students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to

Speaker, I listened with great interest to the member's remarks. 
I am quite willing to agree that the French culture in Quebec is 
a very important and different part of Canada, something we would 
want to cherish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope he will agree that a university education is more than 
the French language and more than learning about the civil code. 
A university education is about learning the sciences, medicine, 
history and all kinds of disciplines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the problems with Quebec's situation with respect to 
grants to students is that these grants are basically exclusive 
only to Quebec.  It keeps students in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would he agree that the millennium fund and all the money that 
it gives to students will give opportunity for young Quebeckers 
to go to universities of their choice, not only in Canada, but 
elsewhere in North America?  It will underwrite at least some of 
their educational costs.  They will benefit from the experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not a good thing to give young Quebeckers the opportunity 
to broaden their minds by experiences elsewhere in the country?

understand very quickly that we are different.  It is true that 
medicine is science.  In that regard, it is the same science. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He would also see that a good Quebec doctor recognizes 
Quebeckers' health problems are not the same as those of other 
people elsewhere.  That is an everyday occurrence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Culture is not about language and the civil code.  He is right 
on that.  I remember Guy Rocher, who said “Culture is a way of 
thinking, feeling and acting”.  I watch my colleague from 
Repentigny, who speaks on foreign affairs and trade.  Business is 
handled differently in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not abnormal.  The Japanese are like that.  It is true 
for people in business, or other sectors.  Our country and our 
culture make us different.  We must honour that.

continue to be different because we want to be and not because we 
detest others. 
It is not that we do not want to get along with others. We simply 
want them to respect us as we are, just as we are ready to respect 
you as you are.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I congratulate 
my colleague for his speech. He clearly showed that this is an 
unwarranted interference of the Liberal government in the areas of 
jurisdiction of the provinces, namely those of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind my colleague of the fact that the Liberal 
Party opposite is not the only one to interfere in the areas of 
provincial jurisdiction. The Conservative Party does it too. I will 
quote from the plan of the Conservative Party on page 33: “A Jean 
Charest Government will help ensure that all Canadian youth receive the 
basic knowledge and skills they need for their futures by instituting a 
Canadian Education Excellence Fund”. I repeat: “A Canadian Education 
Excellence Fund”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does my colleague agree that the Liberal Party is not the only one 
to interfere in areas of provincial jurisdiction, but that the 
Conservative Party and the whole federal system are doing it too? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</B> Madam Speaker, I will take a few

Lac-Saint-Jean also deals with national testing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I fulfilled the responsibilities now held by my colleague, the 
hon. member for Lac-Saint-Jean, we fought very hard against national 
standards. I have a lot of respect for the New Democratic Party, but the 
NDP members then supported the national standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is how the Bloc Quebecois differs from the other parties.

one in Quebec, and one elsewhere in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government thinks otherwise. We strongly believe that we have 
a role to play, as we have been doing for many decades, in educating and 
helping young Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the year 2000 draws near, various countries are looking at 
different ways to celebrate and mark the beginning of the new 
millennium.  To give one example, the city of London, England, is 
looking at ways to celebrate their event and is considering 
building a dome at the cost of several hundred thousand dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government, on the other hand, has taken a different 
approach.  We have decided to invest in the future of our country 
by giving young Canadians the opportunity to achieve their full 
potential through access to training to meet the ever more 
challenging demands of the next millennium.  This is something 
that the Bloc Quebecois have a hard time understanding. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nowadays, we are facing a most formidable challenge which we cannot 
avoid: competitiveness. Given the global economy, all workers must be 
highly skilled, because only those who can produce faster, better and 
cheaper have access to the markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opening of borders, or even their gradual elimination, created 
a whole new attitude toward trade that industrialized countries must 
deal with. We believe that we must rely on the creativity, the 
imagination and the innovation of young Canadians to continue to carve 
out an enviable position in the knowledge-based economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Traditionally based on the development of natural resources, 
Canada's economy now depends increasingly on knowledge rather than 
resources. That is how we will be able to help create stimulating and 
well paid jobs for young Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada has a responsibility to support and 
encourage those who want to participate fully in the new economic, 
cultural and social environment in which we will be living from now on. 
That is what we undertook to do, and the Canada millennium scholarship 
foundation is one of the ways Canada can face up to this great 
challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bloc members, especially the member who moved the motion, are again 
making a mistake they made repeatedly in the past. They confuse access 
to education and education itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The role of the Canada millennium scholarship foundation will be to 
eliminate the obstacles limiting access to post-secondary education or 
to training in advanced technology, which are essential to get a good 
job in the new economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nowhere is it mentioned that the foundation will interfere in 
education programs. As the Bloc members say, we know that education is 
a provincial responsibility, and the foundation's vocation fully 
respects this fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, for decades, the Canadian government has been playing a 
role in the area of financial assistance for students, because it 
strongly believes that access to education must be enhanced through a 
concerted effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Preparing young Canadians to enter the new economy is a collective 
responsibility. 
This is not the prerogative of any level of government and should not be 
the subject of the narrow dogmatism which too often characterizes the 
Bloc's actions, as is obvious in the motion before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course education is a provincial jurisdiction. Programs as well 
as institutions and the quality of the teaching fall within the domain 
of the provinces. However, federal and provincial governments alike have 
long been working to promote equal opportunity by supporting the people 
who cannot afford to pursue their academic training. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has that system served us badly so far? I do not think so. Canada 
has already undertaken to address the challenge of globalization and its 
efforts have been quite successful. Last year, Canada ranked fourth out 
of 35 countries for its competitiveness, according to the World Economic 
Forum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, several factors contribute to such a performance, but 
the quality of our manpower training plays a very major role. The 
establishment of the millennium scholarship fund does not change 
anything in the workings of the present system and, contrary to what the 
Bloc Quebecois always claims, it does not encroach in any way on 
provincial jurisdictions.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The role of the federal government in this dates back to the 
post-war years, not February 24, 1998, the date of the last budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Minister of Finance has clearly explained, the Canadian 
Millennium Scholarship Foundation will be an entity at arms-length 
from the federal government.  It will be administered by a board 
made up of members from the private sector and including one 
student.  The Council of Ministers of Education, representing the 
provincial governments, will also be involved in the selection of 
directors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes without saying that the foundation will consult 
closely with the provincial governments. 
What is more, the post-secondary sector will also be involved in 
designing and awarding the Canadian Millennium Scholarships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will recall the Minister of Finance placed particular 
emphasis on the federal government's desire to avoid duplication in 
this area.  We have done this continually for more than four years 
in other areas, and will continue to do so. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will also remember the reaction of the Quebec minister of 
finance to the tabling of the last budget.  As he did last year, 
Mr. Landry accused us of practising predatory federalism.  Always 
given to verbal exaggeration, he added another adjective, 
abusive.  His words predator and abusive may have rhymed in 
French but they are really a joke.  The words he uses to describe 
the budget and the millennium fund are frankly laughable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to that same minister of finance, this was a budget of 
a unitary state which completely discards federal structures.  I 
wonder if we can consider him to be serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no federation in the world where the central government 
does not play a role in financial assistance for students.  For 
example, in the United States of America 75% of public 
scholarships and bursaries for students come from federal 
government assistance.  In Germany 65% of publicly funded 
bursaries and scholarships are federal.  What is more, in both of 
these countries the central government plays an even more direct 
role in education.  That would never be the case in Canada, since 
we understand that this is a field of exclusive provincial 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All governments are called on to play a role in this field. 
It is crucial to the future of our children and our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not really surprise me that Bloc Quebecois members 
cannot understand that.  That they have presented this motion 
today surprises me even less.  If it suits them, the Bloc and 
their PQ head office do not hesitate to denounce supposed 
predatory federalism.  However, when the PQ government accepts 
hundreds of millions of dollars from our government to pay for 
damage caused by the ice storm, the adjectives are different. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alain Dubuc put the real question as follows in <I>La Presse</I>, and 
I would like to quote him because it is an excellent summary of our 
position.  He writes: “Can Quebec, which has no economic strategy, 
logically, just for the sake of being different, refuse a project 
expressing in a dynamic way the importance of university education 
and knowledge?  One suspects that the main fault in the federal 
project lies in it being just that: federal”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that Quebec's young people share the same 
aspirations as young people anywhere else in Canada.  They want to 
achieve their full potential in order to take an active part in 
improving society.  Let us not saddle them with our own 
limitations, our old quarrels; let us instead encourage them to 
equip themselves to build a better future.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I have a

so forth.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He seems to have forgetten some of his history, which is still 
relatively recent. It goes back to 1964 when the federal government gave 
Quebec the option to opt out. In those days, the federal government's 
trust in Quebeckers, their administrators and democratically elected 
representatives was greater, since it allowed Quebec to have the money 
it wanted and which was Quebec's anyhow—it is our own tax money—to be 
administered in Quebec. The federal government had been trusting us 
since around 1964. These Liberals were elected five years ago and they 
have been trusting the Quebec government since then with this opting out 
clause under which they hand over the money to Quebec to be used for 
loans and bursaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Loans and bursaries are granted on the basis of family income. This 
is equal opportunity: if a family is unfortunate enough to have a low 
income it will not be penalized when it comes to sending its children to 
university or cegep because it can avail itself of the loans and 
bursaries program made possible in part through the opting out clause 
given to us by the federal government in 1964. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After 34 years of sound management and solid infrastructure put in 
place by the managers of the Quebec loans and bursaries program, what we 
are asking is for the millennium scholarship program to be transferred 
to Quebec under the opting out clause in order to improve our loans and 
bursaries program in keeping with our philosophy, which is to help 
Quebec students, not according to how many <I>A</I>'s and <I>B</I>'s they have on 
their report cards, but according to their family income, as we are 
doing now, giving them equal opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are asking regarding the millennium scholarship program is 
to follow the same principle we have been following for 34 years and 
apply the same opting out formula to the amount as before. If the 
position of the federal government, which knows how to spend money, is 
the same as the member for Bourassa, who said he did not trust Mrs. 
Marois and democratically elected representatives in Quebec, it should 
have the honesty to say so. Otherwise it should explain to us why it is 
questioning a formula which has been working for 34 years. This is my 
question to the member from Vaudreuil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nick Discepola:</B> Madam Speaker, we really see the politics 
behind the motion. We really see the concerns of that political party. 
For these members, the issue is not concern for the future of young 
people, but instead the opportunity, and I have seen this in the last 
four years, to fan the flames of some so-called federal-provincial 
squabbles. I wonder whether they are more concerned about the future of 
young people than about receiving the money to help them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The program put forward, as has already been the case for the last 
30 or 40 years, is not a matter of federal or provincial jurisdiction. 
We are not intruding in the administration; we are not telling a 
province which education programs it has to implement and which books it 
has to buy. 
The millennium fund is aimed at giving a better future to young people. 
It gives them the opportunity to pursue post-secondary studies to better 
prepare their future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Bloc Quebecois members are really concerned about the future of 
young people, they will have to do what was done in the past, that is 
co-operate with the federal government, and we will be able to agree on 
the process and the administration. The Canada students assistance plan 
is already working well in Quebec. Quebec is managing it and, in the 
other provinces, it is the federal government that deals with it. There 
are other examples. With regard to the GST, we have administrative 
agreements with the provinces. Therefore, if they are really concerned, 
they should think about the future of young people instead of the future 
of separatists.

with a high school education or less dropped by two million but 
more than five million jobs were created for those with higher 
qualifications.  Not all Canadians are in a position to easily 
access the knowledge and skills they will need throughout their 
lifetime to find and keep the jobs in a very different and 
changing labour market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Barriers, most often financial, reduce access to post-secondary 
education for many of our students across this country.  While 
the government cannot ensure that every Canadian will succeed, 
the government can enhance the equality of opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what our government has done in the 1998 budget.  It has 
introduced a Canadian opportunity strategy which builds on 
actions in the 1996 and 1997 budgets and it also introduces 
historic new measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The costs of post-secondary education have risen dramatically 
over the past 10 years.  Tuition fees and other student costs 
have more than doubled and those with low and middle incomes 
often face a difficult choice, the no win situation of forget 
higher education or incur onerous student debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is no win for both the individual Canadians facing this 
dilemma and for Canada's economic future.  The Canadian 
millennium scholarships are the centrepiece of the Canadian 
opportunities strategy.  They are the single largest investment 
ever made by the federal government to support access to 
post-secondary institutions for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through an initial endowment of $2.5 billion the arm's length 
Canada millennium scholarship foundation will provide 
scholarships to over 100,000 students each year over the next 10 
years.  Scholarships will go to Canadians who need help financing 
their studies and who demonstrate merit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For full time students scholarships will average $3,000 a year 
and individuals can receive up to $15,000 over a maximum of four 
academic years.  The Canada millennium scholarships could reduce 
the debtload that recipients would otherwise face by over half. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians of all ages, full or part time, studying in publicly 
funded universities, community colleges, vocational and technical 
institutes and CGEPs will be eligible for the scholarships.  The 
foundation will begin to award these scholarships in the year 
2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is also introducing Canada study grants.  These 
recognize that many student needs are not fully met by 
scholarships and student loans.  Beginning in 1998-99 Canada 
student grants of up to $3,000 a year will go to over 25,000 
needy students who have children or other dependants. These 
grants will help fund both full and part time students and will 
cost $100 million annually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing is more critical to Canada's economic successes in the 
21st century than vigorous, broad based research and development. 
I am a firm believer for all types of R and D in Canada, both 
basic and applied science. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To support graduate students and researchers as they develop the 
leading edge skills needed in a knowledge based economy we will 
increase funding to the three granting councils to provide 
research grants, scholarships and fellowships.  Over the next 
three years their combined budget of $766 million in 1997-98 will 
be increased by over $400 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the end of the year 2000-2001, the council budgets, I am 
happy to say, will be at their highest level in Canadian history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Student debt has become a heavy burden for many Canadians.  In 
1990 a graduate completing four years of post-secondary education 
faced an average student debtload of about $13,000.  By next year 
the same graduate's average debt will almost double to $25,000. 
At the beginning of this decade less than 8% of student borrowers 
had debts larger than $15,000.  Today and in the near future 
almost 40% do.  That is a heavy load to carry into your future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last December federal and provincial first ministers agreed 
something must be done to reduce the financial burden of 
students.  They asked the federal government to take action in 
the 1998 budget and we did. I must say that the universities and 
colleges in London, Ontario are very grateful that we have, and I 
know parents of future students are very grateful. 
Down the road, all Canadians will benefit from these highly 
skilled people.

</I></B></P><P align=left>First, students will get tax relief.  There will be a 17% 
federal credit for interest paid on the student loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we are increasing the income threshold used to qualify 
for interest relief on Canada student loans by 9% and more 
graduates will be eligible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, we are introducing graduated interest relief which will 
extend assistance to more graduates further up the income scale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, for individuals who have used 30 months of interest 
relief, we will ask the lending institutions to extend the loan 
repayment period to 15 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, if after extending the repayment period to 15 years a 
borrower remains in financial difficulty, there will be an 
extended interest relief period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, for the minority of graduates who still remain in 
financial difficulties after taking advantage of these relief 
measures, we will reduce their student loan principle by as much 
as half. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Together, these new interest relief measures will help up to 
100,000 more borrowers and over 12,000 borrowers a year will 
benefit from debt reduction when this measure is fully phased in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To keep their job or to get a new one, many Canadians who are 
already in the workforce may want to take time off from work to 
upgrade their skills through full time study but often lack the 
resources to do so.  Several new measures will improve Canadians' 
access to learning throughout their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will start with at least six million Canadians who have RRSPs 
with total assets of $200 billion.  To those people looking to 
further their education, this represents an important source of 
their funds.  Beginning on January 1, 1999 Canadians will be able 
to make tax free withdrawals from their RRSPs for lifelong 
learning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An individual who has an RRSP and is enrolled in full time 
training or higher education for at least three months during the 
year will be eligible.  Individuals will be able to withdraw up 
to $10,000 a year tax free over a period of four years to a 
maximum of $20,000.  To preserve the role of RRSPs in providing 
retirement income, the amounts withdrawn will have to be repaid 
over a 10-year period.  In many respects, this plan resembles the 
home buyers plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The need to continually upgrade knowledge and skills can be 
particularly hard for the growing number of Canadians studying 
part time and trying to manage the difficult balance of work, 
family and study.  We are proposing two new measures to help 
those people.  Beginning in 1998, the education credit will be 
extended to part time students.  They will be able to claim $60 
for each month they were enrolled in a course lasting at least 
three weeks and including a minimum of 12 hours of course work 
per month.  The measure will benefit up to 250,000 Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, for the first time, parents studying part time will 
now be able to deduct their child care expenses.  I think this is 
important.  There are certain limits but it is important because 
previously only full time students were eligible to do this. This 
measure itself will benefit some 50,000 part time students with 
children.  Any long range plan to acquire knowledge and skills 
for the 21st century must look ahead to the students of tomorrow 
and the best way to help those children's futures is to save for 
their education today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we have registered education savings plan 
contributions for children up to the age of 18 to a maximum grant 
of 20% on the first $2,000 in annual RRSPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that I have limited time left.  This budget 
deals with youth employment and offers $250 million over three 
years for information technology—

set of tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a debate about education.  It is a debate for all 
Canadians across Canada who have to understand the tools now 
available to them through the budget.  There will be the 
millennium scholarship plan.  There are also all the other 
measures in the budget.  All of them are equally important and 
will provide access to education to those students in Quebec who 
maybe are not going to hear about it from their representatives 
sitting here who want to talk solely about what will happen in 
the year 2000 with our millennium scholarship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am here to say I am happy that students of Quebec and students

<P><A NAME="LINK234"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, it 
will be difficult to comment.  I feel as though I have listened to 
a budget speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I am going to speak about all sorts of things.  I 
have the impression that members speak but do not listen.  I do not 
know.  There is much talk, but it looks like people are trying to 
paint the members on this side of the House as the bad guys.  They 
say:  “Heavens, Bloc members do not seem to think education is 
important”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some things we can talk about, but we must be 
specific. 
I want to emphasize that the Bloc Quebecois also thinks education 
is a key sector, one in which we must invest, and I cannot say so 
often enough.  If we want a qualified workforce and people who are 
not ignorant, and so on, if we want a strong society, we have to 
start with access to education.  That is the first step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree on that.  Yes, some good points have been made by the 
members across the way and we agree fully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am fed up.  We have heard this all day; we have been accused 
of not thinking that student indebtedness is important.  We have 
even been accused of not caring about the future of young people. 
If there is one person concerned about the future of young people, 
I think I qualify. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We covered a lot of things.  What we want to say today is not 
that students should not receive assistance.  It is the form the 
assistance takes. 
It is the relevancy of providing assistance and the best way of 
providing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I made the point again today: the taxpayers already pay enough 
taxes, and probably much more than enough. They hope that the best use 
possible will be made of every tax dollar. When the federal government 
cuts $10 billion with one hand and gives back 25% of this amount—they 
call this an investment, but one might call it spending—with the other 
hand, I cannot help but wonder where the other 75% of the money went and 
if it went into fighting the deficit. These are the type of questions I 
ask myself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other aspects which I feel were only briefly touched on. 
My hon. colleague did not even address today's motion. Another important 
aspect is the fact that the scholarship will be handled by a private 
organization. 
What is the use of having elected members here if, when there are 
complaints about the work done by the administrators, we are going to be 
told “Look, we cannot do anything about it. This is a private 
organization”. Some democracy. Why bother electing members? Universities 
are in the process of being privatized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are immediate comments, but I will have more to make later. 
I could go on for an hour. However, at the request of our colleague 
across the way, I will give the hon. member opposite the opportunity to 
reply. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes:</B>  Madam Speaker, he doth protest too much. 
Honestly, when hon. members on the other side of the House get to 
choose the subject and choose to talk about education and 
scholarships, I am going to canvass the subject.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have just had an excellent budget.  In that budget there were 
excellent avenues for people across this country to not only save 
for education for their children but to access it, and if they 
are a part time or full time student, to access finances and get 
relief.  There was opportunity for lifelong learning through the 
registered education savings plan.  There are going to be the 
biggest investments ever by a federal government in the 
post-secondary educational system.  It is wonderful for 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it perplexing that anybody could be so upset when the 
students in their riding are going to have the benefits of this. 
I am very glad that we are here as a government to assist those 
students.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, NDP):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I must unfortunately say that I cannot support the Bloc Quebecois' 
motion. I will explain why. For us, national programs are very important 
and we have our reasons to care about them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must think about the regions that need help. People pay taxes 
and the federal government must be there to help them when necessary. 
I believe it is important to maintain transfer payments. But the money 
must be put back in the education system, so that young people will not, 
as is often the case now in our country, stop their education because 
they cannot afford post-secondary studies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young people, the lucky ones who have the means to go to 
university, can do so, as well as those who can borrow money, but they 
end up $25,000 in debt. There are graduates in my riding who owe $31,000 
and $51,000. How can we expect them to succeed on the job market? You 
have a hard time job-wise when you are saddled with a $51,000 debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>National programs definitely need to be maintained. One should not 
assume they are there. 
These programs must be maintained. It is unfortunate that we have a 
government which, in recent years, decided that post-secondary education 
was not very important for low income Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And the war goes on. As regards social programs, there is a 
two-tier system not only in education but also in the health care 
sector. Already, there are many medical programs and services 
that used to be free, but for which we must now pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are waiting lists for day surgery hospital beds, which are 
not really used for that purpose. People who can afford to pay to remain 
in hospital can stay, while those who cannot must leave. Often women 
must stay home to take care of those who were not ready to leave the 
hospital. That is why national programs are there, to provide the same 
opportunities to all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very proud to be Canadian. Coming from a relatively poor 
family, I must say that I wonder sometimes if the poor are considered as 
Canadian as the wealthy in this country. Considering the direction in 
which the Liberal government is going, it is very clear that the less 
fortunate in this country do not have equal access to social programs 
and are not treated as they should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same thing applies to those on welfare. We have national 
programs and we should keep them. We have people who have no job and are 
unable to find one. We have a government that is not interested in 
creating jobs, and now it is taking away the only thing these people 
have left, the social programs. This must stop. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new millennium fund outlined in the recent budget 
illustrates the federal government's failure to recognize the 
value of education and its failure to consult with student groups 
and the provinces to develop realistic, workable solutions to 
barriers in education.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Student debt has increased. Personal bankrupcies among students 
have increased by 700% between 1989 and 1997. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Twenty-five per cent of all bankruptcies were the result of 
student loans.  As at the end of 1997 there were $37,000 bankrupt 
graduates.  In the recent budget the number of bankruptcies of

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see a lot of students who cannot repay their student loans. In 
my riding, I could have two full time employees just to deal with that. 
Students are being harrassed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Students cannot find jobs. These people who can only find part time 
jobs or seasonal jobs in areas where such jobs exist are asked to make 
monthly payments of $200, $300 or $400, and some of them cannot find any 
job at all. They are getting telephone calls from financial institutions 
that want their money. These institutions show no mercy. And students 
are scared of personal bankrupcies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We often hear people say that young people abuse the system, that 
they go to university and then declare personal bankruptcy. In any 
program, there will always be people who abuse. That has always been my 
position. But nobody should believe that most students who graduate 
intend to declare bankruptcy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young people come to my office. They may not be so young any more, 
because they have graduated five, six or seven years ago, and still do 
not have a job. The last thing you can tell them is that there are no 
jobs, that they must pay $400 a month, that there is no money coming in 
and that it is their option. They do not have any choice, really. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of providing real assistance to reduce student debt and 
increase accessibility, the budget actually included measures to 
make things harder for students in debt.  The Liberals have now 
extended the period for which student loans survive bankruptcy 
from two years to ten years.  The budget included measures to 
deal with students with severe credit abuse. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>]

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two years after the Liberals announced their youth employment 
strategy, 48,000 fewer young people are working. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The youth unemployment rate stands at 16.5%. Tuition has gone up 
41% since 1992. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I graduated from college in 1980, my debt load was less than 
$3,000. I was able to pay it off and I even found a job. Right now, dome 
students end up with huge debt loads, no future, and no job in sight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should take a look at what is going on in education. A company 
in the Halifax area is paying a headhunter to find skilled workers, 
because it cannot find people with the proper training. This is a real 
problem, and we should be realist about it. There is no strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes, when I meet with small business people, I ask them: 
“When you are looking to hire, is there some communication between 
departments to make sure that if job opportunities exist and if jobs are 
created locally, there will be properly trained people to take up these 
jobs?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With millions of unemployed Canadians, how can it be that 20,000

I am disappointed by the speech the hon. member made today. She just 
praised the national strategies where the federal government is meddling 
in provincial areas of jurisdiction and seems to approve the millennium 
scholarship fund announced recently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a very simple question to put to her about the criteria on 
which the grants will be allocated, mainly income and merit. As a 
progressive member, who also believes in equal opportunity and access to 
university, does she think the merit principle will make university more 
accessible to all young Canadians and especially young Quebecers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour:</B> Madam Speaker, I agree with my colleague, 
scholarships should not be granted on the basis of excellence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I must add that the millennium scholarships are for the year 
2000. If we admit that students have a problem today, these scholarships 
should be awarded right away. If a young student is having a hard time 
right now to finance his education or to access post-secondary 
education, this will not help him in any way. I have checked with young 
people, and they say this will be of no help whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I got scholarships back in 1978 is that I came from a 
poor family and I did not have any money. It is ridiculous even to think 
we should help students whose parents can pay for their post-secondary 
education. These scholarships should help reduce the gap between people 
in need, and people who need no help.

my colleague just said.  He said that he disagreed with the NDP member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing is certain, she spoke from the heart.  I believe she made 
the kind of speech we do not hear enough of here.  She lives in an area 
where there may well be more poverty than elsewhere in Canada, and 
perhaps she cannot accept it because she sees it so closely.  I feel 
that there is a serious problem in this House, and when she talks about 
it, she speaks from the heart, with great feeling.  I think we should 
hear more speeches like that in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We seem to be accepting the fact that to be a productive society we 
also have to have a certain level of poverty, that to be a productive 
society we have to let our children live in poverty, that we have to let 
child poverty grow and that there is nothing we can do about it. I 
remind the House that four years ago, there were 1 million children

I cannot be unmoved.  Yes, we have some differences of opinions on

the Bloc for his kind words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You might say he hit the nail on the head.  It is true that I 
do not necessarily project the image of a politician.  My 
background certainly did not prepare me to be one, but I must say 
I am certainly as well qualified as any to represent the people of 
my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who elected me are people who have needs, who need 
national programs, who need help. They count on me to see to it 
that programs are maintained.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I concur with my colleague that the motion needs to be 
reconsidered.  There is no national vision of education.  The 
federal government has devolved its constitutional 
responsibilities to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province of Saskatchewan guarantees in the education act to 
teach our children until they are 21 years old.  However, if they 
happen to graduate from high school at 17 or 18 years old, that 
funding or support stops.  It should not stop when they receive 
their high school diplomas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The guarantee to 21 years of age should be taken literally for 
all young Canadians.  They should be guaranteed a state paid 
education until they are 21.  If the provincial education 
jurisdictions receive funding through federal government 
transfers, it could be made available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the educational journey.  At the secondary school 
level our children are just starting to be prepared in terms of 
their world view of their education and career journeys.  We can 
look at an education in trades or in university.  A bachelor 
degree is the result of a student being tested on what is being 
taught by the institution.  At the masters and doctoral levels 
individuals begin to develop original thought.  Journeymen, 
craftsmen and artists who study their trade or crafts can excel 
at higher levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After children leave high school they need guidance.  I would 
like to share my vision of the guidance given by aboriginals to 
their children.  It was a vision of sharing the land of Canada. 
They guaranteed the educational rights of their children.  That 
is what we should do for all Canadians, guarantee the educational 
rights of all our children.  This is a national vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Rosemont mentioned that the millennium fund 
could be a step toward privatization.  It is unfortunate but 
true.  We have local school boards and boards of governors 
representing the views of communities all over Canada, and they 
give the responsibility to a chief executive officer of Chrysler. 
That is not a vision of education.  That is industrialization and 
privatization of education.  It should be given to our 
communities.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>OBSERVANCE OF TWO MINUTES OF SILENCE ON REMEMBRANCE DAY ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK242">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK243"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.)</B> moved that Bill 
C-279, an act to promote the observance of two minutes of silence 
on Remembrance Day, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to 
rise to speak to Bill C-279, an act to promote the observance of 
two minutes of silence on Remembrance Day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise to speak to this bill with a heavy heart.  Many Canadians 
and parliamentarians will ask why it is necessary for this place 
to consider a bill to formalize what is regarded as a widespread 
and widely accepted custom, namely the observance of moments of 
silence on November 11, a custom which originated in the British 
empire and was then adopted by the Commonwealth since Armistice 
Day which marks the ending of the first and great war in 1918. 
The reason I bring forward this bill is precisely that custom, 
which is so deeply entrenched in our history, is increasingly 
falling out of practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not to exaggerate for one to say that many young Canadians 
have become disconnected from our history, from our traditions 
and, in particular, from a proper appreciation of the enormous 
sacrifices made by our war dead in the two great wars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an observation that I draw not only from anecdotal 
evidence which I suppose any member of this place may be aware 
of.  One might easily be aware of the growing degree to which 
people are not taught about the great military history of this 
country and of the enormity of the sacrifices made by our war 
generations. It is not simply an anecdotal observation, it is 
borne out by recent public opinion research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, what led me to consider introducing this bill was a 
recent public opinion survey conducted by a new research 
institute called the Dominion Institute.  It recently asked young 
Canadians a number of questions about Canadian history.  They 
were rather simple and straightforward questions.  The questions 
were what we would assume would be absolutely essential to any 
kind of historic and cultural literacy about this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the poll found, among other things, was that among young 
Canadians, teenagers and those in their early twenties, 64% did 
not know the name of our first prime minister.  Only 15% knew 
when our Constitution was repatriated from Great Britain.  When 
asked to name two countries which Canada fought against in the 
first world war, 39% guessed France and Britain.  One in ten had 
no answer at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they were asked questions about the interment of Japanese 
Canadians in the second world war, 68% had no knowledge of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The results were shocking.  Sixty-five per cent did now know 
what D-Day stands for.  Only 35% of young Canadians know that it 
stands for the invasion of Europe at the end of the second world 
war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sixty-nine per cent of young Canadians did not know that the 
battle of Vimy took place in the first world war.  That was 
perhaps the most important battle in the great and glorious 
military history of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sixty-seven per cent of young Canadians surveyed by the Dominion 
Institute did not know which war Remembrance Day marks the end 
of.

<A HREF="#LINKT90"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, we have allowed a creeping ignorance to develop 
not only in young Canadians but I would argue within our 
citizenry as a whole about the enormity of the sacrifices made 
and the central importance of our military history.  It is for 
that reason that I have brought forward this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Dominion Institute suggested, among other things, that one 
of the remedies that could be found to increase an understanding 
and appreciation of our military history would be to formalize 
the increasingly disrespected custom of the solemn silence on 
Remembrance Day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many Canadian schools, in many Canadian workplaces, in many 
retail shopping malls, in many public spaces, in many public 
squares of Canada, one can pass by the 11th hour of the 11th day 
of the 11th month with the normal hubbub of human activity with 
hardly a moment's notice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadians, many tens of thousands of Canadians, recognize 
Remembrance Day.  They gather around the cenotaphs and memorials. 
They gather at the Legion halls in their communities across this 
country.  They remember and they stop for a moment of silence to 
pay tribute to their war dead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, many millions more do not pay that tribute.  If we owe 
one thing to those who died for this country and for our freedom, 
it is to remember them.  It is to remember the struggles in which 
they fought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was also moved to bring this bill when thinking about a recent 
experience I had shortly before Remembrance Day last year.  I was 
at the Lester Pearson airport in Toronto and observed at the 
entrance to the security area of the airport a elderly veteran 
with his Legion hat and poppy.  He was trying to offer poppies to 
passers-by, to travellers entering the security area of the 
airport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I watched this man who must have been in his early eighties who 
likely fought in the second world war.  He stood there with a 
forlorn expression on his face for some time because traveller 
after traveller passed him by and did not even acknowledge this 
man, this hero of the second world war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stood and watched for several minutes.  Not a single person 
approached him, regarded him, commended him or spoke to him.  Not 
a single person bothered to stop and take a poppy from him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It brought me great sadness to think about what must have passed 
through this man's mind as he saw these busy travellers, business 
people, Canadians all, none of whom seemed to even have a 
moment's notice for him and the sacrifice he and the poppy 
represented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I think we must make, in this country, a concerted 
effort to pay proper respect to our war dead, to revive the 
tradition of a fulsome national commemoration of Remembrance Day 
which was really a moment in years past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shortly after the second world war this entire country and every 
other country in the British empire, now the Commonwealth, would 
stop in their tracks at 11 o'clock on Remembrance Day.  Every 
business place would shut down.  Factories would stop their 
equipment.  Cars would pull to the side of the road.  Local and 
national broadcasters would cease broadcasting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every place one went there would be a remarkable national 
silence not just around the cenotaphs in the various communities 
but in every place where Canadians were; in private or in public 
this sacred moment of observance was respected.

<A HREF="#LINKT91"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this bill, I hope this Parliament will begin to call on all 
Canadians to respect once more that tradition in a way that it 
deserves to be respected.  I also bring forward this bill as part 
of a growing concern among not only Canadians but our friends in 
Great Britain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two years ago the British Westminster Parliament, our mother 
Parliament, passed a motion which was very similar to my private 
member's bill as part of a major national campaign launched by 
the Royal Legion to increase in a dramatic way the observance of 
what is known there as Armistice Day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Royal Canadian Legion has launched a similar campaign.  It 
has called on the federal government to help sponsor a two minute 
wave of silence that will sweep across the country at 11 o'clock 
on November 11 beginning on Remembrance Day 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Royal Canadian Legion, on behalf of its 533,000 members, has 
therefore endorsed this bill and urged this House to pass it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently the provincial legislature of Ontario passed a private 
member's bill sponsored by Mr. Morley Kells, MPP, bill 112, which 
is almost identical to the bill before us.  This bill from the 
Ontario legislature received royal assent in October. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this bill would seek to do is not require anything of 
Canadians, not coerce them or create a new government program or 
bureaucracy but simply to invite and encourage them on behalf of 
our war dead, in expressing our gratitude to the many dedicated 
men and women who bravely and unselfishly gave their lives for 
Canada, to stop for two minutes and observe the silence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill provides a number of practical suggestions as to how 
this might be done, by participating in the traditional 
Remembrance Day commemoration at a memorial or cenotaph, by 
pulling to the side of the road if they are driving, by gathering 
in common areas in their workplaces to observe the silence, to 
stop assembly lines where possible, to shut down factories for 
two minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have recently read stories in the newspapers about how unions 
and employers have struck agreements to continue working through 
Remembrance Day and to no longer respect it as a statutory 
holiday let alone a moment of silence.  It encourages schools, 
colleges, universities and other public institutions to observe 
the silence and it encourages Canadians to attend services held 
in places of worship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is a very simple one.  Some might say it is merely a 
symbolic thing and that it is not our business to be involved in 
encouraging respect for symbols.  However, in observing the 
current controversy we are experiencing with respect to the 
Canadian flag and its place in this House and in this country, we 
can see how enormously powerful symbols really are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For that reason I call on all my colleagues and all Canadians 
not to be flippant about symbols such as this but to consider the 
need to increase and deepen the understanding of the sacrifice 
represented by Remembrance Day by taking every step we possibly 
can to invite all Canadians to do honour to the war dead such as 
Colonel McCrae whose words from <I>In Flanders Fields</I> are 
inscribed just outside the walls of this place and whose statue 
we pass every day on our way into this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us resolve, hopefully with the passage of this bill, to 
begin to do greater honour than we have in recent years to the 
sacred memory of our war dead.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to this bill this 
evening.  I can say that it is not often that we get the chance 
to debate a matter over which, almost by definition, there will 
be a great deal of consensus.  I suspect that no one in the House 
today would offer any objection to the principle of honouring our 
veterans with a two minute observation of silence on Remembrance 
Day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among the most fortunate Canadians of this century are those who 
were born in its latter half.  A good number of them represent a 
generation of citizens who have never known war, who have never 
known the threat of tyranny, who have never had to give up their 
youth and risk their lives on foreign soil.  For the first 50 
years of this century, Canadians citizens did not have such good 
fortune. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who were born at the turn of the last century would 
suddenly find themselves thrown on to the bloody battlefields of 
Europe.  Tens of thousands perished in the trenches of France and 
Belgium and died in the hell of no man's land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When bullet and bayonet did not get them, then cold, exposure, 
injury and disease did the job.  Over 60,000 men would not come 
home.  Mothers and fathers would see their beloved no more and a 
nation would lose the flower of its youth. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the guns of this terrible war, which was to be the war to 
end all wars, were silenced at the eleventh hour of the eleventh 
day of the eleventh month, a tradition was born: to take a moment 
on the anniversary of the Armistice to remember those who gave 
their lives. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The poignancy and the need for that tradition will be reinforced 
again and again by the tragedy of another world war just two 
decades after the first, and with the Korea conflict a scant a 
few years later.  So every year we are called on to remember, to 
attend Remembrance Day ceremonies on November 11, to pay tribute 
to the memory of more than 100,000 who gave their lives for this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the generation of Canadians in the second half of this 
century, peace has been their good fortune.  As the baby boomers 
grow up in a nation whose prosperity was guaranteed by those who 
came before, as has been said, it has become easy perhaps in the 
business of raising families and pursuing economic opportunities 
to push the thoughts of history, war and remembrance into the 
background.  In the 1990s, as we approach the millennium, there 
has been a renewed interest in our history and in those who were 
willing to fight and to die for their country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the catalyst for this renewed interest was the 50th 
anniversary activities a few years ago commemorating the events 
that led to the end of the second world war.  Canadians from 
coast to coast saw the blanket television coverage of their 
veterans, of their fathers, grandfathers, mothers and 
grandmothers who returned to the old battlegrounds and the old 
memories.  They saw the incredible scenes of welcome in France 
and Belgium and especially The Netherlands where the Canadians 
were cheered on and thanked again and again for helping to 
liberate that small beleaguered nation. Those scenes touched the 
hearts of all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Interest and attendance at our Remembrance Day ceremonies here 
at home have also been on the increase.  More and more families 
in cities and towns all across Canada are taking the time to go 
the local cenotaphs, bow their heads and listen to the solemn 
ceremonies of remembrance.  Particularly heartening is the 
appearance of young people, those who have never known war, but 
who now want to take time out to acknowledge the sacrifice of 
their parents and their grandparents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fully support the intent of this bill which promotes two 
minutes silence each Remembrance Day.  I also like the notion of 
the collective time out where most of the people in the community 
can stop for a moment to remember.  A period of quiet will ensue 
as neighbours think about the sacrifices of the veterans from 
their own town or village.  Except for matters where safety and 
health may be involved, I foresee very few situations which would 
preclude such a unique possibility for community remembrance. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine, all the people in grocery stores, shopping centres, 
schools, factories, recreation centres, stopping to observe two 
minutes' silence to reflect on the meaning of the sacrifice. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member for Calgary Southeast has pointed out, this 
is not a new concept, just a reinforcement of a custom that has 
been on the wane in Canada for many years.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Actually we are not alone in this.  As has been said, the 
British in recent years have made great efforts and with great 
success to encourage renewal of this practice.  The British 
people have embraced the idea with great enthusiasm.  So, too, 
have our Australian cousins.  They recently revived and 
encouraged the continuation of the tradition whose origins date 
back to 1919. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is also in keeping with the Royal Canadian Legion's 
proposal to the government to officially proclaim a national two 
minute silence each November 11 at 11 a.m.  The move to have all 
Canadians stop what they are doing and remember the sacrifice of 
Canadian servicemen and women follows the incredible success of 
the Royal British Legion's campaign to promote remembrance among 
its citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite a delicate matter debating legislation requesting 
people to pay their respects.  Quite appropriately, this bill 
does not try to force people into an act of silence but merely 
promotes the idea and suggests ways in which Canadians can stop 
and take time out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an idea whose time has come and with proper nurturing and 
encouragement, I think the idea will catch on.  Two minutes of 
silent observation is not asking very much of our citizens and 
our businesses.  I believe it is a renewal of a tradition that is 
long overdue.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased, on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois, to speak to Bill C-279, 
an act to promote the observance of two minutes of silence on 
Remembrance Day, a bill introduced by my colleague, the member for 
Calgary Southeast, Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not oppose the bill.  I do not intend to speak at great 
length, however, because I have trouble understanding the need for 
such a bill, and particularly what purpose it serves. 
Why two minutes, and not three or four, since the point of such an 
observance is not the number of minutes spent, but the ongoing 
remembrance of an event, keeping alive the memory of those who 
sacrificed their lives for peace?  One solid minute seems fine to 
me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, I even wonder if we will not achieve the opposite 
effect by prolonging the time spent in reflection.  We all know 
that one minute of silence in a crowd including children and the 
elderly, in temperatures that are not always ideal, too hot or too 
cold, often seems to go on for a long time, and that, after 50 or 
55 seconds, people start to fidget or whisper.  What will happen if 
another minute is added? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fear that the effort required on such an occasion would be 
too much for some people and that the dignity to which we are 
accustomed might turn to indifference. 
Moreover, this period of silence originally lasted for two minutes. 
Indeed, history tells us that the observance of a period of silence used 
to last two minutes. The custom originated from a recommendation made 
after the first world war by a South African statesman, Sir James 
Fitzpatrick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Fitzpatrick, who was very fond of vast spaces, spent a great 
deal of time reflecting in the silence and solitude of the vast plains 
of his native land. It is there that, while thinking about the past, he 
came up with the idea that people should observe two minutes of silence 
to honour the memory of those who had given their lives for their 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, during the traditional Remembrance Day ceremony, on November 
11, one minute of silence is observed at 11 a.m., because a period of 
two minutes would have the drawbacks mentioned earlier. People stand in 
silence for one minute and think about all those who gave their lives in 
the fight against tyranny and oppression. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This minute meets the objective pursued, which is to remember those 
who paid the ultimate price for freedom and peace. Furthermore, there 
are so many veterans who are unhappy with the current program, which is 
so complex, that this House should really be concerned with the true 
daily issues confronting these people. I can assure you that having an 
additional minute of silence is not one of them.

veterans.  The government should recall the role they played in 
restoring peace in the world and given them equal access to 
benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In December, I supported the motion by my colleague from 
Kamloops, Motion M-75, which proposed the government consider 
“giving to the members of the MacKenzie-Papineau Battalion and 
other Canadians who fought with Spanish Republican forces in the 
Spanish Civil War between 1936 and 1939, the status of veterans 
under the federal legislation and making them eligible for 
veterans' pensions and benefits”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite their sacrifices and acts of individual heroism, Canadian 
veterans of the International Brigades are not yet recognized as war 
veterans.  Therefore, they were never entitled to any veterans benefits 
and were never given any credit for having fought for the liberty and 
democracy we know and enjoy, here in Canada.  It seems most appropriate 
to recognize these people who volunteered to fight for justice and 
democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another inequity of the system is that we recognize veterans from 
the war in Vietnam, but not those who fought in Spain.  Did we have 
better reasons for getting involved in Vietnam? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am thinking also of the soldiers who served in peacekeeping 
operations and whose status is not well defined.  Over time, the most 
consistent element of our foreign policy and defense policy has been our 
commitment to peace and security in the world. 
The active participation of Canadians Forces in peacekeeping missions 
has directly contributed to ease tensions in hot spots around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada sent troops to such remote areas as Kashmir, from 1949 to 
1979, Western New Guinea in 1962-63, and Yemen in 1963-64. From 
1960 to 1964, these troops were involved in such sensitive 
operations as expelling mercenaries from Katanga and preserving 
the territorial integrity of what was then the Belgium Congo and 
is now the Democratic Republic of Congo. I am thinking about 
those who fought in Cyprus in 1964 and witnessed the atrocities 
of the war between Turks and Greeks. There are many others such 
as Bosnia, Haiti, Iraq, Koweit, Yugoslavia, etc. I do not have 
enough time to name them all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These soldiers have not had the same benefits as veterans of both 
world wars and the Korean war. Before trying to add one minute of 
silence, it would be preferable for the House to grant equal status to 
all veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I believe there are many shortcomings in the 
Department of Veterans Affairs, a lot of work to do. As for Bill C-279, 
an act to promote the observance of two minutes of silence on 
Remembrance Day, I believe the tradition already in place meets our 
commitment to remember those who gave their lives in the name of peace 
and justice. Let us strive instead to correct the injustices of the 
current system.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I would like to speak on behalf of the veterans affairs critic 
who could not be here and also portray our party's favour in 
recognizing two minutes of silence.  It is very crucial in the 
issue of remembrance of the sacrifices that were made by the 
young men and women who faced the atrocities of war to find 
peace. The two minutes of silence should end in a celebration of 
peace because peace is the essence of harmony and the fulfilment 
of a good life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to reflect on the land we presently occupy and the 
nations that occupied this land for generations. Along the Great 
Lakes there was a confederacy of united nations. A great law of 
peace guided their society, their government, their activities 
and their relations with other nations.  The original five 
nations which are now called the Six Nations Confederacy lived 
under the law of peace.  They held the might of their strength. 
The arrow was a symbolism of armaments.  But those armaments and 
the military might were in the name of peace, not in the name of 
war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our history of the Canadian military and the Canadian 
government we have had glimpses that we are willing to sacrifice 
our might and our diplomacy for international peace.  We have 
shown leadership and have been recognized as such. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking on remembrance, let us also remember the many people 
who sacrificed themselves, left their families and the comfort of 
their homes to go to the front lines.  Upon returning home, as 
the hon. member for Chateauguay mentioned, our veterans faced 
inequities and injustices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the other groups of veterans I would like to bring 
forward is the aboriginal veterans, the First Nations, the Metis, 
the Inuit.  Brothers in arms, sisters in arms took the risks and 
sacrificed, but on coming back the injustices started.  The 
distribution of grants and allocation of land to these people 
were not fair. The access to pensions and recognition were not 
given to these men and women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>[<I>Editor's Note: Member spoke in Cree</I>] 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our languages were used in combat as well by the aboriginal code 
talkers. If a Cree person or a Dene person spoke to another on 
the other side of a radio line, people in the rest of the world 
could not figure out what they were talking about.  This was done 
in the allied forces for the democratic freedom of all our 
people.  Our languages are gifts of our Creator.  We used those 
gifts to get a speedy recovery from the illness of war, to find 
peace.  These are gifts that can be used to find a peaceful end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In remembrance of the aboriginal veterans, I call on this 
country to recognize them.  Let us give remembrance to them by 
giving them equal opportunity as all other veterans of this 
country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the two minutes of silence, as we challenge our children to 
remember, also celebrate peace.  I challenge my colleagues to 
take up that message because once we have finished the 
remembrance we have to celebrate peace.  This is it.  We have it. 
Cherish it, nurture it and carry it on.  We cannot take it for 
granted. Celebrate it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In memory of all veterans and all people who gave their lives on 
the many battlefronts recognized and unrecognized, I give my 
support to Bill C-279.  Hopefully as a nation we can rise above 
the ashes of war and keep peace into the new millennium and for 
thousands of years to come.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to speak to Bill C-279 which promotes the 
observance of two minutes of silence on Remembrance Day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is something which is not compelling on Canadians but 
it does seek to invite us to pause voluntarily for two minutes to 
remember those who fought so valiantly for the freedom we enjoy 
today. I commend my colleague from Calgary Southeast for bringing 
forward this initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the opportunity to travel with the Minister of Veterans 
Affairs as part of a delegation to Dieppe, France last year. 
Veterans from across Canada were with us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had two brothers who were overseas and fought in the war. I 
had absolutely no idea what they had gone through until we came 
into the harbour of Dieppe, France.  It was just like walls of 
cement that were almost as high as these walls here in the House. 
That was where the Germans were because they knew our troops were 
coming and as they got off the ships and approached the shore, 
the Germans picked them off one by one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people in Dieppe, France never forgot the sacrifices our 
people made.  We had an opportunity to visit the French cemetery 
in Dieppe, France. It was the only night when there was any kind 
of mist and fog and it was going in and around the tombstones. 
All of a sudden this little lady arrived. It was almost as if she 
had come up from the grave.  We all stood very stunned.  She was 
Sister Valois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An hon. member from the Liberal Party and I were helping some of 
the veterans. Some of them had to use wheelchairs after a few 
days because of the heat.  I was pushing one of the wheelchairs 
when all of a sudden the gentleman said “It's Sister Valois, 
it's Sister Valois”.  Then they all joined in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She was a nun, a nurse.  When our boys arrived in Dieppe and 
when they were hurt, she was the one who took care of them.  Five 
of our men who were there fighting during the war died in her 
arms. Our men had great respect for her and it was really an 
honour and a privilege to meet her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At our Canadian cemetery we also had a huge service.  All the 
young people, like the pages here, and even little ones smaller 
than them and others bigger than them, came over to us.  We had 
Canada pins on.  They would say “Please, please” and point to 
the pins.  When we gave them our lapel pins, they said “Merci, 
merci” and hugged us.  It meant so much to them. All down the 
promenade, from the top of every building and the windows there 
were Canadian flags.  It was absolutely marvellous to see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have great respect for our veterans and I am sure most people 
do.  Remembrance of the 114,000 Canadians who gave their lives to 
fight for the rights and freedoms of our citizens and the 1.6 
million who volunteered with them has become a very strong 
Canadian tradition. It has been encouraged by the veterans who 
steadfastly have performed and supported remembrance activities.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We mark Remembrance Day on the eleventh hour of the eleventh day 
of the eleventh month.  It is the anniversary of the hour when 
guns fell silent in the year 1918, marking the end of World War 
I.  Since then our veterans have faced World War II and the 
Korean war, and our peacekeepers have found themselves thrown 
into war zones where Canada is not a combatant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 10, 1997 a private member's bill introduced in the 
Ontario legislature by Progressive Conservative MPP Morley Kells 
received royal assent.  The bill is almost identical to the bill 
we are debating here tonight.  Mr. Kells introduced his bill 
after he spent Remembrance Day in England one year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently Great Britain restored the two minutes of silence to 
its Remembrance Day ceremonies.  The two minutes of silence was 
once commonplace in England but had fallen into disuse. Mr. Kells 
witnessed the reinstitution of the two minutes of silence in 
England.  He was so moved by the ceremony that he decided to 
introduce a bill in the Ontario legislature.  The bill was 
passed. It calls on Ontarians to pause voluntarily for two 
minutes on Remembrance Day each year. I know of no one in this 
House of Commons who should be negative against our doing exactly 
the same here in Ottawa.  It should be done here for our veterans 
right on Parliament Hill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As time marches on our veterans are becoming less and less 
visible at Remembrance Day ceremonies across the country because 
of age, because of health, because of death.  I as well as others 
are concerned that their legacy will fade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I compliment the Royal Canadian Legion that goes into the 
schools to remind the children of November 11, Remembrance Day. 
The legion reminds the children of what it really means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was told that the Royal Canadian Legion asked the children of 
a little town to make wreathes and lay them down.  The children 
did this.  I was told that meant more to the veterans than if 
they had bought a wreath.  The veterans saw that the children 
understood and cared enough for the veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must remember if it were not for our veterans, we would not 
be sitting here today in this Chamber.  We would not be freely 
debating issues of policy and importance to our nation. It is up 
to our present generation and governments to take steps today to 
ensure our veterans' fight for our freedom is never forgotten. We 
must fuel the flame or the torch will never be passed on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately recent generations have never been called upon to 
volunteer for the massive war efforts Canada mounted in World War 
I and World War II.  We must continue to commemorate our 
veterans' legacy.  Two minutes of silence is a small step toward 
ensuring the memory of their valiant fight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Royal Canadian Legion has called on governments and 
Canadians to restore this two minutes of silence nationwide.  It 
believes it will go a long way to enhance Remembrance Day among 
the new generation of Canadians, those who have not experienced 
the horror of war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have already seen the Department of Veterans Affairs support 
this initiative for which I thank it.  It has published brochures 
outlining activities for schools during Veterans Week and 
suggesting that two minutes of silence be organized. I commend 
the DVA for this initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two years ago the present president of the Royal Canadian 
Legion, Mr. Joe Kobolak, wrote to the <I>Globe and Mail</I> on the 
subject of the two minutes of silence.  I quote from his letter 
to the editor dated November 15: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing quite as expressive as silence.  Britain 
discovered that on Monday when it stood still for two minutes to 
remember the war dead.  Trains, buses and cars came to a stop. 
Children stood by their desks with heads bowed.  Office workers 
took their phones off the hook.  The floor of the stock exchange 
fell silent.  TV networks turned off the sound. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a hurry-up world that leaves little for contemplation, it was 
a magnificent gesture of national solidarity.  Is there any 
reason that Canada should not follow the example?  Canadians 
observe Remembrance Day in many ways—in schools, at Legion 
halls, on Parliament Hill.  But remembering together, at the same 
moment, all across the country would lend the event a new force 
at a time when memories of war are fading.  Let the Prime 
Minister declare that, beginning next year, Canadians from sea to 
sea shall observe two minutes of silence at the same time every 
November 11th.  We owe it to the dead.  We owe it to the yet 
unborn.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the president of the Royal Canadian Legion.  I 
agree with the thrust of Mr. Kells' bill.  I agree with my 
colleague's bill before us tonight.  Simply put, the legislation 
is an act to provide for the observance of Remembrance Day in a 
way that it was initially meant to be.  Two minutes is not a lot 
to ask for a lifetime of freedom. 
<P><A NAME="LINK248"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I rise to speak to Bill C-279, an act to promote two minutes of 
silence on Remembrance Day.  I will make a 10 minute speech in 
support of two minutes of silence: two very important minutes 
observed by many in November of each year, two very important 
minutes of silence that are frequently overlooked by many others, 
including those whose employers grant them a day off to observe 
Remembrance Day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since Remembrance Day is not a day accorded the same importance 
as New Year's Day among other statutory holidays, Remembrance Day 
is most frequently associated with the phrase “banks and 
government offices are closed”.  For many who must work on 
Remembrance Day, any pause to remember our war dead is either 
overlooked or difficult.  For those and far too many others the 
sacrifices of war are in a fog of memory at best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank my colleague, the hon. member for Calgary Southeast, for 
his thoughtfulness in sponsoring this initiative.  As the 
official opposition critic for veterans affairs, I assure the 
hon. member and the House that this initiative is greatly 
appreciated by Canadian veterans everywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In life we value those who remember our sacrifices and our 
triumphs long after their occurrences.  In death, those who take 
the time to remember the accomplishments of one who has passed on 
show respect for that person as well as acknowledging that 
person's contribution to the welfare of others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to our war dead, so many of whom died in their 
early twenties without marriage or children to pass on their 
legacy, remembrance of their sacrifices becomes all the more 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the bill, to be called the observance of two 
minutes of silence on Remembrance Day act, is invitational. There 
is no mandated requirement that two minutes of silence be 
observed throughout Canada on Remembrance Day.  Perhaps there 
should be. Rather, it is stated in the bill that the people of 
Canada are invited to pause and observe two minutes of silence at 
11 o'clock on each Remembrance Day to honour the men and women 
who died serving their country in wars and peacekeeping efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note this legislative initiative parallels a bill passed in 
the Ontario legislation in October 1997.  That initiative was 
commenced by Mr. Morley Kells, by way of a private member's bill. 
It is of interest that the current initiative and that in 
Ontario are the result of the concerns of individual members 
rather than being an initiative of the government of the day.  It 
is also regrettable that the bill in the House is not votable, 
given that comparable legislation was deemed to be of sufficient 
importance to have been voted on in the Ontario legislature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wish the <I>Hansard</I> record to show that the current 
bill has been introduced by a member of the House who is not yet 
30 years of age.  Many of his peers do not have a precise 
appreciation of the sacrifices of war.  It is refreshing to 
encounter an individual with such concern and appreciation at 
such a comparatively young age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As witness to the recent Senate hearings on the Canadian war 
museum, I must say that the role of the museum in preserving the 
respect and memories of our soldiers is essential. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1820"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT100"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT100"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1820
<A HREF="#LINKT101"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT99"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many argue, as do I, that the museum should be under the control 
of veterans affairs to allow for better representation by those 
whose memories are preserved in the museum.  It is the Canadian 
War Museum that allows our young a chance to touch the history 
that won them the freedom they enjoy today.  It is the Canadian 
War Museum that remembers the veterans every minute of every day 
and so too it must too receive the same thanks that our veterans 
receive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the current bill suggestions are made as to ways in which the 
people of Canada could promote the pause and the observance of 
two minutes of silence.  Some of the suggestions are traditional 
and some are novel.  It is suggested that Canadians could 
participate in a traditional Remembrance Day service at a war 
memorial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consistent with practices at most primary and secondary schools, 
it is suggested that Remembrance Day assemblies be held.  It is 
also suggested that similar assemblies be held at post-secondary 
institutions, colleges and universities, where to the best of my 
knowledge Remembrance Day practices are less common. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consistent with practices in Europe but not common in Canada, it 
is suggested that driving Canadians could stop their vehicles 
along the side of the road and sit or, as I suggest, stand 
quietly for two minutes.  It is also suggested that factory 
assembly lines may shut down and that at all workplaces persons 
observe two minutes of silence.  The final suggestion is that 
Remembrance Day services be held in places of worship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Silence is an important component to healthy reflection.  Many 
scorn those who wish to reflect on the past.  Somehow this 
perspective sees a lesson from the past as a hindrance to healthy 
living in the present.  This same approach to life also denies 
that one's actions can have a positive or negative effect on 
others.  Respect is often contagious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When soldiers go to war they do not do so on the basis of “I am 
the only one who matters”.  Instead, there is a collective sense 
of purpose, a sense of placing one's life at risk for the greater 
good of others, a willingness to sacrifice in the support of a 
higher purpose and an appreciation that personal sacrifice can 
and does have a profound effect on the direction of history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also in the military a very keen sense of history and 
an appreciation that one must learn from the lessons of history 
in order to ensure that past mistakes are not repeated.  To say 
to a military person that all that matters is to be here now is 
to invite a response combining amazement and pity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The world in which we currently find ourselves is one in which 
instant gratification and self-interest are celebrated.  There is 
no need to make a commitment to any person or ideal other than 
oneself.  It seems there is no need to remember the sacrifices 
that others made for our future welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to progress as a nation and as individuals we must 
remember those who sacrificed their lives for us.  In houses of 
worship we are often asked to sit silently, to contemplate how we 
can improve ourselves in our daily lives.  In silent 
contemplation for but two minutes on Remembrance Day we are 
invited to contemplate how others have contributed to our ability 
to improve ourselves in our daily lives.  A single soldier dead 
50, 75 or 100 years has made such a contribution to our welfare 
that we must remember the sacrifice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I applaud the hon. member for Calgary Southeast for this 
initiative.  My colleague is truly representative of 
Lieutenant-Colonel McCrae's sentiments as he takes up the torch 
and holds it high “lest we forget”. 
<P><A NAME="LINK249"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Judi Longfield (Whitby—Ajax, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
in the short minute available to me I want to say how proud I am 
to stand here and offer my support for the bill before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly would take issue with some of the comments about 
reducing this to one minute.  I believe two minutes is not a 
great deal of time to ask anyone to stand and pay tribute to 
those who have paid the supreme sacrifice on our behalf.  It is 
the very least we can do.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all members of the House to vigorously lend their 
support.  It will take time and effort on the part of all of us. 
These are simply words on paper until such time as they take 
action.  We need to lend our support to our legions, to make 
certain that each and every one of us do our part in making sure 
the very valuable initiative on the part of the member opposite 
comes to fruition. 
<P><A NAME="LINK250"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to conclude debate on the bill.  At the 
outset I thank members of all parties for their words and I think 
their support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would however put to the hon. member of the Bloc Quebecois 
that the bill is not proposing two minutes frivolously.  This is 
a tradition which is decades old.  It is what the Royal Canadian 
Legion has recommended as an appropriate period of observance. It 
is what the mother parliament, Westminister, has enacted by way 
of a motion.  It is what the Ontario legislature has passed 
through unanimous vote.  I suggest that two minutes, as the 
previous member has suggested, is not too much to ask for what we 
are commemorating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if amendments were permitted to the bill I would be 
happy to remove the specific reference to two minutes and to have 
it stated as a moment of silence.  I am not particularly 
concerned about the precise wording.  I am more concerned about 
the sentiment which the bill attempts to express. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also agree with the comments of the previous speaker that this 
kind of honorific statute is of no effect if the spirit of it is 
not taken up by Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the roles of parliament is to exercise national 
leadership.  Part of that leadership should be in demonstrating 
the importance of our national symbols, one of which is a moment 
of silence.  That is why I bring forward the bill as an act on 
the part of all members to provide us with an opportunity to 
exercise leadership in this regard.  It would be for all 
Canadians to observe it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has happened, as the hon. member for Saint John has so 
eloquently pointed out, in the United Kingdom where this practice 
fell out of use.  It has now led to a remarkable moving silence 
in every corner of the United Kingdom.  There is no reason why we 
could not replicate that experience here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing I refer to a anecdote about a particular Canadian 
soldier which would bring to mind the need for this kind of 
commemoration and to take it so seriously.  I refer to a story 
reported in a book on direct democracy by a former member of this 
place, Patrick Boyer.  He dedicated the book to a man by the name 
Gib Boxall who died at age 24 on June 9, 1944. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gib Boxall was involved in the D-Day landing.  He was one of the 
more than 1,000 Canadians who were killed in that war.  When 
Canadian Sergeant Alf Allen was asked about his experience in 
digging some of the graves for Canadian soldiers, he said that he 
came across the body of Gilbert Boxall and said:

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA PENSION PLAN 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK253"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, the Canada pension plan affects all Canadians.  They 
have a right to know the important details of this plan and how 
it will affect their retirement security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have asked the Minister of Finance on at least seven occasions 
to disclose the real rate of return that young Canadians can 
expect to receive on their lifetime CPP investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has avoided answering the question all seven times, 
therefore, here I am again.  I would like to repeat that I am 
asking about the real rate of return, not a rate increased by 
inflation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To assist the minister in his response, I also point out that I 
do not want to hear of some hypothetical sum that would be 
returned after 35 years.  I am interested in the real rate of 
return on an annual basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To further assist the minister, I would like to refresh his 
memory with respect to the Canada pension plan's sixteenth and 
latest actuarial report with which I am sure he is familiar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Page 14 of this report shows a table with the real rate of 
return calculated for contributors to the Canada pension plan. 
For someone born in 1948, 4.9%; for someone born in 1968, 2.5%; 
for someone born in 1988, 1.9%; and for someone born in 2012, 
1.8%. I might point out that a 1.8% real return is less than one 
half the real rate of return available through Government of 
Canada RRSP bonds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the minister has in hand a pre-written, canned response. 
I also know from sad experience that this not only will fail to 
answer my question, but it will not even come close to doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the government to just throw away that canned response 
that is now in the hand of a member opposite and not to insult 
Canadians again with any well crafted, carefully crafted 
self-promotion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the government to spare us also the well-worn attacks 
against my party with fictitious numbers thrown in for good 
effect.  Just give Canadians a rare, straightforward answer to a 
direct question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply ask this government to come clean and admit that the 
real rate of return on their lifetime CPP investment for young 
Canadians, still too young to vote and many yet unborn, will fall 
below 2% and in fact will be only 1.8%  I look forward to the 
government's answer.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Revenue, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I would like to 
clarify some points about the rate of return that Canadians will 
receive from the Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A generation of Canadians born in 1988 will earn an effective 
rate of return on their CPP contributions of 1.9%, comparing the 
benefits they can expect to receive to the contributions they 
will make.  However, the Reform Party does not tell you that this 
return accounts for commitments already made under the CPP.  In 
fact 6.1% of the 9.9% steady stay contribution rate in 2003 will 
pay for the benefits of contributors.  The rest is needed to pay 
for the plan's unfunded liability which is currently around $600 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The effective rate for contributors would be higher if the 
contribution rate was only 6.1%.  However, this would be possible 
only if we reneged on commitments already made under the CPP or 
paid them from a source the Reform Party has not identified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The money actually invested in the CPP under the new, more fully 
funded approach is expected to earn a 3.8% of return after 
inflation.  This is comparable to the returns of any large 
pension plan in the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the hon. member should know that the recent report of 
the Association of Canadian Pension Management supports a 
retirement system that includes the CPP as well as employer plans 
and RRSPs.  It does not support, and I stress it does not 
support, the kind of privatized system that the Reform Party 
wants.  On the contrary.  It points out that private plans can 
have much higher investment costs than the CPP to the investor's 
disadvantage. Those are the facts.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK256"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, on December 10, 1997, I asked a question 
to the human resources development minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked him if he was aware that the unemployment insurance reform 
had increased poverty. What is nice with the adjournment motions is 
that, between the day where we ask the question and the one where we 
move our adjournment motion, new information becomes available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last two weeks, we have received very conclusive answers 
that really demonstrate in an clear, convincing and definite fashion 
that the employment insurance reform has created a lot of poverty in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A very solid study done by a distinguished professor, Mr. Fortin, 
showed that, for Quebec alone, there are 200,000 people who, in 1989, 
would have been eligible to employment insurance but did not benefit 
from it because of the restrictive rules that have been systematically 
imposed since that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister tells us that there is a regular follow-up and that a 
report will be submitted. He talked about this in December, but we 
received the report at the beginning of February, and it contained 
absolutely no recommendation to amend the Employment Insurance Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We considered the issue at the human resources development 
committee and there is currently a motion before the committee to report 
to the House, so that the hon. members can do the work the employment 
commission should have done, which is to see where the situation stands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the reform, the number of people on the welfare rolls 
increased by 200,000 in Quebec and 750,000 throughout Canada, which 
significantly reduces the chances for the unemployed to get back into 
the labour market. The situation is quite clear. Time is of the essence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for the minister of Human Resources Development to 
stop saying that he is making the appropriate follow-up. He now has the 
results and he can see that the operation is very disappointing indeed. 
If we do not take the necessary corrective action as soon as possible, 
we will be faced with permanent consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will have a negative impact, since more people, especially low 
income or poorly educated workers, are systematically joining the 
welfare rolls and leaving the workforce. These people are less happy, 
less satisfied and are added burdens to our society. They have no way of 
increasing their self-esteem and getting interesting results.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, I want to ask the minister, through the parliamentary 
secretary, the following question: Now that we are convinced that this 
is an urgent matter, will the Minister of Human Resources Development 
take concrete steps so that the Standing Committee on Human Resources 
Development can present him with short term recommendations to amend the 
Employment Insurance Act in order to correct the inequity that was 
created, the terrible vacuum that is forcing a lot of people back onto 
the welfare rolls and creating poverty? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should the federal government that wants to fight poverty not use 
the first tool available and, instead of accumulating a $25 billion 
surplus in the employment insurance fund by the year 2000, return that 
program to its original purpose and use that money to help those who, 
unfortunately, do not have a job, those who need a sufficient income 
between jobs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently, we heard testimony, on television, from people who, after 
contributing to the EI fund for 30 years, had left their job for a year 
and then, when they returned and needed EI benefits, got no more than 
$130 a week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there anybody in this House who could live on $130 a week? This 
is totally unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, if he thinks there is an urgent need, last December, the 
minister told us that there was no— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> I am sorry to interrupt the 
hon. member, but his time is up.

<P><A NAME="LINK257"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Revenue, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the hon. member is 
mistaken when he suggests that employment insurance has increased 
poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first major reform in 25 years is fundamentally about 
helping Canadians get back to work quickly.  The old system 
encouraged ongoing dependence and did not address structural 
unemployment.  The new reform invests in people who are prepared 
to invest in themselves.  It is fair, balanced and reflects the 
job market of realities across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The employment insurance system combines income support with 
practical results oriented, active employment measures.  To help 
unemployed Canadians get back to work, an additional $800 million 
will be reinvested annually in re-employment measures, bringing 
the federal funding to more than $2.7 billion annually by 
2000-2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, a three year transition jobs fund is now in place 
to help create lasting jobs in the high unemployment rate regions 
of this country.  Co-operation with provincial and territorial 
governments and the private sector in developing and delivering 
these benefits is an essential part of the EI system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Labour market agreements with 11 provinces and territories will 
reduce the overlap, duplication of efforts and ensure that 
employment programs meet local and regional needs.  As well, 
decisions on the most appropriate forms of assistance to help the 
unemployed get back to work will benefit from the insights of 
those most closely in touch with local markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government with EI reform ensured that the new system was 
fairer and more equitable.  The new system provides a family 
income supplement to help those with children.  Because the 
entrance requirement is now based on hours of work instead of 
weeks, 500,000 additional part time workers will have their work 
insured for the first time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Labour market conditions are now substantially improving.  As 
1998 begins the unemployment rate has dropped to its lowest level 
in seven years.  More than one million—

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>YOUNG OFFENDERS ACT 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK259"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, on 
November 24, 1997, I asked the Minister of Justice when she was 
going to amend the Young Offenders Act.  It has been 108 days and 
I still have not heard a response to this question. In those 108 
days there have been numerous cases of violent young offenders 
committing some of the most heinous crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With no legislation to deter these youth, they are literally 
running wild.  The justice minister continues to call these 
isolated incidents and isolated cases, but statistics prove 
otherwise.  What she does not like to hear is the actual cases 
which illustrate the level of violence now seen in our youth 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On November 21 in Victoria, seven teenage girls and one boy were 
charged with the death of 14 year old Reena Virk.  These teens 
beat this girl to death and threw her body in a gorge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just before Christmas in Saskatchewan, two 15 year old girls 
were charged with first degree murder in the stabbing death of 58 
year old Helen Montgomery who ran a custody care facility for 
young offenders where the suspects were living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On January 19 in Lethbridge a single mom was killed by her 13 
year old daughter and her daughter's 15 year old boyfriend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On January 20 in Kitchener, Ontario, a 17 year old hacked off 
the hair of a 14 year old with a knife and beat her so badly that 
her eyes were swollen shut.

<A HREF="#LINKT104"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is so remarkable about all these cases is not only the 
level of violence but that they were all girls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on and on to cite these incidents, and those I have 
mentioned happened since I asked the question, but I would like 
to talk about one young man named Keith Addy who feels that 
legislators are not responsible for our justice system today.  I 
want him to know that I have heard him and I do recognize the 
need for change and that the Reform Party is working for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Keith Addy was struck by a stolen vehicle driven by a young 
offender which caused major head injuries to the 23 year old 
security guard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The young offender was sentenced to six months in a detention 
facility and 24 months in the open custody of a group home.  He 
will not be allowed to drive for five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What struck me about Keith Addy's letter is his insightfulness 
into the Young Offenders Act.  His letter is entitled “Young 
Offenders law a joke to criminals in waiting”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He goes on to state that as a victim he feels that the 
government clearly cares more about those who offend than those 
who do not.  That is quite obvious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He states that the Young Offenders Act should be gone because 
these are not misunderstood youth, they are hard core criminals 
in training.  He states that parents should be made accountable 
for not maintaining proper supervision and control of their 
children. He signs off by stating “Thanks for nothing”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This young man is clearly enraged with this useless piece of 
legislation and I totally agree.  His bitterness is shared by tens 
of thousands of people and is growing with each passing day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The calls for change are coming from across the nation from 
police chiefs, police associations, provincial attorneys general, 
social service ministers, teachers, parents and of course the 
Reform Party, but most of all they are coming from the young 
people themselves.  They are calling for the YOA to be scrapped, 
since they are living in fear of being the next victim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has drafted the necessary proposals for change 
in record time.  The justice minister no longer has any excuses. 
Her time is up on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The outrage across this nation is so obvious that even the 
Liberals, if they could get it through their thick heads, should 
be able to understand that the people of this country are sick 
and tired of hearing about the violence caused by these young 
offenders.  These people have refused to move.  The act has been 
in place for 14 years.  They have done a 10 year review.  They 
flew across the country to consult, consult, consult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Liberals stood on the street corner in any city of this 
country Canadians would tell them to get rid of the Young 
Offenders Act.  For Pete's sake, send a message to these young 
violent people that it will no longer be tolerated. 
<P><A NAME="LINK260"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Revenue, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, reviewing the Young 
Offenders Act is a priority for the Minister of Justice, but it 
is clear that legislative reforms alone would not have prevented 
any of these tragedies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Legislative reform is one tool among many to deal with issues of 
youth crime and the most effective approach would be a 
comprehensive youth justice strategy that includes proactive as 
well as reactive measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general and the justice minister plan to launch a 
community based crime prevention initiative in 1998 and 
particular attention will be paid to measures for children and 
youth.  Individual communities are well placed to identify their 
challenges and needs, and our initiative will encourage a 
partnership approach to helping communities prevent and reduce 
crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If, however, serious crimes are committed by young people, we 
need a legal regime that is fully capable of responding. Criminal 
laws and criminal law principles must be applied appropriately to 
young offenders.  Criminal behaviour committed by young people 
needs to be denounced as wrong.  Young people capable of forming 
criminal intent should be considered criminally responsible and 
held accountable for their misdeeds through fair and 
proportionate penalties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Intensive rehabilitation and reintegration efforts may need to 
be applied to serious young offenders to promote the protection 
of the public by giving young offenders the best chance at 
becoming law-abiding and productive adults. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Criminal acts by youth range from high spirited behaviour to 
murder, and the response needs to be effective and proportionate. 
For less serious offences accountability and responsibility can 
be achieved by some innovative alternatives such as restorative 
justice approaches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The goal of the comprehensive strategy would be an effective 
youth justice system in which the public could have confidence. 
It is never too early to intervene in the lives of troubled young 
people and never too late. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intervention, however, must be appropriate and effective. We 
do not want to be incarcerating our children at 
disproportionately high rates, nor do we want people labouring—

interrupt the hon. member, but the time has expired.

the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to
