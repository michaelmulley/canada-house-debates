<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>ROYAL CANADIAN MINT ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK6">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK7"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-41, an act to 
amend the Royal Canadian Mint Act and the Currency Act, be read 
the second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, 10 years ago the legislation governing 
the mint was amended to allow it to become a full commercial 
crown corporation.  It is now time to review the legislation to 
bring it up to date, to reflect market realities and to provide 
the mint with the power to meet the challenges of the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Its mandate is to provide Canadians with high quality, cost 
effective circulation coins while operating profitably.  It also 
manufactures and markets high quality collector coins and foreign 
circulation coinage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, Canadians can be proud of the fact that last year the 
mint produced one billion coins for 16 different countries.  By 
the end of this year the total will rise to an awesome two 
billions coins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This global business, which on average accounts for 70% of the 
mint's revenue, works to reduce the overall cost of Canadian 
circulation coinage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mint not only covers its costs, but returns a profit to its 
shareholder, the Government of Canada.  Last year that profit 
reached an admirable $4.1 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I trust that hon. members will agree with me that the Royal 
Canadian Mint is a source of national pride, providing an 
essential service to the Canadian economy while creating the 
beautiful coins that help celebrate proud symbols of our 
nationhood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mint's strategic vision is to be a world leader in minting 
through people, innovation and quality.  The proposed changes to 
the Royal Canadian Mint Act that we are discussing today are 
essential for the mint's achievement of this strategic vision. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us get into these amendments a little more. To modernize the 
act, we propose that the process for approving coins be 
simplified so that the Royal Canadian Mint can meet market needs 
more quickly. The markets for these coins are extremely 
competitive and constantly changing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Investors buy coins of various denominations and degrees of 
purity. Collectors and people shopping for a gift expect to have 
a large selection of models, denominations and metals to choose 
from. 
In order to keep generating revenues for Canadians, the mint 
requires a legislative framework allowing it to respond quickly 
and efficiently, to take advantage of opportunities on the 
market for coins not intended for circulation. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1010"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT3"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT3"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1010
<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are in large part coins made of precious metals to 
celebrate or commemorate major national events and sold to coin 
collectors and enthusiasts across Canada and around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our proposed amendments would give the mint the power to set and 
change any of the coins' features except their design. It would 
still be up to the minister responsible for the mint to approve 
coin design. These amendments would streamline the mint's 
decision-making process, so that it can stay attuned to the 
market and continue to be client centred while at the same time 
retaining control over coin design. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, coin design would continue to be decided by an elected 
representative. As I said previously, the mint's mandate is to 
supply Canadians with circulating coins that are of high 
quality, cost effective and delivered on time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed amendments will rationalize the approval process, 
thus improving the mint's capacity to fulfil its mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to assure the House that, with respect to the coins 
Canadians use on an everyday basis, elected representatives and 
the minister responsible before this House will continue to have 
the last word. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I would encourage my colleagues to support this 
legislation and send it to committee where we can look at it 
clause by clause and hear witnesses.  After a good debate in 
committee we can come back to the House for a final debate and 
accelerate the process so the mint can make the necessary 
decisions in order that Canadians and the rest of the world will 
continue to enjoy the high quality of the coinage produced by the 
Royal Canadian Mint. 
<P><A NAME="LINK8"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is 
an honour to rise to debate this bill.  The hon. minister alluded 
to the pride that Canadians have in the various minted coins we 
use and in those coins that are collected by investors and coin 
collectors.  We are all proud of the Canadian coins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will address certain aspects of the bill.  I will first look 
at the object of the Canadian mint.  Then I will look at the 
present legislation and the provisions that currently exist for 
the operation of the mint.  Then I will compare those provisions 
with what the bill is proposing to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw the attention of the House, for review purposes, to the 
object of the mint.  According to the act that established the 
Royal Canadian Mint, the object of the mint is “to mint coins in 
anticipation of profit and other related activities”.  The act 
goes on to detail rather specifically exactly what the mint is to 
do.  Its legislative powers are as indicated in the object. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It continues: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to carry out this mandate, the Mint may exercise any or 
all of the following powers:— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to look specifically at these powers because they are 
quite different when the proposed legislative changes are taken 
into consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To produce and arrange for the production and the supply of coins 
of the currency of Canada; to produce coins of the currency of 
countries other than Canada; to melt, assay and refine gold, 
silver and other precious metals; to buy and sell gold, silver 
and other metals; to assay, refine, store and otherwise deal with 
gold, silver and other metals for the account of Her Majesty and 
others; to prepare and store shipments of coin, gold, silver and 
other metals and to move such shipments to or from the Mint; to 
make medals, plaques and other devices; to borrow or lease 
precious metals that it requires for the purpose of its 
operations; to acquire, hold and alienate real property or any 
interest therein; to make grants in lieu of taxes to any 
municipality in Canada in amounts not exceeding the taxes that 
might be levied by that municipality in respect of real property 
under the administration and control of the Mint if the Mint were 
not an agent of Her Majesty; and to do all other things that are 
incidental or conducive to the attainment of the objects and the 
exercise of the power of the Mint. 
</UL>

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a pretty comprehensive list.  The mint has in its 
corporate plan 1996-2000 indicated rather clearly how it has 
translated those particular powers into its operation.  I would 
like to read into the record exactly what the mint has said in 
that report: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's national mint, the Royal Canadian Mint, is one of the 
world's foremost producers of circulation, collector and bullion 
investment coinage.  It is one of the largest gold refiners in 
the world.  The mint is highly respected, in Canada and 
internationally, for the high quality and variety of its products 
and services.  Its numismatic and precious metal investment 
coins, all promoting Canada, are sold in over 60,000 retail 
outlets worldwide. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some might wonder what this numismatic business is.  Numismatic 
has to do with coins and with people who collect coins or who 
invest in coins.  It has to do with precious metals that are not 
in general circulation but that are there for a very special 
commemorative purpose or some other reason. They are made of 
special metals and have a value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report goes on: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Royal Canadian Mint is designated a Schedule III-II crown 
corporation under the Financial Administration Act.  The mint 
reports to parliament through the Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mint manufactures all of the circulation coinage used in 
Canada and manages the supporting distribution systems for the 
Minister of Finance.  It also carries out research on coinage 
demand. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw attention to that sentence because what has happened here 
is going to come up a little later in my speech. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the mint develops proposals to introduce high 
quality, less costly metals or metal alloys in Canadian coinage 
in order to reduce costs and improve seigniorage for the 
Government. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has to do with the circulation of coins that actually have 
an intrinsic value lower than their face value, the penny for 
example. We go on to the nickel, the dime and so on. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mint is also concerned about the security of supply and 
price competitiveness of coinage metals used in Canadian coinage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years the mint's commercial activities have been 
impacted by intensive international competition, changing 
investment markets, economic slowdowns and recessions.  After 
consistently producing profits annually from the time of its 
incorporation in 1969, the mint experienced an operating loss of 
$3.475 million in 1994 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister told us that in the last year it had a profit. 
That is good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to address this situation they produced this plan, the 
turnaround plan.  That plan is now operating and, according to 
the minister's numbers, apparently is working all right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a very interesting development.  We now look into 
exactly what has happened in that turnaround plan and what the 
government is proposing to do in introducing this new 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister told us the purpose of the legislation and as far 
as the statement went, it was accurate and complete.  I think we 
need to commend the minister for some of the aspects of that 
statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to read the summary contained in the bill 
itself: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This enactment amends the Royal Canadian Mint Act to update the 
terminology for coins in order to reflect the markets served 
rather than the metals of which the coins are composed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments simplify the process for issuing coins by giving 
additional powers to the mint and to the Minister of Public Works 
and Government Services. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the core of this bill. The mint is given the capacity of 
a natural person and the power to incorporate subsidiaries and to 
acquire and dispose of interests in other entities.  Other 
amendments of an administrative nature are also enacted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is that central part that we want to draw some attention to 
right now.  As the mint has gone along and looked at the existing 
legislation, its current interpretation and application of that 
legislation, it has issued a mission statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That mission statement has three parts.  First, to provide 
quality coinage at a reasonable cost to enable the Government of 
Canada to meet the needs of Canadians. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1020"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT5"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT5"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1020
<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, to manufacture and market on a worldwide basis high 
quality collector circulation coinage and precious metal 
investment products and market refinery services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is pretty clear that in the coinage part of this operation we 
are not in a growth industry.  It is a mature stable industry. 
That comment will become a little clearer as to its significance 
as we move along into examining this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to look at the provisions of the new bill and 
read into the record the new powers that are being given to the 
mint under this act.  We are dealing here with section 4(1). 
Remember what we said the powers of the mint were before.  Here 
are the new powers: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In carrying out its objects, the mint has the rights, powers and 
privileges and the capacity of a natural person and may in 
particular 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) procure the incorporation, dissolution or amalgamation of 
subsidiaries and acquire or dispose of any shares in them; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) acquire and dispose of any interest in any entity by any 
means; and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) generally do all the things that are incidental or conducive 
to the exercise of its powers with respect to 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(i) coins of the currency of Canada, 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(ii) coins of the currency of countries other than Canada, 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(iii) gold, silver and other metals and, 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(iv) medals, plaques, tokens and other objects made or partially 
made of metal. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think it takes a rocket scientist to understand that 
the powers of the mint have now been expanded very dramatically. 
We need to ask ourselves questions such as what are these 
activities that are incidental t, or that are conducive to the 
mint's carrying out its activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing is very clear already.  The mint is in the refining 
business.  It is my understanding that the Canadian mint refines 
more gold than any other refinery in Canada.  It is clearly in 
the business of refining gold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to ask ourselves is it also in the business then of 
buying and selling metals.  Clearly it is.  The act is very clear 
that it may buy and sell metals.  But very closely allied to this 
is the full commodities market. The futures market is a very 
volatile market. There are people in the business who tend to 
hedge their positions in order to protect certain prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But it also means that the mint has the power, according to this 
act, to get not only into the business of hedging itself against 
future price fluctuations but to actually get into the act of 
participation in that market.  Can it now buy or sell futures 
contracts, for example, not necessarily only to look after its 
own interests but also to actually declare a profit in simply 
buying and selling contracts on the futures market? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe that is the intention but the point is the act 
allows this kind of activity on the part of the mint.  I think 
that is far too much power because whose money is at risk here? 
Ultimately it is our money that is at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me indicate how significant the hedging program can be. 
Canada's largest gold producer is Barrick, a Toronto based 
corporation. This is a report in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> October 
22.  There is a lot of information in here but I will read just 
one paragraph: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of its gold hedging program, Barrick was able to sell 
its gold during the third quarter at an average of $400 an ounce, 
compared with the market price of $290 an ounce.  During the 
third quarter of 1997, Barrick sold its gold for $420 an ounce, 
compared with the market price of $324 an ounce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Barrick has sold forward 10.4 million ounces of gold at an 
average price of $400 an ounce. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a good example of what the mining corporations are 
doing in the marketplace and what the hedging program has to do 
with the futures commodities market.  While there are some very 
positive things for the investors in a company like Barrick there 
are also advantages to the mint's buying gold on the futures 
market at a lower price and to guarantee a particular price in 
the future. There is a speculative element in here as well.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the mint be circumscribed in its activities so it does not 
get into this speculative market? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is this significant?  It is significant because of the 
subsequent amendment that happens later in the act.  The 
subsequent amendment is section 20(1): 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mint may, for the attainment of its objects, borrow money 
from the consolidated revenue fund or any other source, but the 
total amount outstanding at any time may not exceed 75 million 
dollars or such greater amount as may be specified in an 
appropriation act. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to be thankful I guess for small mercies.  At least it 
is limited to $75 million.  It was $50 million.  It has now 
increased by $25 million which really means that the public 
treasury of Canada can be attached to the tune of $75 million. 
That is our money.  That is taxpayer money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When that is allowed to take place and if the mint can borrow 
money to get into the buying and selling of precious metals, and 
it clearly says it may, and if it gets into the futures market it 
can get into some serious trouble.  I would hope the management 
will not ever do that but the point is the act does not protect 
the Canadian public from that activity and I think it should do 
so.  It is our money at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It can be argued that it has been able to do that in the past. 
There is some indication that the mint has borrowed money in the 
past.  The most recent expansion of the stamping plant being 
added to the mint in Winnipeg is being done with financing to the 
tune of about $30 million outside of the Canadian consolidated 
treasury.  While that may be true, and I think it is true because 
there is an indication that it is so, the fact remains the mint 
has an indebtedness of $30 million. If it will need more money it 
can go to the consolidated treasury fund for whatever money it 
needs up to $75 million given the new provisions of the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the mint get into the mining business itself, in other 
words buy mining stock?  Somebody would say that is a stretch. 
It is in one sense with the operation of the mint but go back to 
the powers of the mint and it has all the powers of a natural 
person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The interesting thing is that it may acquire and dispose of any 
interest in any entity by any means, any means as broad as the 
imagination.  One has to be really careful about looking at that 
and asking what it can get involved in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that is not the intent.  I am sure it is not but 
nevertheless I think we have to write the act in such a way that 
there are protections against that kind of thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to go to the heart of the issue which really has to do 
with the business of the powers there.  I just read a few of them 
and I want to ask the people of Canada should the Government of 
Canada be in direct competition or get into an area that private 
enterprise has demonstrated it can do. There is no doubt that the 
Canadian mint has to have the exclusive authority to stamp the 
actual coin with the currency in circulation.  It must have that 
because that is the government's control of the currency 
operating in Canada.  But that has nothing to say with the 
production of the plating of coins or of stamping coins in the 
first place. We have at least one corporation in Canada that has 
been doing this for a lot longer than the mint. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should the government own a corporation that can be in direct 
competition with private enterprise? I am unalterably opposed to 
anything that the government does that the people can do as well 
or better.  There is clear evidence that they can do so.  What is 
some of the evidence? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, right now before the courts of Canada there is a suit 
charging the mint with infringing on the patents that are held by 
the corporation we mentioned, Westaim. 
That suit is currently alive and unfortunately I am unable to go 
into the details of the suit.  The fact remains there is a patent 
that is being infringed upon, at least that is what the contest 
is, by the mint which is owned by private enterprise.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at that sort of suit that is going on in the courts, 
we look at the balance of powers that exist in this court case 
now.  All the power of the government and all the resources of 
the government are now pitted against one little corporation.  It 
is not fair.  It is an unbalanced situation. Why should 
government or a corporation of the government ever get into the 
position of stealing something from another company that is 
protected by a patent, by the legislation that the government 
itself has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada can be proud of the number of innovative ideas that have 
come from scientists. The National Research Council for example 
has all kinds of patents which have developed and have advanced 
the technology and have advanced the science of the world.  We 
can be proud of those kinds of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now one of these companies has developed one of those patents 
and lo and behold one of the crown corporations says “That is 
mine now”.  It is not fair.  It should not happen. We will go no 
further on this but it is very important that we recognize these 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second issue is whether there is a need for more coin 
stamping capacity in Canada.  As I stand here today there is 
reason to believe with considerable confidence that there is 
right now a 30% overcapacity in the generation of coins to be 
engraved officially by governments.  That includes the current 
demand of the Eurocoin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Eurocoin demand comes out, and we know what the 
problem is, that causes an upward spike in the demand.  When that 
disappears that overcapacity will increase beyond the 30% that 
exists at the present time.  Yet the mint is expanding in a 
market that is adequately served at the present time.  Why?  The 
argument is that it is a business decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may be a business decision but it looks to me that it is a 
lousy business decision because something is going to happen. 
Either the mint is going to have trouble or this other company is 
going to be in trouble or they are both going to be in trouble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot expect a company to succeed and profit when in fact 
there is an overcapacity. Somewhere along the line there has to 
be a balance between the supply and the demand that is out there. 
In fact we get to the point where we ask ourselves, who is in 
charge here?  Is the minister in charge?  Is the government in 
charge?  Or is it the mint that is in charge? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who made the decision to build this plant and add to the 
capacity of the mint in Winnipeg? Was that done by the minister? 
Was it done by the government? Was it done by the finance 
minister?  Or was it done by the bureaucrats at the mint?  We do 
not know.  It is not clear at this point. These are the kinds of 
questions that must be answered before we agree to this 
particular change in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that as the powers of the mint are expanded, and I 
have just indicated how much they are being expanded, that the 
mint can indeed thumb its nose so to speak at the government or 
at the minister and say “This is what we are going to do because 
we have the powers of a natural person”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to go beyond this.  We need to ask ourselves how 
successful crown corporations have been. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot help but look at Petrofina and now Petro-Canada and 
the cost that was to the taxpayer and how efficiently that was 
run.  Canadian National Railways became a private corporation 
recently.  It is now starting to make money.  It did not before. 
It was a drain on the public treasury.  Canada Post has had a lot 
of difficulty in its labour relations which still are not 
completely settled. I have to commend the minister on what is 
happening now with the dispute with the franchises and Canada 
Post.  There is progress being made, but it is not complete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We really have to ask ourselves what is the best relationship. 
We need to move ahead with positive aggression.  We need to move 
ahead with balance and we need to move ahead with fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are specific concerns in this bill which I have 
illustrated.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion I would simply remind members that the powers 
granted to the mint are too broad. The exposure to risk by the 
expanded powers to the Canadian taxpayer and to the Canadian 
treasury should be circumscribed at least.  It is to $75 million 
but it is too high. The government should never do things that 
individuals can do as well or better themselves. The people can 
do it and we should not be in that kind of business to provide 
competition for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill needs to be amended.  There are some housekeeping 
elements in the bill that the minister has alluded to which I 
think we need to support.  In fact they need to go ahead. 
However, there are other aspects of the bill that should be 
looked at very seriously and amended to come into focus so we can 
have strong private enterprise in the country and at the same 
time within a framework that is clearly guided by government 
principles and rules which make it possible for private 
enterprise to be strong, profitable and which reward innovation 
and entrepreneurship.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to begin my intervention on Bill C-41, the purpose of which 
is to amend the Royal Canadian Mint Act and the Currency Act, by 
stating that my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois and myself do 
not disapprove of its ultimate objective, which is to update and 
enhance the flexibility of the Royal Canadian Mint Act.  This is 
a legitimate objective, and one that is hard to oppose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must, however, ensure that amending the act to that end does 
not create conditions which might bring with them other problems 
that are far more serious than those we wish to solve. 
On reading the bill as introduced, one is justified in having 
concerns about certain proposed amendments to the Royal Canadian 
Mint Act and the Currency Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we speak of money, whether its issue or its circulation, 
confidence between the partners is essential.  That confidence 
is born out of the assurance that each partner has of the total 
honesty of the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very mission of the Royal Canadian Mint requires this 
institution to have a spotless image and reputation, both in 
fact and in appearance.  That is why the present legislation 
contains some very clear provisions requiring the administrators 
of the Royal Canadian Mint not to place themselves in a position 
of real or apparent conflict of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These strict prohibitions are normal and necessary, because the 
very image and interests of the Royal Canadian Mint, and of 
Canada as well, depend on it.  They have certainly proven 
useful, because the Royal Canadian Mint has, until now, always 
enjoyed a solid reputation for integrity.  Unfortunately, I 
believe most sincerely that, if we do not amend some of the 
clauses of Bill C-41, we are putting that reputation at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it now stands, Bill C-41 weakens the legal framework that is 
in place to prevent any conflict of interest at the Mint.  By 
authorizing the Mint to create subsidiaries, the administrators 
of which would not be held to the same arm's length 
requirements, we are allowing it to circumvent the law and we 
are creating a dangerous opening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless it is amended, the bill is nothing short of an open 
invitation to patronage and dubious operations. Indeed, clause 2 
amends the Royal Canadian Mint Act in a significant way, by 
allowing the Mint, in carrying out its objects, to procure the 
incorporation, dissolution or amalgamation of subsidiaries and 
acquire or dispose of any shares in them; to acquire and dispose 
of any interest in any entity by any means; and generally do all 
things that are incidental or conducive to the exercise of its 
powers with respect to coins of the currency of Canada, coins of 
the currency of countries other than Canada, gold, silver and 
other metals, and medals, plaques, tokens and other objects made 
or partially made of metal.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues from the Bloc Quebecois and myself support the 
government's will to modernize the Royal Canadian Mint Act to 
make this institution more functional. However, it is obvious 
that some changes must be made to Bill C-41, otherwise its 
current wording could lead to illicit operations, which is 
definitely not the objective pursued. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 2 is a fundamental provision of the bill, since it allows 
the Royal Canadian Mint, in carrying out its objects, to create 
subsidiaries, to sell any shares in them to anyone, and to buy 
back such shares from anyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another power the Mint will acquire, still under the heading of 
carrying out its objectives, is that of buying or selling shares 
or interests in listed and unlisted companies, anywhere in the 
world.  Finally, this bill will give the Royal Canadian Mint the 
power to amalgamate its own subsidiaries with each other or with 
other companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, clause 2 as written is an invitation to patronage and 
dubious dealings and its scope must be reined in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real danger lies in the expression “in carrying out its 
objects” in clause 4 of the bill, referring to the Mint's power 
to buy, sell, borrow, lease, store and refine gold, silver and 
other precious and non-precious metals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Bill C-41 is passed, it would mean that each of these 
operations could be performed by one company, a subsidiary, 
some, a majority or all of whose shares would not be owned by 
the Royal Canadian Mint. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, this government institution would have the power to 
offload an important part of its responsibilities, to the 
benefit of a private company over which Canada's elected 
representatives, and therefore the public, would have no 
control.  The creation of such private subsidiaries, with power 
to buy, sell and transform assets, presenting a highly 
speculative dimension that would be very profitable in the wrong 
hands, makes no sense whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opening provided by Bill C-41 provides too many opportunities 
for criminals specialized in bribery and patronage, so many that 
there is no doubt whatsoever, unless clause 2 is modified to 
limit its scope, that there will be a scandal, sooner or later, 
which will cast a shadow on the credibility of the Royal 
Canadian Mint. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we pass clause 2 of Bill C-41 without adding the necessary 
limitations, the Parliament of Canada is merely paving the way 
for certain criminals who specialize in dodgy economic dealings. 
Let me tell you today that, sooner or later, this government 
will live to regret it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is absolutely no way we can empower the Royal Canadian 
Mint to hand over to whomever it wishes such important 
responsibilities as the purchase, sale, borrowing, leasing, 
storage and refining of gold or other precious metals, because 
the possibilities of conflict of interest and corruption are so 
obvious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take the example of the Mint's frequent mandate of 
striking gold coinage for other countries. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1045"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT10"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT10"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1045

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In carrying out its objects and under clause 2 of Bill C-41, the 
Royal Mint, required to buy the gold necessary to strike coins 
ordered by other countries, may incorporate a private subsidiary 
anywhere in the world to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all likelihood, this subsidiary would want to find gold at 
the lowest possible price before making its purchase.  It would 
then strike the coins requested and sell them while the value of 
the gold market is on the rise and therefore very profitable for 
the private company and all the more so for the shareholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can continue with this example by imagining that the private 
subsidiary buys the gold at $200 an ounce in 2001, reselling it 
transformed into collectors' coins in 2003 when the value of 
gold has risen to $300 an ounce.  The company would therefore 
record significant profits, thereby increasing the value of the 
stock of the subsidiary created with the blessing of the Royal 
Canadian Mint and so much profit for the subsidiary 
shareholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who would the shareholders be?  What private or corporate 
individuals would benefit from this measure and this manna?  The 
answers to this question are particularly important, since Bill 
C-41, we must not forget, empowers the mint to sell shares in 
its subsidiary to those it wishes and at a price of its 
choosing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ultimately, there is nothing to prevent the mint from selling 
shares in its subsidiary to friends or friends of friends 
through numbered companies or not.  If this is not a path to 
patronage or other dubious activities, I would like to know what 
it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Far be it from me to suggest that such a door be opened 
voluntarily.  However, consciously or unconsciously, the end is 
the same.  My colleagues will not doubt agree with me that, in 
this areas as in many others, an ounce of prevention is worth a 
pound of cure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prevention will necessitate limiting the scope of clause 2 of 
Bill C-41 to prevent conflicts of interest and the unjustified 
and undue enrichment of individuals in latent or apparent 
conflict of interest because of the mint's power to create 
private subsidiaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To do so, we must abandon the idea of giving the Royal Mint the 
power to create private subsidiaries afforded it in Bill C-41. 
If indeed it were worthwhile for the Royal Canadian Mint to 
assign some of its responsibilities to its subsidiaries, we 
should make sure these subsidiaries are above suspicion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best way to do this is by amending Bill C-41 to exclude any 
possibility that a subsidiary be established by private 
interests. The legislation must provide that any new subsidiary 
of the Royal Canadian Mint should be a legally incorporated, 
recognized national or international body such as a chartered 
bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want the Royal Canadian Mint to remain highly credible and 
reputable and prevent its reputation from being tarnished by 
second-rate subsidiaries, it goes without saying that potential 
contenders should be subject to certain restrictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The probity of the Royal Canadian Mint is beyond price and, in 
order to preserve it, Bill C-41 must be amended to ensure that 
the executives of any potential subsidiary care as much about 
the probity of their own organization.

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the same logic, it appears essential to me that Bill 
C-41 be amended to have the provisions dealing with real or 
apparent conflict of interest for mint directors also apply to 
the directors of its subsidiaries, which is unfortunately not 
the case at present. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by reminding the House that my colleagues in the 
Bloc Quebecois and I do not disagree with the objective of 
modernizing the Royal Canadian Mint Act and making it more 
functional. 
But unless the necessary amendments are made to Bill C-41 to 
remedy a number of obvious flaws mentioned earlier, we will not 
be able to support it because the loopholes we have identified 
in the legislation would have far too serious consequences.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
on behalf of the NDP I would like to make a few comments about 
Bill C-41.  I will begin by saying, somewhat in the same vein as 
the spokesperson for the Bloc Quebecois, that we are not opposed 
to the bill in a certain sense but we have some concerns which I 
would like to put on record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I do so, having listened to the hon. member from the 
Reform Party speak to the bill, I would like to say that whatever 
concerns we have about the bill we certainly do not share the 
general critique and opposition of the Reform Party to the very 
existence of crown corporations that I heard coming from the hon. 
member from the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was unfortunate to hear the member from the Reform Party cite 
the privatization of CN as a good thing.  I wonder whether the 
3,000 people who were just laid off by CN to increase CN 
shareholder value share the views of the hon. member from the 
Reform Party that the privatization of CN and the behaviour that 
comes from privatization, for example the fixation with 
increasing and maintaining shareholder value at the expense of 
employees, at the expense of communities and at the expense of 
the country's transportation infrastructure.  I wonder if they 
share the hon. member's approval of that kind of behaviour on the 
part of CN. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would seem to me that at one point when CN was a crown 
corporation it was not tearing up rail lines through western 
Canada, the very rail lines that some of the member's colleagues 
come to the defence of and say “Please don't tear up those rail 
lines.  Our community needs those rail lines”.  One of the 
reasons they are being torn up is that CN no longer feels it has 
a mandate or a responsibility to do things in the interest of 
prairie communities or the infrastructure in western Canada.  I 
would certainly ask the hon. member from the Reform Party to 
rethink his position about the value of privatization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to Bill C-41, there are elements of the bill which 
have to do with modernizing the role of the mint.  There are 
elements of the bill which are purely of a housekeeping nature. 
We have some concerns, some of which have already been mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the whole notion that the mint would be able to create these 
subsidiaries, I think the member from the Bloc, and perhaps the 
Reform Party member, rightly pointed out that this merits more 
examination in committee as to what would be the limits to these 
subsidiaries, what parameters would they be instructed to operate 
within, and what would be their nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could we amend the legislation so as to prevent, as the 
member from the Bloc rightly pointed out, any opportunity being 
created for temptation to corrupt, patronage or any other 
activity that might bring into disrepute the reputation of the 
mint which has a sterling, no pun intended, reputation and 
certainly one which my colleagues and I would like to preserve.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question of the subsidiaries needs to be looked at.  Perhaps 
some helpful amendments to clause 2 would be in order.  The whole 
question of conflict of interest has already been raised.  How 
can the bill either be amended or extended, have things added to 
it which would deal with the possibilities of conflict of 
interest in the new regime the government is setting up? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question of the 15 day notice period should be looked at if 
the mint is about to do something different.  I believe it is 
only with circulating coins.  I do not think 15 days is adequate. 
Fifteen days is like a blink of an eye in terms of the ability of 
the public to know what is going on, to have discussions within 
and among political parties, and to get feedback from the 
business community as to what the effect of any change in a 
circulated coin might be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very inadequate to say that parliament only requires a 15 
day notice and then the government could proceed through order in 
council.  It is certainly something the committee should look at. 
It is just not enough time.  We all know, from being around here, 
that if we want the people who are to be affected by any such 
change to have an opportunity for input that 15 days is simply 
not enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say that we certainly do not share the aversion 
of my Reform Party colleagues for the expansion of the mint in 
Winnipeg.  We do not see the expansion of the mint and of this 
activity in the public sector as the kind of evil thing the 
Reform Party seems to behold it as. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am familiar with the work of the mint in Winnipeg.  It is not 
in my riding but it is close by.  The locating of the new coin 
plating plant there and the expansion of that facility is not 
something we are opposed to, but we want all this to be done in a 
way that does not create opportunities for scandals and mistakes 
down the line which might eventually call into question either 
the reputation or the existence of the mint.  At the same time as 
we do not share the Reform Party objection to crown corporations, 
we do not want to see the activities of this crown corporation 
privatized in a different way through the creation of these 
subsidiaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is more than one way to privatize.  I want to say to the 
minister that we are not exactly convinced there is no hidden 
agenda.  Let us get the bill into committee and have a look at 
these things to see if we can improve it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We will now proceed 
to Statements by Members.  The hon. member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona will have about 12 minutes in debate plus 
questions and comments after question period.

days of technological achievement countries are racing to open 
new frontiers.  The sky is no longer the limit.  Thousands of 
satellites circulate around our planet and thousands of others 
are lost in space.  Since the 1960s there have been many space 
missions, some of which were not completed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members may remember in 1978 when a Russian spy satellite 
containing 100 pounds of uranium plunged through the atmosphere 
over the Northwest Territories.  Members may also remember in 
1996 when part of a Russian space probe plunged into the Pacific 
ocean.  At this very moment thousands of pieces of broken space 
equipment are circulating above us with many more to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With 434 days to the new millennium Canada should take the lead 
and co-ordinate efforts with other interested countries to clean 
up space.  We have over 5,000 intelligent experts who work in 
space and related industries.  These men and women are the best 
in the world.  With their support I am confident we can pass on 
to our children an even better future.

today in Toronto the federal government announced it will 
introduce regulations to reduce the level of sulphur in the 
gasoline sold in Canada.  Scientists agree that sulphur causes 
emissions which contribute to air pollution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a report released last summer the Ontario Medical Association 
revealed that 1,800 people die prematurely in Ontario each year 
as a result of air pollution. Many more get sick and require 
hospitalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over a period of 20 years it is estimated that low sulphur 
gasoline would prevent 2,100 premature deaths, 93,000 cases of 
bronchitis in children, 5 million other health related incidents 
such as asthma attacks and 11 million acute respiratory symptoms 
such as severe coughs and new cases of pneumonia and croup.

by the Centre for Social Justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recently released study highlighted some very interesting 
points.  One wonders how the minister responds to the fact that 
working class Canadian families are working harder than they did 
10 years ago but have less to show for their extra efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the fact that between 1989 and 1996 the average 
Canadian family saw its income decline by over $4,000.  Is this 
the type of society we want to live in and pass on to our

September, the United Nations Development Program submitted its 
world report on human development. This report, which used to 
serve as a political smoke screen to hide a country's social 
reality, will now have to be viewed as an indispensable tool to 
expose false political claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, the report indicates that the gap between rich and poor 
is a contemporary reality. It clearly states that, in the 
industrialized countries, it remains necessary to eradicate 
poverty and meet the basic needs of everyone. In fact, it is a 
shame that these objectives have still not been achieved in the 
richest countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incidentally, the UN tells us that, when it comes to human 
poverty, Canada ranks 10th out of the 17 OECD members. There are 
more people living below the poverty line in Canada than in the 
Scandinavian countries, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, France 
and Italy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A study released this week confirms that this trend is

down world prices while ensuring that our competitors' farmers

otherwise. Parliament has not given the government any authority 
to withdraw this matter from the commission.  That is a fact.

Mr. Speaker, for weeks the opposition has been saying that the

moral authority to investigate political interference. For weeks 
the Liberals have done everything to hide behind this flawed 
process, from the solicitor general's loose lips to the 
government's refusal to fund the students.

<P><A NAME="LINK114"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Transport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Brunswick government has just revealed that its new toll 
highway through the province will generate a profit of $321 
million at the expense of other provinces.  This creates a major 
interprovincial trade barrier.  It means that New Brunswick will 
be exploiting Nova Scotia, P.E.I. and Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In committee the minister said that he has the authority to 
regulate all interprovincial trade when that trade extends from 
one province to another.  Will the minister clarify the source of 
his authority and does that authority apply to interprovincial 
highways? 
<P><A NAME="LINK115"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the member should know, and I am sure he does, that 
the designing, building, financing and operating of highways is 
within the provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that federal-provincial highway agreements have not 
contemplated the use of tolls.  The hon. member has raised this 
in the House a number of times before and I have said that he 
raised a good public policy question that should be examined. 
Perhaps the Standing Committee on Transport could examine it.  It 
is being examined by a council of deputy ministers from across 
the country and their report should be made public very soon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are sorry about the dispute in Atlantic Canada, but hopefully 
it can be resolved in an amicable way. 
<P><A NAME="LINK116"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I say to the minister that there is some urgency to the 
situation because the provinces of Prince Edward Island and 
Newfoundland are now preparing lawsuits against New Brunswick for 
forcing trucks bound for their provinces through the toll booths. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lawsuit will pit three provinces against each other in a 
region that needs total co-operation, not division and 
confrontation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering the regulatory authority that the minister holds 
over these interprovincial trade links, will the minister take a 
leadership role, bring the four provinces involved together to 
find a political solution, rather than go through a costly, 
protracted, painful legal battle? 
<P><A NAME="LINK117"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member knows there is an agreement on 
internal trade that has been reached between the federal 
government and the provincial governments.  My interpretation of 
the transportation provisions of that particular agreement is 
that what is happening on the east coast is fully within the 
ambit of that agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the Conservative Party asking the Government of Canada to 
walk away from that agreement on internal trade and use its 
constitutional powers, which would cause quite a fuss across the 
country?  Is the Tory party asking us to do that?

reject the current framework of MAI negotiations and instruct the 
government to seek an entirely different agreement by which the 
world might achieve a rules based global trading regime that 
protects workers, the environment and the ability of governments

following questions will be answered today: Nos. 110 and 127. 
.[Text] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Question No. 110—<B>Mr. Chris Axworthy:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regards to the four recently acquired British 
submarines, what are the precise figures for: (<I>a</I>) the 
installation of the Air Independent Propulsion (A.I.P.) refit; 
(<I>b</I>) the new communications systems; (<I>c</I>) shore facilities; 
(<I>d</I>) modifications to meet Canadians standards; and (<I>e</I>) the 
total overall cost of the submarines? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK176"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):</B> 
The UPHOLDER project was recenlty approved by the Treasury Board 
at a total of $750 million current year 1998-99.  The project 
consist of $610 million current year 1998-99, for the U.K. 
package—submarines, trainers, technical data, crew training, and 
initial spares and $140 million current year 1998-99 for other 
project costs—essential Canadian modifications, infrastructure, 
including the repatriation of the trainers, project management 
and contingency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cost of the new communications systems, shore 
facilities—trainers—and modifications to meet Canadian 
standards are budgeted for within the $140 million, current year 
1998-99, envelope for other project costs.  Precise costs for 
these requirements will not be known until detailed definition 
and contract negotiations are completed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The installation of an air independent propulsion system is not 
part of the UPHOLDER project.  AIP is currently at the “proof of 
concept” stage at Ballard Power Systems in Vancouver.  To date, 
the Department of National Defence's investment in the research 
and development amounts to approximately $8 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The full development of a submarine AIP system, including its 
installation in the four submarines, is estimated at potentially 
several hundred million dollars over an 18-year period.  As the 
estimate is for planning purposes only, and will have to be 
carefully evaluated for affordability within the defence services 
program, the estimate cannot de released publicly at this time.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>ROYAL CANADIAN MINT ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK180">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-41, an 
act to amend the Royal Canadian Mint Act and the Currency Act, be 
read the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK181"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
particularly like the emphasis on the hon. member. I appreciate 
being back in the House and having you in the chair. I know you 
so enjoy the opportunity of listening to the position of the 
Progressive Conservative Party on any piece of legislation, but 
particularly on Bill C-41 which is an act to amend the Royal 
Canadian Mint Act and the Currency Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it interesting to follow the hon. member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona.  It shows the diverse views in the House of 
Commons.  Obviously it also shows that philosophically there are 
many differences in positions put forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Winnipeg—Transcona indicated earlier it 
would be much better to have many more public services and public 
organizations and he talked about CN and its privatization.  I 
can assure you, Mr. Speaker, that the hon. member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona would prefer to nationalize Coca-Cola and 
have all such services provided by government as opposed to 
private sector corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-41 was introduced in the House on May 7, 1998.  From the 
beginning our party has opposed the bill and we will continue to 
oppose the bill.  The bill would allow the construction of the 
Royal Canadian Mint's new plant to manufacture coin blanks to 
compete with a plant that is already in the private sector.  We 
believe that the mint has not been forthcoming with Canadians on 
the new facility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Winnipeg—Transcona spoke glowingly about the 
potential opportunities for the new plant.  It is interesting 
that the plant is adjacent to the member's riding. It is also 
interesting that the plant is located in the riding of a minister 
of the crown, a member of the government, the foreign affairs 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about the bill just a little bit.  The minister 
mentioned that we have great pride in our Canadian currency and 
our mint.  That is true.  I suggest that this can still be 
maintained without having to put forward a capital expenditure of 
some $30 million to compete with the private sector.  The private 
sector company mentioned by the Reform Party was Westaim which I 
will get to a little bit later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say philosophically, and the government has said so 
itself in previous comments, that what the private sector can 
provide should be provided by the private sector and not by 
government.  There should not be direct competition between the 
government and the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will go back to committee.  The minister also said let 
us take it to committee, discuss it, look at it, make the 
necessary changes and bring it back to the House.  I would 
appreciate that that happened, but unfortunately I have lost a 
bit of my confidence and faith in the committee process.  When 
members of the opposition put forward amendments to legislation 
that will make the legislation better for all Canadians, it seems 
that the committee does not bring forward those amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case I wish beyond hope the committee would listen to 
what I consider to be very logical amendments that would be 
brought forward and amend the bill to improve it.  As mentioned 
by a number of other previous speakers there are very serious 
areas of concern with respect to Bill C-41.  I will review some 
of the facts and arguments members of my party have discussed in 
this case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through Bill C-41 the Liberal government has moved to increase 
the borrowing authority of the Royal Canadian Mint allowing it to 
build a coin plating plant, another patronage plum in the 
backyard of the Minister of Foreign Affairs. This facility would 
put the mint into direct competition with Westaim of Fort 
Saskatchewan, Alberta.

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because the world market for coin blanks is shrinking, either 
Westaim will be forced out of business and 110 employees will be 
in jeopardy or else the Royal Canadian Mint's new venture will go 
down in flames.  Taxpayers will be on the hook for those 
additional operating costs as well as debt servicing costs of an 
additional $30 million for a plant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a corporation right now that provides the service to the 
Royal Canadian Mint.  That corporation will be in jeopardy.  Why 
is it put in jeopardy?  Because a $30 million expenditure of 
indirect Canadian taxpayer dollars will go to compete against the 
private sector corporation.  It is not a level playing field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Westaim is a legitimate successful Canadian business that has 
supplied the Royal Canadian Mint with coin blanks for 35 years. I 
wish the members from the NDP would listen.  There are 110 
employees in this corporation who may well be in jeopardy if this 
plan of the Royal Canadian Mint goes ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The entry of the Royal Canadian Mint into the industry would 
jeopardize this Westaim division and its employees.  Industry 
experts agree that the market for coin blanks will experience a 
slight blip in demand for the Eurodollar, which is to come on in 
the next number of years, and then continue its steady decline as 
electronic transactions become more popular and the need for 
coinage and paper currency declines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not some crystal ball gazing.  This is reality.  There 
is not going to be a need for the coin blanks, the currency, 
because of electronic transfers.  We are now going to have 
overcapacity within the system with the Royal Canadian Mint 
having to compete with this private sector. The new coin plating 
plant will not only replace Westaim as the source of coin blanks 
but will compete in the world market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The costs of getting the mint into the coin blank business are 
enormous.  The $30 million announcement is just to build the 
plant.  Start-up costs are substantial for a new competitor in 
the mature to declining market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mint will have to compete against established, experienced 
well entrenched competition that has years to build expertise and 
economies of scale.  Not only will the Royal Canadian Mint have 
to continue with a high cost structure but it will, like any 
brand new business, make mistakes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize that any time government gets into business, there 
are many inefficiencies and many mistakes.  We expect that the 
mistakes will come at the cost to the Royal Canadian Mint and 
indirectly back to Canadian taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform member mentioned 30% overcapacity.  That overcapacity 
in the industry right now is between 30% and 40%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the entry of the mint into this market, it will likely 
either drive Westaim and the 110 employees out of business or 
else go spectacularly down in an inefficient operation with 
capital losses and operating losses to the Canadian public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though there is no direct subsidy being proposed in this 
venture because all moneys spent by a crown corporation reduce 
dividends paid back to the crown, ultimately the taxpayers are 
the ones who pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Westaim still has an unresolved lawsuit against the mint 
involving the softening process necessary to make the coin 
blanks.  The mint cannot legally proceed with this venture unless 
it settles both these outstanding matters, yet construction 
started in March. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was no funding available to the Royal Canadian Mint under 
law to start the construction of the plant.  However, the 
construction of the plant began in March 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  The member should check his facts.  I think what he just 
said is false. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  With respect, that 
is not a point of order; it is debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am sure the minister 
can debate that point when he gets the opportunity.  I can also 
suggest that there is a lawsuit outstanding which is factual. 
There are infringements being suggested against Westaim at this 
point.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So let us listen again.  A plant is being built yet it does not 
have the patent opportunity to develop the blanks it wants to 
produce for the world market.  Yet the plant is being constructed 
as we speak right now.  If this were a business it would have 
been bankrupt a long time ago, but it is a crown corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting government right is a Liberal government policy that has 
been in place since 1993.  Among other things it stipulates that 
where the private sector can provide a service equal or superior 
to a government department or agency, then government should not 
be in the business.  This venture violates the Liberal government 
policy. This government has said on many occasions that if the 
private sector can provide the service then government should 
stay out of it.  It is unfortunate that the government does not 
follow its own rules or its own policy in this situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only reason this is being allowed to happen is that this is 
a patronage plum in Manitoba.  I am from Manitoba and I would 
love to see as many things happen in Manitoba as possible.  But I 
wish to see them happen only according to good business practice. 
This is not one of those.  I suggest very strongly that this 
change to the legislation is simply trying to assist a business 
practice that should not have gone ahead in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One does not have to look any further than the fiasco the 
Liberal government created in the oil industry in the 1970s to 
know that it does not make any sense for the government to take 
over part of an existing industry and to compete with private 
companies.  Back then the Liberals nationalized Petrofina and 
created the national energy program.  This hurt the industry, 
cost jobs and taxpayers ended up paying out millions of dollars 
unnecessarily.  To a lesser degree this same problem will happen 
with the Royal Canadian Mint competing against the private 
sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have indicated, every bit of information we have seen 
reinforces our view that this scheme of the mint will put Westaim 
and its employees out of business and cost Canadians millions of 
dollars.  This bill would take away from parliament and by 
extension Canadians the opportunity for a full and public 
discussion on any proposed changes to Canada's coinage.  It would 
be left up to cabinet to be approved in secret, behind closed 
doors.  The bill would require that parliament be informed of the 
changes but it would not be the decision of the people or their 
representatives.  The decision would be solely that of cabinet. 
Neither would there be any requirement that Canadians be 
consulted before any changes are implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the near future it is quite possible that parliament may be 
asked to consider replacing a five dollar bill with a five dollar 
coin.  It is also possible that this House may be asked to remove 
the penny from circulation.  Because we all use these coins, 
these changes would affect all Canadians.  At the present time 
under the Royal Canadian Mint Act coins can only be introduced 
into or removed from circulation by an act of parliament.  The 
minister said today in the House that it will be elected 
representatives, that it will be the ministers of the government, 
that it will be an order in council, that it will not be an act 
of this parliament.  That is not only a shame, it is very 
dangerous in my opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Royal Canadian Mint Act coins can only be introduced 
or removed by parliament.  That is the where that decision should 
remain.  That will be one of the amendments when the bill goes 
before committee.  The government will have to look at that 
amendment very seriously as it considers changing this proposed 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on our experience with the introduction of the one dollar 
and two dollar coins in the last decade, we can expect that 
Canadians would want an opportunity for a full and public debate 
on any proposed changes to their money, not cabinet's money, not 
government's money, their money.  By requiring that parliament 
pass a law to implement such changes, the present legislation 
process allows for this.  Any bill to introduce or remove a coin 
would have to receive three readings in both the Commons and the 
Senate.  It would have to pass through two committees that could 
interview witnesses or hold public hearings before they give 
approval.  This would not be the case if this legislation were to 
pass. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give the government three reasons why this bill should 
not pass in the form in which it has been presented.  It violates 
the existing government policy of getting government right.  I 
hope the government is listening.  That policy was first launched 
in 1994 by Treasury Board.  That initiative examines how existing 
government services can best be delivered to Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Government services that can best be delivered by the provinces, 
by the private sectors or that no longer have public policy 
purpose are divested.  Building a new plating facility would put 
the Government of Canada in competition against its own current 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it exposes scarce tax dollars to needless risk.  The 
venture would put the Canadian government into a start-up 
business in a sunset industry where there is already a 
substantial oversupply in the market.  Take business risks but we 
do so in a planned, orderly fashion.  Look at the marketplace. 
Look at the cost of operation.  Look at the capital requirements. 
Then say can we make money at this or not.  In this particular 
business it is our opinion that the Canadian mint will be hard 
pressed to make this a paying operation of the business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last and probably most important, and even my colleagues in the 
NDP would agree with me, this particular operation puts in 
jeopardy 110 to 120 jobs at Westaim.  I suspect putting any job 
in jeopardy would not be supported by any party of this House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK182"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, he mentioned that you had the honour of sitting in the 
big seat and listening to his diatribe.  I get tired of listening 
to it.  We all know he is going to vote for Joe Clark tomorrow. 
There are no new ideas coming from the Conservative Party, 
especially the member from Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He falsely accused the most hon. member in the House, the member 
for Winnipeg—Transcona, about wanting to privatize Coca-Cola. 
The actual issue is that after CN was privatized and has made 
money, it just laid off another 3,000 employees and their 
families.  Volvo, a profitable corporation, laid off 223 
employees.  Air Atlantic laid off 525.  The list goes on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He remarked about people being laid off from profitable 
corporations, and the list goes on about what these corporations 
do in Canada, with absolutely no respect for the employees and 
their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like his comment on the fact that he is against crown 
corporations and against any kind of government intervention in 
companies and for the decency and honour for the employees.  What 
does he have to say about profitable corporations that make a lot 
of money but continue to lay off employees, disrupt their 
families and only pay interest to their shareholders? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I said when I first 
stood up, philosophically the member for Winnipeg—Transcona and 
I are diametrically opposed in our beliefs with respect to 
privatization and nationalization of services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not accuse the member for Winnipeg—Transcona of wanting 
to nationalize Coca-Cola.  I suggested that corporations may well 
not be one of the finest words in the vocabulary of the NDP 
government.  Corporations are a very important and necessary 
engine of our economy in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only philosophically do Progressive Conservatives and the 
NDP differ but the hon. member who posed the question may have 
some difficulty arguing with himself right now. Quite frankly 
what is going is going to jeopardize 110 jobs.  These are jobs in 
the private sector.  We talk about CN, we talk about Volvo, we 
talk about other corporations laying off people.  Why is it the 
hon. member has no heart for the 110 people who are already 
employed in this industry?  It is an industry that has 
overcapacity.  When there is too much capacity in the marketplace 
there are going to be layoffs. These people are going to be 
jeopardized by that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the hon. member worried about other jobs and other 
corporations but in this particular case, where it is proven, he 
does not have any compassion for these 110 people? 
<P><A NAME="LINK183"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I simply cannot believe my ears. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the lone Tory from the west which candidate 
he is going to vote for tomorrow in the PC leadership campaign. 
I could not believe, quite frankly, that he would be voting for 
Joe Who.  If he is, if that is indeed true, it really calls into 
question not only his opinion about leadership for his failing 
party but his opinion about everything, including the bill under 
discussion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was not going to, as a 
paid political announcement, mention at all that there will be a 
leadership vote for the Progressive Conservatives tomorrow night, 
October 24.  I stand here very proudly and inform the members of 
the House that yes, I do support the Right Hon. Joe Clark as the 
next leader of the Progressive Conservatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member also suggested that as the lone Tory in western 
Canada I take some great pride in being that lone Tory.  I would 
like to see where the members are for the Reform Party in 
Ontario.  I see they are perhaps a little lacking in that area of 
the rest of Canada, including Ontario, Quebec and the Atlantic 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Monday there will hopefully be a new leader of the 
Progressive Conservatives.  Our policy will remain Conservative 
policy.  If it were our government in place, this piece of 
legislation would not be before the House right now. 
<P><A NAME="LINK184"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage—Lisgar, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, this is getting very interesting but maybe a little off 
topic.  Just to prove how far off base the Conservatives are, we 
have a tremendous candidate running for the Conservatives with a 
new vision, with new ideas, who would probably make a tremendous 
prime minister, but the only Conservative from Brandon—Souris 
will not support this gentleman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the hon. member if Mr. Pallister wins the leadership 
whether he will be prepared to resign his seat so that he can 
really become the leader of the Conservatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Mr. Speaker, thank you for an 
opportunity to rebut.  The hon. member said “we have a candidate 
running in the leadership”.  I take it the hon. member has now 
taken back his Progressive Conservative membership, because he 
obviously includes himself in our party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also suggested that if Brian Pallister should win I should 
give up my seat.  I seem to understand, now that the hon. member 
is so infatuated with this member, that he now calls himself one 
of us. He comes from that same riding.  Perhaps it would be best 
if that member for Portage—Lisgar gave up his seat so that the 
new leader of the party could run. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I wish to advise the lone 
Tory in Manitoba that when it comes to anybody being laid off in 
this country, losing their job, the one party they can always 
count on for support is the New Democratic Party of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member mentioned the 110 jobs that are apparently going 
to be lost because of this bill.  I would like him to clarify 
where exactly in the bill it states that and how does he come to 
his conclusions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Mr. Speaker, once again if the member 
was listening I said these 110 jobs are in jeopardy.  The reason 
they are in jeopardy is unfair, unlevel playing field competition 
with government to private sector corporations. That is what I 
said and that is what is in the bill. Borrowing has now increased 
to $75 million under the bill to the Royal Canadian Mint or to 
the Royal Canadian Mint Act. There are inequities with respect to 
government competition with the private sector.  Yes, 110 jobs 
are in jeopardy because of this act. 
<P><A NAME="LINK185"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon—Humboldt, Ref.):</B>   Mr. 
Speaker, it is very important that we put this issue to rest 
here.  It is important that everyone understands that the hon. 
member for Portage—Lisgar defeated Brian Pallister in the last 
election.  The member for Brandon—Souris should be the one to 
resign in the event that Mr. Pallister wins leadership, because 
the member for Portage—Lisgar, the Reform member, would again 
win in a byelection because he did win by 1,500 votes over the 
Conservative candidate.  Unless the Conservative candidate wants 
to come back for a second defeat, so be it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I think the hon.

response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we are kind of getting 
off topic. However, I do enjoy the bit of banter between 
Reformers and Progressive Conservatives.  It seems they have some 
concern that perhaps there may well be some more Progressive 
Conservatives in western Canada to augment their strength in the 
other parts of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for Portage—Lisgar won by only 1,500 votes, I 
would suspect that he would want to make sure that if there is a 
new leader and Brian Pallister should be that leader he would 
take the opportunity of putting his seat on the line to ensure 
that the new leader, Brian Pallister, finds his seat in 
Portage—Lisgar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the member for Portage—Lisgar would like to take the 
challenge because he is a man of integrity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Is the House ready 
for the question?
