	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased today to introduce
					 an amendment to the Canada Post Act, which would enable all the little rural
					 mail contractors to be exempted from section 13.5 of the Canada Post Act in
					 order to have the ability to negotiate under the Canada Labour Code.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unacceptable that after 20 years of existence,
					 Canada Post, which now has earnings in the millions and pays out some very
					 substantial dividends to the government, would have a legislative provision
					 allowing it to snub the demands of some 6,000 workers in Canada, people who in
					 many cases are earning less than minimum wage.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is unjust, when their employer is likely going to
					 provide its sole shareholder, the federal government, with $200 million in
					 dividends this year.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill is being introduced on behalf of these
					 workers.</p>

					 Act (parole hearings).</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the
					 opportunity to introduce my private member's bill entitled, an act to amend the
					 Corrections and Conditional Release Act, specifically with respect to parole
					 hearings.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would amend the Corrections and Conditional
					 Release Act to permit a victim of an offence to read at a parole hearing a
					 statement describing the harm done to or the loss suffered by the victim
					 arising from the commission of an offence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill is a logical extension to the changes made to
					 the criminal code in Bill C-79, the victim's rights act, adopted by the House
					 in the 36th parliament.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-79 contained a provision granting victims the
					 right to provide an oral or written statement at the time of
					 sentencing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my understanding that departmental policy does
					 exist allowing victims of crime to present oral statements at parole hearings,
					 however there is nothing expressly provided in statute governing the practice
					 and policy can be changed at any time, as we know.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My private member's bill would guarantee victims the
					 right to make an oral statement if they so choose. I look forward to debating
					 the bill further in the House and I sincerely hope it gains the opportunity to
					 be made votable.</p>

					 to the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, the following questions will be answered
					 today: Nos. 68 and 70.</p>


	<p>[<i>Text</i>]</p>


	<center><b>Question No. 68--</b></center>
		

	<b>Mr. Rick
					 Borotsik</b>:<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the communications branch of the
					 Department of Agriculture: (<i>a</i>) what is its total budget for the
					 2000-2001 fiscal year; and (<i>b</i>) what did the April 6, 2001, EKOS Inc.
					 research contract cost?</p>


	<b>Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of
					 Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.)</b>: <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communication branch budget for the fiscal year 2000-01
					 A-base budget was $5,260,000. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of the April 6, 2001, Ekos Inc. research
					 contract cost $77,688.63 for 12 focus groups held across Canada. </p>


	<center><b>Question No. 70--</b></center>
		

	<b>Mr. Rick Borotsik</b>:
				  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What measures has the government taken to ensure that
					 cross-border trade of agriculture products with the United States is not being
					 disrupted following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks?</p>


	<b>Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of
					 Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.)</b>: <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the government would like to express
					 appreciation for the patience, co-operation and flexibility shown by producers,
					 processors and distributors during this time of disruption following the
					 terrorist attacks. Canada’s overreaching priority must be the safety and
					 security of our borders and citizens. In view of the acts of terrorism, customs
					 authorities in both Canada and the U.S. are more vigilant at ports of
					 entry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government recognizes the importance of maintaining
					 trade, while at the same time mitigating the risks related to the health and
					 safety to the public. In the case of agricultural commodities, the Canadian
					 Food Inspection Agency, CFIA, works with customs officials by inspecting
					 products for health and safety requirements, which facilitates the movement of
					 all commodities, especially perishable shipments and live animals.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the early days following September 11, when
					 large backlogs existed, initiatives such as expediting shipping lanes for the
					 above commodities were employed. Through the dedicated work and co-operation of
					 customs officials, CFIA and other departments, delays at the border have now
					 been largely eliminated and presently we are not experiencing undue delays.
					 CFIA continues to work closely with U.S. counterparts to focus resources on
					 high risk products and carriers as a first priority. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CFIA’s web page http://www.inspection.gc.ca/ links
					 to Canada Customs and Revenue Agency’s web page, which provides an estimate of
					 border delays to assist exporters in planning their shipments. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to speak to this
					 important bilateral free trade initiative between Canada and Costa Rica on
					 behalf of the Minister for International Trade.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to offer our congratulations to several
					 people: to our colleague from Ottawa Centre, the chair of the trade
					 subcommittee, who held hearings on the bill; to our colleague, the member for
					 Etobicoke--Lakeshore, who is the chair of the sugar caucus as it is called and
					 who had some very important input, along with other colleagues, on the
					 legislation; and, indeed, to all members of SCFAIT, the Standing Committee on
					 Foreign Affairs and International Trade. I, on behalf of the minister, would
					 like to thank both the opposition members and the government members for the
					 good and co-operative spirit in which they worked on the legislation. We were
					 able to move the legislation along at a very good pace. On behalf of the
					 Minister for International Trade, we offer our thanks and appreciation for the
					 work that was well done.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now in the final stage of debate on the
					 Canada-Costa Rica free trade agreement implementation act. I welcome the
					 opportunity to address the House on this important matter.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, before I get to the matter at hand, I would
					 first like to say a few words about the impact of the terrible events of
					 September 11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Canadians find it difficult to believe there are
					 those who claim that our country can return to business as usual. Our economy
					 and the entire global economic system has been severely shaken by the
					 tremendous human and economic losses we experienced last month.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As members know, many sectors have felt an immediate
					 impact. The air transport, hospitality and communications industries, for
					 instance, have been hit by a dramatic and sudden reduction in consumer demand.
					 However, as you will no doubt recall, Mr. Speaker, in 1991 there was an
					 economic slowdown related to concerns about international political
					 instability. This was quickly followed by a decade of very strong
					 growth.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today there are also reasons to have faith in the
					 future. Governments of the free world, including our government, are taking
					 unprecedented steps to combat global terrorism and improve security within
					 their own borders. Economically, we know that our markets are resilient and
					 that difficulties such as those experienced at the Canada-U.S. border crossing
					 are starting to ease.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together we can overcome the inertia of fear or worry
					 and establish a new standard of normalcy now strengthened with a renewed sense
					 of purpose.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it may not be business as usual, we are certainly
					 taking care of the usual business for the good of all Canadians. The free trade
					 agreement we are discussing today is certainly an integral part of our efforts
					 in that direction.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to turn now to the benefits of the
					 Canada-Costa Rica free trade agreement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agreement in question would give Canadian
					 businesses barrier free access to the small but dynamic Costa Rican market. We
					 will see the immediate elimination of tariffs on most industrial products upon
					 implementation. This includes some key Canadian export sectors, including
					 automotive goods, environmental goods, prefabricated buildings and some
					 construction products, such as steel products. The advantages do not stop
					 there. In fact people right across the country will benefit from the
					 agreement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some 94% of Canada's current agriculture and agrifood
					 exports to Costa Rica would realize market access benefits. Significant gains
					 would be realized for products such as french fries, peas, beans, lentils and
					 other pulses, greens, fresh fruits and vegetables and processed food
					 products.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While on the subject of agriculture and agrifood, it is
					 worth noting that supply managed dairy, poultry and egg products are exempted
					 from tariff reductions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tariffs on the remainder of goods would be gradually
					 phased out over a period of either 7 or 14 years, depending on the type of
					 product.</p>


	<A NAME="T1015"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1015"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1020"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1010"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1015)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result Canadian exporters will gain an important
					 advantage over their principal competitors in the Costa Rican market, including
					 the United States, European and Asian suppliers. At the same time Canada will
					 achieve a level playing field with Costa Rica's other preferential trade
					 partners such as Mexico and Chile.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This really represents a win-win scenario in the best
					 sense of the word. Of course Costa Rica also stands to gain under this
					 agreement. One of the most important benefits for this small country is the
					 asymmetrical treatment that the Canada-Costa Rican free trade agreement
					 provides for.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As members know, this means that to take into account
					 the difference in the levels of development and the size of the two economies,
					 Canada will liberalize its market more quickly than Costa Rica. We sincerely
					 believe that the government will demonstrate conclusively that free trade
					 agreements can be negotiated between larger and smaller economies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly this will also serve to advance the debate
					 taking place in the FTAA and how the interests of larger and smaller economies
					 in the region can best be reconciled. As a result, the asymmetrical aspect of
					 the agreement serves the broader interest of our country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an important point because Canada's continued
					 engagement within regional free trade agreements, such as the FTAA and the
					 NAFTA, is critical to our collective economic prosperity and social well-being.
					 After all, with a population of 800 million, the Americas is one of the fastest
					 growing markets in the world in terms of consumers and growth in per capita
					 income. Latin America and the Caribbean collectively boast a total population
					 of nearly 500 million people and the region produces a GDP of approximately $3
					 trillion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FTAA will create the conditions for greater
					 prosperity for all participants. This widespread prosperity will in turn
					 provide the poorer countries of the hemisphere with the resources to address
					 such problems as poverty, crime, environmental degradation, threats to
					 democracy and human rights.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end our efforts to liberalize trade on a
					 multilateral, regional and, as in the case of Costa Rica, bilateral level all
					 lead to the same goal: a more open rules based trading system. It is absolutely
					 fundamental to the success of our economy that with a relatively small
					 population in terms of our trading partners we have an open rules based trading
					 system. This helps to promote such a system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the elimination of tariffs is at the heart of any
					 free trade deal, the agreement between Canada and Costa Rica goes further in a
					 number of key areas. For example, the Canada-Costa Rica free trade agreement is
					 the first bilateral free trade agreement including innovative stand alone
					 procedures on trade facilitation which will reduce costs and red tape for
					 Canadian businesses at the border.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has special significance far beyond this
					 particular agreement. Within the World Trade Organization, Canada has long been
					 a leading proponent for binding rules and disciplines on trade facilitation.
					 This agreement also includes a precedent setting framework for competition
					 policy which could serve as a model for the region in the context of the free
					 trade area of the Americas.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, as a country that draws great benefit from
					 foreign trade, Canada is working very hard to strengthen the rules based
					 international trading system. That is why we strongly support the launch of a
					 new WTO negotiation round. We are working closely with our trading partners,
					 including the United States, the EU, Japan and key developing countries, to
					 build support for new negotiations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect I have to note that when I represented
					 our colleague, the Minister for International Trade, in Shanghai last June, I
					 saw how highly respected he is personally by the trading partners in APEC in
					 the leadership that he has shown. That leadership deserves to be recognized
					 here today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WTO members have many difficult issues left to resolve
					 before the meeting scheduled to take place in Doha, but I believe that with
					 political will on all sides we can make good progress in bridging the
					 differences among members. A key to success in this area is to demonstrate to
					 smaller countries that they stand to benefit from liberalized trade. Agreements
					 like the Canada-Costa Rica free trade agreement do just that.</p>


	<A NAME="T1020"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1020"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1025"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1015"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1020)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To digress from my text for a moment, I know that in
					 discussion with many groups in my own riding and in other parts of Canada, the
					 support for free trade in this country is quite strong. It is in the order of
					 some 70% to 75%. Much of it is based on the fact that Canadians expect that
					 there will not be losers in free trade. The basic fairness of Canadians comes
					 into play here when they say that they are for free trade. Most, with their
					 eyes open, understand how it has benefited our economy. However, they expect
					 that it will also benefit the economies of the developing countries of the
					 world. I think that is the Canadian basic sense of fair play. Much of their
					 support is contingent on us doing everything possible to ensure that, and that
					 is exactly what we are working toward as a country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I could turn now to the somewhat contentious issue
					 of side agreements in the areas of environment and labour. Until now I have
					 only addressed some of the many economic benefits of this free trade agreement.
					 While they are of course central, they are not the only advantages that flow
					 from this agreement. After all, while pursuing the goal of liberalized trade,
					 we owe it to future generations to ensure that this increased economic activity
					 is also sustainable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, as a progressive and democratic
					 society we have a special responsibility to foster improved environment and
					 labour standards in those countries where we do business. I am pleased to note
					 that parallel agreements in both these key areas were also
					 negotiated.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of the growing economic, environmental and
					 social links between our two countries, both agreed that a commitment to
					 environmental and labour co-operation, along with the effective enforcement of
					 domestic laws, should go hand in hand with free trade. These parallel
					 agreements will ensure that we not only reap economic benefits but important
					 social benefits as well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Mr. Juan Somaria, the director general of the
					 International Labour Organization, recently stated in Ottawa that he supported
					 side agreements and that Canada had been very creative in using these side
					 agreements.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a meeting of the trade subcommittee, I personally
					 had an opportunity to explore this with the director general of the ILO. Some
					 of our colleagues, specifically those in the New Democratic Party, are saying
					 that we must have these environmental and labour agreements right in the text
					 of our trade deals. Therefore, I put the question to the director of the ILO as
					 to whether he supported that. Quite frankly, he said no. He said he supported
					 and congratulated Canada very effusively for its creative use of side
					 agreements. He said that we take what tools we have and make progress that way.
					 I think it came as a bit of an eye-opener for the NDP members at that
					 particular meeting.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this same issue, I had an opportunity to attend a
					 conference representing my colleague the Minister for International Trade where
					 we talked about trade and the benefits to less developed countries. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, there are colleagues in this House who talk
					 about EU and cite it as a very advanced organization in its trade and other
					 practices. EU ministers are adamant that we not litter up trade deals by trying
					 to include environmental and labour standards in those trade deals. It is best
					 done in side agreements. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the view I believe of all parties in this
					 House, save and except for the NDP. It is certainly the view of this
					 government. It is the view expressed earlier this week by the director general
					 of the ILO. It is important that his support and congratulation for Canada be
					 noted.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the Canada-Costa Rica environmental
					 co-operation agreement includes obligations which provide for high levels of
					 environmental quality and effective enforcement of environmental laws which
					 promote open, transparent and equitable, judicial and administrative
					 procedures. It provides for public accountability for those commitments to
					 effectively enforce environmental laws. It will also seek to involve the
					 public, as appropriate, in all aspects of the implementation of the
					 agreement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the labour front, the two countries have signed the
					 Canada-Costa Rica agreement on labour co-operation.</p>


	<A NAME="T1025"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1025"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1030"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1020"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1025)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main elements of this agreement include: coverage
					 of industrial relations; employment standards and occupational safety and
					 health; a mechanism allowing the public to raise concerns about the application
					 of labour law in the other country; and development assistance to help the
					 Costa Rican department of labour and social welfare improve its institutional
					 capacity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, time does not allow me to catalogue all
					 the benefits of our free trade agreement. However I believe it is clear from
					 the examples I have outlined today, as well as from the comments from many
					 other members who took part in this debate on both sides of the House, that the
					 Canada-Costa Rica free trade agreement is another step in the right direction
					 for Canada. Like other free trade agreements that came before, this one will
					 contribute to Canada's long term prosperity as well as help us achieve our
					 broader goal for international trade liberalization.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, it represents a symbol of our faith in the
					 future. The Canada-Costa Rica free trade agreement is a definitive response to
					 those who seek to sever the lines of communication between nations and retreat
					 into a medieval isolation. Canada will never find itself among those timid
					 souls. Free trade is as much about ideas and values as it is about goods and
					 services. Let us increase such exchanges.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been an honour for me to speak on the debate
					 today and to congratulate and thank those who participated on both sides of the
					 House on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for International Trade. I
					 welcome the support of all members of the House who surely must see the
					 undeniable benefits of the agreement.</p>

					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to talk to Bill C-32, an act
					 to implement the free trade agreement between Canada and the Republic of Costa
					 Rica.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the bill is to implement the free trade
					 agreement with Costa Rica, the objective of which is to establish free trade
					 between the two countries by gradually eliminating barriers to trade in goods
					 and services.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will put a summary at the front end, which is that
					 this is not a controversial bill, with one singular exception. I believe, as
					 the parliamentary secretary made reference to, that we have dealt with that
					 quite adequately at committee. We tried very hard to make that a co-operative
					 arrangement with the government. The compromise we came to hopefully will stand
					 the test of time. This will be seen as time marches on. I will certainly be
					 getting into that in some detail during my presentation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill follows the free trade agreement with Chile in
					 1997 and NAFTA in 1994. One of the major stated purposes is to promote regional
					 integration through an instrument that contributes to the establishment of the
					 free trade area of the Americas, the so-called and so-named FTAA negotiations.
					 This could be the first of several of these agreements with other countries in
					 South and Central America. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eighty per cent of what Costa Rica exports to Canada,
					 primarily fruit, vegetables, coffee and coal, already enters Canada duty free.
					 Canada was looking to expand its market for some specific things.
					 Interestingly, french fries, metal structures, fish, paper products, auto
					 parts, plastics, wood and agricultural products were among that mix. These
					 products had very high tariff rates applied to them. One interesting example is
					 french fries. Even though Costa Rica does not grow potatoes, it has a 41%
					 tariff on imported french fries. This shows the need for tariff reductions on
					 all kinds of fronts. That was very much a focus of these
					 negotiations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2000, Canada's total exports to Costa Rica were
					 about $86 million. In the same year we imported $183 million worth of products
					 from Costa Rica. These are Government of Canada statistics and I do recognize
					 that there is some difficulty in identifying exactly what are the imports and
					 exports because some of them flow through the United States and are attributed
					 in that fashion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Alliance promotes free trade and the joint
					 elimination of tariffs with our trading partners. We support securing access to
					 international markets through the negotiation of trade agreements. We will
					 vigorously pursue reduction of international trade barriers, tariffs and
					 subsidies. Additionally, we will ensure that Canadians' concerns about labour
					 practices, environmental protection and human rights are reflected in these
					 agreements.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did mention that there was one aspect of the bill
					 that was contentious. I will spend some time making reference to it. It is an
					 industry that is important to us. I am talking about the domestic sugar
					 industry. Historically we have grown sugar beets in Canada in many provinces,
					 and now, based on a closure of export opportunities with our trading partners,
					 sugar is one of the most protected markets in the world. Canada has the most
					 open market in the world for sugar.</p>


	<A NAME="T1035"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1035"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1040"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1030"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1035)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has transpired is that we have one sugar beet
					 producing province left, which is Alberta. We have gone from seven sugar
					 refineries not very many years ago to three. Those refineries have made major
					 capital expenditures to ensure that they operate with world class
					 efficiency.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We basically are supplying our own domestic industry
					 with our own refined sugar. We are importing a lot of raw cane sugar. We
					 produce beet sugar and have almost no export opportunity. For example our total
					 export opportunity to the United States at this time is, I believe, 10,000
					 tonnes, which works out to one tenth of 1% of its total consumption. We are
					 facing tariffs on exports to other countries in the Americas of anywhere
					 between 50% and 160%. Our only protection for our domestic industry is an 8%
					 tariff or about $30 a tonne. It is a very small tariff and we do not subsidize
					 our sugar industry in any other way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an example, Costa Rican sugar prices are about $650
					 a tonne higher than world prices. What that really means is that Costa Rica can
					 cross-subsidize any exports of its sugar anywhere in the world, including
					 Canada. What this has done of course is create a lopsided agreement on sugar.
					 In a sense we have sacrificed our sugar industry in many agreements. That is
					 why our place in the sugar world has shrunk.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very significant concern came forward from the
					 refiners and the growers as represented by the Canadian Sugar Institute. They
					 felt that although the bill would not be in itself a major problem because
					 Costa Rica has no refining capacity, if the market provisions of this agreement
					 were to be built into the ongoing negotiations with central American countries
					 such as Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and so on, or with the free trade area
					 of the Americas, we basically could write off our sugar industry. We would be
					 doing that in a non-free trade environment because no one else is practising
					 free trade. We believe in free trade but it has to be fair trade.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will move on to some of the important parts of the
					 agreement. We as a nation of 31 million people have entered into an agreement
					 with Costa Rica, which has a population of less than 4 million, no military and
					 longstanding democratic traditions and institutions. This is an important
					 agreement because Costa Rica is very much viewed as a stable, democratic entity
					 in that part of the world and one that we should be doing our utmost to do
					 business with and to practise the purest of free trade with if we
					 can.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians have a lot of investments in Costa Rica. The
					 Bank of Nova Scotia has 12 branches. Hollinger owns the newspaper <i>La
					 República</i>. Canada has major solid waste treatment facilities, hotels and
					 tourism oriented enterprises and Hydro-Québec is involved in a large hydro
					 generating station in Costa Rica. Our total capital investment is running at
					 about $500 million. I think investors have had generally pleasant
					 experiences.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That gives a good summary of where we are. I will move
					 now into the area of some of the things that would be exempt from tariff
					 reductions under this agreement. Canada has a long tradition, under the Liberal
					 government, of exempting some things from tariff reductions. They are simply
					 not on the table. There is no change from that in this agreement. Exempted from
					 tariff reductions from our perspective are beef, culture and our supply managed
					 industries such as dairy, poultry and egg products.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic message is that when government negotiators
					 negotiate a free trade agreement or any kind of international trade agreement,
					 they do have to make choices. I believe, and I know others believe, that
					 historically we have tended to sell out our sugar industry. This agreement is
					 viewed as being no exception.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our single protection for the sugar industry is an 8%
					 tariff. As I mentioned, the lowest in the Americas is 50%, up to 160%, for all
					 of our competitors. Canada is basically excluded from any ability to export
					 beyond our boundaries for any significant amount of sugar. Nothing would change
					 under this agreement. It is a very lopsided agreement in regard to our access
					 to their sugar market. In the words of the industry, it is token
					 access.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to quote from the website of the Canadian
					 Sugar Institute, which states:</p>

<td><small>The recently announced Canada-Costa
						  agreement is a case in point. Costa Rica has a 50% tariff compared to Canada's

						  above the Canadian and even the supported US price. Yet, Costa Rica is
						  demanding approximately six times more duty free access than it is willing to

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is referring to the Canadian government. The CA-4
					 talks are to be held with the Central American countries I referred to earlier.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what they were saying prior to the bill getting
					 to committee. These are some of the other things and some of the background of
					 the Canadian producers. There is only one beet sugar factory remaining in
					 Canada. It is in Taber, Alberta. At one time beets were also grown and
					 processed in Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada has three refineries that process raw sugar.
					 They are in Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver. In the past 20 years four other
					 refineries have ceased operations. The total Canadian market for sugar is about
					 1.2 million tonnes. Beet sugar supplies about 10% of this amount. Of the
					 remaining 1.1 million tonnes a small but significant portion is imported into
					 Canada in a refined state.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugar is one of the world's most trade regulated
					 commodities. Most countries severely restrict imports through a system of
					 duties, quotas or other mechanisms. Canada is among the most liberal countries
					 in the world with an 8% duty on refined sugar and free import of raw
					 sugar.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guatemala places a 160% duty on sugar imports. Canada
					 is allowed to export only about 12,000 tonnes of sugar to the U.S. due to its
					 quota system. This is sugar from beet sugar as restricted by country of origin
					 rules. No other viable export opportunities exist for the Canadian industry. In
					 other words we are locked into our domestic market.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have covered the basics of the sugar situation fairly
					 well. It is worth adding that the Costa Rican market currently does not include
					 refined sugar. Only raw sugar is sold. The fact that we have gained entry into
					 the Costa Rican market is academic from the standpoint that there is no current
					 market. Its domestic prices are about $650 a tonne more than world prices.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leads to cross-subsidization. It also leads us to
					 ask why would they import sugar if they have those kinds of domestic pricing
					 arrangements.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will go into this a bit further. Guatemala is one of
					 the CA-4 countries. CA-4 will be the next set of negotiations on free trade
					 along with the free trade area of the Americas. Guatemala's current sugar
					 exports amount to about 1.2 million tonnes. That is virtually identical to the
					 entire Canadian market. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CA-4 countries, the four major countries in Central
					 America, have current export surpluses in refined sugar of about 300,000
					 tonnes. That is without further investment in refining capacity or anything
					 else. That is immediately available capacity. This could totally displace the
					 entire western Canadian market, which is the most likely place for these
					 exports to arrive because their ports are on the Pacific coast.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a major concern. One can understand why members
					 of parliament from every part of Canada are receiving a lot of solicitation
					 from sugar refiners, sugar growers and the Canadian Sugar Institute, and why
					 they are taking the Costa Rica agreement so seriously. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it were to be a precedent for the next negotiations
					 we could see the sugar industry in Canada, a non-subsidized industry protected
					 by a tiny tariff, swallowed up with a loss of 1,500 refinery jobs and about 500
					 grower jobs. I am not sure anyone would consider this to be free trade in the
					 sense of unsubsidized industries competing with unsubsidized industries. It is
					 not. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the House of Commons we have something called the
					 national sugar caucus to which the parliamentary secretary made reference. Some
					 of the hon. members on the sugar caucus were also on the committee which met
					 earlier this week and heard witnesses representing the Canadian Sugar
					 Institute, sugar refiners and beet growers. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that meeting I tabled amendments to the preamble of
					 the bill, not to the treaty, to give clarity to the fact that the sugar
					 provisions should be seen as unique to the Costa Rica agreement and not as a
					 precedent for the upcoming CA-4 negotiations or the free trade area of the
					 Americas negotiations. What ended up deriving from discussions among all
					 parties at the meeting was that I would withdraw the amendment if we could
					 somehow build a similar thought process into the language of our report and a
					 subsequent letter to the minister.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is where we are. I can quote from the third report
					 to the House of Commons which was tabled recently. I will outline the relevant
					 paragraph. The Sub-committee on International Trade, Trade Disputes and
					 Investment, which is an offshoot of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs
					 and International Trade, is studying the bill. It stated:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The Sub-committee wishes to highlight
						  the specific concerns of Canada's sugar industry and asks that their interests
						  be taken into account in any future trade negotiations involving
						  Canada.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what we did. I am hopeful the government and
					 government mandated negotiators will take heed that those are the sentiments
					 expressed by the all party subcommittee. It was done in the right spirit and
					 with good intentions on all sides. It is an eminently correct way to proceed in
					 our future negotiations.</p>

					 BQ): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, the Bloc Quebecois supported this bill at
					 second reading. I refer to the Canada-Costa Rica free trade implementation
					 act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member for Joliette, who is responsible for this
					 matter, moved some amendments in committee. However, even though at second
					 reading we supported the principle of the bill, we said we had serious
					 misgivings. None of these serious misgivings were settled during committee
					 deliberations so today we will vote against this bill at third
					 reading.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not that we do not support free trade, because I
					 think everyone knows we do. However we support it on the condition that free
					 trade does not lead to the stronger dominating the weaker. Free trade must
					 improve the economies and the rights of all countries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had and continue to have three major complaints. The
					 first is a matter of principle. Since the Bloc arrived in the House, it has
					 protested as each new international treaty, trade agreement or convention comes
					 to the attention of the House after the government had already reached its
					 decision. We find this a rather backward way for parliament to
					 operate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government cannot point to the British parliament
					 in defence of this approach, which is neither transparent or consultative,
					 either civil society or parliament, since, surprise, surprise, Great Britain
					 has itself changed its approach and consults its parliament.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We find ourselves in a situation where our debates on
					 the content take place after the treaty is signed. This is the case with the
					 implementation bill before us. In the course of the debate in principl, the
					 government side says “But you have the implementation act. You can vote on an
					 implementation act”. Yes, but the problem is that although we can vote on it
					 and against it we can do nothing to change it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the point of a parliament that can only express
					 views and not change anything? That is the situation in which the Parliament of
					 Canada finds itself and this must change.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My former colleague, the member for
					 Beauharnois--Salaberry, presented a private member's bill that was not selected
					 for debate in the House. I presented the same bill. I hope that this time it
					 will be deemed votable and a majority of members will have changed their minds
					 so that this parliament can modernize the way it proceeds and can take into
					 account, in its extremely important international dealings that affect the
					 lives of Canadians and Quebecers, the notion of respect for
					 consultation.</p>


	<A NAME="T1100"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1100"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1105"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1055"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1100)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to providing no opportunity for input,
					 there are two other elements that we find completely unacceptable about this
					 approach. The first is an obvious lack of transparency. The government is
					 always saying that it is the best in the world when it comes to transparency,
					 but when it talks about transparency it refers people to an Internet site. This
					 is not what democracies consider transparency. Throughout Quebec and Canada
					 many people are suffering because of this situation. There is a lack of
					 transparency. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the issue of disregard for provincial
					 jurisdiction. When Canada signs these trade agreements or international
					 conventions, not only is it acting within its own jurisdiction but it is also
					 acting within that of the provinces. We cannot gloss over this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this is not the reason we will be voting
					 against the bill at third reading. We agree on the content of this
					 implementation act, and we could vote in support of it after having the chance
					 to speak eloquently to the issue. However, there are two other serious problems
					 with this trade agreement and its content, and, consequently, the
					 implementation act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This free trade agreement with Costa Rica was signed on
					 April 21, 2001, after negotiations conducted while preparing for the summit of
					 the Americas that was held in Quebec City on the free trade area of the
					 Americas, an issue that is still of interest to Quebecers and Canadians. Here
					 again, if that free trade agreement is signed, it will have an impact on our
					 lives. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the preparations for the Quebec summit, the
					 government stressed through, among others the Minister for International Trade,
					 that it agreed with numerous observers that the way NAFTA, the free trade
					 agreement among Canada, the United States and Mexico, deals with issues
					 relating to foreign investments is not the appropriate way. The Minister for
					 International Trade said, and I quote “Canada is not advocating the replication
					 of NAFTA investor state rules in the FTAA.”</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister added “--and has not supported the
					 proposals made so far by other FTAA countries to include such a type of dispute
					 settlement mechanism”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can give the address of the Internet site where this
					 quote from the minister is to be found.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time that the minister was making that
					 statement, he was negotiating to renew the free trade agreement with Costa Rica
					 that had first been signed in 1998. He was very proud when he showed up with
					 this renewed free trade agreement with Costa Rica. We noticed that the rules in
					 the agreement between Canada and Costa Rica to settle disputes between
					 investors and states are exactly the same as those found in NAFTA. </p>


	<A NAME="T1105"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1105"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1110"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1100"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1105)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In committee, I pointed this out to the minister. He
					 turned to his negotiator, who said “No, the member is mistaken. That is not the
					 case. What we have renewed is a foreign investment protection
					 agreement”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oddly enough, this foreign investment protection
					 agreement, or FIPA as it is called, contains the very same provisions as
					 chapter 11 of NAFTA, which many people with an active interest in free trade
					 agreements oppose.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can this be explained? Not too easily, and it is a
					 big concern. It is why my colleague, the young and brilliant member for
					 Joliette, brought forward an amendment on this issue in committee. He suggested
					 that the bill be amended by replacing the wording in the agreement signed by
					 the government with the following “dispute settlement, by providing for the
					 repeal of article 12 of the agreement between the Government of Canada and the
					 Government of Costa Rica concerning the encouragement and protection of
					 investments”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the important thing to understand, even if it
					 seems complicated, is that, until 1993, all agreements signed by Canada with
					 other countries were based on the principle that, when there was a dispute over
					 foreign investment--if there was nationalization, a government policy, rules
					 which seemed to prevent a company from setting up business, or a dispute of any
					 sort--the rule was that the two states discussed the problem and, if no
					 agreement was reached, they could take their case to a tribunal. That was for
					 two states.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When NAFTA was signed by Canada, Mexico and the United
					 States, this approach, which had been recommended by the OECD, by the way, was
					 replaced by the principle whereby an investor who has cause to complain may
					 bypass its state of origin and take its case directly to a tribunal.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This possibility, this capacity awarded to investors,
					 has had disastrous effects on the role played by states.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With NAFTA we are beginning to see that the settlements
					 coming out of these tribunals, which operated in a totally secret and discreet
					 way until this summer's agreement and which does not change their intrinsic
					 nature, make it possible for an investor to take the state in which he has
					 invested before a tribunal which is all powerful. This is so much the case that
					 private tribunals have in secret, without a third party being allowed to attend
					 to listen in on the proceedings or make representations, made decisions that
					 equated a governmental decision, to protect the environment for example, with a
					 measure that would reduce profits. </p>


	<A NAME="T1110"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1110"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1115"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1105"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1110)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was very far removed from the principle of
					 nationalization for which compensation was required. Loss of profit was
					 considered as something for which the state should compensate. I believe
					 everyone agrees on the effect of this. It is that businesses in countries
					 needing investment, and some here in Canada as well, will launch huge suits,
					 because they are allowed to do so, in order to get government policies
					 withdrawn.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Quebec, the public might perhaps tell the government
					 “Paying for that makes no sense at all. Quebec is entitled to decide on its own
					 policies, environmental or otherwise”. The situation remains, however, that the
					 fear of having to pay is going to be very great, and will run counter to the
					 democratic power of a country. This will in my opinion be even more the case
					 with the poorer countries, which are in greater need of foreign investment.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the famous NAFTA chapter 11, which sets out the
					 principle of the investor's right to challenge a state directly, this principle
					 must absolutely not be part of the free trade agreement of the Americas. If
					 Canada is to act consistently with the statements of the Minister for
					 International Trade when it renews agreements, often with developing countries,
					 it must do away with this principle, which is tantamount to investor domination
					 over states desperately in need of investments and often vulnerable.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite our speeches and our references to the Minister
					 for International Trade, after debate on whether or not it was admissible, this
					 amendment was rejected in the end.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a third and different problem, to which
					 our colleague from the Canadian Alliance referred, and that is sugar. This
					 agreement opens the market to sugar from Costa Rica. This provision, if it were
					 limited as we recommended, would not have provoked our opposition in and of
					 itself, since the sugar that Costa Rica could export to Canada would not
					 threaten the current situation in the sugar industry despite the fact that the
					 industry has some concerns.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Quebec, Lantic Sugar is located in Montreal. This is
					 a world class refinery that employs 345 employees and has just invested
					 $100 million to modernize its Montreal refinery.</p>


	<A NAME="T1115"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1115"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1120"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1110"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1115)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workers came to my office to share their fears with me
					 with respect to the talks that are currently underway with four other sugar
					 producing countries in South America, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Honduras and El
					 Salvador.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guatemala's exports of refined sugar alone represent
					 75% of the Canadian market. This gives us an idea of the size of Guatemala's
					 sugar exports. We cannot blame this country for wanting to export its sugar, to
					 the contrary. However, in Canada this refinery and the industry are telling us
					 that they themselves are in a situation where they are prevented from selling
					 products that contain a single grain of sugar in their exports to the United
					 States. Even cookies have to be made with sugar substitutes rather than sugar.
					 This shows how major the barrier is that they are facing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we and the member for Joliette proposed in
					 committee were basically two things. We proposed an amendment that read as
					 follows:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>It is understood that the agreement
						  must not serve as a model for future bilateral free trade agreements, and that
						  all future negotiations on sugar must take place in a multilateral context and
						  within the framework of the future Free Trade Area of the Americas.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that this amendment is easily understood. The
					 Bloc Quebecois and industry are not against continuing negotiations, but they
					 must take place within a multilateral framework. The idea is not to open up
					 markets to Quebec and Canada alone, but to have other markets open up at the
					 same time. This amendment was ruled out of order.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being very much pro-free trade, we are in favour of
					 bilateral agreements with countries in the southern hemisphere. We therefore
					 find ourselves in a situation where we would have liked to vote in favour of
					 this bill. Given the fact that this agreement essentially reproduces the
					 contents of chapter XI and given the government's refusal to provide assurances
					 that this agreement will not be used as a basis for other bilateral
					 negotiations before an attempt is made to sort out sugar exports within a
					 multilateral framework, we are voting against the act to implement the free
					 trade agreement at third reading to show that our concerns are
					 serious.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I wish to say that the issue of opening
					 up markets to southern hemisphere countries is fundamental. It is not a
					 question of being opposed. It is also obvious that opening up markets in this
					 way will not in itself improve the situation of southern hemisphere countries.
					 The effects on the labour force will have to be considered.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is incompatible with treaties that are negotiated in
					 secret without consulting the public and without even making provisions, as was

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot ignore the real and serious concerns of
					 industry workers. If we want to further develop this type of agreement, and we
					 do, we must do it in an open fashion, through open consultation with the
					 provinces, the workers and the public.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People in northern countries must realize that it is
					 urgent for them to have access, through southern countries and, I should say,
					 through oriental countries to the markets of the richest countries. In order to
					 do so, the preparation work must be based on consultation and on results, so
					 that we can indeed open up and allow for a better sharing of wealth.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oddly enough, it cannot be said that opening up
					 markets, even though everyone right now thinks it is the be all and end all, is
					 the only factor that will ensure a better sharing of wealth. If, in those
					 countries where wealth is growing there is no sharing of it, whether here, in
					 southern countries or in the orient, there are people who will get richer.
					 However, the gaps between societies will not be bridged. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One way that the European Union, among others, has
					 found to help southern or eastern countries in its bilateral relations is to
					 open up its market and buy the production but also provide real assistance by
					 injecting money to promote diversification. We cannot complain about or regret
					 the fact that some countries rely on a monoculture, that they sell only coffee
					 or peanuts, and ignore history. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If today these countries only sell coffee or peanuts,
					 it is because of what happened during the 19th century with colonial empires,
					 where industries did what they wanted and countries that had a diversified
					 production were transformed into countries relying on a monoculture.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is absolutely necessary to recognize that southern
					 hemisphere and Asian countries should diversify. Some are doing so rapidly and
					 are becoming developed countries. However, those experiencing the most
					 difficulty should be helped. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would have liked to be able to say that at last
					 parliament was consulted before the signing of a treaty. Perhaps some
					 provisions would have been included in the agreement to reassure our workers
					 and to inform the public about the needs of southern countries. Unfortunately,
					 because this was done behind closed doors, without consultation, without
					 transparency, we find ourselves in a situation where we can only say after the
					 fact that we deeply regret the way things went, and this is what I am
					 doing.</p>

					 NDP): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have an opportunity to
					 speak to Bill C-32, an act to implement the free trade agreement between the
					 Government of Canada and the government of the Republic of Costa
					 Rica.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not the intention of the New Democratic Party to
					 support the bill. That should be of no surprise as we have indicated that
					 previously. I will expand on the reasons in the next few minutes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-32 and the Canada-Costa Rica free trade
					 agreement follow the North American Free Trade Agreement and the FTAA model of
					 free trade that the New Democratic Party has consistently opposed because they
					 put corporate rights ahead of human rights, the environment and democracy.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side agreements on labour and the environment are
					 insufficient to promote higher standards across the board in these areas. Costa
					 Rica's record on labour is atrocious. We see no reason to make things
					 worse.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purported advantage of free trade in agricultural
					 products is unproven. While Canadian farmers are not seeing the benefits of
					 increased imports, the livelihood of Costa Rican farmers is endangered by an
					 agreement such as this one. Many must wonder how that would be the case.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom line is that the specific agreements are set
					 out with the right of the investors to make a profit. They are the ones who
					 benefit from these trade agreements and they do not encompass a holistic
					 approach to the well-being of a country, a community or an industry within a
					 country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hon. colleague from the Bloc mentioned that
					 colonialism in southern countries does not allow for diversification in some of
					 those countries. Quite frankly we see that happening even within Canada where
					 there is no diversity and as a result certain industries are
					 suffering.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc will not be supporting the bill at third
					 reading. I am pleased to see the Bloc come on side with the New Democratic
					 Party's view that trade agreements are not okay if they do not encompass
					 environmental rights, human rights and labour rights.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know there were numerous members from the Bloc who
					 went to Quebec City earlier this year, along with members of the New Democratic
					 Party caucus. We listened to many people from southern countries who have seen
					 the effects of trade agreements in their countries. They said that the effects
					 were not always good and in some cases were detrimental.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the National Farmers Union, Canadian
					 farmers and consumers have not benefited from increased agricultural exports,
					 nor have farmers and consumers in the developing countries to which we export.
					 The position of the governments of Costa Rica and Canada that it is a good deal
					 for everyone is just not the case. There is no benefit when products go on the
					 market at an extremely low cost. Flooding the world market with food prices far
					 below production costs damages the ability of other countries to feed their
					 citizens. That is exactly the case.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Costa Rica in 1998 a flood of cheap imported grain
					 drove the local farmers out of business. The number of farmers growing corn,
					 beans and rice, the staples of the local diet, fell from 70,000 to under
					 28,000. Therefore it was not a good deal for everyone.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem with a number of the trade deals is that
					 they put the rights of investors ahead of everything else. That is extremely
					 important to the New Democratic Party because we represent a number of people
					 who know that making a profit is not the only thing that counts.</p>


	<A NAME="T1130"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1130"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1135"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1125"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1130)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New Democrats are not opposed to trade. Trade is
					 necessary for strong economies,but not unfettered trade. Trade agreements must
					 include labour, environmental and human rights. It is absolutely a necessity,
					 and that is where we differ from the Liberals.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was absolutely shocked as I listened to the
					 Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for International Trade this morning.
					 That is the Liberal member for 
					 London--Fanshawe. He
					 referred to labour and environmental rights within trade agreements as
					 littering up the agreements. He said “environmental rights and labour rights
					 litter up the agreements”. That is like saying labour and environmental rights
					 are garbage. That is not the case. The Liberal member for London--Fanshawe
					 called environmental and labour rights garbage. If we refer to them as
					 littering up an agreement, that is not good enough.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However this sets the scope of how the government tends
					 to deal with labour and environmental rights. We have seen numerous
					 environmental issues come before the House many times where the government uses
					 tough talk but never follows through on environmental rights.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government waves the ILO banner. Costa Rica and
					 Canada would fall under the ILO banner; they would do everything it says.
					 Frankly Costa Rica has implemented more of the ILO conventions than
					 Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me tell members about the history of labour rights
					 in Costa Rica. Costa Rica is notorious for its persistent denial of labour
					 rights, especially the rights of collective bargaining, association and
					 strikes. In Costa Rica's private sector it is virtually impossible to form or
					 join a trade union because of the hostility from employers and the government's
					 unwillingness to enforce labour laws. That is Costa Rica's history. That is its
					 position on labour rights yet it has introduced more of the ILO conventions
					 than Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We acknowledge that in some areas we have been able to
					 succeed in having good labour legislation in Canada. We all know it is not
					 automatically there. The reason those rights are maintained is the strong
					 efforts of a number of labour unions, the number of people involved in social
					 justice making sure that those rights are upheld, and the legal system built
					 around that. Those things are not a given forever. Civil liberties are not a
					 given forever in Canada. We are seeing that now with the anti-terrorism bill
					 whereby our civil liberties would be jeopardized.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must ensure strong legislation dealing with
					 environmental and labour laws and the protection of privacy and civil
					 liberties. We must fight for those things on a daily basis because they are not
					 a given. It is crucially important that we do not accept willy-nilly every
					 trade agreement the government comes up with.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague from the Bloc mentioned how the deal was
					 put forward. Negotiations on the trade deal began in June 2000 and the
					 agreement was signed during the third summit of the Americas on April 23, 2001.
					 It is coming before parliament as a fait accompli. Parliament did not even have
					 a say in it. Really and truthfully we did not. The government went ahead and
					 did what it wanted. It said the heck with every elected member of parliament,
					 including its own members on that side. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not believe for a second that each and every one
					 of them told the minister to go ahead and sign the deal. I do not believe they
					 did not care or worry about our sugar producers or refineries in Alberta or
					 Quebec. However that is what the government did. It went ahead and signed it,
					 much like it did with the patent legislation. </p>


	<A NAME="T1135"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1135"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1140"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1130"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1135)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The WTO ordered Canada to change its patent legislation
					 and increase it to 20 years. We are now in a situation where we have huge drug
					 costs. Drug companies were not suffering with a seven year patent. I
					 acknowledge that there needs to be patent protection, but excessive patent
					 protection jeopardizes the well-being of a country and its citizens. We are
					 seeing that now. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These trade agreements should not be a fait accompli. A
					 booklet was passed around and I chuckled when I read the comments. It was sent
					 on October 24. It contains Canada's objectives for the fourth WTO ministerial
					 conference. I laughed because, as my hon. colleague from the Bloc mentioned,
					 there is never any consultation with the government. Everything is a fait
					 accompli. The document is from the Minister for International Trade and it
					 states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The government continues to seek
						  still better ways to inform a mutually beneficial dialogue with concerned
						  Canadians. Citizen engagement on foreign and trade policy issues is the key to
						  informed debate and decision making on public policy, and that has been an
						  ongoing process.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is the informed debate? When do we go out and
					 have a dialogue? Has anyone ever seen the government getting the views of
					 Canadians and of members of parliament? The government throws something in
					 front of Canadians and says this is the way it will be. We have to take it or
					 leave it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government will not listen to any amendments put
					 forth in committee. These are amendments that would protect industries within
					 our country and protect human, environmental and labour rights. Is any of that
					 there? No. The government does not care.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These documents are a waste of taxpayer money. They are
					 not accurate, to say nothing of the fact that we have to get ourselves around
					 the words “to inform a mutually beneficial dialogue”. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trade agreements have not benefited our agricultural
					 industry. I am encouraged by the fact that the member of the Canadian Alliance
					 for Lethbridge is here. He pointed out that in February of this year any
					 agreement with Costa Rica would lay the foundation for future negotiations on
					 trade agreements. We know that to be true because the government is following
					 along with NAFTA and the FTAA. The member went on to ask:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Will the government live up to a
						  commitment it made to western Canadian beef producers when it was in western
						  Canada last year that it will do nothing to destroy their industry?</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does anybody believe for a second that the government
					 would live up to any commitment it made during the election? We have seen the
					 government break one promise after another on a continual basis. We were
					 promised infrastructure dollars, good environmental legislation, and support
					 for our agricultural industry and grain farmers. Have we seen any
					 follow-through? It has not been followed through for one second because the
					 election is over. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government pulled the wool over the eyes of
					 Canadians once more. I will wager the government will not be able to do it in
					 the next election because Canadians are not fools.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadian farmers are not fools. Farmers know that the
					 government has not supported their industry. If they look at the facts they
					 will know the government's position that trade agreements are good for farmers
					 is not true. Farmers will see that. Farmers know that the government is not
					 supporting the agricultural industry. The beef farmers in Alberta and refinery
					 workers in Quebec will know that is not the case.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is critically important. I challenge the Canadian
					 Alliance. Every time it supports one of the government's trade deals it
					 jeopardizes the agricultural industry in Canada. Every time it supports one of
					 these deals without taking a stand it jeopardizes Canadian industries. It
					 jeopardizes human and labour rights. If it supports the government then it is
					 as detrimental to Canadian industries as the government is because it
					 jeopardizes those industries in the same way.</p>


	<A NAME="T1140"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1140"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1145"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1135"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1140)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I challenge the Canadian Alliance to say for once that
					 the trade deal is not good enough and that it is not what is best for Canadian
					 farmers. This trade deal does not include environmental rights, human rights or
					 labour rights. I would hope that members within the House do not talk like the
					 Liberal member for London--Fanshawe and call environmental rights and labour
					 rights littering up an agreement. They are equally as important as any profit
					 that will be made which will send a paycheque across some investor's table or
					 some company's table. They are important for Canadians and they are important
					 for people in those other countries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that Canada has a good standard of living
					 for the most part and we do not want to jeopardize that. That is why there are
					 those of us who fight hard to make sure that there is more to a trade deal than
					 just profit and that there is a holistic approach to a strong, healthy economy
					 and country. It is not just profit for one company.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is more to it such as the value added industry
					 that benefits the local economy. We all know that the little grocer down the
					 road and the small and medium sized businesses need those industries because
					 they benefit from the value added to those industries. We all benefit as a
					 nation by paying our fair share in taxes and supporting each other and our
					 social programs. There is more to it than just one company making a profit,
					 such as everything that goes along with having those industries within our
					 country and supporting those industries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If something reads made in Canada it is an extra
					 incentive for me to buy it because I know I am supporting an industry in Quebec
					 or an industry from the east coast. If I see Manitoba potatoes in the grocery
					 store, I will buy them before any others. That is what it is about. It is about
					 supporting each other because that is how we maintain a strong country. However
					 it is also about supporting the people in those other countries. I am not
					 saying we should never buy their products; of course we should. We want to make
					 sure that they have a chance of attaining the same benefits we have.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the classic quotes that New Democrats use is by
					 J.S. Woodsworth who said “What we desire for ourselves, we wish for all”, and
					 we do. We want people in other countries who do not have some of the advantages
					 we have to have those chances.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will they have that chance when their governments do
					 not enforce labour legislation or do not allow them the right to collective
					 bargaining or to make a decent wage for the work they do? Will they have that
					 chance when their governments do not ensure that their human rights are upheld
					 or do not give their children a chance to have an education instead of being
					 made to work at a loom or in the fields? We want the right to education for
					 children. We want the right to social infrastructure. We want people in other
					 countries to have the same benefits that we have in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The New Democratic Party is not opposed to trade.
					 However we certainly are opposed to unfettered trade. We are absolutely opposed
					 to trade that does not consider human rights, environmental rights and labour
					 rights. We are not opposed to trade, not for a second.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our national sport in Canada is hockey. Our Deputy
					 Speaker's son plays for the Montreal Canadiens. However even in hockey there
					 are rules. One team cannot be stronger than the other so it wipes out the other
					 guys. There are rules in place involving a draft process so certain players
					 cannot get all the cash and certain teams cannot get all the very best players.
					 Imagine a team with Gretzky, Lindros--</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They do not survive. That is the problem when trade

					 the speech of the member for London--Fanshawe and I did not hear that. I am
					 sure the member is mistaken.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member wants to talk as though no negotiations took
					 place and the agreement suddenly fell out of the sky. The fact is the two
					 governments dealt with environmental and labour co-operation. They go hand in

					 something that just happened. It is something that was negotiated between the
					 two parties, keeping in mind labour and the environment and the side agreements
					 on them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at the Canada--Costa Rica free trade
					 agreement, we will see that it complements the environment and labour and

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her side is indicating that somehow this did not

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I never for one second said there were not

					 That is the problem. That is the comment I was making.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Negotiations with another country before we have
					 discussions in the Parliament of Canada leave out a very important group of
					 people: the people of Canada and members of parliament who represent the people
					 of Canada. When that deal was signed without it coming here first, that said
					 “To heck with you. Your view isn't worth anything”. That has been a problem in
					 the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite frankly on the issue of a side agreement for
					 labour, human and environmental rights, when do those values become secondary
					 to a buck? That is the problem with the government's position. They should not
					 be side agreements. They should be an integral part of those trade agreements,
					 which should state that if countries do not do certain things in the area of

					 not have access to our markets.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is the government sees them as side

	Mr. Speaker, certainly I will comment. There is no
					 question both sides can benefit, but both sides do not necessarily benefit,
					 especially if we have a situation where one side decides it will ignore
					 environmental, human and labour rights and pays someone 20¢ then sells the
					 hammer for $20. Someone is losing out and I would be willing to wager it is the
					 person who is getting paid the 20¢ or some child who is ordered to make the
					 hammer. The child is paid 5¢ and the person who owns it is paid something else.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We agree it can benefit both. We are not opposed to
					 trade and never have been. However, it has to be with some rules in place that
					 make it fair for both sides.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have Canadian farmers benefited overall? They can
					 produce a product now but have to sell it for less than what it costs them to
					 produce to survive. Do we want to wipe out our farming industry and say that we
					 will not make a buck off the farming industry today, that we will let it go,
					 then a few years down the road cry and say we have no farming industry in
					 Canada? Will we say to heck with the small farmer? A big corporation from
					 somewhere else can buy up all the farmland and make maybe an extra buck by not
					 giving the same kinds of benefits to its local communities and those families
					 who are an intricate part of our community within Canada. That is when it
					 becomes a problem.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question: it can benefit both but not if
					 both sides do not play by the same rules.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I listened with great interest to the
					 comments of my hon. colleague from Churchill. I was involved in some of the
					 discussions dating way back to the 1988 election when that election basically
					 became a referendum on free trade in the country and the pending free trade
					 agreement with the United States specifically. When I listened to the NDP back
					 in those days, and I am sure if I researched history long before that, I was
					 left with the unescapable conclusion that if the NDP had its way, despite the
					 hon. member saying she is not opposed to trade, we would never have had any
					 free trade agreements signed, certainly in this hemisphere and probably in the
					 world if the NDP was a factor in other countries. It is important that people
					 bear that in mind. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also I need look no further than my province of British
					 Columbia, where thank goodness the NDP was recently thrown out of office, to
					 see what its economic policies do to an economy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it almost hypocritical when the NDP talks long
					 and hard about the downtrodden of the world. It has often remarked that we have
					 to increase our aid to developing and third world countries, help out more with
					 humanitarian aid and improve human rights. All of us would agree on that. On
					 the other hand, every time a free trade agreement comes before the House, the
					 NDP is opposed to it because it is not good enough. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask the hon. member to comment on
					 that.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am glad I have the opportunity to
					 comment. The New Democratic Party has never been opposed to trade. I would
					 suggest to the member that he go back in history and also listen to numerous
					 members of parliament or MLAs from the provinces. They are not opposed to
					 trade. We are in favour of trade that considers more than just the dollar
					 coming across the table. We are in favour of trade deals that consider human,
					 environmental and labour rights. There is no question about it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding my colleague's comments about what happened
					 in B.C., I suggest he look no further than the former
					 Conservative government of Saskatchewan, under Grant Devine, that literally
					 wiped out a province. The New Democratic Party then came in and built it up
					 again so that it is now very strong and doing well. It had to come from a
					 terrible time when the Tories literally wiped it out.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question that provincial governments make
					 their mistakes and have to own up to them. However, from a federal perspective,
					 which is why we are here today, we recognize that trade agreements are
					 important but not if we are willing to abandon human, environmental and labour
					 rights of the people in both countries.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with my
					 colleague and friend the hon. member for Prince George--Peace River.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would be remiss if I did not take a minute to respond
					 to the NDP member who just spoke. She talked about the environmental and labour
					 side agreements as being secondary. I remind the member that those agreements
					 were negotiated in advance. She said we are ignoring them. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada has an opportunity to help the
					 Costa Ricans. There is always improvement and they can learn from us. We cannot
					 expect something to happen overnight. We enjoy about $270 million annually in
					 two way trade with the Costa Ricans. That can grow.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP has argued against every single free trade
					 agreement since I can remember as a child, and that goes back to the 1960s. The
					 NDP is notorious for being absolutely opposed to trade.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at trade for a moment. We have had a number
					 of free trade agreements. The 1989 Free Trade Agreement preceded NAFTA in 1994.
					 Canada was successful in negotiating a free trade agreement with Chile in 1997.
					 We are currently negotiating the free trade agreement of the Americas which
					 would bring North America and South America into one free trading area with 34
					 nations by 2005.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We enjoy $1.4 billion a day in two way trade with the
					 United States. Forty per cent of our GDP in Canada comes from our trade
					 agreements. One in four jobs in Canada is a result of free trade agreements
					 negotiated by the Canadian government with other nations over the
					 years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have an enormous trade surplus with the United
					 States. It is not without its problems. We are all fully aware of them and the
					 challenges. We are struggling with the softwood lumber agreement. There are
					 challenges to overcome but we cannot just give up and say that we do not want
					 trade because there is a certain issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us get more specific with respect to the Costa
					 Rican free trade agreement. One major concern in the country is with respect to
					 the sugar industry. It has been raised by a number of people. The member for
					 Saint John used to have a sugar refinery in her riding but it closed a few
					 years ago. They are concerned.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hon. colleague and good friend the member for
					 Lethbridge, when I was travelling with the minister to Costa Rica last spring
					 specifically to deal with this, brought to my attention the issue of the sugar
					 beet industry in Taber. He asked that I bring it up with officials down there.
					 I did that with the Canadian and Costa Rican officials.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Canada the issue is with refined sugar. Those issues
					 were raised. One of the biggest concerns of the Canadian sugar industry is not
					 so much the free trade in refined sugar with the Costa Ricans but that it would
					 be a template for the upcoming negotiations with the CA-4, the Central American
					 countries of Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador. Canada is
					 currently negotiating with them, and more specifically with Honduras,which
					 already has a sugar refinery. There are some concerns.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I specifically met on numerous occasions, and as
					 recently as Tuesday of this week, with Claude Carrière who is a senior official
					 and chief negotiator for Canada on not only the Canada-Costa Rica agreement but
					 also on the trade agreement with the CA-4 and the FTAA. </p>


	<A NAME="T1200"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1200"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1205"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1155"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1200)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should compliment him for the good work he has done.
					 He has given me his assurances, and I am aware he has given them to others,
					 that this is not a template, that this is not a model. It is important that
					 this be read into the record. It is important as they negotiate the free trade
					 agreement with the upcoming CA-4 that there be an exclusion with respect to
					 refined sugar because that is the concern.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have talked about other things with respect to
					 refined sugar. Canada exports 12,000 to 14,000 tonnes of refined sugar from
					 Taber into the U.S. a year. Of course that is because it is country of origin.
					 We export 57,000 tonnes of premixed sugar products to the U.S. More
					 specifically we are allowed to export 2,000 tonnes of non-originating sugar
					 into Costa Rica and under this agreement that has been doubled. It has been
					 increased to 4,000 tonnes so there are potentially new markets out there for
					 our sugar producers. I acknowledge it is albeit whether the economics and the
					 economies would warrant that but we will have to be aggressive in going after
					 that. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall I want to come back to the free trade
					 agreement. It is really good for Canada. On commodities for which there are
					 tariffs on Canada's side, we lose those tariffs immediately on auto parts,
					 prefab homes, various agricultural products and fish products. It is good for
					 Canada but it is also good for Costa Rica.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not have a large amount of trade with Costa Rica,
					 some $270 million annually in two way trade and the Costa Ricans are looking to
					 develop their economy. This is a win-win for both countries. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I applaud the member for Lethbridge and the sugar
					 industry itself. They have done a very good job in educating parliamentarians
					 on the industry's concerns. I applaud the government officials. This is one
					 time that they have listened. They have addressed those concerns. They have
					 given reassurances that in the CA-4 countries this will not be a template, that
					 there will not be free trade in refined sugar. It is reassuring that they were
					 listening. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the NDP member's comments, it is almost
					 unbelievable to listen to those members say that there are no environmental or
					 labour agreements when in fact side agreements were negotiated to deal with
					 them specifically. There is an opportunity for Canada as we increase our trade
					 to share our information, to help the Costa Ricans improve their labour and
					 environmental standards.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;History has shown us that in every single free trade
					 agreement we have entered into, it has been win win win for Canada. I cannot
					 overemphasize that when there is $1.4 billion of trade, 40% of our economy,
					 going between Canada and the United States. One in four Canadian jobs depends
					 on free trade. That is why it is critically important. The reality is we are
					 going to a global economy. In places like Europe, the economic borders are
					 evaporating and trade is opening up.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The members of the Progressive Conservative/Democratic
					 Representative Caucus and I will be supporting this legislation. The concerns
					 within the sugar industry were real. We have been given the appropriate
					 assurances by the department that this will not be a template in the upcoming
					 negotiations with the four Central American countries.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, it seems to me we learn more, and I am

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For decades, especially in the last decade or two,
					 Costa Rica seems to have been a kind of beacon for democracy in Central
					 America. We are aware of the problems that some of the neighbouring countries

					 not have a standing army. It has actually been referred to as the Switzerland
					 of Central America. I think we would very much want to have closer economic and
					 trade ties with a country like that so that we could assist it in assisting
					 other countries in the region. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my hon. colleague has pointed out, we should not be
					 doing what the NDP has done, which is to point out that the agreement is not
					 perfect. What agreement ever is? We can be of immense assistance to the Costa
					 Ricans in helping them to lead the way not only within their own country but
					 within Central America itself.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague has had the opportunity to travel with

					 bilateral discussions with a number of those countries. Would he be willing to
					 comment further on that?</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, the member is absolutely correct. As trade
					 is increasing, Canada is leading. Canada has successfully negotiated the first
					 free trade agreement with a Central American country that has a smaller
					 economy, a nation probably similar in population, and it has done it in a very
					 positive light addressing some of Canada's concerns.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lot of work to be done in many of these
					 countries. In many cases they have developing economies. We can share our
					 information. We can help bring them along on labour and environmental fronts.
					 At the end of the day it is not only a win-win for the Costa Ricans but also
					 for Canada as we open up new markets.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is a very large country with the majority of its
					 population very close to the 49th parallel, the southern part of the country.
					 The reality is that we need to open up our trade corridors north and south.
					 There are great markets both ways as we move into South America and Central
					 America. Canada is leading in this respect as we move forward.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good example is the free trade agreement that Canada
					 has negotiated with Chile. Canada is the envy of many countries as we have
					 successfully done this. While we are in a downturn in the economy our growth in
					 trade with Chile has far surpassed that of every other country trading with
					 Chile. Other countries have been in a negative cycle in trade with Chile.
					 Canada has made a positive gain in this struggling economy. The numbers speak
					 for themselves. In every single free trade agreement, trade grows. It creates
					 jobs in Canada as well as in Costa Rica. Everyone can win.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look forward to working on future free trade
					 agreements, most important, the free trade agreement of the Americas. I think
					 it will be great for Canada.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, it is indeed a pleasure for me to rise
					 today to speak to Bill C-32, an act to implement the free trade agreement
					 between the Government of Canada and the government of the Republic of Costa
					 Rica.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say at the outset, having sat in the Chamber and
					 listened to some of the debate this morning, that it is as well very
					 informative for Canadians viewing the debate at home. They can hear the
					 different positions being put forward by the various speakers and parties on
					 the issue of free trade, in this case with a very small country, certainly
					 small as far as being viewed as an economic power is concerned. There is a huge
					 disparity between the respective sizes of our countries, but nevertheless we
					 are hearing various members representing their parties putting forward
					 different perspectives.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to state for the record that I do agree with the
					 hon. NDP member for Churchill in the sense that many times unfortunately we see
					 in this place what I would classify as a flawed process. I think that was a big
					 part of her angst about the agreement itself and about the other ways in which
					 legislation comes in here. In that regard I would concur with her observations.
					 All too often the government uses what many of us on the opposition side would
					 view as a flawed process to arrive at legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That should not necessarily detract from the fact that
					 occasionally the government does get it right. Certainly I and the coalition
					 believe that this is one of those cases where by and large the government has
					 gotten it right with Bill C-32, the free trade agreement with Costa
					 Rica.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to go back in history a bit. I am one of the few
					 members from the coalition who ran in the 1988 election. That is where my
					 personal history with free trade comes from. I think many in our country will
					 remember, as I said earlier, that in 1988 our country was embroiled in an
					 election campaign that became for all intents and purposes a referendum on free
					 trade with the United States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember, ironically enough in light of the fact that
					 I am now involved in a coalition with the Progressive Conservative caucus in
					 parliament, that at that time as a candidate for the Reform Party of Canada I
					 found myself on stages throughout my huge rural riding of Prince George
					 basically in line with the Progressive Conservative incumbent, who obviously
					 was promoting free trade with the United States during that election campaign.
					 Aligned against us during those all candidate forums were members of the
					 Liberal Party and the New Democratic Party who were passionately and
					 emphatically opposed to that free trade agreement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a certain sense of irony, I guess, in that now
					 it is the Liberal Party, and I congratulate its members and encourage them to
					 continue to work toward more free trade with the Americas. They have in the
					 past and I am sure they will continue in the future with more conferences and
					 negotiations with countries. As my colleague from Saanich--Gulf Islands
					 indicated, we are now on the very cusp of having true free trade throughout the
					 Americas, a free trading bloc of 34 countries involved in a free trade
					 agreement. I think of what a great thing that will be for all the
					 countries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will not be without its problems. As my colleague
					 also pointed out, coming from British Columbia, I will say that right now we
					 are involved in a pretty serious situation with regard to the economy of
					 British Columbia and by extension the economy of Canada.</p>


	<A NAME="T1215"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1215"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1220"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1210"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1215)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fallout from the demise of the softwood lumber
					 agreement in March is just rocking our lumber industry to its very foundation,
					 in particular in British Columbia, which constitutes the vast majority of
					 lumber exports to the United States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had to point out that certain irony, because as I
					 say, there are four members involved in our coalition, including the leader of
					 the parliamentary coalition, the member for Calgary Centre, as well as myself,
					 my colleague from Edmonton North, who was running for the rural Alberta riding
					 of Beaver River at the time, and my colleague from South Surrey--White
					 Rock--Langley, who ran in that election and well remember the debates that took
					 place about the need for free trade. By and large, with the possible exception
					 of the NDP, I do not think that many people are disputing the fact that the
					 free trade agreement and the agreements which have flowed from it, such as
					 NAFTA, more recently the agreement with Chile, and now the agreement we are
					 going to enter into with Costa Rica, and we will hopefully expand beyond that,
					 have been good for Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have we had problems? Of course we have had problems.
					 Have some industries to a certain extent been affected detrimentally from time
					 to time? Of course they have been.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By definition any agreement requires some give and take
					 and some compromise, but that does not detract from the fact that overall it is
					 the way to go. It is the way the world is going. It is the way the global
					 economy is going. I think that ultimately it means that producers who can
					 produce the best product at the best price will be in that business and we can
					 get away from this system where all governments around the globe are
					 continually forced into a situation where they have to subsidize certain
					 industries. Obviously we ultimately do not want to do that. We want to see
					 countries that can produce the best product for the best price in that
					 particular business.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Partly due to this bill coming before the House, it so
					 piqued my interest that I started doing a bit of research on Costa Rica. My
					 partner, Leah Murray, and I have had the good fortune from time to time to take
					 educational trips to certain countries during the winter recess. We hope to do
					 that this winter in Costa Rica and learn more first hand about that country.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I was saying in questions and comments to my
					 colleague, it seems that the more I have researched Costa Rica the more I have
					 come to understand that it is really a beacon for democracy and has certainly
					 been a pretty good example. There again, has it had and does it continue to
					 have problems as an emerging nation in Central America? Of course, but by and
					 large when we compare it to some of its neighbouring countries it has done a
					 pretty good job of being the country that others around it can look to and
					 model themselves after. I know it has welcomed hundreds of thousands of
					 Nicaraguan refugees into the country because of the fallout of the civil war
					 and other wars in that area. That in and of itself has posed some real problems
					 for the Costa Rican nation, but in my understanding it is doing the best it
					 can.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as a personal aside, one of the things I will do
					 when I am there is visit with a cousin of mine who emigrated to Costa Rica
					 quite a number of years ago and is operating his own business there. He is in a
					 business whereby small local corporations contract with him to provide English
					 language training for their staff. Why are they doing that? Obviously those
					 business people can see the opportunities that are emerging in Costa Rica not
					 only for themselves and in regard to the ability to make a profit, but also for
					 the betterment of their employees and the people of that area. Certainly I will
					 be interested to learn more about the businesses and companies that he is
					 working so closely with.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a final point, for those who are so opposed to free
					 trade agreements and say that until everything is perfect we should not sign on
					 to them, I only need to point to NAFTA. There were a lot of legitimate concerns
					 expressed at the time, but look at what has happened to the country of Mexico.
					 If we have this outpouring of concern for the less developed countries and want
					 to help the people of those countries, I think we should look there. It is not

	Mr. Speaker, I noted with interest my colleague's
					 comments about being a Reform member running alongside a Conservative and being
					 pretty much onside with everything. I do not think there is any question about
					 it. There will not be any argument there. New Democrats have long maintained
					 that there really is not a whole lot of difference between the alliance-reform
					 and the Conservatives. Quite frankly, we would also maintain there is not much
					 difference between them and the governing party. That point is made.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He commented on the benefits of the trade agreements. I
					 would agree that there certainly are benefits to trade agreements. He talked
					 about the English language and people in Costa Rica learning the English
					 language in order to be able to carry on trade. That is really important and
					 there is no question about it, but what happens when we have what supposedly is
					 called free trade with, say, the U.S. and because the U.S. lumber industry does
					 not want its industry to suffer in the U.S. it imposes a 19% tariff on Canadian
					 softwood lumber? Where is that great free trade with the United States?
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the problem with these deals. They are not
					 there to benefit both fairly. It is usually the big guy with the big stick who
					 wins out.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like his comment on the 19% tariff that the
					 U.S. has imposed on softwood lumber from Canada.</p>

				  </b>

	I thank my hon. colleague from the NDP for her
					 observations and questions. I will not get into a debate about the differences
					 between the old Reform Party of Canada and the Progressive Conservatives
					 because that would use up all available time, plus pointing out the differences
					 we have had in the past. I think that on a number of issues we continue to
					 differ even today, but the great thing about a coalition is that we are allowed
					 to differ and I would commend that to her for consideration.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At any rate, as far as the softwood lumber agreement is
					 concerned of course there are some problems and she quite correctly pointed out
					 the problems, as I did during my remarks. The fact is that we do have this
					 outstanding problem with the United States. Part of the problem is that we
					 entered into a softwood lumber agreement in the first place instead of having
					 true free trade. That is what the industry is fighting for and certainly what I
					 am in favour of. That is why I hope that whatever comes of the present
					 negotiations will move us closer to free trade, which is sort of the opposite
					 to the hon. member's argument because the problem with it is that we have not
					 had free trade in softwood lumber. We have had these agreements and when they
					 expire the Americans impose duties, tariffs, countervail and whatever against
					 our product. Hopefully in the very near future we can solve that
					 problem.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to agree with the member that free trade
					 agreements by definition do not mean that we have to be less vigilant all of a
					 sudden. We still have to be vigilant in regard to the problems that develop
					 from them. They are not perfect, just as anything in life is not
					 perfect.</p>

					 agreement.</p>

					 Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting time with my
					 colleague, the member for Medicine Hat.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides being probably two of the best looking members
					 of parliament, my colleague for Medicine Hat and I have something else in
					 common. We are probably the sweetest because we have the only homegrown sugar
					 industry in Canada. I preface my remarks with those comments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to get into some of the details of Bill
					 C-32, the free trade agreement with Costa Rica. The main concern I and many of
					 my colleagues on all sides of the House have with the bill is the sugar aspect.
					 The bill follows the free trade agreement with Chile which was signed in 1997
					 and the North American free trade agreement inked in 1994. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our party supports free trade as a means of maintaining
					 a healthy economy by providing jobs for Canadians and improving the standard of
					 living in Canada. We also believe that free trade is good for developing
					 nations and provides stability in those nations as well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the stated purposes of Bill C-32 is to promote
					 regional integration through an instrument that contributes to the
					 establishment of the free trade area of the Americas, known as the FTAA. It
					 could be the first of several of these agreements with the other countries of
					 South and Central America, and that is part of some of the concerns we have. I
					 will get to that later.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the official opposition feel it is important to
					 establish good trade relationships with these countries to encourage economic,
					 social and democratic growth. Eighty per cent of what Costa Rica exports to
					 Canada, goods such as fruits, vegetables, coffee and coal, already enters our
					 country free of duty.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadian producers are looking to expand their markets
					 for goods in Costa Rica. These are products such as french fries, metal
					 structures, along with fish, paper products, auto parts, plastics, wood and
					 agricultural goods. Many of these items currently face high tariffs when
					 exported to Costa Rica, even though the populace has expressed an interest in
					 them and the products are not economically produced within their own borders.
					 The proposed trade deal would change all that. The proposed trade deal would
					 benefit Costa Ricans by providing them with greater access to the products they
					 cannot currently afford or manufacture on their own.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the year 2000 Canada exported $86 million in total
					 trade to Costa Rica. In that same year we imported $183 million worth of goods
					 from that country. The bill would ensure that Costa Rica maintains an open
					 access to all our markets while opening Costa Rica's door to Canadian producers
					 and their high quality specialized products. The proposed trade deal would
					 benefit both countries in that way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Alliance promotes free trade and, I want
					 to emphasize this, the joint elimination of tariffs with our trading partners.
					 We have seen in the past, particularly in our grain and oilseed sector, where
					 tariffs and support were reduced in Canada when our trading partners did not
					 reciprocate and this put our producers at a disadvantage. We do not want that
					 to happen particularly in the sugar industry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, our party has one particular and
					 significant concern with the bill. If the Costa Rica free trade agreement, as
					 described in Bill C-32, is used as a template for other FTAA negotiations,
					 especially the CA-4 countries, we feel the Canadian sugar industry will suffer
					 and suffer greatly. Canada already has one of the most open sugar markets in
					 the world. Our import tariff on raw sugar stands at zero and our tariff on
					 refined sugar is only 8%, one of the very lowest in the world. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadian sugar producers such as Lantic and Rogers
					 provide almost enough refined sugar to meet the domestic needs of all
					 Canadians. U.S. and Latin American tariffs on sugar range from 50% to
					 160%.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian domestic sugar industry employs over 2,000
					 Canadians. This includes the sugar beet industry and growers in my part of the
					 world, in southern Alberta, and the refinery workers across the
					 country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One threat to Canadian domestic sugar producers comes
					 from the four Central American countries, the CA-4 countries: Guatemala,
					 Nicaragua, El Salvador and Honduras, because of their refining capacity and the
					 subsidies they receive from their governments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twelve per cent of Canada's refined sugar is made from
					 the sugar beets that are grown in my area. This is the only region left in
					 Canada that grows sugar beets for refining in Canada. The rest comes largely
					 from imported cane sugar which is refined and a small amount of refined sugar
					 imported from abroad.</p>


	<A NAME="T1230"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1230"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1235"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1225"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1230)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three cane sugar refineries are located in
					 Vancouver, Montreal and Toronto. They employ many Canadians and have been
					 providing our country with the highest quality of refined sugar for
					 years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jobs and economic impact of the current sugar
					 market situation are not limited to beet growers and refinery workers however.
					 Canada's low sugar prices have attracted substantial investment in Canada's
					 food and beverage industry. These industries provide thousands of jobs at
					 bakeries, biscuit manufacturers, dairies, fruit and vegetable canneries,
					 confectionery manufacturers and so on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By generating demand for goods and services, the sugar
					 industry also indirectly supports a number of other economic sectors, including
					 agriculture, natural resources, packaging, industrial machinery and
					 transportation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The industry has concerns with the sugar aspect of the
					 deal with Costa Rica because of the precedent it would set for upcoming
					 negotiations with other Central American countries. The industry has closed two
					 plants in Canada since 1997 reflecting the competitiveness in the Canadian
					 market and limiting export opportunities. The industry has been forced to be
					 efficient and globally competitive, and it has done that. The industry has
					 changed to meet the new competition in the world. The sugar market is very
					 competitive. We have very little access to the U.S. market, our closest trading
					 partner. I know my colleague will expand on that somewhat. However the industry
					 has changed and shaped itself. I know the investment in the plant in southern
					 Alberta has been in the tens of millions of dollars. The growers themselves
					 have invested in new equipment and new methods. The industry is in tune and has
					 made the changes necessary to stay competitive.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Import competition from Central America and other
					 countries in the hemisphere has grown dramatically in recent years, even with
					 Canada's small tariff. If new regional trade deals lead to the removal of
					 Canada's refined sugar tariff in advance of WTO trade liberalization, the
					 Canadian sugar industry may suffer. It may not even survive if we get out too
					 far ahead of the rest of our trading partners.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our members on the House of Commons trade committee,
					 who saw that the issue could be a precedent setting trade deal with the other
					 CA-4 countries, worked with people in the industry and people on the government
					 side of the House. It is funny that when we are dealing with a trade agreement
					 we cannot really make amendments. We either agree with trade or we disagree
					 with it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However we thought if we did not change the text of the
					 trade deal itself, but put in the preamble that there is a concern and that
					 this trade deal should not be used as a pattern for the other CA-4 countries,
					 then that would put most of what we feared could happen to rest. Costa Rica
					 itself does not have the capacity at the moment to greatly harm our industry
					 but the other countries in Central America do. We have assurance from the
					 chairman of the subcommittee on international trade and others that this will
					 be added to the preamble. That will allow us to support the bill and we will.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must remember that the whole idea of free trade is
					 to benefit both parties. If we are going to ensure that a vital industry in
					 Canada remains viable, then we need to keep that in mind when we open up the
					 other trade deals in the rest of Central America.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to make that point. We support free trade. We
					 support what it does and how it helps nations around the world. We wanted to
					 make sure that our concern about the sugar aspect of this was brought forward,
					 and it has been. We feel fairly comfortable, if it is followed through as
					 indicated, that those concerns will be put to rest. We look forward to further
					 debate.</p>

					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Lethbridge for
					 the great speech. He made a great case for why, while we support free trade, we
					 do have some concerns about the pattern we see developing with respect to how
					 we treat sugar when it comes to dealing with the CA-4 countries in upcoming
					 trade negotiations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to start out by talking about free trade more
					 broadly and simply make the point that free trade does raise the standard of
					 living for all people. It does provide better working conditions. It does
					 ultimately lead to a cleaner environment. It leads to higher wages. Everybody
					 benefits when we engage in free trade. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is a trading nation. Forty-three per cent of our
					 GDP comes from trade. Canada, better than most nations and perhaps better than
					 just about any nation in the world, understands the benefits of free and
					 unfettered trade. It leaves people better off and provides higher standards of
					 living, all those sorts of things. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While my NDP friends talk on the one hand about their
					 belief that trade is good, on the other hand what we always see from them is
					 rhetoric suggesting that trade is a disaster. I have yet to see the NDP members
					 support any kind of trade arrangement. I do not think they have ever supported
					 one, and that is unfortunate because in the countries they are concerned about,
					 Costa Rica in this case, trade arrangements will allow those people, who in
					 some cases are very poor, to become much wealthier. It raises their standard of
					 living.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably the best example recently is Mexico when we
					 entered into the NAFTA agreement. Mexico has seen its middle class increase
					 dramatically. After years of having very wealthy people and a very large group
					 of poor people, Mexico is now starting to see its middle class develop.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen that same process occur in other
					 countries. One of the best examples is India where a couple of hundred million
					 people have now become part of the middle class. This has happened in many
					 other countries around the world. Free trade is a very good thing. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP member for Churchill who spoke earlier
					 suggested that sometimes trade can be compared to hockey where all the talented
					 players are on one side and the players who are not so good are on the other.
					 She suggested that sometimes a big country will dominate a little country like
					 a big team will dominate a little team in hockey. As I pointed out to her, the
					 difference is that in hockey when one team wins the other team loses and the
					 team that wins takes the two points and goes on to the next game. In trade both
					 sides come out ahead because it is a voluntary exchange. The analogy I used was
					 that if someone produces a hammer and sells it for $10, the person who buys it
					 is happy because he or she gets a hammer and can use it for something useful.
					 The person who gets the $10 for the hammer is happy because he or she can use
					 it for whatever. In essence, that is what trade is all about. Both sides come
					 out ahead. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member for Churchill offered some examples that are
					 simply not the case. She wanted to know what would happen if some got 20 cents
					 for it. I would say that the person is probably happy to get 20 cents if he or
					 she were only getting 10 cents for whatever they produced before. People enter
					 into these things voluntarily. They enter into them because it leaves them
					 better off. Surely the member for Churchill wants to see people better
					 off.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to talk specifically about Bill C-32, the Costa
					 Rica free trade legislation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my friend said at the outset, we believe in this but
					 we do have concerns about the sugar component. Why? Is it because we do not
					 believe in free trade? We do believe in free trade, but the problem is that
					 Canada is being opened up to the import of sugar from all kinds of countries,
					 not necessarily through Bill C-32, because Costa Rica at this point does not
					 have the capacity to send us refined sugar, but we are concerned that it might
					 be a template for what will happen when we enter into negotiations with the
					 CA-4 countries, like Guatemala, which have a big capacity to export refined
					 sugar.</p>


	<A NAME="T1240"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1240"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1245"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1235"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1240)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concern is not that we would have that sugar coming
					 here but that we also have access to the U.S. market. The U.S. is Canada's
					 natural export market, but in the last number of years Canada's ability to
					 export sugar has declined.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We produce sugar in this country. A lot of people do
					 not appreciate that. There is a sugar beet industry in my riding and in the
					 riding of my friend from Lethbridge. It produces a lot of very good sugar. Our
					 sugar producers can compete with anyone in the United States which also
					 produces a lot of beet sugar. We can compete with any of them. We have an
					 excellent facility in Taber, Alberta, that has just been upgraded. Several
					 million dollars have been put into it. We can compete.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that the Americans are protectionist on
					 sugar and our government has not been able to crack that open. Not only has it
					 been unable to crack open the American market, the amount of sugar we export to
					 the U.S. market has shrunk from 55,000 tonnes a few years ago to 15,000 tonnes
					 today. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end it is the decision of Americans. However the
					 government has not done a good job of looking after the interests of our sugar
					 producers. It has not made it a priority. The reason it has not done so is that
					 it is a relatively small industry compared to, for instance, the supply
					 management industries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government gets heat constantly from the United
					 States and other countries about supply management. Instead of threatening a
					 big industry like supply management our government trades off sugar. It does it
					 over and over again. In the free trade deal there is no question that sugar was
					 traded off.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Americans are happy to protect it. They like
					 protecting it because a number of senators and congressmen have the industry in
					 their areas and want to protect it for political reasons. We have not pushed
					 them too hard on the issue. However it is time for the government to find a
					 spine and push the Americans hard.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to stand by the Americans at any time. We
					 will certainly stand by them during their time of need. However today we are
					 talking about free trade. The Americans are protectionist on this and other
					 issues. Softwood lumber is another example. We could go through the list. It is
					 time the government started to push them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government thinks sugar is a small industry and no
					 big deal but it is a critical industry to the people involved in it. It is not
					 important in terms of overall GDP but to the people involved it is their
					 livelihoods. It is very important to them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the government to make cracking open the
					 American market more of a priority. It should at least raise the quota back to
					 the 55,000 tonnes we used to have. That is still not a lot, frankly. It was not
					 a big amount of sugar to export relative to what we produced but it was three
					 times better than what we export today. It is critical that the government take
					 that into account when it sits with the Americans the next time because this is
					 unacceptable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my riding and across the prairies it is a difficult
					 time in agriculture. People know that. Sugar beets provide a real option for a
					 lot of people. They provide a good livelihood not just for producers but for
					 all the people who work at the facility in my riding.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we cannot appeal to the government to make it a
					 priority on the grounds that the sugar industry is important, we appeal to it
					 on the grounds that farmers need options at a time when wheat prices are low
					 and they do not have many options. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be able to respond since
					 my colleague referred to an analogy I made. In the point I was trying to make I
					 referred to your son and the Montreal Canadiens in the same breath. It was in a
					 good light, Mr. Speaker. I said that even in hockey we have rules. We have
					 rules so that one guy or team is not so big and powerful that they have all the

					 is doing and re-emphasize that New Democrats are not in the least opposed to

					 involved in the trading process it should be beneficial. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will tell my hon. colleague a story. I was visiting
					 Arizona a few years back and watching an American program. This is important
					 because it deals with the issue of trade. On the program there was a
					 representative of American companies that were doing business near Guadalajara,
					 Mexico. The story talked about 200 dead women were disappering found in the
					 desert. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women were disappering going to and from their
					 workplace. They were as young as 12 or 13 years old. Some 200 bodies were found
					 over the course of a few years. People were imploring the companies to put some
					 kind of system in place to bus the women to and from their residences and the
					 workplace. These companies made a fortune selling their products in Canada and

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Costa Rica would incur the same costs trying to export

					 export to Costa Rica, so there is some balance there.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to know a little more. Costa Rica has no
					 refineries or beet sugar production whereas Alberta does, at least in the
					 riding of the member for Medicine Hat. What are the member's fears? Could he

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I do not know what to say except that it
					 is pretty unrealistic to think Alberta would start sending sugar to Costa Rica
					 which is in Central America and is surrounded by all kinds of countries that
					 produce tremendous amounts of sugar.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not oppose the idea of free trade but in a world
					 of complete free trade everyone would obviously find their natural market. Our
					 natural market for sugar is not Costa Rica but we would have a natural market
					 in the United States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the problem with bilateral deals. If we had
					 rules based trade through the WTO things would find their natural level. Canada
					 would trade with the U.S., which is obviously the right way to do things. It
					 makes so much sense. It is the largest market in the world. The $11 trillion
					 U.S. market is right below our border. We should be trading with the
					 U.S.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem with the bilateral deal is that it would
					 give us some new free trade on the one hand but entrench a bunch of distortions
					 on the other hand. It would make more permanent some of the problems that
					 already exist between Canada and the U.S. It would give the government an

					 BQ): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, Bill C-32, the Canada-Costa Rica free
					 trade agreement implementation act, must be examined in the context of the
					 debate that has already taken place regarding the current process for
					 negotiating a free trade area of the Americas and in the context where clearly
					 we are in the midst of a globalization process. I believe that the exchange we
					 just witnessed between the NDP member and the Canadian Alliance member
					 demonstrates this fact.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently it is clear that the Canadian government's
					 strategy consists of multiplying bilateral agreements to speed up the process
					 of economic integration with the continent and with the world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We already have a free trade agreement with the United
					 States and Mexico, NAFTA. We have a free trade agreement with Israel, and
					 another one with Chile. This weekend the Prime Minister announced that there
					 would be negotiations for an agreement with Singapore. We also know that the
					 government is interested in negotiating a free trade agreement with four
					 Central American countries: Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador. The
					 Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade recommended that
					 the government enter into negotiations with the European Union to establish a
					 free trade agreement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This then is the context in which we must look at the
					 bill before us, regardless of whether we are friends with Costa Rica or not. I
					 think it is clear that the people of Canada, like those of Quebec, are friends
					 of the Costa Ricans. This is not the issue. The issue is what is we are getting
					 in the Canada-Costa Rica free trade agreement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the position of the Bloc Quebecois on free
					 trade, like that of most Quebecers, is well known. We support it. We think it
					 is an excellent idea because it encourages countries, by opening their borders,
					 to specialize according to the advantages they enjoy such as natural resources,
					 human resources or capital. This increases the general productivity of our
					 economies. What I mean by productivity is not working intensely, but more
					 effectively, more intelligently. All of this generates additional wealth, which
					 can then be shared, and the problem often lies here, in the equitable
					 distribution of the resultant wealth.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must face the fact. The world has never been as rich
					 as it is now. At no other time in recorded history has the world been as rich.
					 At the same time, we must acknowledge that globalization and free trade
					 agreements have not reduced the gap between the rich and the poor. Quite the
					 contrary, they have widened it. A certain set of qualifications and a certain
					 mobility are needed to benefit from globalization, free trade and
					 specialization. Unskilled workers, as this is all the more apparent in
					 industrialized economies, are unemployed and underemployed, in unacceptable
					 working conditions and living in poverty.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same can be said for regions. If free trade is not
					 guided by a number of rules about the creation of this wealth across the
					 continent or worldwide, inequalities among regions and among various classes of
					 people within countries will grow. Accordingly, all aspects of our life must be
					 taken into consideration, not just the economic issues more directly linked by
					 trade agreements, but also the various social, environmental, cultural and
					 democratic aspects. If they are not considered we may end up, under the guise
					 of improving economic activity, creating inequalities, eradicating cultures and
					 violating democratic rights.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returning to the hockey analogy, although I
					 unfortunately missed the beginning of it, I again congratulate you, Mr.
					 Speaker, on your son's choice.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the professional teams and leagues have
					 systems to try to level out disparities. If the top team had its choice of
					 players during the selection process, not only would their team keep getting
					 better but the one in the cellar would stay there. Professional hockey leagues
					 have therefore come up with a plan to share player talent around more fairly by
					 letting the bottom team in the rankings have first choice. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This of the same sort of philosophical approach we
					 would like to see used by the Government of Canada in the free trade
					 agreements, particularly in negotiations for the FTAA, as well as in the
					 upcoming WTO negotiations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately there was nothing on this in the
					 Canada-Costa Rica agreement. The Canada-Costa Rica free trade agreement is a
					 first generation agreement, as is NAFTA, as are those with Chile and Israel. It
					 does not take the social, democratic and environmental dimensions into
					 consideration. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only new reference I was able to find in this
					 agreement is one to the WTO declaration of 1998 on fundamental rights. This
					 reference, however, has no mechanism for application.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must take into account these economic, social and
					 environmental concerns. Quebecers and Canadians should have been consulted in a
					 meaningful manner, but this was not done. All that was put at their disposal
					 was a website where they could make comments. Some groups did receive 18 months
					 ago a letter from the Minister for International Trade inviting them to express
					 their views. However, no systematic consultation process was set up. At no time
					 were parliamentarians involved in the process. Now the government is coming up
					 with an agreement that is presented to us as a fait accompli, expecting us to
					 blindly pass the implementing act. We will not.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the federal government will realize that it
					 can never again put parliamentarians, Canadians and Quebecers before a fait
					 accompli. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case and in future ones, if there is no true
					 consultation process that includes parliamentarians, civil society and all
					 Canadians and Quebecers, we will vote against these free trade agreements out
					 of respect for our democracy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first fundamental flaw of the whole process leading
					 to this agreement is that it was not transparent. Negotiations were not
					 conducted following a monitoring of the whole process by
					 parliamentarians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second element which in our opinion is a serious
					 mistake in the Canada-Costa Rica free trade agreement is the investment
					 clause.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its documentation, the Minister for International
					 Trade tells us that nothing is changed in terms of investment and services. I
					 realize that nothing has changed regarding investment and services. An
					 agreement had already been negotiated in 1998 between the Government of Costa
					 Rica and the government of Canada for the promotion and protection of
					 investments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Canada-Costa Rica free trade agreement,
					 reference is made to this previous agreement. Under the provision on
					 investment, article VIII.2 reads, and I quote:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The Parties note the existence of the
						  Agreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of Costa Rica for
						  the Promotion and Protection of Investments, signed in San José, Costa Rica, on
						  March 18, 1998. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we take a look at the 1998 agreement, what do we
					 see? We see that the provisions of NAFTA's chapter 11, which we condemned here
					 and the Minister for International Trade said he wanted to change, are all
					 there.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would remind the House that in the debate we led and
					 are continuing to lead for the negotiation of the free trade area of the
					 Americas, we do not want to see investment protection provisions similar to
					 those in chapter 11 of NAFTA, which give multinationals and private
					 corporations too many rights over governments, states and the democratic will
					 of peoples.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were many problems with chapter 11, but I will
					 mention just four: the definition of investments, which is far too broad;
					 national treatment, which means that we cannot have a specific policy to
					 further the economic development of a particular sector; the concept of
					 expropriation, which is far too broad; and finally, the dispute settlement
					 mechanism, which allows a company to go directly to an arbitration tribunal to
					 challenge a government decision or policy. The agreement between the government
					 of the Republic of Costa Rica and the Government of Canada contains these same
					 provisions to promote and protect investments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will take the example of investments. The agreement
					 reads as follows:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">

						  and, in particular, though not exclusively, includes:</small></td>

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The list goes on.</p>


	<A NAME="T1300"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1300"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1305"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1255"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1300)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition of investment is far too broad in the
					 Canada-Costa Rica agreement, and it is inspired by the NAFTA
					 definition.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now as for the national treatment provisions, there is
					 exactly the same clause as in chapter 11 and for expropriation exactly the same
					 type of definition. I will quote from article VIII:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>1. Investments of investors of either
						  Contracting Party shall not be nationalized, expropriated or subjected to
						  measures having an effect equivalent to nationalization or
						  expropriation--</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is rather broad. Finally, as far as dispute
					 settlement is concerned, I will quote from article XII:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>2. If a dispute has not been settled
						  amicably within a period of six months from the date on which it was initiated,
						  it may be submitted by the investor to arbitration in accordance with paragraph
						  (4). </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 11 is found indirectly within the Canada-Costa
					 Rica free trade agreement and runs contrary to the commitments made by the
					 Minister for International Trade when he stated that he did not want to see any
					 equivalent of chapter 11 in the treaty on the free trade area of the
					 Americas.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final element that makes this agreement with Costa
					 Rica unacceptable is the matter of sugar, as has been stated
					 already.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, there has been a unilateral
					 liberalization of the sugar market on the part of the Canadian government
					 without anything corresponding being done on the other side by Costa Rica or
					 any of the other Central American governments that will follow later. There is
					 no way I will be convinced that in agreements with Guatemala, Nicaragua,
					 Honduras or El Salvador we will have what is not in the free trade agreement
					 with Costa Rica. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Costa Rica under the agreement, the
					 doors are now open to selling in Canada, with no applicable tariff, over 20,000
					 tonnes of refined sugar starting in 2003, and the volume involved will have no
					 limits starting in 2009.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is one of the countries, if not the country,
					 that is most open to sugar imports. There is no tariff on raw sugar and there
					 is a $30.84 tariff on refined sugar, which is the equivalent of 8%. Our price
					 for sugar is one of the lowest in the world, whereas the U.S. and the European
					 Union have many protectionist measures that resultsn distorted prices on the
					 world level.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Central American countries such as Guatemala, the
					 tariffs on refined sugar may be as high as 160%. We are opening up our market
					 while there are no market opportunities for Canada in these economies. The
					 previous speaker mentioned this and I agree with him.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United States is the obvious market for our refined
					 sugar industries, but there is so much protectionism that even though they
					 consume ten times more sugar than Canada they import less.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four countries of Central America that I mentioned
					 produce 2.8 million tonnes of raw sugar, of which 1.6 million tonnes, half, is
					 exported. Three hundred thousand tonnes of that is refined sugar. In total
					 Canada consumes approximately 1.2 million tonnes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guatemala, for example, currently produces and exports
					 1.1 million tonnes of sugar per year or the equivalent of our annual
					 consumption. In 2000, Canada imported 273,000 tonnes of raw sugar from Central
					 America, compared to our exports of 110,000 tonnes, under the quota, to the
					 United States, a country that consumes ten times more sugar than we do, as I
					 mentioned earlier.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our industry is competitive, but in a market where
					 there is no price distortion. On the world market and in the United States and
					 Europe, where protectionist measures are in place, such distortion exists. I
					 refuse to believe that there will be a market for Canadian refined sugar in
					 Costa Rica, Guatemala and Nicaragua. Why? Because of the rule of
					 origin.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would have to import raw sugar from Central American
					 countries and refine it in Canada in order to sell it back to these countries.
					 The transportation costs alone explain why it would be difficult to sell this
					 sugar, notwithstanding the fact that they produce raw sugar themselves,and
					 could develop their own refining capability.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Montreal, 345 jobs are being threatened. This may
					 not seem like a lot to the Minister for International Trade, but in the
					 Montreal area, particularly in these troubled economic times, these are jobs we
					 want to keep.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why were the opinions of industry, the unions and
					 opposition parties not taken into consideration on this issue, if “it is not
					 true”, as the Minister for International Trade said?</p>


	<A NAME="T1305"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1305"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1310"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1300"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1305)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally presented an amendment to the
					 Sub-Committee on International Trade, Trade Disputes and Investment to make
					 sure that this provision would not be included in the future. It is true that
					 in the current context Costa Rica is not a threat, but Guatemala is.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I presented an amendment to make sure that in future
					 free trade agreements with Central American countries we would not have the
					 provision that is included in this one. That amendment was rejected by the
					 Liberals. Now they would have us believe that they care about the 345 workers
					 at Montreal's Lantic Sugar. Come on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this provision should have been left out of the
					 agreement. We must negotiate the liberalization of the sugar market. My
					 proposal to the Minister for International Trade is to put this item on the
					 agenda at the negotiations on the free trade area of the Americas and also at
					 the WTO. We want the liberalization of sugar at least at the continental level,
					 if not at the world level, so that Canadian and Quebec businesses that are
					 competitive can compete in a fair market in terms of the practices used.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of these three elements, namely the lack of
					 transparency during the negotiations, the fact that chapter 11 is indirectly
					 included through the agreement for the promotion and protection of investments,
					 and the fact that Canada's refined sugar industry is put in jeopardy, the Bloc
					 Quebecois will vote against Bill C-32.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully to my colleague's
					 comments. One is almost at a loss to know where to start, there are so many
					 questions I would like to ask. I will follow up on a couple of brief
					 observations if I might. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take this opportunity to clarify some comments made
					 by the member for Churchill and to ask my colleague from the Bloc for his
					 opinion on labour agreements. Earlier today I quoted the president of the ILO
					 who said that he supported the use of side agreements on labour and the
					 environment. He not only supported them but applauded Canadian creativity in
					 using that approach.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I referenced the EU ministers who at a meeting I
					 attended a year ago on behalf of the Minister for International Trade indicated
					 that they too did not want to litter up trade agreements unnecessarily by
					 including labour and environment rights. This was the point I sought to make
					 earlier. I believe I was misinterpreted by the member for Churchill but that
					 has been clarified by some of my colleagues. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does the member feel about labour and environment
					 agreements in trade deals?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am disappointed to hear my colleague talk about the
					 proposed amendment he put forward in committee. He knows very well that when he
					 put the amendment our side supported it. In fact his amendment was agreed to
					 unanimously. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will give him a chance to clarify. The next day he
					 came to the committee with a substantially different amendment with no
					 consultation on this side of the House. Obviously we could not support a
					 substantially different amendment from my colleague. We try to deal in good
					 faith so I will give the member a chance to clarify. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I point out that there is no Costa Rican investment to
					 speak of in Canada. Canada has some $400 million of investment in Costa Rica.
					 These are protected by FIPA, a foreign investment protection agreement, which
					 has been in existence since 1999. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not understand his fears in this regard. They are
					 misplaced. It saddens me to think that the Bloc Quebecois will vote against a
					 bilateral free trade agreement with a developing nation, one that badly needs
					 it. Does he really mean that?</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, the parliamentary secretary and I often
					 attend the same meetings, but I do not think we see them the same.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the secretary general of the ILO, he
					 said that the debate had taken place within the ILO on issues involving
					 workers' rights within trade agreements and that no consensus had been reached
					 for the moment. We know that it is a tripartite body.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I served as the secretary general of the CSN for eight
					 years. I know, therefore, that within this forum many governments and unions
					 and perhaps some enlightened managers think that an effort must be made to find
					 a way to introduce dimensions pertaining to fundamental rights into trade
					 agreements. They are working on this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The International Labour Organization and the World
					 Trade Organization must give thought to such things.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tragic events of September 11 should give us cause
					 to think. We cannot do things the same way any more. Much of the revolt in the
					 world arises from the fact that trade agreements take no other dimension into
					 account although they have an impact on society, the environment and
					 democracies. The debate must therefore continue and the Bloc will support this
					 debate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now as concerns what went on in committee regarding the
					 amendment, I moved the same amendment in the subcommittee and in the standing
					 committee. In the subcommittee, the chair declared it out of order. I looked
					 into it in the course of the evening and came back with the argument that it
					 was admissible. Finally it was allowed by the chair of the Standing Committee
					 on Foreign Affairs and International Trade and was voted on. I moved the same
					 amendment twice. In the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International
					 Trade, it was defeated by the Liberals.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also true that, in the subcommittee, and this
					 will be in the report, I agree, out of desperation to a general proposal to
					 ensure tha, in future interests such as those of the sugar refining industry
					 would be considered and that a multilateral perspective would be maintained
					 during negotiations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically in the case of sugar, the Government of
					 Canada should focus on multilateral negotiations to liberalize the sugar
					 refining market.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like as my final point to say that we support
					 free trade, but we must learn from past mistakes. Chapter 11 of NAFTA, and I
					 think the Minister for International Trade agrees with many of our criticisms,
					 cannot be repeated in new agreements we will sign.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the Canada-Costa Rica free trade
					 agreement, I would have expected Canada to reopen the agreement with respect to
					 the protection and promotion of investments in order to take into account the
					 remarks made by the Minister for International Trade himself in this regard,
					 but it has not.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is time we gave a signal to the Liberal
					 government. We will not sign and we will not go along with any free trade
					 agreement that does not meet a certain number of conditions. I have mentioned
					 three in this case. We do not feel that there was sufficient consultation. At
					 no time were parliamentarians asked what they thought. Instead we are being
					 presented with a fait accompli.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the clause on investments contains elements of
					 chapter 11. Third, I cannot in all conscience agree to jeopardize 345 jobs in
					 the Montreal area by unilaterally liberalizing the refined sugar
					 market.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague from Joliette tried to move an amendment.

	Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak on Bill C-32,
					 the implementation of the free trade agreement between the Government of Canada
					 and the government of the Republic of Costa Rica.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time after time the Canadian Alliance has said it is in
					 favour of free trade. In that context we see this agreement as one step forward
					 in the implementation of free trade, which we feel is the route to go for the
					 prosperity of Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will be splitting my time, Mr. Speaker, with the
					 member for Surrey Central.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the concerns raised by members on this side of
					 the House was the impact on the domestic sugar industry. I am pleased to note
					 that an agreement was reached in committee to say that this model would not be
					 applied throughout the other free trade agreements, which paves the way for the
					 Alliance to support the bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our concern for the sugar industry still remains
					 regarding future trade agreements that Canada might sign. We are putting the
					 Minister for International Trade on notice that if future trade agreements are
					 signed they should be more balanced in the interests of both
					 countries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to talk in general about free trade in the world
					 and globalization. I just returned with the minister from the APEC conference
					 in Shanghai last week where an interesting paper was presented by the
					 government of Australia called “Globalization and Poverty”. I hope my
					 colleagues from the NDP and others will listen carefully to what the research
					 said.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will quote some statements from the
					 document:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Globalisation --in the form of
						  increased economic integration through trade and investment--is an important
						  reason why so much progress has been made against poverty and global inequality
						  over recent decades.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Good national policies,sound
						  institutions and domestic political stability are also important...in reducing
						  poverty.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to 1.2 billion people of the developing world's 4.8
					 billion people still live in extreme poverty, but the proportion of the world
					 population living in poverty has been steadily declining. Since 1988 the
					 absolute number of poor people has stopped rising and appears to have fallen in
					 recent years despite strong population growth in poor countries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the proportion living in poverty had not fallen,
					 since 1987 alone a further 215 million people would be living in extreme
					 poverty today. There is very strong evidence here. The very poorest countries
					 now represent less than 8% of the world total population compared with just
					 over 45% in 1970. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Australian document went on to say:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Most progress has taken place in
						  developing countries that have reformed their policies, institutions and
						  infrastructure to become the ‘new globalisers’...During the 1990s their growth
						  in gross domestic product per person was 5 per cent a year compared with 2 per
						  cent of the rich countries... But far more serious problems confront the
						  countries that have not integrated with the global economy--countries that
						  account for up to 2 billion people. Often experiencing internal conflict and
						  suffering poor government anti-business policies and low participation in
						  international trade, these countries have not joined the process of
						  globalisation, with the consequences of slowly growing incomes or even
						  declining incomes and rising poverty.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The document says quite clearly that evidence produced
					 over the last decade shows that globalization and free trade have been major
					 instruments in moving people out of poverty, specifically in Asian countries.
					 This is clear evidence why it is important to have free trade in the
					 world.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member for 
					 Churchill gave one
					 example when she talked about 200 women who lost their lives while travelling.
					 Yes, that is a tragic consequence. However, in the overall context of the
					 situation, we must look at the bigger picture that has propelled people to move
					 out. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem with these anti-globalization protestors,
					 and the NDP, is they nitpick. The loss of 200 lives is extremely important, I
					 am not saying that it is not. However, they nitpick small little things to put
					 up barriers against free trade and globalization. Evidence shows that the
					 majority of people have moved from the poor sections of the economy to better
					 living standards.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the APEC conference, which I attended with the
					 Minister for International Trade, every country there talked about moving their
					 economies into the global market. After years of experimenting with other
					 forms, they see that as one of the key factors in helping their countries to
					 move out poverty and improve the living standards of their citizens.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty-one countries cannot be wrong, can they? They
					 have looked hard at the results. They are the ones that have been governing for
					 years. Yet we have the anti-globalization led by the NDP, that is the new
					 mantra these days of anti-globalization, putting up barriers, supposedly for
					 these poor people. I do not know for whom they talk.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All I know is that most of these NGOs and
					 anti-globalization protestors, who supposedly live in rich countries and have
					 great living standards, are trying to impose their will on other countries that
					 want to improve their standard of living. The anti-globalization protestors are
					 putting up barriers to stop the same people who they are trying to help, when
					 all economic indicators and research point to the fact that free trade has
					 assisted them in moving forward. I do not understand why the NDP is picking up
					 that mantra.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the Canadian Alliance will support Bill
					 C-32 in the context that free trade has been one of the engines of prosperity
					 for Canada.</p>

					 NDP): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, clearly the hon. member has come back from
					 the People's Republic of China and the APEC conference with his head full of
					 corporate information about globalization and that it is good for everyone. I
					 have heard this so often at committees, from the pharmaceutical companies that
					 are pushing the idea of intellectual property rights and that this is somehow
					 lifting people out of poverty.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the hon. member had taken the time, whether it was
					 in Quebec City at the summit of the Americas, or at APEC when it was in
					 Vancouver a few years ago, or now in the People's Republic of China, to attend
					 the parallel conference and hear from workers about impact of corporate
					 globalization, he would know that the NDP is not nitpicking, or as he said,
					 “small little things”. We are defending the fact that workers have established,
					 through these agreements, virtually no rights. Now we are looking at trade
					 agreements, particularly the one before us today, that will do nothing to
					 enforce and ensure the rights of workers in Costa Rica, or other countries
					 where these agreements exist, to the basic human rights and labour rights to
					 organize, to work in livable and decent conditions, to speak out and to
					 associate. None of these things properly exist. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am really offended that the member would somehow
					 consider this to be nitpicking. He needs to go and do his homework. He needs to
					 hear from worker organizations, both international and national. He needs to
					 hear the very deep concerns that are being registered about these agreements
					 and how they absolutely do not provide any adequate measures to protect workers
					 in other countries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask the member to respond to that. Did he
					 bother to take the time to find that out when he was at the APEC

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to respond to the
					 question. Let me tell the member that I grew up in a country that was in
					 poverty. Today it is one of the poorest countries in the world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was there in August and talked to the people. I will
					 say repeatedly that the NDP is nitpicking these little things because of the
					 rhetoric being used. The members use so-called NGO groups who have similar
					 interests and say they represent the people. If they went to those nations,
					 walked the streets and talked with the people who have businesses, they would
					 find out exactly what people want. They want prosperity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course they want good living standards and better
					 labour standards, but that will come through free trade and economic activity.
					 It will not come through a central state government as the NDP wants. I have
					 lived in that country and have seen the labour standards. The standards that
					 the NDP says are there do not exist.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where it exists is where people have choices. They have
					 the choice to go from business to business to raise their living standards.
					 With this documentation and the usual NDP rhetoric about corporate interests,
					 the member seems to forget every time that it is the economic activity minus
					 the corporations. Corporations do not operate the major activities of the
					 country. Major activities of the country are done by small and medium sized
					 businesses. That is where economic prosperity comes from, not from large
					 corporations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest to the NDP to forget about a parallel
					 summit, to go out and walk the streets and talk to the local people to find the
					 answers.</p>

					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Calgary East
					 for allowing me to share his time. I am pleased to rise on behalf of the people
					 of Surrey Central to participate in the debate on Bill C-32 regarding the
					 proposed free trade agreement between Canada and Costa Rica.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The free trade agreement implementation act tries to
					 lay out the terms for a free trade agreement between our two countries by
					 gradually eliminating trade barriers in goods and services. The bill follows
					 the free trade agreement with Chile in 1997 as well as NAFTA in 1994. One of
					 its stated purposes is to promote regional integration through an instrument
					 that contributes to the establishment of the free trade area of the Americas,
					 commonly called FTAA. It could be the first of several of these agreements with
					 the other countries of South and Central America.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eighty per cent of what Costa Rica already exports to
					 Canada enters Canada duty free. Already our bilateral trade with Costa Rica has
					 had an annual growth of 6% in the last five years with a 7% increase in exports
					 and a 5% increase in imports. The agreement would further accelerate that
					 growth. Canada is looking to expand its market for goods and services, many of
					 which currently face high tariffs when exported to Costa Rica.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Costa Rica is not the problem, but the main risk is if
					 this provision is extended to the CA-4 countries, Guatemala, Nicaragua, El
					 Salvador and Honduras. That is where I see a threat because of their refining
					 capacity and because of the subsidies given by the governments in those
					 countries. The domestic sugar industry has been asked to make representation at
					 the House of Commons committee and to offer amendments to the proposed
					 legislation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the bill was debated in committee some of our
					 concerns were addressed. I opposed the bill at second reading. I commend some
					 of the improvements made at committee because of the pressure from the official
					 opposition, the Canadian Alliance members.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill now appears to support the Canadian Alliance
					 policy regarding free trade. Reduction of tariffs should be done in stages, in
					 step with other countries and not unilaterally. Canada reduced its tariffs
					 prematurely on grain and this created many problems, as all of us
					 know.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a concern that the government is putting our
					 sugar industry at risk in order to reduce completely unjustified high Costa
					 Rican tariffs on french fries and selected other exports.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have one of the most open sugar markets in the
					 world, with an import tariff on raw sugar at just zero and a tariff on refined
					 sugar at only 8%. United States and Latin American tariffs on sugar range from
					 50% to 160%. For our domestic needs Canada produces enough refined sugar. In
					 terms of exports, our only really viable market is the United States, which
					 imposes strict quotas of 12,000 tonnes of sugar per year.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other countries like Costa Rica hit us with very hefty
					 tariffs when we export sugar to their countries. For example, Guatemala has a
					 160% tariff on sugar imports.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada currently has three sugar refineries to process
					 raw sugar which, by the way, is down from seven 20 years ago. The Canadian
					 domestic sugar industry employs about 2,000 Canadians. A 111 year old company,
					 Rogers Sugar, in B.C., supports the livelihoods of 650 people and stands a
					 chance that it will lose under this agreement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a footnote to the debate, the people of British
					 Columbia have already been hurt through the government's bungling of softwood
					 lumber, tomato dumping, the mining industry, fisheries, tourism, the film
					 industry and some others.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also losing may be some 450 farmers producing 140,000
					 tonnes of sugar each year, and we know that our farmers are already in
					 desperate shape.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogers Sugar currently injects close to $100 million
					 into the Canadian economy through its operations in Vancouver and Taber,
					 Alberta, providing high quality employment to their employees. Some people from
					 my constituency are employed there as well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Costa Rica does not currently use refined sugar so
					 there is no possible benefit to Canada on this score. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some concerns that this agreement may stifle
					 the operation of market forces by giving Costa Rica more access to Canada than
					 Canada gets to Costa Rica. Trade should not only be free but also fair.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all know, a balanced free trade agreement usually
					 helps to raise the standard of living for both partners through increased
					 competitiveness and lower prices. Free trade, when done right, leads to lower
					 prices for consumers. Who benefits? It is the consumer who benefits. Free trade
					 must provide our firms with a level playing field in bilateral trading
					 relationships with Costa Rica. Markets work best where government intervenes
					 least. When the government does intervene, it must try to promote fairness and
					 look at the whole web of Canada's trade relations with other countries. We
					 cannot afford to be shortsighted. We must look at the big picture.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned, though, the agreement does more than
					 open the door for the exchange of goods and services with Costa Rica. It may
					 act as a model for the whole FTAA framework. Regional trade agreements such as
					 the FTAA should not conflict with our WTO agreements.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the bill hurting our sugar industry somewhat,
					 this agreement seems to be a step forward on several other levels. It includes
					 some side agreements on the environment and labour. It demonstrates that free
					 trade agreements can be negotiated between larger and smaller economies.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada has about $500 million invested in Costa Rica.
					 The improved access that we hope to gain with this FTA will give Canadian
					 businesses an edge over foreign competitors who do not have preferential access
					 to the Costa Rican market. We are getting access to the market. This market
					 access will benefit about 90% of Canada's current agriculture and agrifood
					 exports, so that is a big benefit.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, Canada exports goods and services of close to 45%
					 of our GDP, which is almost half of our GDP. This is a high proportion in
					 comparison to our major trading partners, so our success in international trade
					 is important to sustain our Canadian economy, particularly during this time.
					 Many SMEs, small and medium sized enterprises, in Canada depend on trade and
					 the foreign market for their success and growth. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore I look forward to the bill and I will be
					 supporting Bill C-32 at this stage.</p>

					 NDP): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I will advise the Chair that I intend to
					 divide my time with the hon. member for Vancouver East.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have witnessed the most extraordinary spectacle in
					 the House this afternoon: this unholy alliance between the Liberal Party, in
					 particular the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for International Trade,
					 and the Canadian Alliance. They are attacking the New Democrats. Why is it that
					 they are attacking us? They are attacking us because we have the effrontery to
					 actually speak out for human rights, to speak out for the rights of working
					 people and to speak out for the environment, because we have the nerve to talk
					 about the importance of democracy and putting the rights of democratically
					 elected representatives of the people of this country ahead of corporate
					 rights. What a shocking thing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member from Calgary who spoke earlier on
					 behalf of the Alliance said that we have to listen to the people from the south
					 and that this legislation will be good for them. I wish that member had
					 listened to the voices from the south, from Mexico, Colombia, Honduras, Peru,
					 Brazil and elsewhere when they were in Quebec City speaking about the
					 destructive impact of the existing trade deals on their people. Had he been at
					 the women's forum in Quebec City he would have heard women speaking about the
					 appalling conditions in the maquiladora zones in Mexico, the poisoning of
					 workers from chemicals, the violence and the ruthless repression of the rights
					 of working people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member from Calgary asks why we are nitpicking over
					 workers' rights. I will tell him. Is it nitpicking to say that working people
					 should have the right under ILO standards to organize and bargain collectively,
					 the right to equal pay for work of equal value, the right to work free of
					 discrimination and prohibitions? They should not have to work without any
					 restrictions at all on child labour and forced labour.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is it that the Liberal Party and the Alliance do
					 not understand about the rights of working people? Or is it that they do not
					 really give a damn about the rights of working people? All they really care
					 about is corporate profit. That is the bottom line for them. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the New Democratic Party oppose the legislation
					 and we say that this Canada-Costa Rica bilateral free trade agreement is in
					 fact part of what would lay the groundwork for a hemispheric agreement that
					 would simply replicate all of the destructive impact of the existing NAFTA. We
					 want nothing to do with that, certainly nothing that would increase the
					 momentum toward a free trade area of the Americas, an FTAA.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is that? Too often Canada's trade policy has
					 ignored social considerations, human considerations, the environment and the
					 rights of workers and has put strictly commercial advantages for Canadian
					 corporations ahead of all of them. There is no better example of that than
					 chapter 11 of NAFTA. While chapter 11 of NAFTA is not explicitly included in
					 the Canada-Costa Rica bilateral free trade agreement, it is in fact imported
					 into that agreement.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was a member of the Standing Committee on Foreign
					 Affairs when my friend, the hon. member for Joliette and Bloc Quebecois critic
					 on international trade, tried to move a very clear amendment to exclude chapter
					 11 from this Canada-Costa Rica agreement, but the government did not accept
					 this fundamental principle.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We already know that the rights of working people in
					 Costa Rica have been trampled on. It is virtually impossible to form or join a
					 trade union in Costa Rica in the private sector because of the hostility from
					 employers and the government's unwillingness to enforce its own labour
					 laws.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that Costa Rica was the birthplace of the
					 anti-worker Solidarista movement which set up employer sponsored associations
					 in banana plantations to supplant bona fide trade unions. In the banana zone in
					 Costa Rica working conditions are appalling and dangerous because of the lack
					 of protection for workers using chemicals, resulting in the birth of
					 genetically deformed babies, sterility, ill health and death among workers. In
					 the private sector, Costa Rican workers are effectively denied any opportunity
					 for collective bargaining whatsoever. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Labour Congress and the International
					 Confederation of Free Trade Unions, which represents 125 million workers
					 worldwide, recently wrote to the president of Costa Rica, Dr. Miguel Angel
					 Rodriguez, expressing their concern about the situation faced by Costa Rican
					 workers, especially those in the public sector.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does the government say? The government says that
					 it has great side accords. It says that it has a side accord on labour and on
					 the environment. We have seen this movie before. We have seen the so-called
					 side accords under the existing NAFTA and they are a joke. They do not protect
					 workers and they sure as heck do not protect the environment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When governments fail to enforce labour laws that
					 protect such basic rights as the freedom of association, what is the recourse
					 under the side agreement under NAFTA? They can make a submission to the
					 national administrative office of a signatory government. What can that office
					 do? It can recommend ministerial consultations with the offending government,
					 and that is it. There is no respect for the fundamental rights of workers and
					 no respect for the environment whatsoever, and that is continued in the
					 Canada-Costa Rica agreement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far from expanding the principles of NAFTA, which put
					 corporate rights ahead of democracy, ahead of the rights of working people,
					 ahead of the environment and ahead of basic human rights, we should be
					 replacing that agreement with a fair trade agreement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not support the bill and we certainly do not
					 support the extension of NAFTA into Costa Rica or anywhere else in this
					 hemisphere.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to take a moment to say a few words about the
					 impact of the bill on the sugar industry. I recently met with representatives
					 of Rogers Sugar, an refinery that has over 200 employees in the Vancouver area
					 located in the constituency of my colleague for Vancouver East. Many of those
					 workers live in my constituency of Burnaby--Douglas.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogers has been around for about 112 years. It is a
					 Canadian owned company. It provides quality union jobs to over 200 employees
					 who are members of the Retail Wholesale Union. It contributes about $33 million
					 to the economy. I want to be very clear that the employees, the management of
					 Rogers refinery, as well as others in the sugar industry across Canada, are
					 deeply concerned about the implications of the bill for the survival of that
					 industry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the bill in any way is seen to be a model or a
					 template for negotiations with the so-called CA-4 nations of Guatemala,
					 Nicaragua, El Salvador and Honduras, it will be very destructive for the sugar
					 industry in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was pleased that the foreign affairs committee made a
					 recommendation to the government. The recommendation was not part of the bill
					 but it was a strong unanimous recommendation that this not be seen in any way
					 as a model. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly, on behalf of my colleagues in the New
					 Democratic Party, I want to make it very clear that we reject any extension of
					 this Canada-Costa Rica agreement to the other countries I have mentioned. It
					 could very well spell the end for the Rogers Sugar refinery.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, I would once again say that we as New
					 Democrats have always supported a rules based trading system but what we have
					 seen too often is that those rules benefit not working people, not small
					 businesses, not the environment and not human rights. They simply hurt the
					 poorest of the poor. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not even had the opportunity to speak to the
					 implications the bill would have for agriculture. I would note that too often
					 agri-business means that more and more small farmers, some of the poorest
					 farmers in Central and South America, are being pushed off their land because
					 of cheap imports coming in from the north. Certainly, that is not
					 acceptable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have serious concerns as well about the impact of
					 pesticides in the agriculture industry in Costa Rica but these concerns have
					 not been addressed in the legislation. In terms of human rights and in terms of
					 the implications for agriculture, the environment, the rights of the working
					 people and for democracy itself, we say no to the legislation and we say no to
					 the extension of the bill into any form of FTAA.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, after listening very carefully to my

					 repository of all truth and virtue and if we do not happen to agree with the
					 New Democratic Party of Canada we are somehow part of some unholy alliance.
					 Well I guess 75% of Canadians are part of this unholy alliance because 75% of
					 Canadians strongly support free trade.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask my colleague to react to the
					 comments of Juan Somavia. A few days ago I asked the director general of the
					 ILO whether the ILO supported the inclusion of labour standards within trade
					 agreements. I told him that the Canadian government did not think it was the
					 way to go. Mr. Juan Somavia's answer was, and I quote:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>For example, Canada is being very
						  creative in this, through side agreements which are of a promotional nature.

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Somavia was very flattering toward Canada. He
					 rejected out of hand the fact that we must enshrine ILO standards into trade
					 agreements. I know the hon. member could not be present for that discussion but
					 I have just quoted Mr. Somavia. I would like to know what the hon. member's
					 reaction to that is. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to know what the hon. member's
					 reaction is to the EU ministers. We often hear the EU cited by the New
					 Democratic Party. What is his reaction to the EU trade ministers who have said
					 that they reject putting labour agreements into trade deals, that they litter
					 up the trade deals unnecessarily and that it is not the way to go? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, why is the NDP against helping one of the
					 poorest nations in the Caribbean area, a nation that needs trade not aid? Why
					 does it oppose that?</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poppy campaign is perhaps one of the Royal Canadian

					 poppies helps to provide direct assistance to ex-service people who are in need

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poppy is our symbol of remembrance for those who

					 the supreme price for the freedoms we enjoy today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was from the field of war that Lieutenant Colonel
					 John McCrae penned the words of that famous poem: “In Flanders fields the
					 poppies blow”. These words take on a special meaning of significance on
					 Remembrance Day when we pause to honour our war dead.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not enough for us to pay respects on Remembrance
					 Day alone. I appeal to all Canadians to give generously to the poppy campaign

					 the Senate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ceremony included the unveiling of a bust of
					 Senator Gladstone. Fred Gladstone, the senator's son, was in attendance as were
					 Senators Dan Hays, Joyce Fairbairn and Thelma Chalifoux.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James Gladstone was born in 1887 near Mountain Mill,
					 Alberta, and was a member of the Blood Band. He was appointed to the Senate in
					 1958 to represent Lethbridge, Alberta, and served for 13 years. As senator he
					 co-chaired the joint committee on Indian affairs and fought for improvements
					 for native people. His biography, <i>The Gentle Persuader</i>, was published in
					 1986. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I call on the House to join me today in paying tribute
					 to the lifelong dedication and achievements of Senator Gladstone.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, this year Medical Radiation Technology
					 Week will be celebrated from November 5 to November 9. Medical radiation
					 technology is and will continue to be at the forefront of medicine in the 21st
					 century as more procedures will be based upon the use of diagnostic imaging and
					 radiation therapy. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medical radiation technologists in all disciplines,
					 like Elaine Buchner from London and other professionals from across the
					 country, are frontline health care workers in a variety of settings such as
					 hospitals, clinics, and labs. More of these professionals will be needed to
					 meet the future needs of our citizens. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent large government investments in new diagnostic
					 imaging and radiation therapy technology promises to benefit both the public
					 and professionals involved with such state of the art equipment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask the House to join me in recognizing Medical
					 Radiation Technology Week and encouraging more of our young people to seek a
					 career in radiation technology.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently over 20% of Canada's population does not read

					 lifelong learners. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We tend to equate the ability to read with
					 intelligence. This is not the case. We do not know what happened along the path

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Marc Alexandre was killed in cold blood on

			 Implementation Act</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill
				C-32, an act to implement the Free Trade
				Agreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of the Republic
				of Costa Rica, be read the third time and passed.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-60518"></A><a HREF="#Int-60521"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-60511"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East,
					 NDP): </b>

	Madam Speaker, I am happy to continue the debate where
					 my colleague from Burnaby--Douglas left off on Bill C-32, an act to implement
					 the free trade agreement between the Government of Canada and the government of
					 the Republic of Costa Rica.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In listening to the debate earlier I felt offended that
					 members of the Canadian Alliance lobbed at the members of NDP that somehow we
					 were nitpicking and attaching our debate to small things, such as defending the
					 rights of workers, whether they were in Costa Rica, Canada or any other
					 country. As the debate continued, the parliamentary secretary wanted to know
					 why the NDP was opposed to helping one of the poorest countries in the
					 hemisphere. Presumably he meant Costa Rica.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP is absolutely in favour of helping one of the
					 poorest countries in the hemisphere. In fact, this party has had a very proud
					 and long tradition of promoting international solidarity, economic investment
					 and aid and development. We have pressed the government to meet its commitments
					 through the red book and in other areas over many years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However the debate today is really about who this trade
					 agreement will help. I would challenge the parliamentary secretary to produce
					 the evidence as to how this particular free trade agreement will help poor
					 people in Costa Rica or, for that matter, workers in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like other members in the House, I have also received
					 information from workers and management from Rogers Sugar which is located in
					 my riding of Vancouver East. I want to tell members of the House, particularly
					 the government members, that there is a huge concern about the impact of this
					 trade agreement on Canadian companies and the sugar industry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June of this year I met with a joint delegation of
					 labour and management representatives from Rogers Sugar. Anyone who knows about
					 labour management issues will know that it is not usual for labour and
					 management to come together. However in this case it was a joint delegation
					 because the several hundred people who work at the plants as well as the
					 management of Rogers Sugar are very concerned about the impact of this
					 agreement.</p>


	<A NAME="T1510"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1510"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1515"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1505"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1510)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<A NAME="Int-60521"></A><a HREF="#Int-60526"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-60518"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b></b>

	In fact when they wrote the Prime Minister to express
					 their concern they received the following response. In a letter dated April 26,
					 the Prime Minister said that in any free trade negotiation it was necessary for
					 each side to consider compromises in the interest of reaching an agreement
					 which was fair overall. In the case of Costa Rica, Canada recognized that the
					 differences in the level of development of our two countries would need to be
					 reflected in the final agreement. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then went on to say that the agreement negotiated
					 provided opportunities for exporters in both countries to explore new markets,
					 including opportunities for some Canadian sugar exporters to sell to Costa
					 Rica. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is absolutely contrary to the evidence and
					 information that has come before us. The fact is that if the tariff were
					 eliminated, Canadian refineries would be exposed to competition from Costa
					 Rican refineries without the prospect of better access to that market for our
					 exporters, contrary to what the Prime Minister said.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality is there is virtually no market for refined
					 sugar in Costa Rica or elsewhere in central America. Granting duty free entry
					 for refined sugar from Costa Rica and we believe, eventually from Honduras, El
					 Salvador, Nicaragua and especially Guatemala, will end up eliminating a
					 significant portion of a long-standing Canadian industry. We have to be
					 incredibly concerned about that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we could look at what the NDP has articulated in its
					 position, it is precisely because of this race to the bottom. It is another
					 example of the lowest common denominator approach that opens the door to job
					 flight from countries, such as Canada, where there are tougher, more
					 progressive legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not just about protecting jobs in Canada,
					 although that is very important. It is also about protecting and encouraging
					 high quality jobs in other parts of the world. We have heard a lot of debate
					 today in the House about how this agreement will lift people out of poverty. We
					 heard from the Alliance that globalization has moved people out of poverty. We
					 heard that the trickle down theory is working very well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, there is ample evidence to suggest that these
					 trade agreements have done nothing to improve the lives of working people.
					 These trade agreements have done nothing to improve the quality of our
					 environment or the quality of social conditions that exist in many countries.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the NDP take a very principled stand. This
					 is not about being opposed to trade agreements per se on any grounds. It is
					 about being in favour of trade agreements that protect our environment, that
					 protect quality social conditions for people and that enshrine and protect
					 worker rights.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To go back to the situation in Costa Rica, because that
					 is the agreement before us, one of the things we should be concerned about is
					 the development of export processing zones in Costa Rica, of which there are
					 nine. One thing that is taking place, particularly in the textile industry, is
					 that companies increasingly are hiring workers at home where they are not
					 protected by labour laws nor are they covered by social security, holidays or
					 job security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to ask critically whether the agreement
					 actually is helping one of the poorest countries in the hemisphere or whether
					 it is conferring greater rights for greater profits for large corporations.
					 Basically the workers get left behind at home with absolutely no
					 protection.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is information on the record, and it is available
					 for any member to see, that private sector employers have ignored the ILO
					 recommendations that workers, particularly in the private sector, have been
					 denied the right to organize. They have been denied the right to basic, safe
					 working conditions. They have been denied the right to decent wages.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It becomes very clear that the trade agreement is not
					 in the interests of poor people in those countries. It is not in the interests
					 of protecting our environment. I feel proud that as an NDP caucus we understand
					 this and stand in solidarity with international labour movements, with the
					 labour movement in Canada and with NGOs that have done analysis on this and
					 have participated in things like the people's summit at the summit of the
					 Americas in Quebec City and the people's summit in Vancouver at the APEC
					 conference.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is through those forums that the issues affecting
					 workers have come to the forefront. As we know, that debate has not taken place
					 in the House. We raise day after day the fact that the summit of the Americas
					 was not brought forward to the House for any kind of democratic vote. These
					 agreements affect all of us. They affect our local communities and the workers
					 in my riding of East Vancouver but the House has not participated in any kind
					 of democratic vote about whether or not we should be adopting the FTAA for
					 example.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP is not nitpicking. The NDP is not opposing the
					 agreement because we are opposed to free trade or any trade agreement. We are
					 opposing this agreement because we see it as nothing more than continuing the
					 sellout of Canada. We see it as a continuation of a policy from the government
					 that actually is abandoning the basic human rights and the basic human dignity
					 of workers in Costa Rica.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very glad that the workers I met with from Rogers
					 Sugar understood that they were standing in support of the workers in Costa
					 Rica. They did not see it as just an issue of protecting their jobs and their
					 turf. They understood that this race to the bottom not only affected them but
					 also the workers in those other countries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad the NDP is opposing this trade agreement. It
					 is a bad trade agreement both for workers in Canada and for workers in those
					 countries.</p>

				  </b>

	Madam Speaker, I listened with interest to the comments
					 of the hon. member for Vancouver East. I listened to her say that we should
					 have democratic votes in the House about these things. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It strikes me that the NDP has refused to recognize
					 democratic votes that have taken place in elections in the past few years. It
					 refuses to recognize that in the last two or three election campaigns the vast
					 majority of Canadians voted for parties that support free trade and the
					 expansion of our ability to trade around the world. This would allow products
					 from other countries to come into our country without tariffs or with lower
					 tariffs so that our consumers can get access to goods and services from around
					 the world at reasonable prices.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems strange that a party that talks about its
					 concern for consumers and ordinary people is not interested in ensuring we are
					 able to get goods and services at low prices.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time it surprises me that the NDP refuses
					 to recognize that with this agreement there are side agreements on environment
					 and labour. The two governments involved in the agreement believe environment
					 and labour co-operation should go hand in hand with trade liberalization. That
					 is a fundamental element of Canada's foreign policy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The environment agreement in this case would commit the
					 parties to provide for high levels of environmental quality and the effective
					 enforcement of environmental laws. It would provide for technical co-operation
					 to strengthen environmental management systems. It would seek to expand public
					 participation in environmental policymaking. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is important for both countries. It is important
					 to Canada and to Costa Rica that the public is involved in these processes and
					 that they are not just handed down. The people must have a chance to take part
					 in the discussion about the development of these important policies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It goes without saying that the labour and environment
					 side agreements are important complements to the Canada-Costa Rica free trade
					 agreement. All I have heard today from members of the NDP is how terrible it is
					 that we are not dealing with the environment. They say that we do not care
					 about the environment or about labour. They seem to deny and ignore that in
					 this case there are agreements on those very things.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the hon. member explain to us how the NDP can
					 refuse to accept the decisions of the electorate in democratic votes in
					 Canada's last three elections?</p>

				  </b>

	Madam Speaker, I thank the member for his question but
					 let us not forget our history. In the election of 1988 more Canadians voted
					 against the beginning of the free trade era than voted in favour. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the hon. member would care to look at the history of
					 his own party he would probably remember that the party of whose government he
					 is a part was opposed to the original free trade agreement. If we want to talk
					 about democratic expression, a majority of Canadians voted for members of
					 parliament and parties that were opposed to that agreement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since that time, if we look at information that came
					 out before the summit of the Americas, there has been growing opposition from
					 Canadians to what these trade agreements represent. There is a growing
					 realization and understanding that these trade agreements are nothing more than
					 huge giveaways to multinational corporations that are able to move capital
					 across borders and disregard the rights of workers, the environment or social
					 conditions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member says that there are all these sidebar
					 agreements. The sidebar agreements are not worth the paper they are written on.
					 The CCRALC does not oblige a government to enact or maintain labour laws of a
					 high standard. It only requires that a government enforce the labour laws it
					 enacts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the minister was in central America earlier this
					 year he was quoted in the local press as promising that Canada would not use
					 environmental and labour legislation as a barrier to trade deals.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must ask what the government's real agenda is in
					 this regard. Is it to raise the standard of living for people in these
					 countries or is it to confer enormous rights on the corporations and leave
					 people at the mercy of the employers?</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said: Madam Speaker, I am pleased today to rise to
					 speak to private member's Motion No. 382. I was pleased to take on the motion
					 from my hon. colleague from Vancouver Quadra after he was appointed
					 Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea for a national rivers day originated in
					 British Columbia where on the last Sunday in September of each year B.C. Rivers
					 Day is celebrated. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.C. Rivers Day started in 1980 with a single clean-up
					 event along the Thompson River involving about 40 people. While the event that
					 year was small it was nonetheless a great success in terms of the amount of
					 garbage and debris that the small group of dedicated people removed from the
					 river and its banks. As a result of that effort the group decided to plan a few
					 more events the following year.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus began the long journey of B.C. Rivers Day. It has
					 now snowballed to a point where this year more than 100 events took place
					 involving an estimated 45,000 people. It has become the largest river related
					 event of its kind in North America. It has become popular for a number of
					 reasons, not the least of which is the concern of British Columbians for the
					 state of local waterways.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By demonstrating their strong support for B.C. Rivers
					 Day British Columbians are poised to embrace a similar national celebration of
					 our rivers as I believe all Canadians will. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.C. Rivers Day attracts participation from
					 recreational clubs, conservation organizations, community groups, schools and
					 local governments. Almost 350 organizations were involved last year. Virtually
					 every local government proclaimed it, as did the province itself. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every year this diverse collection of groups hosts a
					 variety of events across the province, events that celebrate the cultural,
					 ecological, historical, aesthetic, spiritual and recreational importance of
					 B.C. rivers to the people of that wonderful province. Most of these events
					 involve volunteers who contribute their time and energy to make a positive
					 difference to the health of B.C. rivers. Their activities also benefit the
					 local communities that take part in the celebrations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will list some examples of activities that took place
					 this year, activities such as river cleanups, art exhibitions, interpretive
					 walks, workshops, tree plantings, canoe trips, readings, slide shows,
					 educational paddles and the Whistler Fishtival.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the midst of all this fun, important public
					 education is taking place. While B.C. Rivers Day offers people the opportunity
					 to get out and experience the province's spectacular river heritage, it also
					 brings attention to the need for better river management. Some organizers view
					 B.C. Rivers Day as a vehicle to raise awareness about the threats facing local
					 rivers. Others use it as an opportunity to showcase success stories. Often
					 these perspectives can be combined into one event. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intent in establishing B.C. Rivers Day was to
					 celebrate the province's river heritage and promote the natural, cultural and
					 recreational values of its waterways.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intent of national rivers day should be the same.
					 Canada has a long and rich river heritage. A national rivers day would be a
					 fitting way of commemorating it. I suspect that the same kind of support and
					 enthusiasm we have seen in British Columbia will unfold across the country as
					 national rivers day picks up steam in the years ahead.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I share with all Canadians a deep love and respect for
					 our rivers. As members may recall, I helped bring Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to
					 Ottawa last year to speak to members about his experiences with the U.S.
					 organization Riverkeeper. The story of Riverkeeper's efforts to rehabilitate,
					 protect and preserve a long list of rivers all over the United States has
					 inspired people around the world including here in Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the honour of working with Mr. Daniel
					 LeBlanc who was the first riverkeeper in Canada. Mr. LeBlanc and his associates
					 have worked long and hard to improve the condition of the Petitcodiac River in
					 New Brunswick. I hope recent announcements mean that progress is being
					 made.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closer to home, or at least to the House, Canada now
					 has a riverkeeper for the Ottawa River.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may have seen the Canadian riverkeepers
					 broadcast on the CPAC channel. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the riverkeepers are relatively new, Canadians'
					 awareness of and concern for our rivers is longstanding. I am sure all my
					 colleagues in this place would agree that rivers have a tremendously important
					 role in the history of Canada and always will. They connect us to both our past
					 and our future. Hugh MacLennan wrote the following in 1961:</p>

<td><small>Incredible though it sounds, the
						  canoe parties which used to leave Montreal in the late eighteenth century were
						  able to paddle nearly all the way to the Pacific Ocean. Their portages were
						  many and exhausting, yet few of them were longer than three miles.So it came
						  about, thanks to the maze of lakes in the Shield, that Canadian waters would be
						  used as an east-west lateral avenue from the St. Lawrence to the Pacific above
						  the American border. That is why it is accurate to say that without the rivers,
						  the early nation could never have survived. The plains and British Columbia
						  would have been fatally severed from the older communities of the Canadian
						  east.</small></td>

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's rivers are Canada's veins, Canada's arteries,
					 Canada's highways, Canada's stories, Canada's history. In fact, they are
					 Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure most members would agree that increased
					 public awareness of rivers and watersheds is a noble objective. We know there
					 is great public interest and willingness in river and lake cleanups. In my
					 riding of York North, for example, people in the community have exerted great
					 efforts on helping to clean up Lake Simcoe and on river conservation
					 projects.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A national rivers day would also increase the public
					 profile of the Canadian heritage rivers system. Established in 1984, the
					 Canadian heritage rivers system is a co-operative program developed and run by
					 the federal, provincial and territorial governments. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objectives of the program are to give national
					 recognition to Canada's outstanding rivers and to ensure long term management
					 and conservation of their natural, cultural, historical and recreational
					 values. There are currently 38 rivers with a total length of more than 9,000
					 Kilometres on the Canadian heritage rivers system. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian heritage rivers system seeks to give
					 national recognition to the important rivers of Canada and to ensure their
					 future management in such a way that the natural and human heritage which they
					 represent is conserved and interpreted, and the opportunities they possess for
					 recreation and heritage appreciation are realized by residents of and visitors
					 to Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the board secretariat and working with other
					 federal agencies, national co-operating and non-governmental organizations,
					 Parks Canada publicly works hard at promoting the system as a national program,
					 a national responsibility.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's rivers are not only keys to the understanding
					 of our country's natural and human history. Virtually all of the nation's fresh
					 water eventually flows through rivers into five different salt water bodies:
					 the Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic Oceans, Hudson Bay and into the Gulf of
					 Mexico. Our river system, thereby, cannot be separated from the larger bodies
					 of water into which they flow.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to close with a quotation from T.S. Eliot
					 that speaks beautifully to our propensity to ignore and often neglect nature
					 personified here as the river:</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<blockquote>
		
<p>I do not know much about gods; but I think that the
							 river<br>
		

	Is a strong brown god--sullen, untamed and
							 intractable.<br>
		

	 Patient to some degree, at first recognised as a
							 frontier;<br>
		

	Useful, untrustworthy, as a conveyor of
							 commerce;<br>
		

	 Then only a problem confronting the builder of

	 The problem once solved, the brown god is almost

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T.S. Eliot's image of the river as something we have
					 used solely for our own purposes and, distracted by the technological age,
					 failed to honour, is one some may differ with, especially those who work on our
					 rivers or who are more connected to our rivers than many of us are.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, we all need to be reminded of the value
					 of these waterways. Therefore I ask my colleagues: Would an annual day spent
					 celebrating rivers not serve all of us well? The creation of a national rivers
					 day would afford a wonderful opportunity to encourage public awareness and
					 involvement in stream and river management, in cleanups, in river heritage and
					 so much more.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would represent a powerful step in the protection
					 and preservation of Canadian rivers and watersheds, one that would be organized
					 and implemented by communities and local groups. It would highlight an
					 environmental issue of great concern to Canadians for freshwater rivers are
					 linked to healthy fishery, healthy forests and healthy communities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would contribute to the illustration of Canadian
					 history and identity. It would provide an opportunity to bring Canada's river
					 constituencies closer together on tangible projects nationally, regionally and
					 locally. Above all, a national rivers day would be a new source of pride for
					 Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons I believe a national day of
					 celebration would be appropriate and well deserved. I look forward to hearing
					 the comments of my colleagues on this motion.</p>

					 (Saskatoon—Wanuskewin, Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Madam Speaker, my constituency name is a Cree word that
					 means a place of peace, a place where you do not feel threatened or inhibited.
					 It is a beautiful word. My constituency is right on the banks of the
					 Saskatchewan River. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I enjoy rivers. I happen to live not that far from a
					 river, the mighty Saskatchewan. Throughout my growing up years I had the
					 opportunity and privilege to canoe on rivers, lakes and bodies of water
					 throughout our country. There is always something calming and tranquil about
					 being around rivers and streams. I appreciate what the member across the way
					 has done today. I want to thank her for giving me an opportunity to walk down
					 memory lane and have a nostalgic look at what some of those bodies of water
					 have meant to me in my life.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is some merit in recognizing the value of lakes
					 and waters in our country. These days more than ever we need to be concerned
					 about properly stewarding and sustaining this life-giving water. We should not
					 be squandering water. We should be passing this commodity on to our
					 children.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the main, I would be supportive of the motion before
					 us today. However, some questions have to be asked as we proceed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a unique situation with a national rivers day
					 when so many other days and weeks are proclaimed throughout the course of the
					 calendar year. I have a few pages here in respect of the beautiful national
					 parks in Canada. Many of those parks have rivers and bodies of water in
					 them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I noticed as well that a United States senate
					 resolution introduced in May 1998 is something akin to what is being proposed
					 here. As to the dollar cost I am not sure what is involved in the United
					 States. This is one question I would raise in respect to the motion. It is
					 inevitable when we put something into law. What is the dollar figure? I am not
					 sure what is in the mind of the member. However our neighbour the U.S.A. has a
					 similar resolution.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware of some of the events in our annual
					 calendar. February is black history month and Canadian radio music month. There
					 is nothing in particular for March. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April there is national wildlife week. Of course we
					 have Good Friday, Easter and Easter Monday. There is also earth day, national
					 volunteer week, world book and copyright day, Canada book day, and
					 international dance day.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May we have named some more days as well. The
					 calendar is pretty full when we think about it. We are soon going to run out of
					 days, weeks and months. In May we have world press freedom day, national forest
					 week, the international day of families, world telecommunications day,
					 international museums day, Victoria Day of course, aboriginal awareness week
					 and national access awareness week. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are a lot of good events actually. There is
					 probably no end of other days we could put on our calendar with respect to
					 honouring and recognizing some very good events.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the month of June there is Canadian environment week
					 and national public week. World environment day is on June 5. National
					 aboriginal day is on June 21. We also have Saint-Jean-Baptiste day, national
					 armed forces day and so on. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On July 1 we celebrate Canada Day. I will not go
					 through July and August. I am skipping some of the lesser known days.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October there is the international day of older
					 persons, international music day, national family week, Thanksgiving, national
					 citizenship week, persons day, United Nations day and world development
					 information day.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December there is the international day for the
					 abolition of slavery, the international day of disabled persons, volunteer day
					 for economic and social development, national day of remembrance and action on
					 violence against women, and human rights day. Then we round out the year with
					 Christmas Day and Boxing Day.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some very good days. I am sure the House has
					 been enlightened by the plethora of days and weeks.</p>


	<A NAME="T1550"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1550"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1555"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1545"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1550)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been numerous statements in the House when
					 these days have come up, such as our national flag day, which is very
					 important. It is the day on which we recognize the very important symbol of our
					 country. Members of parliament typically make statements in respect of it and
					 things are done across the country to honour the day.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other days such as natural resources day. I
					 notice that some of the these days are sponsored by associations and are not
					 necessarily proclaimed by the House. For example, national forest week is
					 sponsored by the Canadian Forestry Association. It is possible for various
					 groups, agencies and organizations to promote to the Canadian public and the
					 country at large some of these very important ideals and concepts. That is
					 appropriate. The initiative taken by individuals is not a bad thing in respect
					 of these things. We have Elizabeth Fry week and mental illness awareness week.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fire prevention week is a little special this year
					 because of what has happened in the United States of America and the heroic
					 actions of firefighters laying down their lives in New York.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year it was more moving and stirring for me when I
					 was presenting medals and awards on behalf of the lieutenant governor in the
					 city of Saskatoon. We hope we never have to use the services of these good
					 people but sometimes they do put their lives on the line. They risk life and
					 limb in carrying out their duties.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other events include national marine day and national
					 mining week. As I said before some of these are supported and sponsored by
					 industries and not by the House. I appreciate that because I do not think
					 everything has to generate from this place, that this is the fountainhead of
					 all wisdom and initiative in our country. I am appreciative when certain
					 agencies and associations do that kind of thing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate the member's effort in bringing forward
					 this motion. I appreciate the waters across our country. I and my party
					 certainly are of the view that from an environmental perspective we need to be
					 protective and watchful. We need to sustain our rivers. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a little careful sometimes in making a commitment
					 on these things when I do not know the price tag. If the motion is about
					 various groups across the country promoting it on a voluntary basis by way of
					 newspapers and other publications and stirring up activity in schools, clubs
					 and organizations, then I would be for it. I would be a little more reluctant
					 if it meant big buckets of money and lots of dollars being sent out all over
					 the country when it could be better spent in other areas. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the motion is about an initiative to play up the
					 importance of rivers, riverways and waters in Canada and maintaining and
					 preserving them, then I certainly support that. I appreciate the motion the
					 member has brought forward.</p>

					 PC/DR): </b>

	Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to participate in the
					 debate on the motion regarding a national rivers day. I commend my colleague
					 from Ontario for bringing the motion forward. She began her speech by talking
					 about the things that are happening in British Columbia with rivers day. That
					 of course is the province I represent and it is a pleasure to add my voice on
					 behalf of the Coalition.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within my own riding of Dewdney--Alouette, which
					 encompasses Pitt Meadows, Maple Ridge, Mission, Agassiz and Harrison Hot
					 Springs, there are a lot of rivers. Actually the Alouette River is one of the
					 reasons the riding is called Dewdney--Alouette. Many people ask me what the
					 name means. They are uncertain as to where the riding is because it could be
					 almost anywhere in Canada. Some people think I am from Quebec because of the
					 name, Alouette River. It is mainly based on the name of the Alouette River and
					 Alouette Lake that are in the west end of the riding. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the Alouette River, a number of
					 activities happen on rivers day every year, a number of which I have had the
					 opportunity to participate in. I want to commend the folks who are involved in
					 rivers day in British Columbia, particularly in Maple Ridge in my riding. A lot
					 of fine events happen every year on rivers day.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to spend a few minutes bragging about the
					 Alouette River Management Society. It is referred to as ARMS and was formed in
					 1993. The primary focus of ARMS at that time was the attempt to increase the
					 base flows from the Alouette dam. This goal was achieved in 1996 when the base
					 flow was increased fivefold. It was quite an accomplishment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then ARMS has become involved in almost all
					 aspects of watershed stewardship, including inventory and monitoring, habitat
					 restoration and lobbying for the protection of aquatic habitat. Its members are
					 extremely active in the community and often attend private properties in order
					 to assist landowners with the implementation of sound stewardship practices on
					 their land. They should be commended for that because they not only believe in
					 stewardship, they practise it. They help others take care of an important
					 resource and part of the community, the rivers in our riding. Of course these
					 things happen throughout B.C. and I believe it would be a good thing if this
					 model were used in other provinces. I am sure there are other societies similar
					 to ARMS.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ARMS has also been able to have a very good
					 relationship with the local media. Quite often we see articles in the local
					 paper about its activities and the good work it is doing. I commend its members
					 for that and because of that they have also been able to educate and inform a
					 considerable number of people very quickly.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ARMS is based at the Rivers Heritage Centre in East
					 Maple Ridge. Its goal and stated purpose is to be a source for community
					 stewardship information and direct advice. Some of the activities at the centre
					 have included training in stream keeping, workshops dealing with sustainable
					 development practices, school field trips and hosting public events.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a board of directors and over 300 members in
					 the society. They have done a lot of good work in the riding, in the Maple
					 Ridge area in particular. I commend them for that. That is very fitting given
					 the topic of the motion before the House today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fraser River is a major river within my riding. It
					 is one of the boundaries of many ridings in the lower mainland area. That is
					 very important not only in my riding but in the surrounding ridings of my
					 colleagues in the lower mainland area and upper Fraser valley in British
					 Columbia.</p>


	<A NAME="T1600"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1600"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1605"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1555"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1600)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague who brought this motion forward mentioned
					 some of the other activities that happen in British Columbia on rivers day. It
					 is a way to connect average, everyday citizens with the importance of rivers,
					 and that is a good thing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may be debating to have a special day set aside for
					 rivers as a heritage motion one day but it is more than that. It crosses into
					 the environmental side of things as well. Rivers are a very important resource
					 for communities throughout the country. It is incumbent upon us to demonstrate
					 this notion of stewardship whenever we are dealing with our environment, and in
					 particular when we are talking about rivers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we do not have organizations like ARMS or
					 individuals involved in the process of taking care of the smaller creeks which
					 feed into larger rivers, or the larger rivers themselves, we will not have
					 sustainable creeks and rivers. The environment could be damaged and all kinds
					 of other unintended consequences could result.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support my colleague's motion that was brought
					 forward today. There was a lot of talk about the Niagara River a few months
					 ago. Members in the House may recall the particular debate about the
					 north-south flow of that river. It is in my colleague's province of Ontario and
					 she may want to expand on that in her closing comments. In all seriousness it
					 is a good idea to have a day in recognition of our rivers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague from the Alliance mentioned that we would
					 have all kinds of days that would acknowledge different things and went through
					 a very long list. Should that discourage us from taking the action that would
					 have a positive effect on our communities?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to see the kinds of things that I mentioned
					 happen within communities across Canada. Those are the kinds of activities that
					 will enhance and sustain Canada's river system. To have a day to acknowledge
					 rivers is a positive thing because it would draw attention to that area and
					 would hopefully spark other groups getting involved in the same kinds of
					 activities within their local communities. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I commend my colleague on her good motion and I commend
					 the group in my riding, ARMS, on its good work in Maple Ridge.</p>

					 Secretary to the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada,
					 Lib.): </b>

	Madam Speaker, it is a great honour to rise in support
					 of the motion put forward by my colleague from York North. We celebrate B.C.
					 Rivers Day annually in British Columbia.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recognize and appreciate the comments of members
					 opposite, particularly my colleague from British Columbia, the member for 
					 Dewdney--Alouette. His
					 constituency shares the border of the mighty Fraser River that runs through
					 both our constituencies. As it passes my constituency of Vancouver Quadra it
					 also passes West Point Gray and then flows into the Pacific Ocean.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fraser River is of particular importance to us as
					 we consider the importance of having a national rivers day. It exemplifies more
					 than any other river in the country the wonderful words from the poem of T. S.
					 Eliot as quoted by my colleague.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a T. S. Eliot of sorts in British Columbia. His
					 name is Mark Angelo. Mr. Angelo was the originator and energizer of the concept
					 of B.C. Rivers Day. He was the long time member and leader of the outdoor
					 recreation council of British Columbia. The council brings together dozens of
					 different outdoor recreational environmental groups and tens of thousands of
					 British Columbians who enjoy themselves throughout the year by teaching and
					 instructing us. It helps to protect the outstanding recreational environmental
					 values of British Columbia and has been the leader and energizer of the very
					 successful B.C. Rivers Day.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed the Fraser River has stimulated one of the most
					 interesting governance institutions in our country, the Fraser Basin Council.
					 The Fraser basin and all the tributaries that run into the Fraser River take up
					 approximately 60% of the land base of British Columbia. This makes it a
					 tremendous catchment area. It covers first nations traditional territories and
					 dozens of municipalities. It attracts the important attention of all levels of
					 government, whether municipal, provincial, federal or first nations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until very recently the president of the Fraser Council
					 was Iona Campagnolo, a former member of the House. She was later sworn in as
					 lieutenant-governor of British Columbia. She led the Fraser Council as a new
					 form of governance which combined the mandates, the energies and in many ways
					 the resources of all levels of government, whether federal, provincial,
					 municipal or first nations, that are within the catchment area, the watershed
					 of the Fraser River. Those are some of the important issues in British Columbia
					 to focus upon in terms of the wealth of our rivers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Canadians we know how lucky we are to live in one of
					 the world's most beautiful countries. How well do we know what makes our
					 country such a unique place? How many of us know that Canada has the world's
					 longest coastline but, more important, holds the globe's greatest reservoir of
					 freshwater? Our hydrographic wealth is such that it is perhaps impossible to
					 determine exactly how many rivers flow in Canada and how many flow into the
					 Fraser River.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had the opportunity to take part in a ceremony which
					 recognized the restoration and regeneration of spawning in a river through the
					 beautiful Pacific Spirit Regional Park which is in the constituency of
					 Vancouver Quadra. It is part of the traditional lands of the Musqueam Band that
					 worked thousands of hours of volunteer time with the Suzuki Foundation of
					 British Columbia to restore that spawning stream which had lost its vital
					 potential.</p>


	<A NAME="T1605"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1605"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1610"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1600"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1605)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The true importance of our rivers cannot be measured in
					 their number or in their kilometres of length, width or cubic metres of flow.
					 Rivers are part of Canada. They have opened up the country to the successive
					 generations of people who lived here for thousands of years. They have helped
					 us become one of the great success stories of the 20th century.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether our ancestors explored this land in birchbark
					 canoes or came here in French caravels or British square-riggers or whether we
					 first saw the splendour of our natural heritage from the airplane that brought
					 us or our forefathers to Canada, we know that rivers are part of the history of
					 Canada and will continue to shape the future of its citizens.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hon. colleague opposite informed us in a very
					 interesting way of the number of national days that we celebrate in Canada. I
					 am not sure if it was his underlying intent but it certainly had the impact on
					 me of demonstrating what a gap we have in not having a national rivers day in
					 Canada. I thank him for pointing out that oversight and for his support of the
					 motion to make sure we plug that gap.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps no other country in the world owes so much to
					 its rivers. Perhaps nobody more than this generation of Canadians should want
					 to repay that debt. Our rivers need us today as much as we needed them in times
					 gone by.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That takes us to the most important part of something
					 like a national rivers day. We have celebrated B.C. Rivers Day for over 20
					 years now. My colleague from Dewdney--Alouette and I have had the great
					 pleasure of taking part in B.C. Rivers Days events. It brings together
					 thousands of people and helps us to become educated, energized and determined
					 to ensure that what has been damaged is restored and what is still healthy
					 remains so for the wealth and health of Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our government is very proud of what has been
					 accomplished in favour of our national parks, national historic sites, heritage
					 rivers and marine conservation areas over the past few years. Let me mention a
					 few of the accomplishments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are: the appointment of the expert panel on the
					 ecological integrity of Canada's national parks, followed by plans to implement
					 most of the 127 recommendations of the panel; the creation of 7 new national
					 parks, including 3 extraordinary parks in the remote reaches of our Arctic; the
					 approval of 14 new designated Canadian heritage rivers and the nomination of 4
					 candidate Canadian heritage rivers; the setting aside of pristine spaces in the
					 Gulf Islands of British Columbia, an essential part of Canada's Pacific marine
					 heritage legacy; the inclusion of Middle Island in Point Pelee National Park;
					 and the creation of the new National Parks Act with ecological integrity as the
					 paramount priority.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other accomplishments are: the introduction of the new
					 national marine conservation areas legislation; the first marine park in the
					 Saguenay-St. Lawrence region; permanent caps on commercial development in
					 national parks and fixed boundaries for all park communities; 90% of Canada's
					 Rocky Mountains parks designated as wilderness areas; legislation creating the
					 Parks Canada agency; the first national historic sites system plan; the
					 honouring of historic achievements of aboriginal peoples, Canadian women and
					 ethnocultural communities; the commemoration of over 150 national historic
					 sites across Canada; the creation of urban discovery centres to connect
					 Canada's students to their natural heritage; the involvement of thousands of
					 students in British Columbia on B.C. Rivers Day, which presents the promise of
					 education, energy, awareness and support from our youth across the country for
					 a national rivers day; and the commitment in red book three to expend $130
					 million on new national parks and ecological integrity over the next four
					 years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These many accomplishments of the last few years have
					 been led by the Minister of Canadian Heritage. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sponsor of the motion has rightly singled out among
					 the many initiatives taken by Parks Canada those that aim specifically to
					 protect and enhance our national rivers system and our marine conservation
					 areas. I believe national rivers day would help immensely to publicize these
					 efforts and build support for them. It would also provide an opportunity to
					 bring Canada's river communities closer together on tangible projects
					 nationally, regionally and locally.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take great pride and honour in endorsing the motion
					 and I hope all members of the House will give it their full support.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National days have been mentioned when we sometimes

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think of March 8, international women's day, and the
					 impact it has had on me. I was nominated for the first time for my party on
					 March 8. There are numerous days like that which cause us to think and reflect
					 on things that are very important and near and dear to us.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our national rivers system is near and dear to all of
					 us and unfortunately we sometimes do not see that. There are a good number of
					 Canadians who never so much as get near the water. They are either just
					 travelling down the highway or heading off on a sidewalk to work. Some people
					 never get the opportunity to be by the rivers or, if they are very lucky, to be
					 on a boat or a canoe on the river system. This is something that needs to be
					 experienced. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had that pleasure within the riding of Churchill
					 and pretty much most of Manitoba, both on land and water. There is a tremendous
					 number of waterways and rivers within the riding of Churchill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will make a point of commenting on the Bloodvein
					 River which is one of the heritage rivers mentioned previously by my colleague.
					 I did not know about the heritage rivers system until I became a member of
					 parliament and was reading about the Bloodvein River. I was truly impressed.
					 The more I studied the heritage rivers system and the Bloodvein River flowing
					 through Manitoba and Ontario, I recognized the impact it had on the Bloodvein
					 First Nation and how they worked with the river. To this day they take great
					 pride in the Bloodvein River and its tourism potential. For anyone listening,
					 it is a fantastic canoeing river and a truly enjoyable experience.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well, in the northern part of my riding there is the
					 Grass River system. This is another fantastic canoe trip with waterfalls along
					 the way. It is a wonderful system within the riding and truly another enjoyable
					 tourist attraction.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water, as a river or a lake, has the potential to be
					 very soothing and e very powerful, like the rivers in our country. They are
					 very peaceful, but when the floods come they literally have the power to rip a
					 community apart. The waters need to be respected and we need to show that
					 respect environmentally. We can do good for the rivers and the rivers can do
					 good for us.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to comment on how we tap our rivers for
					 other sources of industry. In my riding we have the great opportunity of hydro
					 developments. The hydro projects within the Nelson River system in Manitoba
					 have brought a lot of good opportunities and a lot of prosperity to the
					 communities around them as well as to the province of Manitoba, but there have
					 been problems as a result of hydro projects on the rivers. I tie that to the
					 fact that we have to respect the river so we are not destroying what is there,
					 so we are protecting it for communities around it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate my colleague bringing forward the motion.
					 I know the motion is not votable but it certainly has garnered the support of
					 members here today. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would hope that members will all continue to show
					 that support in some manner so we can go ahead, whether the motion is votable

					 Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
				  </b>

	Madam Speaker, I too wish to give my support to the
					 motion in favour of a national rivers day.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are indeed many reasons to support this
					 initiative. Many of them have been touched upon by those who have spoken before
					 me, but I too am motivated personally by the conviction that too many Canadians
					 have only a vague idea of the natural splendour and unique character of our
					 rivers. A national rivers day would go a long way to helping us better
					 appreciate this facet of our country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, in Canada there are now 38 heritage
					 rivers. More are being added to the system each year. Among rivers that already
					 have been designated and nominated from east to west we find the
					 following.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Newfoundland there is the Main River, one of the
					 last wilderness rivers on the rock, and the Bay du Nord River, where countless
					 brook trout, ouananiche and Atlantic salmon wait. On Prince Edward Island there
					 is the Hillsborough River, which begins on the south shore of the island and
					 winds inland through rich farm country to its sources near the white sand
					 beaches of the north shore, and the Montague--Three Rivers, an unspoiled
					 intermixture of fresh and salt water marshes, beaches, forests and communities
					 interwoven by this river system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Nova Scotia there is the famous Margaree River,
					 whose clear, icy waters and deep pools provide a haven for spawning Atlantic
					 salmon and trout, and the Shelburne River where we can see the last old growth
					 stands of white pine, red spruce and hemlock in Nova Scotia. In New Brunswick
					 there is the St. Croix River linking shimmering lakes to the surging tidewaters
					 of the Bay of Fundy. There are also the Sackville River and the Upper
					 Restigouche River, where the salmon is still king. In Quebec there is the
					 Jacques-Cartier River which cuts into the magnificent valley of the
					 Jacques-Cartier and splits the spruce covered plateau of the
					 Laurentians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Ontario the French and Mattawa Rivers formed a vital
					 link in the fur trade route from Lachine, near Montreal, to Lake Superior and
					 the northwest. St. Mary's River is an historic waterway which begins
					 tumultuously, tumbling over rapids, where native people traded and fished for
					 thousands of years and on past the power dams, factories and urban parks of the
					 twin cities of Sault Ste. Marie in Ontario and Michigan. Lock and canal
					 building started here as early as 1798, and in 1895 the Canadian lock was the
					 most advanced in the world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also in Ontario there is the historic Rideau waterway,
					 winding 202 kilometres from Kingston to Ottawa, the oldest continuously
					 operating canal system in North America. There is the Missinabi River, a silver
					 thread of unspoiled wilderness, was used by the Ojibway, the Cree and later the
					 voyageurs as the main trade route linking Lake Superior with James Bay. There
					 is the Detroit River, passing through the largest metropolitan area,
					 Detroit-Windsor, along the world's longest undefended border. The Grand River
					 is in the heartland of southern Ontario. The Humber River is in the backyard of
					 more than four million people. The Boundary Waters--Voyageur waterway is a
					 paddler's paradise flowing through rapids, waterfalls, gorges, cliffs, beaver
					 dams and innumerable lakes. The Thames River is the most southerly major river
					 in Canada, flowing 273 kilometres through the cities of London and Chatham to
					 Lake St. Clair.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Manitoba there is the Bloodvein River, where red
					 ochre pictographs of bison, human figures, hands and power symbols grace
					 overhanging rock faces along a course that slashes through the Canadian Shield,
					 slipping and sliding over 100 sets of rapids on its journey to Lake
					 Winnipeg.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also in Manitoba there is the Hayes River, which served
					 as a route for Manitoba's first nations long before Europeans arrived and later
					 became the main route from York Factory on Hudson Bay to the interior of
					 western Canada for fur traders, settlers and explorers from 1670 until 1870.
					 There is the Seal River, named for the harbour seals, normally marine creatures
					 that are found up to 200 kilometres upstream from Hudson Bay.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Saskatchewan there is the Churchill River, a
					 succession of shimmering lakes interconnected by rapids, waterfalls and short
					 stretches of river. It was the main water passage to the Canadian northwest for
					 early explorers.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Clearwater River in Saskatchewan and Alberta was
					 the main route to the rich fur country of the north. The Fraser River in
					 British Columbia is British Columbia's largest river, is the longest river in
					 the Canadian Heritage river system and is the greatest salmon river in the
					 world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems, as usual, that we have all the greatest and
					 the best references both in the east and west to the salmon rivers. However I
					 am sure that for both sections of the country the feeling of pride in their
					 salmon is well deserved. Fortunately we do not have to have a contest between
					 our Atlantic and west coast salmon so the issue stays with the
					 rivers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are the Athabaska, Kicking Horse and North
					 Saskatchewan Rivers. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Yukon there is the Alsek River. Then there is
					 the beautiful South Nahanni River, which is in the Arctic in the Northwest
					 Territories. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will leave the balance of the time to the member who
					 most deserves that time, for her to explain a little further why she has come
					 forward with such an excellent motion and such an excellent idea.</p>

					 Lib.): </b>

	Madam Speaker, I would like to thank all of the members
					 who took part in the debate this afternoon on this motion. I appreciate hearing
					 the words of the member from the Canadian Alliance Party from
					 Saskatoon-Wanuskewin.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To address his concern about cost, it is a simple
					 matter of declaring this as a national rivers day. What we have to think about
					 are the wonderful opportunities in our communities, for example, around
					 community economic development. There are a lot of festivals, fairs and
					 opportunities for local merchants to be involved with the community in the
					 clean up, promotion and celebration of our rivers. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the member of the PC/DR coalition from
					 Dewdney--Alouette, I was very heartened to hear about the work of his local
					 community organization. It is not only just the national rivers of Canada that
					 we would be celebrating, we would also be celebrating the work of our community
					 members. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the member whose motion this originally was, the
					 member for Vancouver--Quadra, I would like to thank him very much for giving me
					 the opportunity to move the motion in the House. The Fraser Bason Council, of
					 which he spoke, is a very important opportunity that looks at how people,
					 different levels of government and first nations can all work together. Our
					 rivers in Canada connect us through our activities and the projects that we
					 undertake to preserve them. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank the Parliamentary Secretary to
					 the Minister of Foreign Affairs for her wonderful description of some of the
					 major rivers in Canada. I appreciate her fine support and would like to mention
					 to the House how much we miss her on the environment committee now that she has
					 her new duties.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the NDP member for Churchill, as a member who
					 represents a northern community, it is so vitally important to remember the
					 contribution that the northern rivers have made to our communities in the south
					 through the advances of the early explorers. Imagine setting out on a vast
					 expedition onto one of those northern rivers. What an exciting, exhilarating
					 experience that must have been. It is so important to our history, to the
					 economic development of our country and indeed to our natural heritage.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is often said that people always remembers the first
					 time they see Lake Superior. I grew up on Lake Superior. It is an incredible
					 expanse of water. It is an image that never leaves one's mind. A variation on
					 this is what the writer Lynn Noel said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The first river you paddle runs
						  through the rest of your life. It bubbles up in pools and eddies to remind you
						  who you are. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure those of my colleagues who have paddled would
					 agree. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member for Churchill talked about the soothing
					 qualities of our rivers. I remember as a child the creeks and the rivers that I
					 paddled on and their cool, quiet shores with their leafy vegetation crowding
					 the water's edge. There are many times in this place and related to this place
					 that I look to that image for some soothing and calming. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same rivers that have so informed our lives and
					 speak to the very soul of us as a nation can inform the lives of others.
					 Therefore, let us celebrate them. Let us once a year talk about rivers, clean
					 up rivers and float down rivers. Let us swim in them, paint them, read by them,
					 plant trees by them, sing by them, dance by them, learn from them and enjoy
					 them. Let us honour them as they honour us. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have included some of my favourite words from poets
					 to best describe our understanding and feelings of rivers. A favourite prime
					 minister of mine, Prime Minister Trudeau, wrote in “The Exhaustion and
					 Fulfillment: The Ascetic in a Canoe” the following:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>I know a man whose school could never
						  teach him patriotism, but who acquired that virtue when he felt in his bones
						  the vastness of his land, and the greatness of those who founded
						  it.</small></td>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that formal recognition of a national rivers
					 day can help people come to such a place and it is a journey we should well
					 consider. Unfortunately, the motion is not a votable motion. Therefore, I would
