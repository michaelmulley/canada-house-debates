in recent months, the people of Abitibi—Témiscamingue and I find 
the price of gasoline too high in Abitibi compared with other

this regard, although Newfoundland announced recently that it 
would look at the statute provisions that would permit it to 
regulate the price of gas.

gives me great pleasure to recognize the 125th anniversary of 
Mennonites coming to Canada from Russia.  One would be hard 
pressed to imagine what the province of Saskatchewan would be 
like if not for the hardworking, God-fearing Mennonites who chose 
to come to our country so many years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mennonites moved to the Saskatchewan River Valley from the east 
and west reserves of Manitoba in the 1890s.  These pioneers have 
left us a rich heritage of faith and strong family values.  The 
positive influence of these men and women remains with us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The contribution of the Mennonites to our present way of life is 
almost too difficult to enumerate.  Agriculture, cuisine, 
churches, enterprise and innovation are all areas that were 
influenced as this group settled and took root in the valley area 
north of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a testimony to God's enduring goodness that these 
Mennonite farmers, teachers, preachers and entrepreneurs 
flourished in this new land with harsh climate extremes and 
political uncertainties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to be a descendant of the Neufeld clan and wish to 
extend my congratulations to all my constituents of Mennonite 
heritage on the occasion of this special anniversary.

Tuesday I attended a luncheon where over 100 local businesses 
divided up $76,000 in rebates from the Worker Safety and 
Insurance Board under their Safe Communities Incentive Program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thanks to the coalition, Brockville is fast becoming one of the 
safest communities in Canada to live, work and play.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As we close the century it is fitting to acknowledge the game of 
the century, which took place 27 years ago on September 28, 1972. 
On that date the Canada-U.S.S.R. series, 480 minutes of 
nail-biting, heart-stopping hockey, was decided by only one goal 
with 30 seconds left in the game. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone in my hometown of Sault Ste. Marie was riveted to their 
television sets to watch Team Canada and two of its favourite 
sons, Phil and Tony Esposito, who were instrumental in Team 
Canada's victory.  In fact, it was Phil Esposito who set 
Henderson up for the winning goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much has changed since that afternoon in 1972 but the people 
from my hometown will never forget this exciting series.  There 
has not been one like it since. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These hockey legends live on.  Both Esposito brothers are now 
hall of famers and I am proud to say that they were featured on

pioneering study on the short term effects of monetary and fiscal 
policy in an open economy.  His theoretical constructs were 
studied by the European Union's leaders and were influential in 
developing plans for a single Eurocurrency.  They should also be 
influential in future discussions on currency relations under the 
North American—Canada-U.S.-Mexico—Free Trade Agreement.

made her a model for an entire generation of young people.  Her

had NDP joining the Tories.  We had Joe Clark united with Joe 
Clark, and Reformers were fighting each other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning:</B>  Mr. Speaker, Reformers were fighting 
each other, so maybe it was not that unusual after all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event, we are back and the throne speech has been been 
presented.  Lo and behold, it contains some vague expressions of 
tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Prime Minister.  Why should Canadians 
believe any of the promises of tax relief in the throne speech 
after six straight years of Liberal tax grabs? 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we are very happy to be back too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was some movement.  We are sorry that the Reform Party 
might disappear or end up as some type of not very united 
alternative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are very happy with the performance of the government. 
All Liberal members who have been in their ridings have reported 
to the caucus this morning that the people are extremely happy 
that we have no more deficit and that we have already started to 
reduce taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I am giving a little bit of room 
today but not lots and lots of room.  The hon. Leader of the 
Opposition. 
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we got sharper responses when we were handling the 
question period by ourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This summer I visited a lot of Canadians at their places of 
work:  at factories, plants, offices and so forth.  What these 
people are interested in is take home pay.  They will not believe 
any promise of tax relief unless the federal government takes a 
smaller bite from their paycheques. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should Canadian workers believe any of these promises on tax 
relief when the federal deduction from their paycheques week 
after week and month after month keeps increasing rather than 
decreasing? 
<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, when we started, the EI premium was at $3.07.  It is at 
$2.55 at this moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a surtax of 3% imposed by the Tories some years ago 
because of the deficit.  That is no longer there.  There are 
600,000 Canadians who are not paying any more taxes because my 
Minister of Finance brought in some good budgets.  We will keep 
doing that in a rational, reasonable and sensible way.

was going to abolish, get rid of, in other words obliterate the 
GST.  Everyone knows what happened with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Reform Party started pressing the government on tax 
relief this was the Prime Minister's initial response:  “I don't 
think it is the right thing to do in a society like Canada”, as 
if giving tax relief was un-Canadian in some way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With a record like that and with statements like that on the 
record why should Canadians believe they are going to get real 
tax relief out of the Prime Minister? 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, when we came here we said we were going to reduce the 
deficit to zero.  They did not believe us but we did it.  For 
three years in a row we have had surpluses in Canada.  We have 
not seen that in 50 years.  Since we have a surplus, in a very 
humble way the Minister of Finance reduced taxes in the last 
two budgets.  He will continue to do that in the next one.  We 
have an agreement on that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, when 
we clear all the rhetoric away from yesterday's throne speech 
what are we left with?  No tax cuts, just a commitment to spend a 
whole lot more.  The stark reality is that on January 1 the first 
act of the government in the new millennium will be to raise 
payroll taxes and personal income taxes through bracket creep. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the finance minister not simply admit that after all 
the smoke has cleared from yesterday's throne speech what we are 
left with is a big tax hike on January 1? 
<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I can assure the hon. member that on January 1, as indeed 
on January 1 of every year since we have taken office, there will 
be a reduction in payroll taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to remind the hon. member that yesterday's 
throne speech was not a budget in which we deal with taxes but it 
did provide a profound vista on the government's plan for the 
future, one that has been universally well received right across 
the country.  It is a perspective that says we will invest in 
education, we will invest in social programs, and that— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for Medicine Hat. 
<P><A NAME="LINK44"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
maybe the finance minister should invest in a watch.  He has 
taken up a lot of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are looking at a finance minister who has a great future 
behind him.  He had a chance to cut taxes but he blew it. 
Instead, he raised taxes 60 times.  His whole record is a record 
of tax hikes.  We are now paying the highest taxes in Canadian 
history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the finance minister not just give it up?  Why does he 
not admit that his real agenda is to raise taxes in the next 
budget? 
<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have told the member a million times not to 
exaggerate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a question of credibility.  The fact is that the Reform 
Party has no credibility.  Its tax plan in the third year would 
require a surplus of $52 billion.  That is smoke and mirrors. 
Until such time as the Reform Party gives the Canadian people a 
plan that is based on solid facts it will have no credibility in 
this debate.

never signed by Quebec.

this does not serve the interests of the Bloc Quebecois. But 
since what we are doing is good, as was the case with the

continue working with us.

have the leader of this government to thank for the two

1982, and the social union agreement, both opposed by 
federalists and sovereignists alike in the Quebec National 
Assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the same vein, the government announced that it planned to 
establish a pharmacare plan.  But Quebec already has such a 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we to understand that the only choice open to Quebec will be 
either to amend its plan, or to forgo the money from the federal 
program, some of which also belongs to Quebec taxpayers? 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we did not announce a new program; we merely said that was 
a problem and that there should be talks with the provinces, 
including Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is how a federation operates.  It is still the best form of 
government in the world.  As President Clinton said last 
Friday, federalism is always the best solution in a modern 
society. 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the Speech 
from the Throne the government has committed to eliminating the 
barriers it claims impede the mobility of citizens within 
Canada.  We are aware of the tensions that exist between Ontario 
and Quebec in the area of construction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the Prime Minister tell us whether this desire of the 
government to eliminate barriers to mobility means that it 
wishes to interfere in the discussions currently under way 
between Quebec and Ontario relating to construction? 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there is a dialogue at the present time between the Government of 
Quebec and the Government of Ontario relating to protectionism 
in the field of construction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe there should be an agreement to enable people 
to work anywhere in Canada that there is work, and to prevent 
excessive protectionism, which is detrimental to economic growth 
in any part of Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime 
Minister is getting into a particularly hot issue as far as 
Quebec construction workers are concerned.  Perhaps he should 
think twice about doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In another area of concern to us, again in connection with 
barriers to mobility, does the Prime Minister consider that the 
provisions of Law 101 relating to the language of work in Quebec 
constitute an obstacle to mobility? 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
that is the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I deal with federal problems.  Living here in Ottawa, I have had 
the opportunity to see that there are far more Quebecers working 
in Ontario than there are Ontarians working in Quebec.

Mr. Speaker, the 1990 Sparrow decision giving natives the right

to fight his conviction for illegal fishing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the Marshall decision and the ample time the government

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of Fisheries and

no plan regarding the court ruling, no ideas, and exercised none 
of the leadership that the minister should have been exercising.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, without 
even once using the word education, yesterday's Speech from the 
Throne made reference to learning, skills development, 
knowledge, and internship programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the Prime Minister now admit that his government wants to 
implement a national education policy, when this is not an area

<P><A NAME="LINK78"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the answer is not a very long one.  It is no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have responsibilities toward all Canadians.  We must ensure 
that Canada is in a position to move into the 21st century 
equipped to face the challenges that we will have to confront 
and, within areas under federal jurisdiction, to step up our 
contributions in order to ensure that Canadians are very well 
prepared to enter the 21st century.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, if 
they do not want to get into areas of provincial jurisdiction, 
the throne speech states that they want to “eliminate barriers 
to the mobility of citizens” —I am quoting from page 21, to be 
exact—particularly those barriers “that deny some students use 
of their student loans when they study out-of-province”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we to understand that the government in Ottawa, after having 
inaugurated its millennium scholarship program, now wants to 
attack the award criteria for loans and bursaries that are in

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
what we are seeking is equality for everyone, for everyone to be 
able to go anywhere in Canada to further their education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it would be very good for Canada if people 
from the English speaking provinces could go to Quebec to study, 
and if 
people from Quebec could go to study in the rest of Canada under 
the same conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel that this is ideal, because everyone would gain from it.

<P><A NAME="LINK82"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, yesterday the throne speech failed to 
mention the massive restructuring that Canada's airlines are 
about to face.  Air Canada and Canadian Airlines were in merger 
discussions six months prior to section 47 being invoked.  Could 
the minister please explain to Canadians why he invoked section 
47 when he did? 
<P><A NAME="LINK83"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is true it now appears that the two airline 
companies were having discussions earlier this year.  In the 
month of March, Air Canada was the first to raise with my 
officials the use of section 47.  We now know that it was in 
connection with those discussions, but no action was taken and 
there was no formal request because the talks fell apart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In June of this year, first Air Canada, with its proposal for 
the Canadian Airlines international routes, and then Canadian 
Airlines came to us and talked about a need to restructure the 
industry. That is why we used section 47. 
<P><A NAME="LINK84"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley,

provide Canadians with its vision of our airline industry in the 
new millennium.  One can only assume that it does not have one. 
Why has the government failed to provide Canadians with some 
indication of its vision of Canada's airline industry in the 21st 
century? 
<P><A NAME="LINK85"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the government is committed to a viable, strong and 
stable airline industry, but it is undergoing some very difficult 
problems, problems that will necessitate some very difficult 
choices on the part of Canadians and especially members in this 
House.  We want a full debate in the House to elicit the views of 
hon. members on both sides of the House so we can develop an 
airline policy that will deal with the difficult matters we have 
to overcome in order to have a very strong and viable airline 
system in the 21st century.

were the first country on the ground with CARE Canada to provide 
assistance to the East Timorese who were being held in West 
Timor.  It was rather risky but we did that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition we had $300,000 from the Canada fund on the ground 
which was redirected.  We also had $300,000 from another program

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, today the Prime Minister verbally proved he does not 
understand the farm income crisis, let alone able to devise a 
solution.  Let us try the agriculture minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a 98% drop in realized net income and not a whisper of 
concern in yesterday's throne speech.  There was no any mention 
of children going hungry or parents wondering if they could stay 
on the farm.  Farmers never knew how far away Ottawa was until 
yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the minister of agriculture.  Why is the 
plight of thousands of farm families not a priority for the 
agriculture minister and the government? 
<P><A NAME="LINK94"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I remind the opposition and all Canadians 
that even prior to last year's budget in February the government 
announced $900 million and, along with the provincial 
contribution, $1.5 billion to assist producers who are under 
stress and need that help across Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK95"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the government cannot in good conscience allow farmers 
to head into winter with no hope.  The government likes to throw 
around compassionate sounding buzzwords such as the children's 
agenda.  There are thousands and thousands of farm children whose 
parents are trying desperately to make ends meet.  Real children 
need real help and the government is turning its back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the agriculture minister and government are truly interested 
in helping children, what do they plan to do for them to get them 
through this winter? 
<P><A NAME="LINK96"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food,

are very fortunate the Reform Party did not form the government, 
the party that was going to cut $600 million in support to the 
agriculture industry in Canada, mostly at the primary production 
level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a safety net program in place.  We are working with it. 
We have made changes to it.  We are not done making changes to 
it.  We will continue to do all we can to find all the resources 
we can in co-operation with the provinces and the industry to 
assist all those that we can assist.

strictly a private sector issue.  The Minister of Transport has 
said that there might be some public interest at stake.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, as I said earlier, we have chosen a market driven 
solution as the option for us to follow at this stage.  It is up 
to the parties in the private sector to determine any 
arrangements in reorganizing the companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once the private sector determines that, and once a conditional 
offer comes to the government, the government will be fully 
engaged in making sure that the five principles I enunciated a 
couple of weeks ago are adhered to and that the protection for 
Canadians on prices and other issues in the public interest is 
rigorously adhered to.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, to make the assertion the hon. member does about 
deregulation is a very facile way to approach the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Deregulation had many successes but there is no question that 
severe problems have occurred in the last few years especially 
with one company, Canadian Airlines.  Those issues have to be 
addressed and addressed in a way that protects the public

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
taxpayers of Canada's largest cities and the provinces bear the 
brunt of the government's bungling on immigration.  Yesterday 
Toronto's mayor, Mel Lastman, said he is tired of the 
government's excuses and his city can no longer afford the 
Liberal's broken immigration system.  The mayor of Toronto is 
simply expressing the frustration on immigration felt across this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the minister respond to Toronto's mayor and Canadians 
who share his concerns? 
<P><A NAME="LINK126"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my department is working co-operatively 
with the city of Toronto.  We are trying to gather the data and 
the information.  We know that this requires a response from 
three levels of government:  the federal government, the 
provincial government and the municipal government.  I want to 
point out that the refugee population that the mayor is concerned 
about represents about 10% of the concerns that he has and we are 
working with him to resolve those issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make one point very clear.  As we do this, the 
government remains committed, as opposed to the opposition party, 
to upholding the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms; not 
just for some, but for all.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>REQUESTS FOR EMERGENCY DEBATES 
</H3><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I received six applications for emergency 
debates for this evening.  Two of them have been withdrawn by the 
unanimous consent of the House, namely the applications made by 
the member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough and the member for 
Delta—South Richmond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That leaves me to deal with four others.  I would ask the hon. 
members, as I call upon them, to state their case for an 
emergency debate in a very concise fashion.  I would first call 
on the hon. member for Palliser. 
<P><A NAME="LINK140"></A></P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>AGRICULTURE 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK141"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
under Standing Order 52(2) to seek leave to propose an emergency 
debate to address the deepening financial crisis that is 
affecting far too many Canadian farm families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that we had an emergency debate on this 
crisis on November 30, 1998.  However, since then the crisis has 
only deepened in its intensity.  Last November the agriculture 
minister predicted that as bad as 1998 was for farmers, in 
particular those in western Canada, particularly Manitoba and 
Saskatchewan, the forecast for 1999 was even worse. 
Unfortunately, that prediction has been realized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Spring flooding has compounded the situation.  Those that 
escaped the devastation of rising waters continue to be battered 
by record low commodity prices and highly subsidized competition 
from producers in the U.S. and Europe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without immediate and effective help, up to half of the farmers 
in western Canada could be out of business by next year. 
Bankruptcies on the prairies are already up 24%.  Statistics 
Canada reports of the situation in Saskatchewan this year 
indicate that take-home farm incomes are forecast to be the worst 
in more than 70 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that an emergency debate is required in order to urge 
the government to address this crisis.  Parliament has the 
responsibility to find long term solutions.  Mr. Speaker, I would 
urge you, respectfully, to consider an emergency debate in an 
immediate and timely fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I will hear the member for 
Selkirk—Interlake because his request deals with farming.  I 
believe from the letter I received that it is in the same genre. 
<P><A NAME="LINK142"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the crisis situation I referred to in my letter to you 
asking for an emergency debate absolutely involves the 
statistical analysis of Statistics Canada, which has clearly 
indicated that farm incomes will be flat and will be dropping as 
a result of low commodity prices and the actions of our 
competitors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This emergency arises now because last fall the standing 
committee on agriculture held hearings on the problem.  As a 
result of those hearings and the report that was put forward it 
was determined by the government that the only problem was a 
sharp drop in income for farmers for 1998-99.  According to 
Statistics Canada, the truth of the matter is that during the 
past five or six years incomes have been dropping to very low 
levels and they are projected to remain flat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is, the federal government has addressed a short, two 
year program that is not providing money to the majority of 
farmers.  That is the reason we must have an emergency debate. 
The government has not addressed the issue.  Farmers are going 
bankrupt.  Calls to the Brandon, Manitoba stress line for farmers 
are up three times over what they were a year ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are dealing with a true crisis.  The number of farm groups 
coming to Ottawa to stress their point to the minister requires 
that we in the House debate the issue to bring forward what the 
real problem is and what the solutions are.

<P><A NAME="LINK145"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 52, I request leave to 
make a motion for the adjournment of the House for the purpose of 
discussing a specific and important matter requiring urgent 
consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following a January 1999 British Columbia supreme court decision 
concerning the possession of child pornography, the British 
Columbia Court of Appeal did, on June 30, 1999, dismiss the 
appeal to reinstate subsection (4) of section 163.1 of the 
Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supreme court has scheduled a hearing on this matter for 
mid-January 2000.  Given the normal time required for the supreme 
court judgments, this issue will not be disposed of until perhaps 
2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legality of the possession of child pornography is not 
limited to the province of British Columbia.  In fact, defence 
counsel in Ontario, Quebec and Alberta are arguing cases now 
based on the British Columbia decision to make child pornography 
legal in those provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government did not find reason in the Speech from the Throne 
to discuss this issue. That is why I served notice after the 
speech yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 2 the minister said in the House that the government 
was acting immediately on the issue and would not wait for the 
case to reach the Supreme Court of Canada.  Sixty-three Liberal 
MPs and six senators signed a notice to the Prime Minister asking 
him to use the notwithstanding clause in this child pornography 
issue because it was so important last February. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The children of this country cannot wait until 2001 to find out 
that child pornography is illegal to possess in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an issue of children.  Children were mentioned in the 
throne speech yesterday but this issue was not mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think all members of the House agree that the law we have is a 
good one; it is only some judges who do not.  We have to debate 
that issue in the House and come up with a solution to protect 
our children a lot quicker than the judges of this land want to 
protect our children. 
<P><A NAME="LINK146"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I do confirm that the hon. member did 
write to me explaining this particular case, but I do not feel at 
this time that it meets the criteria for an emergency debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With reference to the member for Lakeland, if there was some 
confusion and if I did misread the information I had, I will 
entertain a letter to be sent to me again today so that the hon. 
member can address his subject tomorrow.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON ADDRESS IN REPLY 
</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from October 12 consideration of the motion 
for an address to Her Excellency the Governor General in reply to 
her speech at the opening of the session. 
<P><A NAME="LINK150"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to reply to the Speech from the Throne presented 
yesterday by Her Excellency the Governor General.  In doing so I 
want to take the opportunity on behalf of the official opposition 
to extend our best wishes to the former Governor General on his 
retirement as well as our congratulations to the new Governor 
General on her appointment. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This summer, my wife and I had the pleasure of visiting the

in that magnificent part of the country. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along with other members of the House, we also had the 
opportunity to listen to another speech by Her Excellency the 
Governor General at her swearing in ceremony a week ago. 
I might say it was an excellent speech.  It was much better than 
the speech prepared for her by the Prime Minister.  We wish Her 
Excellency well in all her future communications.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to extend on behalf of the official opposition our 
best wishes to the members of the Canadian Armed Forces both at 
home and abroad.  Their contributions to maintaining peace in the 
world are even more significant in light of the hardships and 
resource limitations that they must endure, not the least of 
which are those imposed upon them by their own government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the next few days my colleagues will be dissecting the Speech 
from the Throne in considerable detail, pointing out its 
deficiencies, which are many, and presenting constructive 
alternatives.  My task today is to deal with the big picture 
which I will now proceed to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We stand on the threshold of a new century. Canadians have a 
right to expect that the legislative program presented by their 
government would put forward bold solutions to old problems and 
chart new directions for a new century, solutions and directions 
inspired by principles and vision.  We see none of that in the 
Speech from the Throne.  What we have here is essentially more of 
the same, perpetuation of the status quo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, over the summer the country faced specific problems 
demanding government action.  We heard of some of them today, 
from people smuggling on the west coast, to violence in the east 
coast fishery, to an agricultural crisis on the prairies, to the 
need to completely reorganize the airline industry. The Speech 
from the Throne does not even acknowledge the existence of these 
problems, let alone offer solutions that are based on some kind 
of vision of the future for those sectors or some kind of 
fundamental principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The greatest defect is the deficiency in principle and vision, a 
deficiency for which the government attempts to compensate with 
bland rhetoric.  For example, the government refers in the speech 
to the principle of clarity as essential to national unity.  It 
talks about the importance of principles to the national 
children's agenda.  It talks about the need for principles to 
govern co-operative approaches to infrastructure development. But 
in none of the sections where it mentions the word principle does 
it spell out what these governing principles are.  In most of the 
other sections of the speech there is no attempt to specify at 
all the principles that will guide the government's actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the government has chosen to exit the 20th century not 
with a bang but with a whimper, it is my intention to present an 
alternative set of principles for directing the legislative 
program of the government and an alternative vision for Canada in 
the 21st century, alternatives which I believe are in keeping 
with the deepest convictions and hopes of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me start with the principles of fiscal responsibility. When 
Reformers were first elected to parliament, we won support on the 
basis of a commitment to certain clear-cut principles of fiscal 
responsibility.  Today we are even more committed to those 
principles because we are even more convinced they are right for 
Canada and Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As our chief finance critic, the member for Medicine Hat, has 
repeatedly argued, we want a federal government that is committed 
to controlling and prioritizing its spending, to balancing its 
books, and having a legal commitment to balance its books not 
just a policy decision, to lowering its debt and reducing federal 
taxes, and doing so at a pace that is far faster than that being 
followed by this timid and tired administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that bothers me profoundly is that it can be 
demonstrated from polling data and research data that there was 
majority public support in this country as early as 1984 for 
balancing the federal budget.  There was majority public support 
for balancing the federal budget as early as 1984 and yet it took 
two administrations and 15 years to achieve what for most of us 
is a self-evident objective that should have been achieved far 
sooner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This Speech from the Throne is rife with government references, 
bowing and scraping toward the recognition of the global economy 
and high tech knowledge and computerization.  The essence of all 
of that is speed in decision, yet when it comes to meeting the 
fiscal obligations of this country and implementing fiscal 
policies, the government moves at the pace of a snail dragging a 
chain through the mud.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be understood that the official opposition wants real 
tax relief and debt reduction, not as an end in themselves but 
because of the benefits that will flow to Canadians.  We do not 
have just an academic interest in this principle.  It is the 
benefits that will flow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a dream.  It is a simple one and it gets reinforced every 
time I go to a factory or a plant and talk to workers.  It is a 
dream of getting a pay increase, just a pay increase for every 
Canadian worker and family.  That is reasonable.  It is a pay 
increase that does not come from their employer but from a 
reduction in the high taxes collected every day and every month 
by a tax crazed government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about real, substantive tax relief.  It is quite 
evident that the Canadian public, and particularly workers, are 
simply not going to believe promises of tax relief from anyone 
unless they can see it in a tangible form.  They are going to 
look at their paycheques at the end of the day and they will 
believe they have tax relief when the federal deductions have 
been reduced.  They will not believe any other promise or 
commitment to tax relief unless it shows up on the bottom line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is our vision of tax relief.  Its impact on families could 
deliver up to $4,600 of tax relief per year per family for them 
to use on whatever they choose, such as education, shelter and 
clothing.  We think the people themselves are the best ones to 
direct those expenditures whether they are socially directed or 
economically directed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But what do we see in the Liberal administration's 
implementation of these principles of fiscal responsibility?  We 
see a government whose main financial priority has been to 
collect and spend as many taxpayers' dollars as it can, from $107 
billion, or almost $14,000 in federal tax revenues per family in 
1993, to $148 billion, or $18,150 in federal tax revenues per 
family in 1999, and still growing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We read in the Speech from the Throne on page 9 that the 
government will follow a multi-year plan for tax reduction.  Why 
would anyone take this at face value when we consider what the 
government has said and done on this subject in the past? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On one occasion the finance minister said that the ultimate goal 
was to lower taxes but—and unfortunately there is always a 
but—lowering taxes and reducing the fiscal load would not be 
possible.  He then promptly raised federal tax revenues to 
$14,835 per family.  The next year the finance minister said that 
we could not have a massive tax cut across the board, and 
promptly raised federal tax revenues per family to $15,614. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next year, speaking about across the board tax cuts, the 
Prime Minister said “I do not think it is the right thing to do 
in a society like Canada”. Somehow it is un-Canadian to give 
them back some of their money. That year, as if to reinforce the 
point, the finance minister raised federal revenues per family up 
to $16,550. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next year, along with the budget close to being actually 
balanced, the finance minister said that to put in place a 
broadly based tax cut now would be irresponsible.  That year he 
raised federal tax revenues per family to $18,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it any wonder that Canadians will regard tax relief promises 
from the throne speech with extreme, justifiable scepticism.  The 
government's taxation record is in precisely the opposite 
direction to the direction it promises in the throne speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most deceptive half truth in the entire throne speech is on 
page 9. I could hardly believe the statement, when I heard it 
standing in the other place.  If it had been in the prospectus of 
a company filed with the Ontario Securities Commission, this half 
truth which fails to disclose the other half of the truth, 
whoever put it together would be liable to spend up to five years 
in a provincial institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the statement:  The government says it has begun to 
deliver broad based tax relief totalling $16.5 billion over three 
years.  It gets this figure by adding up projected tax reductions 
for the financial years 1999-2000, 2000-01 and 2001-02, for a 
total of $16.5 billion. 
What it fails to mention is that during those same three years it 
also projects tax increases, namely through increases in CPP 
premiums and bracket creep, amounting to $18.4 billion for a net 
increase in the tax burden on Canadians of $2 billion.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The first great deficiency in principle and vision that we see 
in the Speech from the Throne is the lack of principle and 
substantive commitment to the great principles of fiscal 
responsibility, in particular tax relief that is the key to both 
sound government and a prosperous economy for the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our judgment, this is a deficiency which cannot be remedied 
by trying to change tax and spend Liberals into tax cutters.  It 
is a deficiency which will only be remedied by the election of 
150-plus members to the House who on a certain night in a certain 
month—probably February or March—are prepared to stand up in 
the House and vote for real, genuine, substantive tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me turn to economic policy in general.  The official 
opposition's vision of an economically prosperous and secure 
Canada for the 21st century includes much more than just a 
fiscally responsible federal government and lower taxes.  It 
includes a Canada where jobs with good incomes are plentiful 
rather than scarce because the job creation engine is fueled, not 
by patronage-tainted and politically motivated grants, contracts, 
handouts and subsidies from the government but because it is 
fueled by dollars left in the pockets of consumers to spend and 
businesses to invest.  It is private enterprise.  It is an old 
concept but it happens to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We envision a Canada where the younger generation is valued and 
encouraged by economic opportunity to make their future in Canada 
rather than being told by the Prime Minister to go to the U.S. if 
they are not prepared to pay exorbitant taxes.  Talk about a 
children's agenda.  He is telling our children, “If you don't 
like the tax system here, if you think the levels are too high, 
go somewhere else”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We envision a Canada where economically disadvantaged regions 
and people, including aboriginal people, are given the tools to 
direct and create their own economic future by participating in a 
free enterprise, market based economy, not a country where 
aboriginal people are given the obsolete, dependency creating 
instruments of government planning and socialist economics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the big reasons we object to the Nisga'a treaty is that 
it is straight out of the 19th century.  There is no other group 
in the country that the government would have the nerve to say, 
“Your economic development is going to be achieved through 
collective rights and collective ownership of property and 
resources”.  There is no other group that the government would 
have the nerve to say that to.  It then hands off those types of 
tools to aboriginal people.  Exactly the same mistake the country 
made in the 19th century we are making as we enter the 21st 
century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We envision a Canada where challenges faced by agriculture, the 
infrastructure sector, the airline industry or professional 
hockey are met by policies that give them tools and frameworks to 
solve their own problems rather than increasing dependency on the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time does not permit me to deal with all the points in the 
Speech from the Throne where the Liberal government's approach to 
economic problems or the problems of particular sectors violate 
these principles, but let me touch on just three examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first example is the brain drain.  The official opposition 
has some of the youngest members in the House.  Many of them 
spend a lot of time on university campuses and they hear about 
this problem all the time.  I hear it every time I go to a 
campus.  What is the question that we are asked by younger people 
at the universities?  Some person will go to the microphone and 
say, “I'm graduating next year with such and such a degree and 
my wife is graduating with such and such a degree.  Here's my tax 
position in Toronto.  Here's my tax position in Chicago.  You 
tell me why I should stay here one day after I graduate”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I see the new pages in the Chamber I do not just think of 
the pages as servants of the House.  I know many of them have 
ambitions and are studying far beyond spending time here in the 
House.  I think of them as representatives of the younger 
generation who are looking for incentive, opportunity and things 
like that from government, not punitive taxes that create the 
opportunities for them somewhere else.

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government fails to see that high taxes drive youth, 
capital, jobs and companies out of the country.  Its response to 
the brain drain is to deny it.  It does not bring to the problem 
of the brain drain what free enterprise, market based principles 
and fiscal responsibility in government can offer those people. 
That is a huge mistake.  It is a deficiency in principle, not 
approaching the problem from a principled basis, and a deficiency 
in vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look for a minute at the agriculture situation.  This 
summer the member for Selkirk—Interlake and the member for 
Souris—Moose Mountain arranged for me to spend a little time 
talking to farmers and producers from southwestern Manitoba and 
southeastern Saskatchewan.  I do not have to tell the members in 
the House who have a background in agriculture about the depth of 
the dilemma.  We have thousands of farmers who have suffered two 
disasters beyond their control.  In that particular region, the 
disaster was an enormous amount of flooded acreage, an inability 
to seed after the flooding and late seeding leading to frozen 
crops in the fall.  We now have the bigger problem of foreign 
subsidies driving commodity prices down to the point where a 
large number of our farmers cannot make a living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is worth looking at some of the statistics that the hon. 
member referred to a minute ago.  Statistics Canada confirmed 
that 1998 was a disastrous year for Canada's farmers.  Realized 
net income was down 21% over the year before.  Agriculture Canada 
forecasts even worse for 1999.  National realized net income of 
$2.2 billion and that figure includes payments from the 
government's AIDA program.  The hardest hit will be Saskatchewan 
where Agriculture Canada predicts a net loss of $48 million. 
Manitoba will fare only slightly better earning $64 million, a 
little less than the net realized farm income of Prince Edward 
Island.  This is one of the great agricultural provinces of the 
prairies yet that is what its net income is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the Prime Minister to listen to this.  Put another way, 
the realized net income for all farmers in Manitoba and 
Saskatchewan taken together will be down 98% from the previous 
four year average.  I cannot imagine that if any other group had 
statistics show that its net realized income had fallen 98% 
because of something beyond its control the government would not 
respond.  However, in the Speech from the Throne there is no 
visionary response to this problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to labour this but I will read the statistics. The 
statistics do not tell the real story.  Behind the statistics are 
incredible amounts of heartbreak.  I have been going to farm 
meetings ever since I belonged to a 4-H club in the Horse Hill 
area of Alberta in the 1950s.  I have gone to all kinds of 
agricultural meetings with different commodity groups, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At some of the meetings we went to this summer we talked to 
people in this dilemma.  I cannot recall ever having seen people 
who could not even talk about the problem.  These are stoical, 
independent western farmers who would go out behind the barn and 
shoot themselves rather than acknowledge that they have a 
problem.  They tend to be that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At these meetings we saw grown men breaking down and crying.  It 
was not because of their bottom lines but because they were 
losing the farm that their grandfather had.  It was because of 
what it was doing to their families, the stress lines that the 
hon. member mentioned.  People are calling for help from 
psychiatrists, ministers and everybody else and the government 
does not respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has to do three things.  It must first recognize 
that its AIDA program is a joke and is not working.  The 
agriculture minister goes around saying that the government has 
promised farmers $25 or $50 an acre to put together with the 
provinces.  I defy the government to find one farmer who has 
actually received $25 an acre.  Some farmers pay $500 to 
accountants to fill out the forms to get $40 back while others 
pay $500 only to be told that they do not qualify for anything. 
Nobody gets what is in the press releases because there are a 
whole lot of strings attached:  what was their last three years' 
average; what is their deductible, et cetera.  There are 100 
reasons for not getting the money.  They want to know where the 
replacement for AIDA is and they want it fast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Secondly, where is the expanded crop insurance program that 
includes disaster relief?  This business of inventing a new ad 
hoc program every time there is a natural disaster is crazy.  It 
politicizes the thing.  It causes all kinds of problems for the 
minister. 
Why do we not extend crop insurance to include broad based 
disaster insurance?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thirdly—and this is one for the prime minister—where is the 
team Canada mission to Europe that is not just a glad-handing 
exercise but includes the prime minister, the minister of trade, 
the foreign minister and the agriculture minister and which makes 
a powerful argument with the Europeans that their subsidies are 
killing our farmers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are committed to free trade, and the government professes 
to be committed to free trade, this is not just knocking down 
trade barriers and subsidies at home.  Yes, it does include that 
and we have supported that, but it also means being even more 
vigorous at knocking down the other guy's trade barriers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the prime minister has great influence with President 
Clinton, why does he not use it on behalf of the farmers?  If 
Canada and the U.S. teamed up to fight European subsidies rather 
than the U.S. just outbidding them, we could have an impact on 
those subsidies which are killing our farmers.  I suspect the 
reason the government does not take this approach is because it 
really is not committed to market based, free enterprise ways of 
solving this problem.  It will cut our subsidies but it does not 
go after the other guys. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one other sector where I see a deficiency in the 
government's approach which is again a backward looking approach. 
The Speech from the Throne has a little section on physical 
infrastructure.  It makes only token references to the demands 
for new highways, new roads, new bridges, new airports, new ports 
and all types of physical infrastructure development.  The speech 
states nothing at all about the need for north-south trade 
corridors, the need to build the transportation networks and 
rebuild the transportation networks that are moving a billion 
dollars of trade a day across the American borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government looked at that it would soon come to the 
conclusion that there are not enough dollars in the public works 
budget of the Government of Canada and the highways departments 
of all the provinces to even meet the physical infrastructure 
investment requirements of the west.  If we add them all up, 
there is not enough to even meet the requirements for building 
infrastructure in the west over the next 20 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does that mean?  It means we are going to have to find 
massive amounts of capital for investment and infrastructure from 
other sources.  I say that the only place we are going to find 
that is in the private sector.  We are going to have to look to 
these public-private partnerships in order to build that type of 
infrastructure.  Guidelines will be needed from the federal 
government to make sure that these projects are not screwed up 
the way the federal government did it in Atlantic Canada where it 
picked public-private projects which did not meet the 
requirements or the priorities of the provinces and where the 
project got tainted with patronage right at the beginning which 
discredited the whole approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My conclusion is that the second great deficiency of principle 
and vision that we see in the Speech from the Throne is the lack 
of a principled substantive commitment to encouraging and 
facilitating individual and corporate enterprise and better 
operations of free markets to solve the actual practical problems 
in many of these particular sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have already spoken of Reform's vision of fiscal 
responsibility and the need for governments to constrain their 
natural appetites for excessive taxation and misdirected 
involvement in the economy.  However, fiscal and economic ideals 
are not ends in themselves.  They are but means to more important 
ends.  Those more important ends for us are social and moral in 
nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now want to turn to the social and moral dimensions of the 
Speech from the Throne.  In the judgment of Reformers, the 
highest moral responsibility of government is the passage of just 
laws and the maintenance of law and order.  The most important 
social responsibility is the protection and nurturing of the 
family.  Let us look at what this throne speech does in those two 
areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to criminal justice, we have a vision of Canada as 
a safe society where people can live their lives, walk on the 
streets, drive on the highways, go to school, go to work, shop in 
the stores, visit the parks and live in their homes without fear 
of harm to themselves or their property or, even worse, fear of 
harm to their loved ones.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of the many seniors we run into when we are 
door-knocking as all of us do.  They live in fear in Canada 
inside their own homes.  They are afraid of theft.  They are 
afraid of assault.  They are afraid to go out at night.  They are 
afraid of a knock at the door.  Some of them are men who risked 
their lives for the country when they were young, and they have 
to live their older years in fear.  Some of them are women who 
pioneered in the workforce while raising families.  Many of them 
are people who built our homes, our towns and our cities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we not owe our seniors more than a pension?  Do we not have a 
moral and social obligation to protect their physical safety and 
to lift the federal government's constitutional obligation to 
create peace and order off the dry pages of the constitution and 
give people peace and order in the place where they live? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to us the only people who are really sticking their 
necks out to protect citizens from crime are police officers, 
particularly the ones who work on the streets.  These are the men 
and women who literally put their lives at risk every day to make 
public safety a reality.  How does the government treat them?  It 
slashes their budgets and it turns their work and their risks 
into a mockery through a revolving door parole system and an 
unbalanced justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To achieve the idea of genuine public safety for Canadians we 
believe the federal government must embrace the principle that 
the protection of the lives and property of the citizens must be 
the highest ideal of the criminal justice system.  The right of 
Canadians to this protection and consideration must take 
precedence over the rights of the perpetrators of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we examine the policies and actions of the government we 
find them lacking in commitment to this principle.  Let me take 
the classic illustration of this point from the events of this 
summer.  Federal law, as everyone in the House knows, provides 
for the legal entrance into the country of immigrants and genuine 
refugees.  However those laws were repeatedly violated this 
summer by international gangsters smuggling illegal entrants into 
Canada on our west coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This people smuggling is not only illegal but is a gross affront 
to the hundreds of thousands of legitimate immigrants and 
legitimate refugees who have waited patiently in line and 
fulfilled everything we have asked of them—all the hoops, all 
the paperwork, all the time delays—in order to have legitimate 
legal standing in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The points I am making have been pointed out by official 
opposition critics for immigration and justice, but I want to 
repeat them again.  The official opposition has called for 
expedited procedures to detect, detain and assess illegal 
immigrants and to immediately deport those who are not genuine 
refugees.  In doing so we are not calling for something unusual 
or draconian.  This is what the 1987 amendments to the 1976 
Immigration Act were supposed to accomplish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However there is a problem which those and subsequent amendments 
to the Immigration Act have not remedied.  Many members in the 
House know what it is.  Why do we not do something about it?  The 
problem is that in 1985 the Singh decision by the supreme court 
ruled that the Charter of Rights and Freedoms applies to everyone 
who is physically present in Canada, even if they got here 
illegally and even if they have no legal standing whatsoever.  So 
we hand to those engaged in people smuggling and to illegal 
entrants, regardless of their status, all the legal tools 
required to fight deportation hearings, deportation procedures 
and deportation orders.  They can fight it for years to the point 
where the whole process of dealing with illegal immigrants and 
refugees becomes a farce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an issue of law and order.  It is an issue of criminal 
justice.  We look to the federal government for a solution to 
make its laws enforceable so that rights granted to persons 
without legal standing in our country and violating its laws, are 
not allowed to tarnish or diminish the rights and privileges of 
those who fully comply with our laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the Speech from the Throne, what do we see?  Sad 
to say, we see nothing in the Speech from the Throne to correct 
this deficiency in principle and vision with respect to the 
Canadian criminal justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the third great deficiency in principle and vision that 
we see in the speech?  It is a lack of principled and substantive 
commitment to criminal justice reform, in particular reforms 
which ensure that when the rights of law abiding citizens and 
victims of crime conflict with the rights of the perpetrators of 
crime it is the former that prevail over the latter.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, the social vision of Reformers attaches the 
highest priority to the protection and nurturing of the family. 
Our vision of Canada regards the family as the most important 
organizational unit of society.  This is a statement of principle 
to which I believe many members of the House subscribe.  Surely 
for each of us it has some real and substantive meaning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last weekend was Thanksgiving.  Mr. Speaker, what are you 
thankful for?  What am I thankful for?  Well, many things.  I am 
thankful for being a Canadian.  I am thankful for growing up 
within driving distance of the Rocky Mountains.  I am thankful 
for a Christian heritage and for the religious liberty which 
allows each of us to turn toward God or away from God and to 
accept the consequences of our own moral decisions.  I am 
thankful for political freedoms.  Reformers complain a lot about 
the political system of the country, but I am thankful for the 
freedom that allows my friends and me to start a political party 
and to try to change the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am most thankful in my life for my family, and I think a lot 
of members share this.  What was the most important thing Sandra 
and I did on Thanksgiving?  We spent time with our family, as 
many other members did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am thankful for the kindness and nurturing of my mother and 
for the wisdom and example of my late father.  He was my hero.  I 
am thankful for my wife, Sandra, and for the spiritual 
foundations of our marriage which have enabled us to withstand 
all the stresses and strains that everybody here knows politics 
puts on a marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am thankful for the effort Sandra makes to keep our family 
healthy and strong and the way so many of our spouses sacrifice 
their own interests for us to be playing in this game. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am thankful for my own boys who have grown up to be strong and 
sensible with the help of a lot of other people besides myself, 
and who can do so many things from fishing to making music to 
operating computers far better than I can do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am thankful for my daughters; for their relentless pursuit of 
excellence in sport and education; for making life and faith 
commitments of their own; for their choices in husbands, the two 
who are married; and for the strength that these men bring to our 
family.  I am thankful for three precious little grandchildren, 
with another one on the way, who find love and acceptance and 
roots in the family while at the same time becoming its brightest 
promise and prospects for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am thankful that such a family allows us to support and care 
for each other: children, parents, grandparents, great 
grandparents and siblings, and turn to one another in times of 
need instead of having no one to turn to other than a stranger on 
the end of some government telephone line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In expressing this thankfulness for family I am not denying for 
a moment the importance of government services, whether it is 
health, education or social assistance, that help the well-being 
of families.  I am not denying for a moment the harsh realities 
of all those who because of economic, social or personal 
circumstances have lost or been denied the benefits of family, or 
those for whom family has been transformed into a place of 
violence and insecurity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My heart aches for such people, especially for the children in 
such circumstances, to do something to preserve the health of 
more families in the face of economic, social and personal 
hardships and adversity to give today's young people, regardless 
of the family circumstances in which they started out, at least a 
fighting chance to avoid some of the mistakes of our generation 
and to provide the benefits of healthy family relationships at 
least for the next generation, for their children and their 
grandchildren. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>May I suggest that if the Liberal government really wants to do 
something for children there are a number of other practical 
things it could do that are not in the Speech from the Throne. 
For example, it could focus first and foremost on doing something 
for families.  It should not focus on government programs that 
attempt to substitute for families.  It should focus first and 
foremost on supporting the family directly.  It might start at 
the beginning, if it had the moral nerve, by defining the rights 
of the unborn.  This it will have to do if it intends to 
reintroduce its bill on reproductive technologies.  It will have 
to get into that subject and it would be better to do it sooner 
rather than later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, if the Liberal government really wants to do something 
for children, it should state clearly the definitions of marriage 
and family which it believes are most conducive to the well-being 
of children.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 8, 1999, for example, the House passed by a vote of 216 
for and 55 against a resolution moved by the hon. member for 
Calgary Centre which read as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, it is necessary, in light of 
public debate around recent court decisions, to state that 
marriage is and should remain the union of one man and one woman 
to the exclusion of all others, and that Parliament will take all 
necessary steps— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where are the steps?  We did not see any in the Speech from the 
Throne. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—within the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada to preserve 
this definition of marriage in Canada. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's support of this motion was a good step but it 
should be followed by another.  If the Liberal government really 
wants to do something for children, it should also clarify the 
definition of family as the primary biological and social context 
into which our children are born. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the Reform Party's conviction that a family should be 
defined as individuals related by blood, marriage or adoption. 
Members should note that this definition is broad.  It is not a 
narrow definition of family.  It is broad enough to embrace a 
so-called traditional family, common law relationships, the 
single parent family and the extended family which is so 
important to many new Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Affirming these definitions of marriage and the family is not to 
say that parliament cannot recognize in law other relationships 
of dependency, but in our judgment these should not be confused 
in law or public policy with marriage defined as the union of a 
man and a woman or the familial relations based on that union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some might argue on the basis of the supreme court's 
recent M. v  H. decision that the court is headed, whether we 
like it or not, in the direction of saying that in Canadian law 
a couple is a couple is a couple, regardless of the basis of the 
relationship.  However I believe I speak for the majority of 
parliamentarians, not just Reformers, when I say that it is 
parliament's intention, that it was parliament's intention and 
that it is still parliament's intention that the union of a man 
and a woman, which is unique in its potential for the natural 
procreation and nurturing of children, should be in a category by 
itself as should be the familial relations based upon it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On page 22 the throne speech states that Canada will champion 
efforts at the United Nations to eliminate the exploitation of 
children.  If this is the case, the government should then direct 
the courts here at home to stop protecting the consumers of child 
pornography.  When parliament passed that section of the criminal 
code, and that debate has gone before the B.C. court, it intended 
that the possession of child pornography should be treated as a 
crime. Why?  Because possession represents the demand side of the 
pornography industry.  If one wants to shut down the pornography 
industry one has to go after the demand side and not just the 
supply side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the criminal code does not make it crystal clear that is what 
parliament intended, the government should introduce legislation 
that makes that crystal clear to the courts.  If the courts still 
insist that section of the criminal code is not charter 
compatible, the government should not hesitate to use the 
notwithstanding clause now to enforce such a provision. Surely if 
the government values children it will put their right to 
protection from the evils of pornography ahead of any adult's 
right to possess child pornography. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech also expresses particular concern about child 
poverty while often ignoring the family context in which much of 
that poverty occurs.  Again if the Liberal government wished to 
do something about child poverty, it could do two practical 
things which do not require the invention of some new program. It 
could stop overtaxing the parents and stop taking up to $6 
billion a year from people making $20,000 a year or less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government takes in $6 billion and tries to figure out how 
some complicated program, which will cost a lot administratively, 
will give them back a couple of hundred dollars for this or that. 
Am I missing something, or would it not be simpler to leave the 
dollars in their pockets, stop the unfair taxation of single 
income families and see just how many new child care spaces that 
creates?

</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the fourth great deficiency in principle and vision that 
we see in the Speech from the Throne?  It is the lack of a 
principled priority commitment to the protection and nurturing 
directly of the Canadian family, the human context, the primary 
biological, economic, social, cultural and spiritual context into 
which our children are born. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a deficiency which in our judgment cannot be remedied 
until there are 150-plus members in the House who are convinced 
in their hearts as well as their heads that the number one social 
priority of government should be the protection and nurturing of 
the family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another set of principles nowhere alluded to in the 
Speech from the Throne and yet absolutely essential to the 
implementation of any legislative program approved by parliament. 
They are those principles that define the proper line between the 
executive, parliament and the courts. In recent years we have 
seen these lines increasingly blurred by this administration. We 
have seen the courts increasingly encroach on the prerogatives of 
parliament to the point where one might argue that one cannot 
fully interpret the Speech from the Throne until after hearing 
the speech from the bench. I have three examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the impact of the Singh decision on the government's 
ability to halt people smuggling. What difference does it make if 
this parliament sets up the ideal system for handling immigrants 
and refugees?  As long as the Singh decision stands, there are 
legal ways around it.  It can be fought every step of the way for 
seven years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the impact of the B.C. court decision in the Sharpe 
case which legitimates demand for child pornography.  It is 
already having a secondary impact in other parts of the country 
while we wait and wait for a court decision that may not come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the impact of the Marshall decision on the management 
of the east coast fishery.  I understand we will have a debate 
tonight during which we can get into this in detail.  The member 
for Delta—South Richmond will be saying a lot on this a little 
later.  In the Marshall case the court affirmed an aboriginal 
fishing right from a treaty that does not contain the word fish. 
Talk about writing things in, that is a good example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apparently no one, and this is the responsibility of the 
government and not the court, made a convincing case for the 
dangers of having one law for aboriginals and another law for 
non-aboriginal fishermen.  No one made the case apparently of the 
threat that unlimited fishing rights create for destroying the 
biological basis of the fishery.  And apparently no one made the 
case that the government, through its constitutional right under 
section 91 of the Constitution and its responsibility for 
fisheries, also granted rights to fish under certain licences and 
if the court was going to deal with this problem at all, it was a 
matter of balancing two sets of rights, one against the other, 
not simply affirming one set of rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The court made a fishery policy as distinct from parliament 
making a fishery policy leading to, in this case, violence and 
chaos on the east coast fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Switching to the positive, the official opposition has a vision 
of the proper relationship between parliament, the court and the 
executive.  It is a vision that is rooted in our own Constitution 
and several hundred years of British constitutional convention 
and precedents.  It is based on a simple principle, that 
parliament makes the law, the administration administers the law 
and the court interprets the law. In our judgment any delegation 
of law making by the executive to the courts by default, which is 
what this government does, or any proactive assumption of law 
making functions by the courts is a violation of this basic 
constitutional principle and it needs to be corrected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe the following explains why the government is not 
enthusiastic about correcting it.  The root of the problem is 
that the BNA Act of 1867 founded Canada on a constitution 
“similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom”.  One of 
the founding principles is that parliament makes the law, the 
executive implements the law and the courts interpret it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But in 1981-82 the Liberal administration of Pierre Trudeau, an 
administration in which the current Prime Minister was the 
justice minister, initiated and secured the passage of the 
Constitution Act, at the heart of which was a constitutional 
device similar in principle not to the constitution of the 
United Kingdom but to that of the United States. 
I refer of course to the charter of rights and freedoms.  This 
law included for the first time in Canada a constitutionally 
entrenched guarantee of civil rights. It served the same function 
in Canada as the U.S. bill of rights but without any of the 
checks and balances on the three branches of government which are 
found in the American Constitution.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what happens when you transplant an idea from one 
constitutional system to another.  You do not necessarily bring 
along with it the checks and balances that made it work in the 
original situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the introduction of the charter to the Canadian 
Constitution a great departure began from the historic division 
of responsibilities between parliament and the courts which 
continues to this very day. The consequences of that departure 
include replacement of the supremacy of parliament with the 
supremacy of the Constitution as interpreted by judges.  They 
include a transfer of power from parliament and the legislatures 
to the courts, including a transfer of the ultimate right of 
interpretation. The other consequence is the thrusting, whether 
they want it or not, of unelected judges with no direct 
accountability to the people into the realm of decision making 
and political activism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consequences of this great departure and the political 
activism of the courts are enormous.  I suggest to members that 
they go far beyond simple legal and academic questions concerning 
the appropriate balance between the courts and parliament. Look 
at the list of things into which this great departure has taken 
the courts whether or not they wanted to go there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Mahé decision of 1990 took the courts into the operation of 
school boards.  The Eldridge decision of 1993 took the court into 
affecting provincial government budgetary decisions.  The Singh 
case of 1985, as already pointed out, took the court into the 
administration of immigration and refugee procedures.  The 
Therens case of 1985 created an enhanced role for lawyers in 
criminal proceedings that went far too far and which has had 
negative effects.  We saw further evidence of political and 
social activism by the courts when they created the defence of 
self-induced intoxication, something parliament never ever 
dreamed about in any of its wildest moments. That was via the 
Daviault case in 1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was court direction of public policy with respect to 
vagrancy via the Heywood case of 1994.  There was the extension 
of the requirement for the use of warrants to unreasonable 
lengths via the Feeney case of 1997.  It took the courts into the 
elevation of the protection of language rights ahead of the 
protection of citizens from criminal activity via the Beaulac 
case of 1999, and into the establishment of procedural delays as 
grounds for abandoning thousands of criminal prosecutions via the 
Askov case of 1990. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw further evidence of the great departure when the courts 
extended the democratic franchise to prisoners via the Sauvé 
decision of 1993.  It legitimated the rights of adults to possess 
child pornography via the Sharpe decision of 1999.  It imposed a 
limit on the sanctity of life by striking down provisions for the 
regulation of abortion via the Morgentaler decision of 1998. It 
interjected a court ruling on spousal benefits into the politics 
of a provincial election, which I find utterly inexcusable, via 
the M and H decision of 1999.  It has triggered violent 
confrontations over diminishing fishery resources on the east 
coast via the Marshall decision of 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could keep the House here all night reading court cases, but 
on some future occasion I am hoping the Prime Minister will 
ensure this parliament addresses this issue explicitly.  At such 
time it would be my intention to lay before parliament a number 
of measures for clearly delineating a line between ourselves and 
the courts.  These measures include a number of things, of which 
I will mention three. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First would be measures to ensure that parliament specifies in 
each statute it passes the intent of that statute and that it 
obtains independent legal advice, because we cannot get it from 
the justice department, on the charter compatibility of bills 
before they leave this place rather than after.  It is a process 
of pre-legislative review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would also recommend that these remedial measures include the 
establishment of a judicial review committee of parliament to 
prepare an appropriate parliamentary response to those court 
decisions that misconstrue parliament's intent, and include 
recommendations of the appropriate use of the notwithstanding 
clause which I remind hon. members is just as much a part of our 
Constitution as is the charter of rights and freedoms.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the Speech from the Throne we do not see any 
recognition of this even though it affects everything we pass 
here.  Why is that?  I suspect it is because on many of the 
issues affected by the political activism of the courts, 
especially in moral and social areas, the Liberal administration 
would prefer to have the hard decisions made by Liberal appointed 
judges rather than by the elected members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is the case, we will not see a remedy to this problem 
until there are 150-plus members elected to this Chamber with a 
commitment to change and to draw the line crystal clear between 
parliament and the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I turn now to the state of our federal union, a subject on which 
the Speech from the Throne devoted about four specific paragraphs 
and yet is one which is central to everything we do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As all members here know, Canada is the second largest nation in 
terms of territory on the face of the earth.  It consists of ten 
provinces and three territories encompassing an enormous breadth 
of cultural and regional diversity.  In order to unify this great 
diversity into one nation from sea to sea to sea, our forefathers 
rightly chose to apply the principles of federalism.  Canada is 
therefore a federal state, but because of its size and diversity 
it is a federal state that cannot take its internal unity for 
granted even for a month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This parliament has the right to expect that every Speech from 
the Throne would contain at least two things.  One is substantive 
measures to address the particular concerns and aspirations of 
the great regions that make up this country.  The other is 
something substantive with respect to the application, 
preservation and advancement of the principles of federalism on 
which our continued unity depends.  Let us look at the present 
state of our federal union and the Speech from the Throne from 
this perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This summer my wife and I spent several weeks in the west, two 
weeks in Quebec, two weeks in Ontario, and almost three weeks in 
Atlantic Canada.  We attended some 80 different functions, many 
of them informal social functions which gave us a good 
opportunity to interact with people.  We listened to the 
predictable concerns of people about taxes, jobs and health care. 
But we also perceived something else, something less defined and 
yet very real and something that is bigger than people's day to 
day concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are four big regional concerns and aspirations which I 
believe are abroad in our land and which this federal parliament 
must recognize and address in order to maintain the unity and 
progress of this country in the 21st century.  Four strong winds 
are starting to blow with increasing velocity; four strong winds 
which, if we ignore or misread them, can put our federal ship on 
the rocks; four strong winds which, if properly harnessed, can 
propel this federal union forward with confidence and security 
into the uncharted waters of the next century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me begin in the west.  I like beginning in the west.  In 
June, Sandra and I travelled to the Milk River country of 
southern Alberta.  There we borrowed two horses and a tent from a 
longtime rancher in the Milk River area, Tom Gilchrist. For three 
days we joined the anniversary trail ride commemorating the 1874 
march west of the original North West Mounted Police contingent; 
a great adventure which originally took 275 officers and men from 
Fort Dufferin south of Winnipeg all through the southern part of 
Saskatchewan and southern Alberta to Fort Whoop-Up 125 years 
before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That original group of North West Mounted Police included 
Colonel James MacLeod who would lay the foundation for a treaty 
with the great Blackfoot confederacy on the basis of a simple 
principle: equality under the law. I wish James MacLeod had been 
around when they were putting together the Nisga'a treaty.  That 
is how he made peace with the fiercest group of aboriginals left 
on the prairies.  It was the last group to have a confrontation 
with the Europeans.  He made it on a simple basis.  A couple of 
RCMP walked into a huge camp.  There was one law, the same law, 
for whites and Indians.  He did a few things to back it up and 
that was the basis of that peace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fort he established on the Old Man River became home to 
F.W.G. Haultain a few years later.  Haultain was a lawyer from 
eastern Canada who came out west.  He became the greatest premier 
the old North-West Territories ever had. 
He was the one who negotiated the provincial terms of entry of 
Alberta and Saskatchewan in the federal union as provinces.  What 
was the principle he insisted on, even though he did not get it? 
Equality for provinces.  Equality between the new provinces and 
the old provinces.

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of that same old Northwest Mounted Police contingent 
would soon establish another fort at the confluence of the Bow 
and Elbow Rivers, Fort Calgary, the place where over a century 
later nine premiers and two territorial leaders would meet and 
produce a declaration asserting the principle of equality of all 
Canadians and provinces under the law and that any power given to 
one province to protect and develop its uniqueness would be given 
to the others.  Equality for individuals and provinces was as 
much a founding principle of the old west as accommodation to the 
French-English fact was a founding principle of central Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That old west, including British Columbia, was wild and vast 
with enormous potential.  It attracted people of enterprise and 
initiative who overcame all sorts of obstacles and hardships. 
Members should read the story of the original march west by the 
RCMP if they want a story of overcoming hardship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That old west had all sorts of new ideas and convictions on how 
the west itself should be governed.  But politically the old west 
had one huge problem.  It was politically impotent.  At the turn 
of the last century the west produced less than 10% of the GNP, 
had less than 10% of the population and had less than 10% of the 
seats in this parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The old west lacked political clout to impress its concerns on 
the federal government, let alone impress its ideas.  It quickly 
and unfortunately developed an underdog attitude that if it 
participated in negotiations with the national government or if 
it participated in political dialogue with people in other parts 
of the country it would rarely win the debate and would always be 
outvoted and outnumbered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What struck me as I rode through that country commemorating the 
opening up of the old west was how far the west has come in a 
century and how different the position of the new west entering 
the 21st century is in comparison to what the old west was at the 
turn of the century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that Milk River country, if one stands at the right place, 
the Cypress Hills can be seen to the east, the Sweet Grass Hills 
of Montana to the south and Chief Mountain to the west.  These 
were all sacred places to the Blackfoot.  They were high places 
from which the Blackfoot believed they could see forever and from 
which they believed they could see the future.  It was a place 
where the young saw visions and the old dreamed dreams.  Could 
any of the people who mounted those heights at the turn of the 
last century, aboriginal or non-aboriginal, possibly have 
envisioned the new west of the 21st century? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new west is no longer politically impotent.  In the 21st 
century it will produce over one-third of the wealth of this 
country.  It will have over one-third of the population of this 
country.  British Columbia will become the second largest 
province in the country and the west will control over one-third 
of the seats in this parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 21st century it will be impossible to implement any truly 
national policy without the west's concurrence or to form any 
truly national government without western participation.  The 
great challenge for westerners is how to use this newfound 
influence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be some, “little westerners” Haultain would have 
called them, who will advocate that the new west should use its 
growing influence simply to settle old scores and that the west 
should confine itself to addressing its own immediate regional 
interests.  These people will prefer regional parties over 
national parties.  There will even be some who will say, 
regrettably, that the new west should use its influence to 
separate from Canada.  Fortunately there will be others, “big 
westerners” Haultain would call them, who will advocate a much 
more positive and inclusive course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform is the principle and Reform is the voice of the new west. 
We say yes, the new west should use its influence to protect and 
advance regional interests, to raise the agricultural concerns of 
the prairies higher on the national agenda, to protect the oil 
and gas producing regions from another raid by the federal 
government, to prevent the west coast fishery from suffering the 
same abuse as the east coast fishery and to make B.C. Canada's 
gateway to the Asia-Pacific. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also say that the new west should use its new influence in 
the federation to address and resolve the problems of the 
federation as a whole, to get the federal financial house in 
order by insisting that tax and debt levels be lowered for all 
Canadians, by advocating that national health care—medicare, 
after all, was born in the west—be reformed for the benefit of 
all Canadians, by insisting that federal institutions be made 
more representative and democratically accountable for all 
Canadians, and by insisting that the equality of all Canadians 
and all provinces under the law become a governing constitutional 
principle throughout the entire country and be pounded into the 
heads of members of parliament.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the Speech from the Throne from this 
perspective, what do we see?  We see no evidence at all that the 
federal government even recognizes the existence or emergence of 
the new west, let alone a preparedness to accommodate its 
aspirations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is at odds, in particular with British 
Columbia, on everything from the mismanagement of immigration and 
refugees to the mismanagement of the fishery to the mismanagement 
of aboriginal relations.  It has negotiated a treaty with the 
Nisga'a which is based not on the principle of equality of all 
under the law, but on the divisive principle of one law for 
aboriginals and another for non-aboriginals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than offering tax incentives to reduce greenhouse 
emissions, the government has mused about imposing a green tax 
which would discriminate against the petroleum producing regions 
without proposing any compensatory measures or equivalent 
environmental taxes on competing energy sources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By failing to propose or mount a concerted international attack 
on European agricultural subsidies, it refuses to get at the root 
of the low commodity prices that are doing enormous damage to our 
farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has never followed up on that resolution we 
passed in the House one night, which members voted for, calling 
on the federal government to help communicate the real 
significance of the Calgary declaration to Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech from the Throne and the Liberal government are 
completely oblivious to the spirit and the aspirations of the new 
west.  This is a deficiency which is inexcusable in a federal 
system where the federal government must recognize regional 
aspirations and respond to them for the sake and well-being of 
Canadians living in those regions, as well as national unity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said there were four strong winds.  The wind coming out of the 
new west is only one.  In Ontario, the federal government must 
recognize and accommodate the aspirations of the common sense 
revolution.  It has not done so and there is little in the Speech 
from the Throne that indicates it is prepared to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 the people of Ontario elected the tax cutting, common 
sense government of Premier Harris to get that province's 
financial house in order.  Premier Harris proceeded to do so by 
cutting taxes 30%, introducing programs like workfare as 
preferable to welfare, while still spending 50% more dollars on 
health care in that one province than this government spends on 
health care in the entire country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 Mr. Harris asked the people of Ontario whether they 
wanted his government to continue on this common sense course 
and, in particular, whether they wanted him to continue to cut 
taxes.  Despite the fierce opposition of both federal and 
provincial Liberals, the Harris government was returned by the 
people of Ontario with a solid majority.  We offer them our 
heartiest congratulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a strong wind blowing across Ontario.  It is the wind 
of the common sense revolution.  It is completely 
counterproductive for the largest government in the country, the 
federal government, to pursue tax policies that are at cross 
purposes with the tax policies of the largest provincial 
government.  People in Ontario are concerned, like people in 
Alberta, that tax and spend federal Liberals will move into the 
hard earned vacated tax room created by the provincial 
government.  They want the principles of the common sense 
revolution to be respected and implemented in Ottawa as well as 
Queen's Park.  Yet, there is not a flicker of recognition in the 
Speech from the Throne of that political reality.  It fails to 
recognize, let alone respect, the principal fiscal interest of 
the largest province in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked about four strong winds.  I have two so far.  There is 
an easterly wind beginning to blow in this country.  The Atlantic 
provinces are bestirring themselves in a manner which is good for 
them and good for the country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I talk to business, labour and academic interests in 
Atlantic Canada I hear a desire to pursue new paths to economic 
growth; not the tired and discredited Liberal policies of trying 
to stimulate growth through patronage tainted subsidies, grants 
and handouts to the few, but new and more credible policies.  I 
will list them:  tax relief for the many to put more dollars in 
the pockets of consumers to spend and Atlantic business to 
invest; a concerted effort to expand trade between Atlantic 
Canada and the New England states, which was the basis of the old 
Atlantic economy before it entered Confederation and in which 
Atlantic Canada was stronger than it is now; a vigorous effort to 
expand Atlantic rim trade to make Atlantic Canada the gateway for 
European-North American trade; rebuilding the infrastructure of 
the whole east coast through public-private partnerships, but 
partnerships acceptable to the province and untainted by federal 
Liberal patronage; creating a tax and investment environment 
conducive to the growth of the knowledge industry in Atlantic 
Canada to take advantage of the many excellent institutions of 
higher learning and to create 21st century jobs for Atlantic 
Canadian youth close to home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of these policies, and they represent a departure from what 
the federal government has done, were first proposed and pursued 
by Premier McKenna of New Brunswick, who has just denounced the 
federal Liberals' approach to regional economic development in 
the strongest possible terms.  According to a <I>Globe and 
Mail</I> report, Mr. McKenna has unleashed a scorching indictment 
of the federal government's treatment of Atlantic Canada.  The 
federal Liberals, he said, have nothing in the window for his 
region.  He speaks of “their total ignorance of the issues of 
shipbuilding, their total ignorance of the very highly developed 
information technology sector which is taking place here, their 
disgraceful management of the fisheries issue and the resource 
issue having to do with the natives”.  All of these things, he 
said, are just more nails in their coffin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Premier McKenna's initiatives were largely abandoned by his 
successor at the provincial level, who paid the price at the 
polls.  In both New Brunswick and Nova Scotia two tired and 
discredited Liberal administrations have been turned out of 
office and replaced by the Conservative ministries of Mr. Lord 
and Dr. Hamm.  In both elections the smell of patronage and 
federal political interference in provincial highway projects was 
a factor in the defeat of the provincial Liberal administrations, 
and both of these administrations are seeking to pursue new 
approaches to economic growth.  We extend our heartiest 
congratulations to both. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The winds of change are blowing in Atlantic Canada.  Yet, when 
we examine the Speech from the Throne, supposedly the speech 
laying out the legislative program of the federal government 
which claims it lies awake nights trying to figure out how to 
make this federation work better, there is no recognition of this 
regional fact at all, no new principles or visions that respond 
to the new wind that is blowing out of Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That brings me to the fourth wind.  The fourth wind that a 
perceptive and sensitive federal government would be recognizing 
and seeking to accommodate would be the new wind that is stirring 
in Quebec.  It is still a light breeze, but there are signs in 
the polls and the political discussion in that province that 
perhaps up to 15% of the Quebec electorate is open to a third 
way, une troisième voie:  not separation for Canada, not the 
status quo federalism of the Liberals and the Prime Minister, but 
reform of the federation with a rebalancing of the powers between 
the federal and provincial governments for the 21st century, a 
rebalancing that would strengthen the federal government in some 
of its key areas of jurisdiction, strengthen the provinces in 
some of their key areas of jurisdiction, particularly health, 
education and social assistance, and include jurisdiction for the 
provinces over language and culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, when we examine the Speech from the Throne and the 
application of the principles of federalism to the maintenance of 
national unity, what do we see?  As I have said, we see nothing 
that truly recognizes the growing and diverse regional 
aspirations of the west, Ontario or Atlantic Canada.  When it 
comes to addressing the concerns of Quebec we see nothing of the 
principle or the vision of a reformed federalism, only a 
continuation of the status quo plus a veiled reference to 
defining a federal position on the secession process and 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it absolutely amazing that a government that prides 
itself on always taking the balanced approach—how many times 
have we heard it, always seeking the balanced approach between 
spending and tax cuts, between debt reduction and taxation—when 
it comes to national unity it takes a totally unbalanced 
approach. 
When it comes to national unity and adjusting federalism to 
accommodate the strains of regional-provincial interests, the 
government spends 90% of its time thinking about Quebec and 10% 
of its time thinking about the rest of the country.  When it 
comes to Quebec, the government spends 90% of the time trying to 
defend and perpetuate an unacceptable status quo.  When it comes 
to advocating something new to provide a way out of the 
constitutional box for either discontented federalists or for 
weary nationalists in Quebec, instead of presenting both plan A 
and plan B in balance so Quebecers understand all their options 
and the consequences of them, the Speech from the Throne contains 
no plan A and only a veiled reference to a plan B proposal for 
federal legislation on the secession referendum process and 
question.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister must come across in Quebec as the schoolyard 
bully.  When the sovereignists show strength, as in the last 
referendum, he grovels and promises anything, like constitutional 
recognition of distinct society which he had opposed for 36 
years.  However, when he thinks his opponents are weakening, he 
plays the tough guy who is willing to go to court. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the question of national unity, Quebecers are used to seeing 
the Prime Minister playing the blow-hard.  That has been his 
style throughout his political career.  The Prime Minister is 
brave when his adversaries are disorganized, but he makes 
himself scarce as soon as they begin to rally round. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If federalists are going to speak credibly to Quebecers we must 
be consistent and balanced.  We should recognize that status quo 
federalism has little appeal in particular to the young.  We 
should not risk a revival of support for separation as a reaction 
to clumsy miscalculations by status quo federalists.  If plan A 
and plan B are to be presented they must be presented in balance, 
with plan A representing reform of the federation with the 
priority being given to communicating it to those who are 
searching for a third way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the four big winds that we see blowing across the 
country.  We see nothing in the Speech from the Throne that shows 
any recognition of them whatsoever, that shows any preparedness 
to harness them for the benefit of the country in the 21st 
century and no adjustment of federalism beyond the status quo. In 
our judgment, this deficiency will not be remedied until there 
are 150-plus members of parliament from all parts of the country 
committed to that vision of a reformed federation for the 21st 
century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One might ask why there is so much public interest and support 
throughout the country for things like tax relief, criminal 
justice reform, the strengthening of families, health care reform 
and the reform of federal-provincial relations to make them more 
co-operative and productive, and yet so little principled 
commitment or action on these fronts in the legislative program 
of the federal government.  The answer lies in the fact that the 
federal political institutions of the country, in particular this 
parliament and this House of Commons, are defective in terms of 
their capacity to accurately assess and represent the public will 
and to respond democratically to public demands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why Reformers want not simply to reform particular 
fiscal, social, economic or justice policies of the government. 
We want to reform the system itself whereby these policies are 
developed and implemented in the first place.  We have a vision 
of a country and a system of government that is truly democratic, 
not simply democratic in appearance, not an autocracy where 
people get a chance to vote for the autocrat every four years, 
but a genuine democracy where the institutions are truly 
representative and accountable and where the first allegiance of 
members of parliament is not to their party or to themselves but 
to the people who elect them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We envision a parliament where the upper house is a credit and a 
complement to democracy, not the disgrace to democracy that it is 
now.  We envision a Senate that is democratically elected with 
equal numbers per province and effective powers to safeguard and 
represent regional interests. 
If the country had a workable Senate, in particular the way the 
Fathers of Confederation envisioned it to be, the first place 
where these four regional winds that are blowing would register 
in Parliament is the Senate.  As it is, it is the last place. 
They could have a hurricane over there and they would not even 
recognize it as a wind.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We envision a parliament where there is genuine free voting in 
both the Houses, not just on private members' bills or on 
exceptional occasions when the government does not want to touch 
a moral issue with a 10-foot pole, but every day on issues of 
substance and on government bills and opposition motions of every 
description. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We envision a house of commons where a prime minister with 
genuine democratic convictions has risen to his feet. The Prime 
Minister might want to take some notes on this.  We would like to 
see a prime minister stand in the House and say, “It is not the 
policy of my government to regard every vote as a vote of 
confidence in the government.  If a government motion is defeated 
or an opposition motion is carried the government will not 
resign.  It will respect that vote and only resign in response to 
the passage of an explicit vote of no confidence”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can hon. members imagine even for a moment what a difference 
that one simple change would make to improve the democratic 
nature of this place?  The capacity of every single member to 
more effectively represent constituents' interests would be 
increased, in particular when the constituents' will conflicts 
with the party line.  The power of the leaders, in particular the 
prime minister, to coerce votes would be restrained.  Committees 
would be more independent.  They could initiate legislation. 
Debates would no longer be meaningless, sequential soliloquies 
because members would actually be free to change their mind or 
their positions as a result of something that some other member 
had said.  Legislation would be enacted perhaps not in exactly 
the same form that it was originally introduced by the 
government, but enacted nevertheless by majority vote and in 
accordance with a broader cross-section of public and national 
opinion than would otherwise be the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We envision a parliament that regularly invites the public to 
participate in making major national decisions; a democracy where 
referendums on key issues are regularly held; where citizens can 
initiate a referendum if enough of them feel strongly enough 
about the need for a legislative measure; a democracy where 
elected officials who abuse their public trust can be fired for 
cause by an electorate itself through a recall mechanism; a 
democracy where parliament is willing to give the public a chance 
to vote in favour of reforms to the electoral system itself, 
inviting Canadians to choose from among such options as 
continuation of the first past the post system, adoption of some 
form of preferential balloting, a system of proportional 
representation or some combination of these measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, we envision a democratic parliamentary system 
where the principles of genuine democracy, of effective 
representation, of true accountability, of free votes and of 
public participation are actually practised and reflected in the 
day to day operations of our institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the scale of the demand for democracy that is abroad in 
the land.  We see it in British Columbia where just the prospect 
of a recall mechanism has the anti-democrats quaking in their 
shoes, as they should.  We see it in Alberta where hundreds of 
thousands of people went out and participated in a Senate 
election knowing that the Prime Minister, in all his 
stubbornness, would not respect their wishes.  They went out 
anyway.  They went to the meetings.  They marked their ballots in 
the spirit of democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the most encouraging thing for Canadian democrats this 
summer was a conference held at Bird's Hill Provincial Park in 
Manitoba by the First Nations Accountability Coalition, a group 
now representing grassroots aboriginal people from more than 200 
first nations communities across the country.  What were they 
talking about?  They were talking about fiscal and democratic 
accountability for on-reserve governments and the department of 
Indian affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The spirit of democracy is alive in the country.  However, when 
we look at the Speech from the Throne what do we see?  Not a 
flicker of enthusiasm for any of the great democratic principles 
and reforms that would make the country a model democracy for the 
21st century.

</I></B></P><P align=left>People from emerging democracies, some from the former Soviet 
Union, from Africa and from Asia, visit the House and the 
Speaker's chambers.  They sit in the balcony expecting to see a 
model democracy.  If we handed them the Speech from the Throne 
they would not guess that there is a commitment to democracy, to 
democratic reform or to making this democracy work better.  It is 
a shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have devoted almost the entirety of my reply to the Speech 
from the Throne to demonstrating its greatest flaws:  its 
deficiency in principle and vision.  In order to be constructive, 
I have also endeavoured to outline by contrast the principles and 
vision to which the official opposition is firmly committed and 
which we believe should animate and direct the legislative 
program of the Government of Canada; principles of fiscal 
responsibility; vigorous encouragement of private enterprise and 
free markets; principles of social responsibility for law and 
order and integrity of the family; respect of the line between 
the courts and the parliament; principles of reformed federalism; 
and, principles of genuine democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to my final point.  The official opposition is 
deeply committed to these principles.  We have left our homes and 
our normal occupations to fight for them in elections and in 
parliament.  However, the official opposition is not naive enough 
or egocentric enough to believe that we have some exclusive 
monopoly on these principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, across the country there are hundreds and thousands 
of supporters and voters for various political parties who 
believe in the principle of fiscal responsibility, in particular 
the need for national tax and debt reduction.  However, because 
so many of the people who hold these convictions are divided in 
their political loyalties between various political parties, 
between several federal parties, or between provincial parties 
that espouse these principles and federal parties of the same 
name that do not, it has not been possible to amass the political 
support required to elect the 150-plus members needed in this 
parliament to make real tax reduction and tax relief a reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Across the country there are millions of people who would agree 
in principle that Canada needs to make a new commitment to law 
and order, to preserving the family and to reforming 
federal-provincial relations.  However, again, because the 
political loyalties of those people are divided among various 
political groups, the country ends up being governed by a party 
that is committed to none of these principles and elected with 
only 38% of the vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It could be argued that if only we could secure some of these 
democratic reforms I have enumerated, in particular free voting 
in the House or some change in the electoral system, it would 
then be much more possible to form temporary or permanent 
coalitions of members of the House who are committed to the same 
principles but find themselves currently divided by party lines 
and loyalties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a catch-22 to that argument.  In order to implement 
those democratic reforms, we need the 150-plus votes required to 
carry a motion or a bill and no such free voting or committed 
majority exists in this Chamber at the present time.  What is 
this telling us?  What is this telling Canadians?  It is telling 
us that there is a need for a realignment of the party lines in 
the country in order to implement policies based on widely shared 
principles and values be they those that I have enumerated or 
some other set of principles that others may define. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is to advance the principle of political realignment, the 
principle that party lines and party structures must be adjusted 
from time to time to better unite rather than further divide all 
those who share certain common principles essential to the 
implementation of public policy conducive to good government, 
that the official opposition has offered to work with others 
like-minded, regardless of past party affiliation, to create a 
principled united alternative to the current administration in 
time for the next election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this partisan House, I am well aware that arguments in favour 
of co-operation across party lines for the sake of the country 
usually fall on deaf ears.  However, out in the real world where 
voters and taxpayers live this is not the case.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that increasing numbers of Canadians are watching us 
with two questions in mind whether or not we as practising 
politicians want to recognize it.  They are watching first to see 
whether any existing party is willing to make a sincere effort to 
define new common ground on which large numbers of Canadians 
could unite in new ways to lower taxes, to heal the health care, 
to democratize their institutions and to unite our country, all 
the things the status quo Liberal administration has been unable 
to provide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, they are watching to see if any existing party is so 
committed to these principles that it is prepared to set aside 
its own partisan goals, even if for a moment, and work with 
others who are like minded, regardless of past party affiliation, 
in order to implement those principles at the federal level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two weekends ago the once great Progressive Conservative Party 
of Canada said no to both the idea of seeking new common ground 
and setting aside its own narrow partisan goals to work with 
others.  It will have to live with the consequences of that 
decision, the kind of inward looking thinking that reduced its 
representation from 169 seats in the 34th Parliament to 2 seats 
in the 35th Parliament, that has reduced its party membership 
from 90,000 a year ago to 18,000 under the current leadership, at 
least half of whom reject the traditional conservative principles 
of both fiscal conservatism and free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party of Canada and the official opposition in this 
Chamber has said yes to both those questions.  Over the next few 
months it will continue to explore whether it is possible to 
build a new principled alternative to the unprincipled and 
visionless administration in time for a new century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The original Fathers of Confederation had a dream.  We should 
remember this because a similar challenge was faced by a 
parliament long ago that created our country.  The original 
Fathers of Confederation had a dream that could not be realized 
until there was a political realignment in the old parliament of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I too have a dream of a new and better Canada that requires a 
political realignment if it is to be fulfilled early in the new 
millennium.  It has sometimes been asked how was it that the 
original Fathers of Confederation, a group which contained people 
who wanted to conserve certain old things like the French 
language and culture and the British connection and which 
contained people with radical new ideas on federalism and 
advanced democracy, were able or willing to work together to 
bring into being the new confederation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The short answer which has meaning for us today is that the 
conservers of the old and the advocates of the new learned to 
bear with one another and to recognize each in the other the 
necessary complement of their one-sidedness.  The defenders of 
the old need the challenge of new ideas.  If they do not have 
that the old ossifies and eventually decays. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The advocates of change need the influence of the advocates of 
old principles to constrain them from going too far.  If the two 
can ever bear with one another, one of the products of their 
doing that at the turn of the last century was the country of 
Canada itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite all Canadians who share in their hearts a vision of a 
better Canada where taxes are lower and government less 
intrusive; where law and order and the value of the family are 
enhanced rather than undermined by federal policy; where federal 
and provincial governments co-operate rather than bicker in a 
better federal union to provide better health, education and 
social services for our people; and where federal political 
institutions like the Senate and the House command a new respect 
because of their effectiveness and commitment to democratic 
accountability to work together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite all who share in this vision and the principles on 
which it rests to work together to remedy the deficiencies in 
principle and vision that characterize this last gasp throne 
speech from a tired and visionless administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime I move that the following words be added to the 
address: 
<A NAME="LINK151">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And that this House regrets that your Government has failed 
through a lack of vision and commitment to sound principles to 
adequately address the allegations of corruption against it, 
including the abuse of patronage; failed to bring integrity to 
Canada's immigration system by allowing organized crime to take 
advantage of Canadians' generosity and by undermining the 
standing of legitimate immigrants and genuine refugees; failed to 
seriously deal with the problems of drug trafficking, youth 
crime, and child pornography; rejected the common sense policies 
of other governments, most notably the Ontario and Alberta 
Governments, of lowering taxes to create jobs and prevent 
companies, young people, and capital from leaving the country; 
failed to maintain the supremacy of Parliament in relation to the 
court; failed to recognize the serious plight of Canadian 
agriculture and to provide a framework for reorganizing the 
airline industry; failed to provide for the democratic reform of 
federal institutions and the reform of federal-provincial 
relations through the rebalancing of powers; and therefore, 
having failed to demonstrate the capacity, commitment, and vision 
required to lead this country into the 21st century, has lost the 
confidence of this House and the Canadian people.

chooses and I know how Canadians choose.  We choose the Canadian 
way.

That does not mean that everything is as it can be and must be 
for everyone.  It is not.  There is no room for complacency. 
There is no room for self-satisfaction.  There is a lot of room

make it better for everyone.

society of excellence with a commitment to success, a strong and 
united country, a dynamic economy, a creative and innovative 
population, a diverse and cohesive society where prosperity is 
not limited to the few, but is shared by many.  It is a Canada 
where every child gets the right start in life, where young 
people have a chance to grow and be the best at whatever they 
want to do, where citizens have access to the skills and 
knowledge they need to excel.  It is a Canada where citizens, 
regardless of income, receive quality health services, where 
families enjoy safe communities and a clean environment and where 
we work together with other countries to promote peace, cultural 
diversity and the human purpose and benefits of the new global 
economy.  It is a country, Canada, that is the place to be in the 
21st century, the place where people want to come and stay, to 
learn, to pursue opportunities, to raise children, to enjoy 
natural beauty, to open new frontiers and to set the standard for 
the world for a high quality of life.  It is a Canada that is a 
leader and an example to the world. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, I want to set out a comprehensive strategy that enables 
Canadians and their governments, working together, to turn this 
vision into reality, a comprehensive strategy for leadership in 
the knowledge-based economy and for promoting our interests and 
projecting our values in the world, a strategy that integrates 
the economy, social policy and the environment, a strategy 
faithful to the Canadian way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot do everything.  But that which the national government 
can do, we must do wisely and well. 
We must set ambitious, concrete objectives, and work with 
Canadians to achieve them.  That is what leadership is really 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the government is setting out both five-year 
objectives and concrete steps over the next two years to achieve 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Above all, a strong economy is the indispensable foundation for 
all we can do and all we want to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's economic strategy is clear and comprehensive; 
it is to make Canada a world leader in the next century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we took office six years ago, we had a plan.  We have 
followed our plan.  It is working.  And we will continue to 
follow it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now in a position to build on it by setting ambitious new 
goals and objectives for the next five years. 
We have to build a common vision of how Canada will take on the 
world, and win, in the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to think globally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to brand Canada, at home and abroad, as a dynamic and 
skilled knowledge-based economy.  And we must do these things 
faster than our global competitors, because speed wins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But to compete on an equal footing, we first had to restore the 
country's fiscal health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The era of growing debt and large deficits is now behind us once 
and for all.  The budget will be balanced in each and every year 
through the life of this Parliament and beyond, something that 
we have not seen for generations, for at least 50 years.

we will pay it down.  The debt to GDP ratio will decrease year

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The economy is growing strongly and sustainably.  Canadians are 
more optimistic about the economy and their individual prospects 
today than they have been for a long, long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unemployment is lower than it has been in almost a decade and 
more Canadians are working today than ever before in our history. 
The country is on the right track.  We are very well positioned 
to be a world leader in the new economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of people deserve credit for the economic success of the 
last six years, but no one more than the Minister of Finance.  I 
want to express to him my personal gratitude as Prime Minister, 
the gratitude of his colleagues in caucus and cabinet, and that 
of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the fiscal house in order, with the strong and growing 
economy, we can move forward boldly to implement our economic 
strategy, to strengthen the economic and social fabric of Canada 
and to seize the opportunities of a new century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government, the Prime Minister, the Minister of Finance and 
the Liberal Party have been and are committed to reducing taxes 
as the finance of the nation improves.  We have already started 
and we will carry on.  But lower taxes are not an end in 
themselves.  They are an essential part of an economic strategy 
to provide jobs, growth, rising incomes and a higher quality of 
life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We began targeted tax relief even before the budget was 
balanced.  As soon as the books were balanced the Minister of 
Finance introduced broad based tax relief.  The budgets of 1998 
and 1999 have together cut taxes by $16.5 billion over a three 
year period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a good beginning, but it is only a beginning.  Now we 
will do more in a responsible and sustained way, year after year 
after year.  With continuing improvements in the financial health 
of the nation we will do more to reduce taxes in the years ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the next budget the Minister of Finance will outline a 
multi-year tax reduction strategy to ensure that Canadian 
families have more income in their pockets than they had when we 
started as government, and that Canadian businesses are better 
able to compete in the global knowledge based economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax reduction is only one part of the equation.  A 
comprehensive, balanced economic strategy requires investment, 
public and private, in children, knowledge, creativity, 
innovation, health and the environment.  It also requires 
maintaining flexibility to meet urgent needs such as the problems 
in agriculture today in western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to the Reform Party, this government is helping farmers 
with programs.  It is against that.  I hope people will note 
that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This government committed itself at the beginning of this 
mandate to using 50% of any surplus for tax and debt reduction 
and the other 50% for investment in economic and social needs 
that will increase our quality of life over the long term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a growing Canadian consensus that this is the right 
approach, that this balanced approach is the Canadian way.  In 
August in Quebec City we saw agreement on that from Tory premiers 
from the west and from Atlantic Canada.  The NDP governments were 
there as were Mike Harris and Lucien Bouchard. In fact, Premier 
Harris read from the red book.  He saw that as real common sense 
and that is why he approved of it.  I do not blame him.  I 
applaud him.  He has to like it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our comprehensive strategy to make Canada the place to be in the 
21st century means focusing on children, on knowledge, on youth, 
on health and on the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best place to start is with Canada's children.  If we want 
the brightest future possible for our country, we must ensure 
that all our children have the best possible start in life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our plan for the next two to five years is comprehensive: one, 
increased maternity and parental leave benefits; two, a 
federal-provincial agreement on more supports for early childhood 
development; three, more after tax money in the hands of 
families; four, more family friendly workplaces; five, 
modernization of family law; six, a third significant investment 
in the national child benefit; and seven, strengthened learning 
opportunities through an expanded SchoolNet.  Real support for 
Canadian families in the Canadian way. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me elaborate on three aspects of our strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is now overwhelming scientific evidence that success in a 
child's early years is the key to long term healthy development. 
Nothing is more important than for parents to be able to spend 
the maximum amount of time with newborn children in the critical 
early months of a child's life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I am proud to announce today that the government will 
introduce legislation in this parliament to extend employment 
insurance maternity and parental benefits from the current 
maximum of six months to one full year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will make these benefits more flexible to meet the different needs 
of families.  We will make them more accessible by increasing the 
number of parents eligible for support.  This will be in effect no 
later than January 1, 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Together with the provinces, we have begun to put in place the 
national children's agenda to improve supports for families and 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe this work has to be accelerated. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1720"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provincial premiers think so as well and discussed this last 
summer.  We must move as quickly as possible from talk to 
action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I challenge all governments to have in place by December 
2000 a federal-provincial agreement consistent with the social 
union framework to strengthen community supports for early 
childhood development, an agreement on principles and 
objectives, on measuring outcomes and reporting to Canadians, 
as well as an agreement on a five-year timetable for increased federal 
and provincial funding to achieve our shared objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have demonstrated over the last three years that federal and 
provincial governments can work together to help families with 
children.  The national child benefit is an outstanding example 
of federal-provincial collaboration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must now continue toward our goal that parents will no 
longer have to choose between a job and benefits for their 
children.  Too often, we have seen people turn down jobs because 
they might lose their government benefits. 
Under the system we have introduced, in collaboration with 
provincial governments, people are motivated to keep their job 
because they are not penalized for working, as they were in the 
past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will therefore—and this is very important—make a third 
significant investment in the national child benefit for low 
income families with children, to be in place no later than July 
1, 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And we will seek a commitment from the provinces, who have all 
asked for this further federal contribution, to build on our 
investment by increasing their own investments in early 
childhood development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many years ago, Canadians and their governments, Liberal 
governments, I may add, of my predecessors, Mr. Pearson and Mr. 
Trudeau, committed themselves to a bold and noble objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a country as prosperous as ours, senior Canadians should not 
be denied the security and dignity of an income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We did not build our system of old age security and public 
pensions overnight.  But we focused on our goal and, by and 
large, we succeeded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us today make another ambitious commitment, this time a 
commitment to take the action necessary as a country, all levels 
of government working in partnership together with communities 
and the voluntary sector, so that every Canadian child can have 
the best possible start in life. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of world will these children live in?  Well, we can 
see it already.  And we can also see how they will succeed.  We 
enter a new century at a time of rapid change, the scope and 
speed of which the world has never seen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a Canadian, Marshall McCluhan, who coined the phrase 
“global village”.  Our researchers no longer compete with each 
other; they are in competition every day with the whole world. 
Our industries no longer compete locally; they compete globally. 
Globalization and technology have redefined the concept of the 
marketplace.  This has a major implication for public policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To seize the opportunities of the new knowledge based economy 
requires a comprehensive and ambitious strategy.  We have begun 
this in the last six years.

investments, if we create the right partnerships and if we work 
together as a country, not only will we keep the best and the 
brightest in Canada, but we will attract the best and the 
brightest from around the world to Canada.  And we will give more 
people in Canada the chance to become the best and the brightest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The knowledge based industries which will provide the jobs of 
the future require access to a diverse range of skills close at 
hand to support them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is much easier for a large country like the United States 
to achieve than it is for a relatively small country like Canada. 
If we want to attract the investment Canada needs, we have to 
establish a type of critical mass and we can only do it through 
collaboration between governments, our universities, research 
institutions and the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today our challenge as a country is to create a climate of 
opportunity for our graduate students and our graduates and to 
provide exciting opportunities for Canadian researchers and to 
attract the best academic researchers in the world to Canadian 
universities, and to do so at a time when worldwide competition 
for them has never been so fierce.  And particularly at a time 
when United States universities benefit from both permanent 
endowments and the generosity of private foundations out of all 
proportion to those of our universities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the years through the granting councils, the Medical 
Research Council, the Social Sciences and Humanities Research 
Council and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research 
Council, the Government of Canada has been far and away the 
largest contributor to university research in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years the granting councils have contributed to the 
pursuit of excellence by creating and supporting hundreds of 
research chairs in our universities.  They are now prepared to 
build on what they have already begun.

Innovation, working with some university presidents, in 
particular Dr. Robert Lacroix, the rector of the Université de 
Montréal, and Dr. Martha Piper, the president of UBC, have come 
to the government with an exciting and ambitious proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They want to build on existing partnerships between our 
universities, the granting councils and the Canada Foundation for 
Innovation, to brand Canada around the world as the place to be 
for knowledge creation as we enter the 21st century, to enable 
Canadian universities to create outstanding research 
opportunities for the best and brightest Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They want to make Canada a place where Canadian students and 
graduates want to be, and to attract the global research stars of 
today and the future research stars of tomorrow, to attract to 
Canada some of the world's best minds from other countries and to 
create an environment to produce Canadian Nobel prize winners in 
the future.  It is a plan for brain gain, not brain drain.

as soon as possible thereafter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a plan I welcome and we welcome on this side of the House. 
It is a plan for excellence and international competitiveness 
which the government endorses enthusiastically.  We will provide 
the required funding to the granting councils and the Canada 
Foundation for Innovation.  This investment in our granting 
councils to promote research and the quest for excellence will 
truly make Canada a leader in the knowledge based economy and 
will truly brand Canada as a country that values excellence and 
is committed to success, a country that is the place to be in the 
21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not all.  We will introduce legislation in the next few 
weeks to create the Canadian institutes of health research to 
ensure that Canada stays in the forefront of health research, to 
create a more integrated system of health related research than

for the global economy of the 21st century.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This afternoon I have spoken about the country that we are so 
proud of, the country that we have built so well in the 20th 
century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I have set out a comprehensive strategy for Canadian 
leadership in the knowledge-based economy and for promoting our 
interests and projecting our values in the world, a vision for 
the Canada of the 21st century and a plan to achieve it, a 
vision of the Canadian model, a modern project of a society, the 
project of a forward-looking country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are not old solutions to the problems of today, but new 
plans to meet new opportunities. 
It is a strategy to ensure that the opportunities of all of Canada are 
available to all Canadians; a strategy to ensure that Canadians 
shape their future in the Canadian way; 
a strategy for people, for opportunity, for excellence, for 
success, for a high quality of life, for sharing, dignity and 
mutual respect, for creativity and innovation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a realistic strategy for a realistic country, a caring 
strategy for a caring country, a modern strategy for a modern 
country, an ambitious strategy for an ambitious country and a 
bold strategy for a bold country.  It is a strategy for the 
future for a country of the future, a country that is open to the 
world and willing to lead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are not a boastful people.  We are not given to flag 
waving or emotional excesses.  In a century, indeed in a 
millennium, that has seen so much bloodshed over differences of 
faith, race and nationality, perhaps that is a good thing. 
Instead, with quiet confidence we have adopted a Canadian way of 
living together, resolving differences, reasoning together and 
creating what is quite simply the best country in the world in 
which to live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I began today by referring to the famous remark of Sir Wilfrid 
Laurier about the 20th century belonging to Canada.  I do not 
know if the 21st century will belong to Canada, but I do know 
something even more important:  Canada belongs to the 21st 
century and Canada will be the place to be in the 21st century. 
The world has seen the future and it is Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, some 
weeks ago, the throne speech was being touted as the opportunity 
for the Prime Minister to demonstrate a vision of Canada for the 
21st century, as we enter a new millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a pretty unsubstantial vision: what it treats us to is 
more of an invasion by the federal government into areas of 
provincial jurisdiction.  Instead of a vision, we have an 
invasion.  For Quebec this throne speech is fraught with meaning 
and with consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So much for Plan A, if ever there was such a thing as Plan A. 
Bad news for the Quebec federalists, moreover.  This prime 
ministerial vision of the future is one of a Canada that 
excludes Quebec, that thumbs its nose at Quebec's concerns and 
traditional demands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister is now putting into practice his famous 
statement made just before the last election in Quebec “The 
general store is now closed”.  With this throne speech, the 
federal government is slamming the door closed on all the 
commitments toward Quebec that were made leading up to the 1995 
referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a message for all Quebec federalists in this 
speech: this is the end of renewed federalism, of Quebec's 
traditional demands, this is the end of the concept of founding 
people, of distinct character, all those formulas that were 
found in an attempt to renew Canadian federalism.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>From now on everything is clear: one country, one people, one 
government.  All the rest is nothing but public administration, 
nothing more than public administration and the implementation of 
a social union, an agreement that once again  excludes Quebec. 
All political parties in the National Assembly have rejected the 
social union framework agreement.  Mr. Dumont and Mr. Charest 
have made it clear that they would not have signed it either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the throne speech, the federal government indicated both its 
intention to work in collaboration with its partners and its 
intention to do without their approval.  Where exactly does this 
leave us? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer is blatantly obvious when we read the Speech from the 
Throne.  Let me quote an extract from it from page 5.  The 
speech talks of national will, of national strategies and of the 
partnerships across the country that are required.  That are 
required—that is the word, the essence of the Speech from the 
Throne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How will federal government go about achieving this?  It tells 
us that it is going to establish standards of its choosing, 
since it is omnipotent.  The government talks about operating on 
the basis of the social union agreement.  What does this 
agreement on social union say?  There is discussion, but if no 
agreement is reached, the federal government—Ottawa knows best— 
announces three months in advance that it will intervene in 
areas of provincial jurisdiction where direct services are 
provided to the public, and the provinces are requested to take 
note.  This is what Ottawa calls partnerships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In what areas will it impose its standards and set up its 
programs?  National defence or the Royal Canadian Mounted Police 
or air transportation come to mind.  There is no shortage of 
problems in these sectors, which are under federal jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government could ensure pay equity in its own public 
service or correct the huge injustices caused by the employment 
insurance reform, which is nothing more than government robbery 
on the backs of society's most disadvantaged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, it is in areas of provincial jurisdiction that it 
intends to impose its standards.  For example, in family law; in 
family policy or in policy on childhood; in the area of culture; 
in the area of language, especially language of work. 
In fact, this afternoon the Prime Minister could not deny that, 
under the social union and the unjustified barriers to mobility, 
he could take action regarding Bill 101, regarding the language 
of work in Quebec. This is serious stuff. It jeopardizes a vital 
prerogative in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister also talks about getting involved in Quebec's 
environmental sector, as if his government had lived up to its 
commitments in its own jurisdictions, including air pollution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government talks about justice. It claims that it will 
reform family law. Does it intend to tamper with the Civil Code, 
which is the foundation of the Quebec law and an exclusive 
Quebec jurisdiction, as was the case even before the 
Constitution, in 1867? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On page 23, the government reiterates its intention to impose a 
repressive act on young offenders, an act that no one in Quebec 
wants. 
The government is prepared to sacrifice the future of hundreds 
of young Quebecers to gain a few votes in western Canada. This 
issue does not fall under its jurisdiction. The government could 
have acted through the Criminal Code, it could have taken action 
against organized crime, which is corrupting our young people 
and our economic institutions, both in Quebec and across the 
country, which is going after farmers, and which has even 
targeted my colleague from Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot. It could have 
tabled anti-gang legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But there is not one word about the fight against criminals. 
Yet, in order to get some votes in western Canada, the 
government does not hesitate to jeopardize Quebec's 
rehabilitation program for young offenders. This is an 
unacceptable, shameful and cowardly attitude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government also talks about families and young children. 
It now wants to help families and children after having 
drastically cut employment insurance, health, education and 
income support. The government wants to impose, and I am quoting 
from page 7, “common principles, objectives and fiscal 
parameters for all governments”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is so arrogant that it is trying to impose 
policy by stating that the provinces, and Quebec is in the 
forefront with its exemplary policies on daycare and early 
childhood, will be able to provide additional services in their 
own areas of jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It takes no little arrogance, indeed a lot of it, to say that 
the provinces will nevertheless be entitled, in their fields of 
jurisdiction, to propose policy that is complementary to that 
decided here in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the cultural sector, the federal government mentions Quebec 
only once. We will see later on that it is in order to threaten 
it.  Otherwise, nothing. 
As if Quebec and Quebec culture did not exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has announced a whole series of new 
cultural programs, but it is also promising an approach that it 
calls encompassing for national unity.  We know what that 
means.  It means submitting cultural institutions and programs 
to propaganda on national unity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will, I imagine, ask book publishers receiving a 
subsidy from the federal government to put the maple leaf on the 
first page and the last page and why not on the theatre 
curtains. The maple leaf could appear after the first act even. 
That is totally crazy, but I know just how much that inspires 
the Minister of Canadian Heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government talks about the environment as well.  However, 
this government's performance in this area is disastrous. 
It has failed to achieve the very modest objectives it set for 
itself in Kyoto.  It refuses to sign the protocol on 
biodiversity that 140 countries have already signed.  So much 
for the federal government's jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is it doing?  Well, once again in the provinces' 
jurisdictions it will try to impose bills and programs on 
endangered species and habitats, two areas under provincial 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government, from one end of the speech to the other, is 
ignoring the existence of Quebec and making a mockery of its 
powers.  A head-on collision is in the works.  Plan A is not just 
being ended, it is being buried. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I speak of head-on collision, I refer particularly to the 
area of education.  Naturally, nowhere in the text of the speech 
does the word education appear.  I am sure the thesaurus 
was well used in the writing of this text. 
It mentions knowledge, skills, learning, training, but this is 
not education. Of course not. Everyone knows that.  It probably 
refers to agriculture when using those terms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ottawa is therefore announcing a national plan related to skills 
and learning for the 21st century, with a one-stop entry point, 
one marked “made in Ottawa”. This means that Ottawa 
is announcing no more and no less than a national policy for 
education, a provincial area of jurisdiction if ever there was 
one, one that has been recognized as exclusive to them since 
this country began back in 1867. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A vision of the future?  More of a systematic invasion plan into 
areas of provincial jurisdiction, with or without the provinces' 
consent.  This means the end of Plan A, but it gives a good idea 
of what Plan B will or may be, thus leaving Quebec with the sword 
of Damocles hanging over its head. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is of course reference to the referendum process, to rules 
of clarity. 
As far as the rule of 50% plus one is concerned, which is a 
democratic rule recognized even here in Canada, it seems to me 
that this ought to be clear.  There cannot be two rules, one for 
Newfoundland, where it was 50% plus one, and where the outcome 
was just a touch above 52% after two referendums, and another 
rule for Quebec in a third referendum, whereas in the first two, 
where the federal government was involved, it was 50% plus one. 
It is a pretty strange game when one player wants to change the 
rules partway through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the matter of the referendum question itself, that is a 
prerogative of the National Assembly.  I would remind you that, 
right before the last referendum, the Prime Minister himself 
said “The question is clear.  If you vote no, you stay in 
Canada. 
Vote yes, and you leave Canada.”  I would submit that if the 
Prime Minister understood it, then everybody understood it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, as far as plan B is concerned, although I am not 
sure that is what it should be called since there is no longer a 
Plan A, I would say that the government ought to start by 
applying to itself the clarity it demands of others.

<A HREF="#LINKT48"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will have to tell us clearly whether it intends to honour a 
majority that is democratic and recognized by the people of 
Quebec in a referendum and whether it intends to negotiate with 
Quebec, as the supreme court requires it to do, the terms of its 
departure from the federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenged the government to state clearly what place Quebec 
has in this country called Canada, where the government talks of 
the quality of life of Canadians, as in the throne speech. 
At a time when Canada is enjoying one of the largest surpluses 
in a number of generations, according to the Prime Minister 
himself, nothing has been announced to lighten the tax burden of 
Canadians and Quebecers, particularly that of middle class 
families, which represent 27% of the population and pay 50% of 
what goes to Revenue Canada. There is a significant imbalance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech from the Throne should have served as the 
government's opportunity to make a solemn commitment in this 
regard.  However, we got simply a vague promise that there may 
be something in the upcoming budget without anything 
specific being indicated.  So it is very vague, wishful 
thinking, general remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were promised vision, we got repetition, and especially no 
specific action in order to ensure and develop Canadians' 
quality of life. 
This theme of the Canadians' quality of life appears as a 
leitmotif throughout the throne speech, as if it only needed 
repeating in order to convince Canadians and Quebecers that they 
live in the best country in the world, as the Prime Minister 
puts it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about the quality of life of Canadians.  Quality of 
life involves, first, direct services to the public, primarily in 
health and education.  It also includes income support.  In this 
area, the provinces provide the services to the public.  And 
herein lies the contradiction in this country of Canada in 
which, on the one hand, those who provide direct services to the 
public do not have the means to do so and, on the other, the 
government that does not provide these direct services has all 
the money in its pockets.  Herein lies the contradiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One would expect the government, which will have cut $33 billion 
between 1994 and 2004, to restore transfer payments to the 
provinces, precisely to improve health and education services. 
Yet, there is not a word about this in the throne speech. The 
only thing one sees is the old Liberal habit of getting involved 
in provincial jurisdictions as soon as they have money. The 
government is now promising a pharmacare plan, something which 
already exists in Quebec, homecare and help for families and 
young children, instead of giving back the money to those who 
provide the direct services to help them fulfil their 
responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is collecting too much money, given its 
own jurisdictions. It is the provinces that are responsible for 
the programs whose costs are skyrocketing, primarily because the 
population is aging. The federal government does not provide 
these direct services to the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is more than an imbalance, it is a profound injustice, a 
major dysfunction in the federal system. This imbalance leads 
the federal government to establish new programs to gain greater 
political visibility. This is the whole issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals see the federal government as the major league. To 
them, the provinces are mere junior partners they consult when 
they see fit to do so and on whom they impose their will, with 
money taken from the citizens of those provinces, and often from 
budgets that should have been given to these provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, the federal government is not proposing 
anything to correct the major flaws in employment insurance. 
Indeed, 60% of those who contribute to the program are not 
eligible for benefits if they become unemployed. This is highway 
robbery. 
An insurance agent who behaved like the Prime Minister and the 
Minister of Human Resources Development would be taken to court 
and at risk of being sent to jail.  This is fraud, no more and 
no less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People were expecting tax cuts for middle income families. 
Nothing, once again.  Nothing about re-establishing transfer 
payments. They talk of poor children.  Tears are shed about the 
fate of the poor children.  Might people not realize that there 
are far more poor children since this government has been in 
power?  Are people going to finally realize that, if there are 
poor children, it is perhaps because they have poor parents, and 
the parents are poor as a result of this government's policies? 
That is why there are poor children.  It seems to me this is 
easy to understand.  Perhaps there would be less visibility but 
greater responsibility.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at problems of immediate concern to the government, 
for instance air transportation.  At the present time, there are 
between 5,000 and 10,000 jobs at stake, in Quebec in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the buddy-buddy relationship between certain members of 
government and the main stakeholders in this matter have 
anything to do with this? According to the Minister of Transport 
himself, this afternoon, this is a highly important question, 
one he described as too important to be in a throne speech.  I 
imagine he took a page from the book of Kim Campbell, she who 
did not want to discuss important issues during the 1993 
election campaign.  Too important to discuss—better to discuss 
such things behind closed doors at fundraising dinners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing about shipbuilding either, yet the Bloc 
Quebecois had made some proposals, supported by the other three 
opposition parties, for a serious and rigorous shipbuilding 
policy.  On the other side they are constantly boasting about 
this country reaching from sea to sea to sea—three oceans but no 
shipbuilding policy.  They do not have much imagination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of the premiers who met together in Quebec City last August 
supported the shipbuilding policy we proposed.  Yet there is no 
reference to it in this Speech from the Throne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And what about the situation of aboriginal people and the 
fisheries issue?  There is a mess in both cases, and now the two 
messes are combining into one big one.  There is a major crisis 
and even if one reads this speech from start to finish, there is 
nothing to be found about this problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am thinking of mobility, —because we heard about mobility for 
citizens and students, —and because we are required to eliminate 
unjustified barriers to that mobility.  This afternoon the 
Prime Minister was asked whether this meant that the federal 
government could intervene—because Ottawa knows best—in disputes 
such as the one between the construction industries of Ontario 
and Quebec.  He left the door open.  Can we expect to see the 
federal government blunder into this sector? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And can we expect it to meddle in the loans and scholarships 
issue?  We were told that someone should look into all the 
people from Vancouver who go to Montreal, and all the people 
from Montreal who go to Vancouver. Come on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for language of work, is Bill 101 a barrier to mobility? 
Your guess is as good as ours.  It is to weep. 
I knew that the ambassadors have their little question and 
answer books, but now the Prime Minister and his ministers will 
be able to spread the good word throughout the country.  It 
could go something like this:  Where is Ottawa?  Ottawa is 
everywhere.  Why is Ottawa everywhere?  Because it has money. 
Why does Ottawa have money?  Because it made extensive cuts. 
What does Ottawa do with its money?  It does wonderful things 
and establishes new programs everywhere in order to enhance its 
visibility.  This sounds silly, but it gives the idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, this government has too much money for its areas of 
jurisdiction, views the provinces as mere intendants, and denies 
the existence of the Quebec culture and people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I move: 
<A NAME="LINK154">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the amendment be amended by adding, between the words 
“powers” and “; and therefore”, the 
following: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“, especially by failing to recognize the existence of the Quebec people; 
failed to carry out its responsibilities in the 
area of social welfare by not re-establishing transfer payments for 
programs relating to healthcare, postsecondary 
education and social assistance, while maintaining an inequitable and 
unjust employment insurance scheme”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
occurs to me that this afternoon's speech by the Prime Minister 
is one of the more revealing deathbed repentances I have ever 
witnessed in my 20 years in political life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After so many years of the federal Liberal government tearing 
down, backing away from commitments and creating crises for many 
Canadians and many Canadian communities, what we heard from the 
Prime Minister this afternoon was potentially very good news, and 
I say that quite sincerely.  It is also a reminder of why it 
serves Canadians well to have sufficient numbers of New Democrats 
back in parliament to be able to push back against that reform 
dominance of the federal Liberal government's efforts over the 
last six years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that very positive note I welcome the opportunity to enter 
the debate this afternoon on the throne speech that we heard 
yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech is an important opportunity for members of 
parliament to speak about their own constituencies.  I will say a 
few words about my constituency of Halifax that I am privileged 
to represent in parliament.  A portion of that constituency has 
been responsible for electing and re-electing me to public office 
for almost 20 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am immensely grateful for the privilege my constituents have 
bestowed upon me and for the trust they have placed in me.  I 
take that trust very seriously.  I believe that it is my 
responsibility to gain and regain that trust each and every day I 
have the privilege to remain in office and to serve as their 
representative in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech offers members an opportunity to note some of 
the particular contributions one's constituents have made to 
one's community and province.  I will say a few words this 
afternoon about the sadness I feel, and I know the great sadness 
that many Canadians feel, about the recent deaths over the last 
10 days of three very distinguished Canadians, Nova Scotians who 
have contributed enormously to the life of my province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One was the long serving conductor of the Atlantic Symphony and 
more recently the Nova Scotia Symphony, Georg Tintner.  He was a 
marvellous man who came to Canada as a refugee.  He created joy 
and harmony in the community through the music that he 
contributed and through a wonderful philosophy on life.  He was 
truly a leader who provided inspiration to all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I was very saddened to learn yesterday of the death of 
Reverend Donald Skeir, a leader in Nova Scotia and particularly 
on behalf of black Nova Scotians for over 40 years.  He was 
someone whom I had the privilege of knowing personally and of 
observing his terrific commitment to creating harmonious race 
relations and advancing the status of black Nova Scotians.  He 
will be sorely missed, but he has left a great legacy for all 
Nova Scotians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, I was very saddened this morning to open my newspaper and 
find that Lee Creemo had passed away on the weekend as well. 
He will be known certainly to Nova Scotians who serve with me 
here in the House of Commons as a great Cape Bretoner, a 
wonderful Mi'kmaw who also provided music that will long be 
remembered.  He was a fiddler, a champion in Canada and 
internationally.  He will be missed sorely.  I want to express my 
condolences to his family and to his community of Eskasoni.

have been several highlights in my past year. I will long 
remember them as among the most inspirational in my 20 years of 
political life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have many things that we are privileged to participate in as 
members of parliament in our own communities and across the 
country.  For me it was a privilege that I will never forget to 
have been present in Nunavut on April 1, 1999 for the official 
launching of the newest member of the Canadian family, the 
territory of Nunavut.  I was accompanied by my colleague from 
Churchill River who had many friendships and relationships over 
the years with some of those I had the privilege to meet while in 
Nunavut on that special occasion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it was one of the happiest and most promising things 
that happened in the past year.  It really is a testament to the 
many years of patient, persistent struggle by Inuit Canadians in 
working toward a dream that would not only provide for some 
reconciliation after literally centuries, of 400 years of 
exploitation and hardship, but would serve as a model of what 
people can achieve if they come together, if they work together 
toward a dream that they share.  It was indeed a privilege for me 
to be in attendance at that very exciting event. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make mention of an event that took place on Canada Day 
in my riding of Halifax.  That was the official opening of Pier 
21.  Pier 21 will be known to many members of the House and 
certainly to millions of Canadians as the point of entry for over 
one million immigrants, many of them refugees, to Canada between 
the years of 1921 and 1973.  My colleague from Sackville—Eastern 
Shore is a member of one of the immigrant families that came 
through Pier 21. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That occasion was a wonderful celebration of the contributions 
immigrant Canadians have made to Canadian society over not just 
that period of 52 years during which many immigrants and refugees 
came through the Halifax harbour, but the past, present and 
continuing contributions of the millions of immigrants and 
refugees who have come to Canada throughout all of our history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pier 21 is a very important living, breathing memorial to the 
contribution immigrants have made.  It is a very timely reminder 
of that important immigrant history and that reality in Canada at 
a time when there have been some very unhappy sentiments aroused 
and fears generated around the arrival of Chinese refugees on our 
shores over the last several months. We have seen less than a 
welcoming, compassionate response to the plight of many of those 
people who in some cases are young children who have been 
exploited by a criminal element for reasons of profiteering.  We 
need to be very much on guard against the kind of fearmongering 
that has been generated toward many of those exploited and 
desperate people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I want to speak about a more recent event, the 
installation of Canada's newest Governor General on October 7, 
1999.  If I am honest about it, I attended that event without any 
terrific expectations.  I attended it because that is one of the 
things one does as a member of parliament. 
I want to take this occasion to say that I found it to be a 
tremendously inspirational event.  I believe the speech delivered 
by Canada's newest Governor General on that occasion was a great 
moment for Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What we saw in the vision put forward by Canada's newest 
Governor General was one that will be long remembered. We would 
all do well to keep in mind the very powerful message she 
delivered about how there are two kinds of societies in this 
world, forgiving societies and punishing societies.  She urged 
that Canada always remain and continue to strive to be a 
forgiving society in every sense of the word. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It brought to mind a similar image that I have always carried 
with me.  Stanley Knowles used to express it when he talked about 
how one can accomplish much more with an open hand than with a 
closed fist.  I think it is the same concept.  Sometimes we do 
not build enough on those positive images as we try to go about 
dealing with the major challenges we face in contemporary 
political life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It struck me that it was somewhat ironic, in a way a sad irony, 
but also a telling disappointment that a woman who came to Canada 
as a refugee, who has never held political office in this country 
and who has never to my knowledge sought political office 
nevertheless was able to put forward in her speech to Canadians 
last week a more compelling vision for the future of Canada, a 
more profound appreciation of Canadian history and Canadian 
culture and a better grasp of the challenges that we face in this 
country today than the current Prime Minister who has actually 
held office for over 30 years, and the current government that by 
my calculation has actually been in power in the country for 63 
years during this century. One has to wonder what that says about 
the current government and the lack of leadership we have seen 
from the government over the six years since it was elected to 
office in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I spoke in the address in reply to the Speech from the 
Throne on my first occasion in this House in 1997, I quoted from 
one of my favourite passages and one of my favourite authors and 
also a very accomplished actress, Anne-Marie MacDonald.  She is 
best known perhaps for her epic novel <I>Fall on Your Knees</I>. 
Like all good literary references, I will again quote briefly 
from that book because it bears repeating: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing so congenial to lucid thought as a clear view 
of the sea:  it airs the mind, tunes the nerves, scours the soul. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a maritimer there is no question that references to the 
ocean, to the seaside, to our marine heritage are always very 
positive, particularly when one comes from a riding where so much 
of the way of life depends on our proximity to the ocean. There 
is shipbuilding, shipping, our naval history, marine related 
industries and so on, and of course fishing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It occurred to me that maybe part of the problem with the lack 
of vision from the government and the Prime Minister is the fact 
that he spends too much time on landlocked golf courses and not 
enough time beside the sea where he could gain the kind of 
inspiration that is very much needed today in public office.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, the Prime Minister has made it clear that he 
intends to remain at the helm.  Some of his colleagues would say 
it would appear to be forever.  It is certainly creating some 
difficulties and some manoeuvring below decks among his 
colleagues.  But he has made it clear that he wants to continue 
to be at the helm.  It is becoming something of a long running 
soap opera, not to be outdone by the continuing national soap 
opera between the Reform Party and the Conservative Party in 
trying to decide whether they want to be a divided alternative, a 
united alterative, or split off in three different directions. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister wants to remain at the helm, but he is a bad 
captain. He has no vision and no idea of which direction to 
take. Consequently, he relies on pollsters and uses taxpayers' 
money to determine Canada's destinations for the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, even with the range of destinations identified by 
pollsters and hoped for by Canadians, the Prime Minister and his 
Liberal crew are unable to safely take Canadians there, as they 
have demonstrated in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seven years ago, the Liberals told Canadians “Put us at the helm 
and we will set the course”, a course which was supposed to lead 
to the abolition of the GST. Not only have we not arrived at our 
destination, but Canadians continue to pay this charge, which is 
particularly unfair to the poor. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 Canadians were told that if they put Liberals at the 
helm, they would launch a national child care program.  They said 
that they would add new child care spaces, 50,000 new child care 
spaces for every year in which economic growth exceeded 3%.  In 
three out of four of the subsequent years, economic growth has 
attained or exceeded 3% yet we do not have one single solitary 
additional child care space as a result of the initiatives of the 
federal government.  The result is that hundreds of thousands of 
children and their families remain stranded when it comes to 
access to affordable, safe and quality child care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were promised that we were on our way to home care so that 
families could care for their loved ones.  We were promised that 
we were on our way to pharmacare so that families without drug 
plans could cope with inflated prescription drug costs.  That 
ship has not even set sail.  No wonder Canadians do not believe 
that Liberals can be trusted to keep their promises that have 
been set out in the throne speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberals pretend to care about our children.  They talk in the 
throne speech about the importance of the early years of a 
child's life, to his or her own well-being.  I want to say that 
we welcome the Prime Minister's announcement this afternoon of 
extending parental leave and maternity benefits.  I congratulate 
my colleagues from Bras d'Or—Cape Breton and Acadie—Bathurst 
for having worked strenuously to achieve that kind of commitment 
from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is what has the government actually done about 
children who are living in grinding poverty in this country? 
There were close to one million children living in poverty 
already when this Prime Minister came to office.  What has the 
government done?  It has added 500,000 more children to the ranks 
of poverty in Canada.  When did the Liberal government decide 
that 1.5 million poor kids do not count in this country? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech shows clearly that the Liberal government has 
no intention of acting to help our young people gain access to 
the higher education they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals' laissez-faire attitude means more debt for our 
young people and more profits for the banks that finance their 
education.

people? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government pretends that it wants to help Canadians flourish 
in a dynamic economy.  Yet there is not one single solitary 
mention in the throne speech about the greatest crisis in farm 
income, the worse agricultural crisis experienced in the country 
since the Great Depression.  When did the government decide that 
farm children and farm communities did not count? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was not a word in the throne speech about the upheaval in 
families and communities in Cape Breton that are facing the 
shutdown of the coal mining industry or those who are facing 
uncertain futures in the steel industry.  When did the government 
decide that the families in those communities do not count? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government pretends that it cares about Canada's physical 
infrastructure.  Yet we are experiencing a severe crisis with 
respect to the future of our airline industry.  The government 
has decided to abandon any leadership.  It has decided to allow 
the shareholders to determine absolutely the future of our 
airline industry.  It has shown no leadership to bring together 
the other stakeholders in our airline industry: the travelling 
public, airline employees, and small and remote communities that 
need the assurance of continued service.

continuing a bit longer.  We have just a few more minutes and I

so.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to pose a question to my leader, the member 
for Halifax, pertaining to the very difficult economic situation 
facing many families and communities everywhere in the country. I 
would like to ask the member to respond to what is in the Speech 
from the Throne for that situation and what solutions she sees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think we have already 
heard that a number of Canadian families have been completely 
ignored by the government.  Let me speak about the complete lack 
of leadership by the government with respect to those who do not 
have a family with whom they can find a home, with whom they are 
able to live, the homeless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have watched the government completely abandon any 
responsibility to put in place a national housing strategy, the 
only industrial nation in the world which does not have a 
national housing strategy.  When did the government decide that 
the homeless did not count? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government pretends that it cares about aboriginal families. 
Yet we have seen the government virtually turn its back on many 
of the most important recommendations of the Royal Commission on 
Aboriginal People. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most important principles of the recommendations in 
that commission's report was that treaty rights should be 
negotiated, not litigated.  Yet it is the lack of leadership by 
the government which has driven many aboriginal people into the 
courts to seek justice and to seek their rights.  The result is 
that many tensions have been created by a government absolutely 
not prepared to provide any leadership in dealing with the 
inevitability of finally addressing treaty rights long overdue 
and disregarded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Later this evening we are to have a take note debate on some of 
the tensions created in the fishery industry.  Again it is 
important to note that the Union of Nova Scotia Indians began to 
provide leadership six months ago on April 29 around the failure 
of the federal government to address what kinds of tensions would 
be created by a favourable decision on the Marshall case when it 
came before the supreme court.  We now have to repair the damage 
done by that lack of leadership.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many other areas in which the government has 
disregarded its responsibility to provide leadership.  The 
government says that it cares about the environment all of a 
sudden, and thank goodness it is back on the agenda.  However, 
let me say that it is very difficult for Canadians to be 
confident that the government will deliver on any new commitments 
to the environment when it has done nothing to put an end to the 
export of our most precious resource, our water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has done nothing to address the concerns of communities in 
Ontario in speaking out against the importation of MOx plutonium, 
MOx fuel, with all the implications both short term and long term 
that holds for damage to our environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having gutted the most important provisions and improvements to 
the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, Canadians are 
wondering how they can trust the government to make a priority of 
the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I wrap up I want to make one further brief mention of the 
complete absence in the Speech from the Throne of any commitment 
to meaningful electoral reform or parliamentary reform.  The 
government knows and understands how serious it is in a democracy 
to have more and more cynicism toward politics, more and more 
people feeling that their vote does not count and they cannot 
hear their voice in parliament.  It is a privilege to live in a 
democracy.  We understand that politics is the lifeblood of a 
free and democratic society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democratic Party absolutely believes in the importance 
of modernizing our electoral processes and our democratic 
institutions to ensure that they remain responsive, effective and 
accountable.  The federal Liberal government has delivered many 
promises in its Speech from the Throne, but Canadians can be 
forgiven for not trusting the Liberals to deliver on those 
promises because of their dismal record of not doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues and I will use every opportunity available to us 
inside and outside of parliament to act on the concerns of 
ordinary Canadians to push the government to address the concerns 
of working people because we believe in a responsive, positive 
and proactive role for government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe in a vision for 21st century Canada which includes 
the notion of political leadership not just by the federal 
government but by all levels of government working in effective 
partnerships with the private sector, the non-profit and 
co-operative sector, labour representatives, and primary 
producers for something that is bigger than ourselves.  That is 
the legacy of my party's contribution to Canada.  That is what 
inspired each and every one of my colleagues to seek public 
office and to represent our constituents and our communities as 
New Democrats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, that is what will inspire our every move as we go 
about our work on behalf of our constituents.  As Tommy Douglas 
once said, it is never too late to build a better world.  Let us 
get on with the task of working together on behalf of all 
constituents to build a better Canada and a better world as we go 
into the 21st century.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan—Coquihalla, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I listened with interest to the leader of the New Democratic 
Party in her response to the throne speech.  I would like to ask 
one brief question.  We heard the leader of the NDP talk about 
the programs and the spending which the federal government plans 
to undertake. 
We also heard of some programs that she and her party would like 
to see added to that list.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Exactly how much higher would the leader of the New Democratic 
Party like to see Canadian taxes go? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is a very 
unhelpful question which breeds much cynicism toward politics in 
a lot of Canadians who look at what goes on in parliament today 
with some distress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say very clearly that we believe the federal government 
or any government has a responsibility to act in a fiscally 
responsible manner.  It is very difficult for the vast majority 
of Canadians to understand how the party the member represents 
can on one hand say that it is committed to reinvesting in health 
care and to ensuring that the agricultural crisis which many 
families and communities are experiencing are addressed with 
public dollars.  On the other hand, that party talks about the 
kind of across the board tax cuts which would give millions and 
millions of dollars to the wealthy and absolutely nothing, or 
pennies, to those who need assistance most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the Reform Party stands for.  That is why my party 
is very happy to be here with sufficient force to stand and not 
only push against the Reform Party agenda but finally begin to 
push the Liberal Party back toward a more responsible stand on 
some of these issues than the dominance it has had over its 
actions over last six years. 
<P><A NAME="LINK158"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I begin on a congratulatory note.  I extend my 
congratulations to all previous speakers and leaders.  I also 
extend congratulations on behalf of the party to the new governor 
general, Madam Adrienne Clarkson, and offer our best wishes to 
the outgoing governor general, Mr. LeBlanc.  Some congratulations 
are also in order with respect to the Speech from the Throne 
which broadly and vaguely stated the government's willingness to 
look to the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is necessary to compliment the Liberal government for finally 
recognizing that the modern economy exists, for showing an 
awareness for the next century and for spending some time in the 
throne speech telling Canadians that new technologies will play a 
larger role in all our lives.  These are penetrating statements 
of the obvious, yet it marks a shift in simply following the 
policies of a previous Conservative government and reaping the 
benefit of those visionary initiatives. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are on the verge of the 21st century; that is an undeniable 
fact.  The Liberals acknowledge it, and that is encouraging. 
They may have taken six years to do so, but finally the 
government has taken the risk of stating that the country is in 
a period of transition and that there are a number of challenges 
ahead on the horizon.  Yet there is nothing in the Speech from 
the Throne that helps Canadians understand the direction in 
which the Liberals wish to steer Canada.  Nothing in the throne 
speech assures Canadians that the country is going in the right 
direction.  The Speech from the Throne says nothing about all 
the complicated workings of governmental affairs. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I compliment the government for making a grand gesture to the 
Canadian public yesterday, a gesture that exhibited supreme 
confidence in the future of the country and the ability of 
Canadians to respond to future challenges.  Unfortunately it was 
an empty and shallow gesture, one which offered no vision and no 
leadership.  This was not a blueprint of where the country is 
headed.  It was a pencil sketch or connect the dots.  Sadly it 
showed a government with no ideas, no focus and no sense of how 
we move the country forward, only vague notions of what the 
future might look like. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want some serious issues addressed, issues like 
increasing the tax burden, the agricultural crisis in western 
Canada, the issue of immigration, or the consequences of a 
hostile takeover resulting in a single national airline.  Those 
looking for these issues to be addressed in the throne speech 
were sadly disappointed.

words like knowledge economy, building a higher quality of life, 
technology and advancing Canada's place in the world.  These are 
all important issues that this parliament will have to address, 
but beyond the catch phrases themselves there was nothing, 
nothing new and nothing that explains the purpose of the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is disheartening to see over the course of several months 
that the federal government failed to prepare itself for this new 
parliament, even with the three-week delay in the opening.  It 
failed to meet the demands of Canadians for a responsible 
government and for the delivery of a vigorous new plan for this 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has also failed to anticipate the Supreme Court decision in 
Marshall, the void that it would create and the chaos it would 
initiate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is appropriate now to quote a respected Canadian philosopher, 
John Ralston Saul, who wrote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The modern tools of communication become the tools of propaganda. 
And fear of the consequences of non-conformity is propagated. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This statement takes on a wonderful clarity and irony in the 
context of yesterday's throne speech.  What was the meaning 
behind the promises we heard?  Were they one line promises with 
little if any detail on how exactly these promises were to be 
implemented?  It was much like we have seen from previous throne 
speeches from the government.  Much of what we heard were ideas 
generated by the PC Party of Canada or ideas that have been long 
media tested, words that sound wonderful and warm people's hearts 
but do not amount to much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one would deny that we need to improve our commitment on 
children's issues, to a stronger economy, to a quality health 
care, to aboriginal peoples amongst other issues.  These we can 
all agree on but where were the details?  When can Canadians 
count on the government to explain its vision in a manner that 
provides answers rather than more questions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard much about the Liberal's concept of diversity.  We 
heard it many times in yesterday's speech.  How can the 
government speak of respecting diversity when it chooses to 
antagonize Quebec, when it chooses to antagonize Atlantic Canada, 
the west and other regions and when it chooses to antagonize 
every region of the country with alienating provocative 
approaches to federalism? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government boldly states that the supreme court 
decision on the clarity of the referendum question must be 
respected it makes clear that the goal is to provoke Quebec.  The 
Liberal plan B approach has done nothing but antagonize Quebec 
and is completely unconstructive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to encourage Canadians if we are to evolve as a strong 
and united country.  When the government ignores the plight of 
western farmers or Atlantic fishers it shows that it respects 
diversity only when it falls within the Liberal agenda.  It 
demonstrates that it is only a true crisis that evokes a response 
and even then the government responds slowly and inadequately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is heartening to know that the government has finally 
recognized the priority that needs to be given to environmental 
issues, six years too late, I might add.  And still the Liberals 
have done nothing more than to affirm and reaffirm Canada's 
commitment to the Kyoto protocols and the reduction of greenhouse 
gas emissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government speaks of a children's agenda but it has not 
taken any meaningful action to protect the environment in which 
our children will live.  Thankfully, some industries have stepped 
up the challenge and have taken meaningful steps to reduce their 
greenhouse gas emissions and to do so from their factories. 
Others have not been so noble.  The government needs to stop 
talking about the reduction of harmful greenhouse emissions and 
start meaningful implementation of those commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked about what was in the throne speech.  What we uncover 
more about the government is in discussing what was left out of 
the document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech delivered the message of the new economy, of 
high technology and of the Internet, but here we have a 
government that has abandoned the country's traditional 
industries, industries that have powered our economy for more 
than a century, industries such as forestry, fishing, oil and 
gas, mining, farming and shipbuilding.  These industries continue 
to play an invaluable role in keeping our communities alive, 
prosperous and thriving, traditional industries that have 
sustained Canadians and provided not only income and occupation 
but also pride and purpose.  They continue to do so.  They 
continue to be a part of Canada's overall economy despite Liberal 
government indifference. 
Where on earth was the commitment to our brave men and women of 
the armed forces for equipment and resources to ensure their 
safety and success?  This glaring omission speaks volumes.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Within the pages of the speech there was a flavour of the 
abandonment of the past.  While the push to the future is a noble 
ideal, we cannot forget the fact that our traditional industries 
continue to provide meaningful work in areas of high 
unemployment.  The speech was littered with reaffirmations of 
previously unfulfilled promises or commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a Maritime member, it becomes obvious that the lack of focus 
on significant industries will have a negative impact.  It sends 
a message to Atlantic Canadians and others that they are not a 
high priority for the Liberal government.  One only has to look 
at the results of the last federal election and two recent 
provincial elections in the Atlantic provinces to know how 
Atlantic Canadians react when ignored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Liberal government speaks of high technology and of the 
knowledge based economy bringing a higher quality of life to 
Canadians, it neglects to mention that the costs to the quality 
of life in our smaller communities amongst fishers, farmers and 
miners will be hurt.  Let us build a stronger future by 
encouraging and connecting Canadians from coast to coast.  Let us 
not disconnect from the important industries that continue to 
drive the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is appropriate tonight that we in the House will be 
participating in a debate on the crisis emerging in the 
commercial fishing industry between native and non-native 
fishers.  The government has tiptoed around this critical issue 
for weeks allowing it to fester and grow to the point of 
confrontation and violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us hope that the government uses tonight's debate as an 
opportunity to reset its priorities and focus on the necessity of 
finding a swift and long term resolution to this crisis.  This 
must be an inclusive focus on consensus building and it must 
avoid the base political antagonism that has been practised by 
some. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have learned recently that aboriginal chiefs, including those 
who have until now supported the moratorium, have just left the 
meeting in New Brunswick and that the fisheries self-imposed 
moratorium is now off.  This means that boats and traps will be 
put back in the water and there is a serious issue that needs to 
be addressed and addressed quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Across the country other crises emerge.  The crisis faced by the 
western farm families went literally and figuratively unnoticed 
in yesterday's throne speech.  The low agricultural prices caused 
by subsidies among our trading partners threatens to put many 
Canadian farmers out of business completely.  This issue needs 
government action before it is too late. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing in the throne speech that will stem the brain 
drain.  The government must move to keep highly skilled Canadians 
from emigrating to the United States.  As well, there is nothing 
to stem interprovincial brain drain.  Far too many young 
Canadians are forced to move away from home and family depriving 
their communities of the knowledge and the skills necessary to 
build a strong foundation for the country in the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot wait for more Centres of Excellence to be established 
and more implementations of millennium scholarships.  A focus on 
research and development and the improvement for our children is 
laudable.  However, if our children are to simply grow up, become 
well educated, armed with skills and then move to the United 
States what have we accomplished and what have we gained? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can do more than simply applaud the government's commitment 
to a free trade arena or area of the Americas by the year 2005. 
We can do that but it is finally heartening to see that free 
trade has become a government priority.  Free trade is something 
that this party initiated.  I would certainly like to see the 
Liberal government undertake this effort with as much vigour and 
tenacity as it did with its anti-free trade efforts in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may have taken the Liberal government six years but it 
appears that it has finally realized that for Canadians to 
succeed they must be innovative and productive.  They must invest 
in skills development and they must seek new opportunities around 
the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that the Liberal track record has been about 
declining productivity and investment, record levels of taxation 
and punishing regulations and red tape.  Pie in the sky 
platitudes are not enough for Canadians and after six years they 
should and do expect more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are simply paying lip service to increasing our 
quality of life.  Under this Prime Minister, Canadians have seen 
their federal tax revenues go up while their disposable incomes 
and revenues go down. 
At best, we have seen incomes decline.  The Liberal government's 
lack of vision and leadership is actually destroying and 
undermining Canadians' quality of life not improving it as the 
throne speech would have us believe.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government needs to cut taxes starting with personal income 
taxes and capital gains taxes.  We must put money back in the 
pockets of those who have earned it and allow them to generate 
economic growth.  The government must set firm, achievable debt 
reduction targets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PC Party of Canada has given specifics about where it stands 
on tax issues such as the decrease in the capital gains tax and a 
full indexation of tax brackets.  The Liberal government has 
remained silent.  Our party will continue to consult with experts 
and Canadians on this matter.  Our federal government chooses to 
avoid consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This reluctance to put forward a plan for tax cuts is part of a 
trend.  We have not seen any ground-breaking initiatives in the 
last six years that would reverse the trend.  The government's 
commitment to seasonal workers is abysmal.  Agriculture, natural 
resource workers, middle class families and scores of other 
Canadians have been ignored and undercut by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax reduction is fundamental to the economic well being of 
Canadians and tax relief, more dollars being left in the hands of 
families with children, would be a step in that direction.  To 
help children, the government must help parents of those children 
with meaningful tax relief.  In the throne speech, the government 
said it would make a third significant investment in the national 
child benefit but there are no details of exactly how much the 
government will invest nor are there any contingency plans should 
the provinces and territories choose not to co-operate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as it has done with a series of other issues, issues such 
as poverty where the Liberals identified a problem that was 
obvious to all and then provided Canadians with false hope. 
Canadians are becoming cynical and despondent.  The government 
even created a separate ministry aimed at poverty but with no 
budget and no mandate and then tried to convince Canadians that 
it had addressed the problem.  Canadians will not be fooled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are more examples of more promises and no action.  The 
government's day to day management of native issues contradicts 
the promise that aboriginal people will be able to more fully 
participate and contribute to Canada's economy.  This 
paternalistic attitude flies in the face of the government's 
pledge to promote greater aboriginal self-reliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's attempt to present itself in a caring and 
compassionate way as a government that helps families and 
children in particular is a sham.  However, in the Year of Older 
Persons nowhere was there even a mention of seniors.  To quote my 
colleague from Saint John: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too often in our society today, seniors are overlooked and 
ignored. Our society is aging, and as it does, more and more 
seniors are falling through the cracks—substandard housing, 
inadequate health care, and in many cases, just plain neglect. 
Yet this government didn't see fit to mention them even once in 
their blueprint for the new millennium. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether I speak of families, children or of the elderly, it is 
obvious that when it comes time to implement legislation that 
would be truly beneficial the government has constantly failed to 
deliver.  One need only look at the government's chance to reform 
family law and strengthen support with the joint common senate 
committee on child custody in 1997.  The government ignored its 
report and the justice minister has already indicated that she 
wants more consultations that will last until the year 2002. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area where the Liberal government has failed to deliver 
has been with the new Youth Criminal Justice Act.  It has called 
this legislation a priority yet it has refused to acknowledge how 
it is going to pay for this when it is already not living up to 
the monetary commitments under the old young offenders act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lack of attention to youth crime has spilled over into other 
areas of law enforcement.  An abysmal lack of funding for the 
RCMP has constantly forced our Mounties to do more with less. 
This has literally endangered the officers and the public at 
large.  Bowing to public pressure, the government is now 
expecting the already overworked members of our national police 
force to combat high tech crimes such as money laundering, 
organized crime and the smuggling of people, guns and drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government speaks of public safety as its number one 
priority yet it continues to release dangerous offenders into our 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally we have more Liberal rhetoric regarding the future of 
health care.  It is fine for Liberals to talk about improving our 
health care system but it cannot be forgotten that the dire 
straits of health care in the country was created by this 
government.  By simply putting money back in when it does not 
even equal the amount of money that was taken out, our health 
care system will not improve.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This approach simply will not cut it.  Accessible and universal 
health care is one of the things for which Canadians take the 
most amount of pride.  We are very anxious to see how this 
government plans to keep the proud tradition of our health care 
system alive.  Certainly this throne speech gives no hint. 
Medical research is vital.  If the government intends to foster 
an international reputation as a world leader in this field, we 
cannot continue to ignore the daily health care needs of 
Canadians.  They are sadly off course. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Throne Speech represents a government whose vision is a mile 
wide and an inch deep.  There were some fine platitudes about 
this country's potential but there was nothing that provided 
Canadians with an understanding of where this government is 
coming from, and where it is going. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the dawn of the new millennium, this Liberal government had 
a golden opportunity to present a comprehensive plan on the path 
that the country should take.  Sadly that opportunity was missed 
and the government has traded vision for vagueness at the expense 
of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, on behalf of the Right Hon. Joe Clark and the 
Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, I thank you for the 
opportunity to present our response to the throne speech. 
<P><A NAME="LINK159"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
something was left out of the throne speech.  I am wondering what 
my colleague feels about the situation with regard to the 
aboriginal chiefs, our native people and the lobster industry at 
the present time and what is happening with the fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure about this, but my understanding is that there was 
a meeting held in Moncton, New Brunswick today and the chiefs 
have decided to put their traps back in the water tomorrow. These 
are not just the New Brunswick chiefs, but the Atlantic chiefs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the government did with regard to the fishing situation in 
all of Canada from coast to coast was not addressed. I would like 
to hear from the hon. member as to what he thinks should have 
been in that speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Madam Speaker, it has become obvious 
that not only was there an omission in the throne speech but also 
there was a lax approach by the government to this emerging 
crisis.  It was two weeks before the government chose to act. 
Going back even further, it is shocking to think that the 
government did not anticipate or foresee that this was one of the 
possible scenarios the supreme court could follow in its decision 
in the Marshall case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that members of this party, members from South Shore, 
West Nova, Southwest Nova, Petitcodiac, Beauséjour, our newest 
member, and Saint John have worked very diligently to meet with 
both the native and non-native fishers to get their ideas and 
input.  I am encouraged to see that the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans has followed that tack.  Now the time has come to sit down 
with these members to try to come up with a solution that is 
going to work respecting the need for conservation and respecting 
what the supreme court has done in a meaningful but measured way 
to avoid violence or possible death in this issue.  It has to be 
done quickly.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate this opportunity to bring members of parliament up 
to date on the developments in Atlantic Canada following a recent 
decision of the Supreme Court of Canada.  Many members have been 
following the story in media reports over the past four weeks, 
but this is the first chance I have had to tell the House 
personally what is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is important for members of parliament to understand 
the background to this issue and what I am going to do to resolve 
it.  The judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada in the Marshall 
case is an important judgment that affirms certain rights of the 
Mi'kmaq and Maliseet peoples flowing from the historical treaties 
with the crown.  In short, the supreme court decision affirms a 
treaty right that deserves our respect; but that right is a 
regulated right, it is not a blank cheque to fish anywhere at any 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of this judgment we will have to consider a number 
of fundamental questions about the management of the fishery.  In 
this new reality our challenge is to find ways to work together 
to secure the future of the fishery for both aboriginal and 
non-aboriginal communities.  We must formulate a process for 
integrating fishing under the treaty right in the overall 
fishery.  We need to develop a management scheme that will 
respect the treaty right described by the court while being 
sensitive to the social and economic realities of the Atlantic 
fishery and those who depend on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the supreme court handed down its judgment on September 17, 
the issue had my immediate and full attention.  We have been 
working with federal departments to analyse the implications of 
the judgment.  In addition, we engaged in immediate and 
continuous dialogue with aboriginal communities, provincial 
governments and other stakeholders in the fisheries.  Throughout 
this past month I have been heartened to hear the clear 
commitment to conservation and to co-operation expressed by the 
Mi'kmaq chiefs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the beginning our objective has been to achieve an 
effective management regime which represents a supreme court 
judgment and is fair to the interest in the fisheries.  Through 
the goodwill, patience and restraint that has been demonstrated 
by all participants, we have made considerable progress toward 
this goal.  The treaty signed in 1760 between the British and the 
Mi'kmaq was called the Peace and Friendship Treaty.  We should 
keep those words in mind, peace and friendship, as we work 
together toward the long term solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supreme court decision is complex and its full implications 
are not yet totally clear.  However, since September 17 we have 
clarified a number of issues raised.  Let me summarize what we 
understand about the judgment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The court has affirmed that the beneficiaries of the treaty have 
a right to, among other things, fish, hunt and gather and trade 
the products of these activities for necessaries.  Translated 
into modern terms the judgment indicates this right entitles the 
beneficiaries to have the opportunity to gain a moderate 
livelihood from the exercise of their fishing, hunting and 
gathering activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The court has also told us that right is limited.  It does not 
extend to the open-ended accumulation of wealth, nor does it 
provide for an unregulated harvest.  While the court has made it 
clear that there is a treaty right to fish, it has also made it 
clear the exercise of the right is subject to regulation by 
government. Catch limits that would reasonably be expected to 
provide a moderate livelihood can be enforced without infringing 
the treaty rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many considerations that will be central to our 
efforts as we move forward in concert with all the parties.  For 
example, we consider this to be a communal right and not an 
individual right.  To be clear, even though the right is 
exercised by individuals, it is for the benefit of the 
collective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue that is fundamental to the interpretation of the 
judgment is that in order to accommodate the treaty right, we 
must understand who are the current beneficiaries of that right. 
It is our view that the treaty applies to the aboriginal 
communities that best represent the modern manifestation of the 
original signatories.  Our initial assessment is that the Mi'kmaq 
and the Maliseet Indian bands in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, 
Prince Edward Island, and the Listiguj first nation in Quebec are 
the modern manifestations of the collectives that benefited from 
the treaties. 
We now need to focus on a process that will allow us to 
accommodate the treaty right.  We will involve in this process 
all who are directly concerned with the sustainability and the 
viability of the Atlantic fishery.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I became involved earlier on this issue and I have worked 
closely with natives, with commercial fishers, with federal 
departments and with provincial premiers to find short and long 
term solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the supreme court judgment was delivered on September 17 
and others in government sought a clear understanding of the 
implications, we worked quickly to analyse some fundamental 
questions about the management of the fishery and how to address 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There may be some critics who think we should have been able to 
guess what the court would say and that we should have jumped 
immediately into action, but it is difficult to predict the 
supreme court decisions and the terms used within the judgments. 
Some court decisions take years to interpret.  In this case we 
had a preliminary assessment in less than two weeks' time. 
Unfortunately, emotions ran high in some communities which 
resulted in serious property damage, injuries and violence. Those 
events deeply saddened me and many other Canadians across the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for us to work together.  We must not allow hot 
tempers and poor judgment to tarnish Canada's reputation for 
tolerance, for generosity and respect for the law. I am 
encouraged to see that calm and goodwill have returned to most 
areas of Atlantic Canada.  In the meantime we are working on a 
process that will accommodate both commercial and native 
fisheries for years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to extend my personal thanks to all the chiefs and 
members of the industry who took the time to meet with me to 
share their views and concerns.  Since the beginning I have said 
that I would respect the decisions of the chiefs, and that 
continues to be my position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to commend the people in area 35 who together, 
aboriginal and non-aboriginal, found community based solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decision that was handed down on September 17 by the supreme 
court left many unanswered questions.  We need time to work 
together.  But thanks to the willingness of all those who keep 
the lines of communication open, we have made progress. 
Aboriginal members of the fishing sector, the province, the 
federal government have all shown a strong will to resolve this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was really important when I met with the chiefs in Atlantic 
Canada was the long term issue.  Many of the chiefs felt that we 
must not focus on the short term and detract from what are the 
real issues, which is a long term issue.  That is what I hope to 
focus on, that we begin a process, a comprehensive plan of 
progress with all those parties that are affected by the 
fisheries issues, to bring them together and talk about real 
solutions. Real solutions can come about through dialogue and 
through co-operation, with people working together, sitting 
around the table looking at each other eye to eye and talking 
about the problems and how they can resolve them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been working on a short term solution.  I know the 
chiefs are meeting today.  Until I hear from them directly, I 
will not comment whether they in fact have decided to lift the 
moratorium or not, because this is something that they have done 
on a voluntary basis.  Certainly I would be disappointed if that 
is the decision they have made, but I will wait until they have 
directly contacted me before I comment on that.  An hon. member 
has said that I have not had contact.  I will wait to see if that 
is the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must go back to the fact that this treaty was a peace and 
friendship treaty.  It was signed more than two centuries ago. 
Natives and non-natives have lived and worked together for 
generations since that time in peace and harmony.  Together with 
patience, restraint, respect for the law and with the 
co-operation of everyone, we can turn the spirit for the next 
century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order to seek the unanimous consent of the House to extend the Q 
and A of the minister to allow the House to fully question him 
about this issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The House order made 
earlier today provides that there shall be no request for 
unanimous consent, so I am afraid that request cannot be granted. 
We will proceed to questions and comments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK164"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta—South Richmond, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, the government failed to obtain the court's objectives 
in the Marshall ruling.  It had no management plan in place in 
the event of a decision in favour of this treaty right and it has 
made no attempt either in its presentation to the court or since 
to balance the interests of other Canadians in the face of the 
treaty right granted by the court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has suggested in his speech and elsewhere that he 
will apply this treaty right as a communal right.  He has said 
that the communal right will be exercised by individuals for the 
benefit of all.  I would like to know how he will be able to 
determine a moderate living if he is going to apply this as a 
communal right.  If we consider a moderate living for all of the 
Mi'kmaq, if that is his objective, it is obvious that there will 
be nothing left for anybody else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the minister, very clearly, to answer the question 
of how a moderate living could be determined if the treaty right 
is applied as a communal right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal:</B>  Madam Speaker, the communal 
right is seen as a collective right.  I am sure the hon. member 
is very much aware of what that means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How we define a moderate livelihood, as described by the courts, 
is something that we have to sit around the table on.  We have to 
work with the aboriginal community and with all the parties 
together.  We must ask how we can ensure that the aboriginal 
people who are the beneficiaries of this treaty right are going 
to exercise it.  We need to define those terms, but we need to 
define them in conjunction with the aboriginal people, by sitting 
around the table and talking with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to ask everybody in this room how to define that we 
would have 30 different definitions.  It is something that has to 
be negotiated.  We have to sit at the table and do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have always felt that it is better to negotiate than to go to 
the courts, but there are others out there who refuse to move 
forward.  Even when we introduced the aboriginal fishing strategy 
after Sparrow many said that we could not move forward.  The last 
Conservative government was not any better at predicting what the 
supreme court was going to do with respect to Sparrow.  However, 
we were trying to bring the aboriginal community into the 
fishery.  Buying up licences was one way we were doing it.  We 
have already tried to work things out through negotiation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to negotiate.  At the end of the day, if we cannot find 
some sort of mediation, we will have to go back to the courts. 
However, when we go to the courts we have to go by what they put 
forward and we have to live with their views. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the challenges we have is to define a moderate 
livelihood.  It is something we will have to sit around the table 
to deal with.  That is why we need to focus on the long term and 
not on the short term issues that distract us.  The courts have 
recognized it as a treaty right and we have to ensure that we 
work together so they can exercise that right by taking due 
consideration of the interests and being sensitive to the other 
interests in the fisheries.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Robert D. Nault (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I look forward to Reform 
members' interventions in this debate.  It is always very 
interesting to see where they are coming from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to join my hon. colleague in debating this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supreme court has provided valuable guidance on how an 
agreement between two parties, the 1760-61 Mi'kmaq treaty, should 
be interpreted as we enter the 21st century.  However, the court 
did not specify how those treaty rights are to be implemented and 
respected both now and in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important for people to understand that the court's 
decision is complex and far-reaching.  There are no quick and 
easy solutions, as has been suggested by some people already this 
evening.  A constructive resolution requires that all parties 
work together to respect an affirmed treaty right in a way that 
is sensitive to the interests of all those who rely on the 
fishery for their livelihood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have much more work ahead of us—governments, first nations 
and non-first nations—to reconcile and understand the court's 
interpretation of this and other historic treaties.  The process 
by which we can work together toward finding a settlement is not 
new.  In fact, it is well under way.  Our commitment to negotiate 
with first nations in the spirit of partnership is ongoing.  So 
too is our commitment to finding settlements to legitimate 
outstanding first nations obligations.  These commitments were 
reconfirmed last year with the launch of “Gathering 
Strength—Canada's Aboriginal Action Plan”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's response to the Royal Commission on Aboriginal 
Peoples affirmed that agreements are best negotiated in a way 
that respects the rights and concerns of first nations and those 
of their neighbours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is nothing new.  We see it taking place across the country 
every day.  On the west coast the British Columbia Treaty 
Commission is negotiating modern day treaties with 51 first 
nations where no settlements were negotiated.  In the Yukon, 
comprehensive claim settlements, self-government and shared 
resource management are returning certainty to the territory.  In 
the Atlantic region a process is under way with first nations to 
find approaches to identify and settle legitimate outstanding 
obligations to first nations.  The same spirit of partnership 
will be needed to understand historic treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In “Gathering Strength” we said that the continuing treaty 
relationship provides the context of mutual rights and 
responsibilities which will ensure that aboriginal and 
non-aboriginal people can together enjoy the benefits of this 
great land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, for too many years first nations have not fully 
enjoyed the benefits of this great land, in part because they 
have had limited access to fish, forests, minerals and other 
natural resources.  Yet, court rulings have consistently and 
clearly demonstrated that first nations do indeed have rights. 
They have worked relentlessly to have aboriginal and treaty 
rights recognized.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote from a letter to the editor in today's 
edition of the Vancouver <I>Sun</I>.  Miles Richardson, the chief 
commissioner of the British Columbia Treaty Commission, writes: 
“Aboriginal rights exist whether or not they are set out in a 
treaty or agreed to by anyone.  But without a treaty it is 
unclear about how and where those treaties apply.  The courts 
have continually said that the best way to resolve these issues 
is through good faith negotiations with give and take on all 
sides”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree completely with those words.  I can confirm that my 
department is working in partnership with first nations and other 
governments across Canada to ensure that treaties are fully 
respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that the supreme court ruling on the Marshall case 
has implications for the people of Atlantic Canada, both first 
nations and non-first nations.  My colleague, the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, is working very hard to arrive at a fair 
and equitable solution involving access to Atlantic fishery 
resources in light of the Marshall decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The impact of the Marshall case likely will not be confined to 
fish and it likely will not be confined to Atlantic Canada.  I 
will be reviewing with others involved how these broader issues 
should be addressed.  After all, this is a shared responsibility 
among all parties.  It is up to all of us to help explain to all 
Canadians the meaning of treaties and the treaty relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we are seeing that the days are gone when one minister, 
the minister of Indian affairs, is the only one working on or 
speaking to aboriginal issues.  These issues are of significant 
importance to all ministers and I commend and support my 
colleague, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, for his efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My role is broader.  I see it as having the federal lead to work 
closely with first nation leaders, my provincial counterparts and 
my cabinet colleagues to explore together an overall approach to 
the broader question of the treaty relationship and aboriginal 
access to resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development I am 
just one person among many who is working on or speaking to 
aboriginal issues.  These issues are of significant importance to 
all ministers.  Again, I commend the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans for his efforts.  Together we will explore an overall 
approach to the broader question of the treaty relationship and 
aboriginal access to resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  There are many 
members who wish to ask questions tonight.  Therefore I suggest 
that we limit our questions and answers to one minute in order to 
give as many members as possible the chance to intervene. 
<P><A NAME="LINK167"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is 
very difficult to get the opportunity to ask a question tonight 
and I will keep it to one minute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the minister's statement there is one looming 
question that needs to be asked.  We all know that there is no 
plan by the department of Indian affairs and there is no plan by 
the minister of fisheries to integrate natives into the fishery, 
but I want to know the minister's reasoning behind his statement 
when he said that natives were kept out of this fishery in the 
past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1950s and 1960s a lobster licence in southwest Nova 
Scotia could be bought for $1.  I believe prior to that a licence 
was 25 cents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kept any first nations from the lobster fishery at that 
time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Robert D. Nault:</B>  Madam Speaker, obviously members 
who have a preoccupation with the fishing strategy are asking 
very specific questions, but they seem to have lost the gist of 
the speech and what I was trying to suggest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make it very clear to members that when the courts 
rule on particular rights of first nations they rule with the 
intent of saying to Canadians and to governments, provincial and 
federal, that the rights exist.  Then they suggest to 
parliamentarians and members who are on the government side that 
they sit down with the aboriginal people to negotiate how those 
benefits from the treaty will flow, and they flow in a number of 
ways:  from the economic development side of the issue, which was 
mentioned by my colleague earlier in his question to the Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans; the issue of how first nations people 
would be involved in the regulatory regime of the fishery itself; 
how they would be involved in other resources; and in gathering, 
which was part of the statement that was made by the court. 
Those issues were not defined.  That was the whole issue.  For 
someone to be as simplistic as to say that we should be prepared 
and coming out with a plan tomorrow and saying here it is, that 
is not what the courts asked us to do.  The courts have asked us 
to sit down with the first nations and to define exactly how that 
treaty right will benefit them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, we have 
been hearing a lot of words over there about how the government 
will try to work to effect a compromise between aboriginal and 
non-aboriginal fishermen on the east coast.  For the benefit of 
those listening or watching the debate tonight, I would like them 
to know that this is the same minister, when push came to shove 
on the Musqueam reserve, who sent eviction notices to all 
non-aboriginal leaseholders on that reserve because the 
insensitive and belligerent chief of the Musqueam insisted that 
be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the minister tell us what comfort the fishermen on the 
east coast can take by his words and those of the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans when this is the kind of action we have seen 
from the government consistently, time after time, when it has 
come down to an issue between aboriginal and non-aboriginal 
rights? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Robert D. Nault:</B>  Madam Speaker, any time an 
aboriginal community tries to create an economic development 
opportunity for themselves it becomes a win-lose for the Reform 
Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the Musqueam issue as a win-win in the sense that first 
nations people will make economic benefit from this legally 
binding contract.  I do not know what the Reform Party would like 
to see the Government of Canada do.  If its members would give us 
their position on that particular file, if they would like us to 
subsidize the first nations to the tune of $7 million to deal 
with it, I would be prepared to look at it.  So far all the 
Reform Party is doing is running at aboriginal people but not 
giving us solutions as to how we deal with the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans and I will be setting up a 
number of tables.  Those tables will be like any other 
negotiation that we have done in B.C. or across the country, as I 
have mentioned earlier.  We will sit down with the people, the 
chiefs of the Atlantic region and other interest groups, and we 
will then come up with a resolution as to how best to proceed 
with the treaty right confirmed by the court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That will not happen tomorrow, next week or the week after.  We 
will set up these tables and we will work through it over the 
winter.  We hope that in the short term, which is in the next 
year, we will have some solutions to the issues.  That is how it 
will be done.  It is not the simplistic view of some members 
opposite that we should just go out there and ask people to break 
the law or change the law because we do not like the results of 
what the courts have ruled. 
<P><A NAME="LINK169"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta—South Richmond, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, on September 17, 1999, the Supreme Court of Canada 
rendered its decision in Regina versus Marshall.  The effect of 
that judgment is quite clear.  The situation in law now is that 
before fisheries managers can lawfully open the fishery to 
others, the Mi'kmaq people must be accorded the opportunity to 
fully satisfy their rights for a moderate livelihood.  In other 
words they are given a priority right to fish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This follows from the order of priority set out in Sparrow and 
in other cases which establish firmly that aboriginal treaty 
rights have priority over general, commercial and sport fishing 
rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moderate livelihood is defined as including such basics as food, 
clothing and housing supplemented by a few amenities, but not the 
accumulation of wealth.  It simply addresses day to day needs. 
This definition is broad and hopelessly vague.  It is likely that 
there are few existing commercial fishermen who enjoy any greater 
standard of living than that from the inshore fishery.  These 
fishermen will now have to stand aside while each and every 
Mi'kmaw who chooses to go fishing does so and earns enough to 
achieve this level of income. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1935"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens if there is some doubt as to when to close the 
fishery?  Our experience is quite simple.  When in doubt 
fisheries managers will be inclined to err on the side of 
allowing too much Mi'kmaq fishing rather than too little.  This 
has been our experience.  It happens because non-aboriginal 
fishermen do not have constitutional remedies for infringement of 
their fishing rights as aboriginal fishermen do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The practice of erring on the side of aboriginal fishing rights 
seems to have been adopted as a method of keeping DFO managers on 
safe ground and free of legal challenges to their decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present situation also allows for the courts to strike down 
the current regulations of the fishing rights of the Mi'kmaq 
because these regulations did not have any specific accommodation 
in regulation as a priority right.  The minister's absolute 
discretion under the Fisheries Act, which is the basis for the 
current regulations, was not held to be adequate protection of 
the treaty right.  Accordingly at the moment there is no valid 
regulation of the Mi'kmaq right.  There is a legal vacuum. 
Unrestrained fishing can take place by the Mi'kmaq until such 
time as a valid regulatory regime can be put in place.  That may 
take months or even years since consultation must take place 
beforehand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I go any further I will look back at the situation in 
British Columbia because the experience there with preferential 
fishing rights accorded to natives is not a happy one.  The 
problem in British Columbia was visited upon us by the 
Conservative government, in particular John Crosbie, minister of 
fisheries at the time.  He allowed for a separate native 
commercial fishery in British Columbia in June 1992.  There was a 
tragedy that year for fish stocks.  The situation only worsened 
until 1994 when there was a complete breakdown in enforcement. We 
have encountered some of the lowest spawning escapement on the 
Fraser River in history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result the Liberal government asked John Fraser, a former 
Minister of Fisheries and Speaker of the House, to investigate 
the management system in place on the Fraser River.  He found 
that the natural disaster excuses the government had offered to 
be without much substance.  It had said that the water was too 
high and the water was too warm.  The fact of the matter was that 
the problem was visited on us because of the poor regulations 
which were in place, poor enforcement and so on of that native 
commercial fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was the experience of British Columbia.  It has been a 
tragedy.  Prior to 1992 the fishery on the Fraser River was a 
profitable one.  This past year commercial fishing was completely 
closed on the Fraser River for the first time in history.  That 
came about as a direct result of the aboriginal fishing policy 
and the commercial fishing regulations which were put in place by 
the government.  There is no question about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over time the government has blamed nature, acts of God:  the 
water was too high; the water was too low; the water was too 
warm; the water was too cold; it was El Nino; it was La Nina, all 
these problems.   When they look at that collapse they say it was 
El Nino in the north Pacific in the last couple of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened? Why was it that there were strong returns of 
sockeye to Port Alberni on Vancouver Island this year?  Why is it 
that in Alaska they anticipated 25 million sockeye to return to 
Bristol Bay and we ended up with over 40 million?  Those fish 
were swimming in the same waters in the north Pacific as the fish 
from Fraser River.  Those returns came back strong.  The only 
difference was the aboriginal fishing regulations in place on the 
Fraser River and the cutbacks by the government resulted in a 
lack of enforcement and a lack of proper monitoring of the 
fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister talks about supreme court decisions and the effect 
they have on the government. 
Supreme court decisions are not made in isolation.  The 
government was there and it was supposed to address the issue on 
behalf of all Canadians.  It was supposed to present its case and 
especially the case of the fishermen who would be impacted by the 
decision to the court so the court could have something to base 
its judgment on.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the crown do, the crown being the Liberal government? 
In the first instance the crown expert witness described the 
prohibition on Mi'kmaq trading peltry with any other than the 
British as a Mi'kmaq right to trade.  How we can get from a 
restriction on trading, which that was and which the truck houses 
were, to a right to trade is beyond me, but that point was 
conceded by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the expert witness conceded that the treaty right 
included a right to trade fish although peltry was the only 
commodity cited in the treaty and the price list agreed to by the 
chiefs and the British did not include fish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we get from an agreement which does not include fish and 
which is a restriction on trading rights to a priority right to 
fish?  I will tell the House how.  The government had in place a 
policy on the west coast which gave to natives a priority right 
to fish.  How can it have that kind of policy in place and 
sustained on one coast and then go to court and try to deny it on 
the other?  It cannot be done and the government knows it.  It 
did not do it and that is why we are in the jam we are in now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another interesting oversight by the government.  The 
crown also failed to enter into argument the public right to 
fish.  The public right to fish has existed in British common law 
since the Magna Carta.  The public right to fish guarantees all 
of us equal access to the fishery.  That public right can only be 
broken by the House.  It takes an act of parliament to allow for 
separate native commercial fisheries. That has not happened on 
the west coast.  There is no act of parliament dealing with it. 
Those fisheries are operating illegally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That argument should have been put to the court when the 
decision was argued so the court would understand the legal 
condition in which that treaty was signed.  That treaty should 
not then have been interpreted as an exclusive right or as a 
priority right given the underlying right that we all enjoyed, 
the public right to fish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The crown failed to enter evidence demonstrating the social and 
economic impact on the maritime fishery if the Mi'kmaq were 
awarded the right to fish commercially.  The crown also failed to 
argue that a decision in favour of a commercial fishery on eels, 
there being no viable commercial fishery in the maritimes on 
eels, could result in a commercial fishery on other species such 
as lobster.  The crown failed to introduce evidence such as the 
1995 fisheries conservation council report which suggested that 
lobster were already overharvested so that any official entry 
into the fishery through a treaty would mean an existing 
participant in the public commercial fishery would have to be 
displaced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the crown failed to represent to the court the 
situation that currently exists, a situation in which a fishery 
is already oversubscribed, in which there are already too many 
participants according to the Fisheries Resource Conservation 
Council, and in which allowing the entry of others would require 
the displacement of those who are currently exercising rights to 
fish.  That argument should have been put in place and it was 
not.  The government overlooked it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not the first time a tragic oversight by the government 
has happened in arguments before the Supreme Court of Canada. 
It happened in R. v Nikal, which I will not go into now because 
of time limits, but I will reference the recent Delgamuukw 
decision of the Supreme Court of Canada. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1945"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Delgamuukw, the federal government supported aboriginal 
claims to self-government and the continued existence of 
aboriginal title.  Although the Supreme Court of Canada did not 
deal with self-government, it did find in favour of 
unextinguished aboriginal title which continues to cause chaos 
throughout British Columbian resource industries.  That is 
tragic.  It caused the logging disputes we had this summer and 
the flagrant breaking of law, not to mention the hardship.  The 
minister, himself, mentioned just moments ago that these rights 
would extend to logging, mining and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is chaos and turmoil in eastern Canada.  Shortly after 
this decision came down, I offered the minister a reasonable and 
legal escape route.  I sent it to him in a letter and I sent that 
letter to the provincial governments affected.  I told him that 
what he should do first is to seek a stay of judgment and, 
second, to seek a rehearing of the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear what the effect of a stay of judgment would be.  It 
would simply allow for a cooling off period.  It would have 
allowed the government time to pool its resources and to figure 
out what it was going to do with the situation it was faced with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second thing it would do is this.  By asking for a rehearing 
it would have given the government, the attorneys general of the 
provinces involved and other stakeholders, whether they be 
fishermen's organizations, processing organizations or the 
communities affected, the opportunity to go to the supreme court 
and say “Look, if this decision moves ahead this is the impact 
it is going to have on our communities”.  It would have given 
those stakeholders a chance to say “Look, when you dealt with 
the Gladstone decision of the supreme court you acknowledged that 
others had rights”.  That Gladstone decision dealt with an 
inherent aboriginal right to commercially fish herring roe on 
kelp. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though it was found to be an inherent aboriginal right, the 
court acknowledged that others had acquired rights as well.  That 
argument was not taken to the supreme court by the government. It 
left it out.  It refused to bring that forward.  It refused to 
defend the interests of current stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fisheries oversubscribed.  If one drives down the coast of 
Nova Scotia and takes a look at those small towns and villages 
one will see that the only building standing is the lobster 
processing plant and behind every house there are lobster pots. 
That is how those communities exist.  If we take away their 
access to the resource what is left?  It is not only the 
fishermen who will go out of business, it is the processors, the 
guy who runs the gas station and the guy in the grocery store. 
It trickles right down.  It will destroy the economy.  Nothing is 
gained by taking from one who is simply making a living and 
giving it to another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view it is imperative for the court to rehear this matter. 
Neither Parliament nor the provincial legislatures have the power 
to deal with the matter, it having been put out of reach of the 
legislative branch by sections 35(1) and 52 of the Constitution 
Act, 1982.  The notwithstanding clause is not available since 
section 35(1) is not a part of the charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only legislative remedy is a constitutional amendment by 
Parliament and the legislatures of seven provinces containing 50% 
of the population of Canada.  This is probably impractical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister says to negotiate.  Negotiations would be lovely 
but they can only be successful if one goes to the table with 
something in one's hand.  The minister has no cards.  He has no 
chips on the table.  He gave it all away when he failed to score 
points and make the proper arguments before the Supreme Court of 
Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to quote three passages from the Gladstone decision of 
the Supreme Court of Canada.  I want to show which references the 
government could use if it sought the court's advice on this 
matter.  These three passages would provide legal weight to an 
escape route from this problem.  The first quotation reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should also be noted that the aboriginal rights recognized and 
affirmed by s. 35(1) exist within a legal context in which, since 
the time of the Magna Carta, there has been a common law right to 
fish in tidal waters that can only be abrogated by competent 
legislation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is from R. v  Gladstone, paragraph 67. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second quotation reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the elevation of common law aboriginal rights to 
constitutional status obviously has an impact on the public's 
common law rights to fish in tidal waters, it was surely not 
intended that, by enactment of s. 35(1), those common law rights 
would be extinguished in cases where an aboriginal right to 
harvest fish commercially existed. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is R. v Gladstone, paragraph 67. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last quotation reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although by no means making a definitive statement on this issue, 
I would suggest that with regards to the distribution of the 
fisheries resources after conservation goals have been met, 
objectives such as the pursuit of economic and regional fairness, 
and the recognition of the historical reliance upon, and 
participation in, the fishery by non-aboriginal groups, are the 
type of objectives which can (at least in the right 
circumstances) satisfy this standard.  In the right 
circumstances, such objectives are in the interest of all 
Canadians and, more importantly, the reconciliation of aboriginal 
societies with the rest of Canadian society may well depend upon 
their successful attainment. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is R. v Gladstone, paragraph 75. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That says it all.  By not arguing for the rights of other 
Canadians when this matter was before the court, the government 
has put peace and good government in the country in jeopardy.  It 
has walked away from the very legitimate concerns that other 
Canadians have for their fishery, the legitimate interests that 
other Canadians have to earn a living from the fishery.  It is 
beyond belief that this could happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>DFO could balance the interests of Canadians in several ways. It 
could state, as did the court:  that the federal government has 
the ultimate responsibility to balance the interests of all 
Canadians; that there will be only one commercial fishery 
operating under the same rules and regulations; that the treaty 
right will be accommodated by issuing commercial licences to fish 
in the public commercial fishery alongside other Canadians; that 
any licence issued to the treaty fishery will be offset by a 
licence that the government purchased from a voluntary seller of 
a licence in the public commercial fishery.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
given that the hon. member made the suggestion to the federal 
government that it seek a stay of judgment to allow a cooling off 
period during which legitimate and constructive negotiation to 
allow peaceful aboriginal entry into the fisheries could occur, 
what was the government's response?   Why did the government not 
pursue a stay of judgment and pre-emptively perhaps make a 
recommendation to the supreme court in anticipation of the 
potential ramifications of the Marshall decision which would have 
allowed a peaceful entry for the aboriginal fishers and would 
have prevented some of the chaos that exists now? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are on the eve of the Bay of Fundy lobster season beginning 
tomorrow morning.  It is going to affect communities in my 
riding.  We understand that there is now a withdrawal by some of 
the native fishers on the 30 day moratorium. 
There is tremendous chaos looming right now which the government 
could have prevented with an appropriate pre-emptive strategy 
that was more long term in nature.  I would appreciate the 
member's feedback on that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins:</B>  Madam Speaker, the government's 
response to my position that a stay could be sought from the 
Supreme Court of Canada and that a rehearing of the judgment 
would be appropriate was simply to reject it as unfounded.  I did 
not just pull that suggestion out of the air.  I consulted with 
some prominent constitutional lawyers in my home province of 
British Columbia, lawyers who have experience before the Supreme 
Court of Canada.  It was their suggestion and one that is very 
real. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A caller mentioned to me early this morning that some of the 
bands that had committed to participating in the moratorium had 
simply moved their gear and placed it elsewhere.  I cannot 
confirm this, but if the moratorium has been broken, the 
government should use the opportunity to say that the situation 
is out of hand and out of control and that it would be best to go 
back to the supreme court to seek some legitimate advice on how 
to handle the situation.  It has 30 days to do that.  In other 
words, there are only about three days left for the government to 
make that representation to the supreme court. 
<P><A NAME="LINK171"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, we 
have a very serious situation on our hands.  As everybody can 
appreciate, it is very serious for those of us who live in 
coastal communities and for those of us who live along the sea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It always disturbs me when I hear the situation presented as the 
hon. member who just spoke presented it, to rehear the case.  It 
reminds me of people tossing a coin to see who goes first.  If 
they do not get the right answer they go for the best two out of 
three.  If they still do not get the right answer they go for the 
best three out of five.  They want to keep going until they get 
it the way they want it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems very unusual to talk about rehearing a supreme court 
decision.  I wonder if the hon. member would have taken the same 
position if the decision had come down not in favour of the 
aboriginal treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a very serious situation.  The court has ruled.  It has 
made a decision.  We should now be focusing our attention on 
giving a practical application to the decision that will be 
beneficial to all who are involved, to all the stakeholders in 
the industry.  We have to do that through negotiation, which is 
where the government has fallen down.  It waited until the 
decision came down before it looked at the prospect of 
negotiation despite the fact that Delgamuukw had talked about 
negotiation and the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples had 
spoken about negotiation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have known for a long time that there must be a sharing of 
resources and that it must be done in a way that will maintain 
peace and harmony but we wait until a very crucial decision comes 
and now it comes down to one side against the other side, 
communities being divided against communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard a lot of goodwill spoken on this issue by people on 
all sides, by the aboriginal people and by non-aboriginal people 
who want to resolve this issue in a favourable way.  This is 
where the minister and the government must take the lead and show 
leadership.  They must not wait and see whether the negotiations 
have broken down.  They must not wait and see if the traps have 
been pulled.  Rather, they must initiate leadership and do 
something now.  It is great to hear about the long term plans but 
we have an immediate situation that must be dealt with now.  It 
is a matter of getting the priorities around the table now to 
deal with the crisis that is facing us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins:</B>  Madam Speaker, the objective of asking 
the court to rehear the case is simply this.  There is obviously 
turmoil on the east coast.  People are upset because they are not 
sure what the decision means.  They are not sure whether this 
priority right allows for others, non-aboriginals, to have access 
to the fisheries resource.  We need clarification from the court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rehearing is not to rehear the judgment.  The court has 
spoken on that right.  It has acknowledged that the treaty right 
exists.  What it has not done is to clarify what right others 
have given this decision.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can argue this out until the cows come home but the quickest 
way to solve this problem is to go back to the court and ask it 
for clarification. What balance did the court have in mind when 
it allowed this treaty right?  Was it going to allow that treaty 
right to be infringed?  The suggestion in Gladstone and in other 
cases is that yes, others have rights, but those rights are not 
stated in this case.  In fact, the people affected by the 
decision were not represented in court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is beyond me why the member would not want others to be heard 
by the court as well.  The government did not represent the 
interests of existing commercial fishermen when it made that case 
in court.  Those people had a perfect right to be heard in that 
court.  For the member from Halifax to suggest that they do not 
have a right to be heard in court is beyond me. 
<P><A NAME="LINK172"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I have two 
quick questions for my friend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first question is when we heard the Minister of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development make his intervention, he 
suggested that aboriginal people had been denied access to 
resources.  My experience in British Columbia is that that is not 
the case.  Could the member elaborate on what the aboriginal 
participation is in the regular commercial fishery in British 
Columbia? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second question is a genuine question.  Can the member 
explain to the House and Canadians what the aboriginal experience 
is on the east coast with respect to the lobster fishery?  Is 
this fishery a traditional fishery that existed prior to European 
contact and colonization?  Was there a reliance on lobsters by 
the Mi'kmaq Indians as a part of their culture and as a part of 
their subsistence prior to Europeans coming to North America? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins:</B>  Madam Speaker, with reference to the 
first question, aboriginal people played a big role in the 
British Columbia fishery.  Prior to 1992, when the former 
Conservative government introduced this racially based commercial 
fishery which gave natives a priority right to commercially fish 
in British Columbia, 30% of the commercial fishermen in British 
Columbia were native.  Some of the most prosperous fishermen in 
British Columbia were native Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we went to Prince Rupert in the member's riding of Skeena, 
60% of the people working in the fish canneries were natives. 
There was a high participation of native people in the fishery in 
British Columbia where the native population represents about 3% 
of the population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to native participation in the lobster fishery on 
the east coast, one circumstance that a historian described to me 
today was that fish were not mentioned in that treaty because 
they held very little value at the time the treaty was made. 
They were readily available to anybody who wanted them.  If they 
wanted fish, it was not hard to catch them.  As a trade item they 
had no value.  Certainly lobsters were probably not a commodity 
that was sought after by natives.  There is no evidence to 
suggest that they were. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member behind me said earlier, prior to 1968 anyone could 
have got a lobster licence.  For a long period of time they were 
available to everybody for 25 cents.  The people who participated 
in that fishery did so for a variety of reasons, but it was tough 
to make a living.  Since the restricted licences came in, the 
fishermen, the processors and DFO have worked hard together to 
put a quality product into the marketplace, a product which has 
gradually risen in value.  Now that it is a valuable fishery, 
obviously there is interest from others.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I wish to 
state at the outset that the aboriginal fishers and the 
commercial fishers on the east coast have my sympathies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the pleasure of touring Nova Scotia in the summer of 1998. 
I would remind hon. members that, at the time, the entire area 
of education had been vested in the aboriginal people of Nova 
Scotia.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I took the opportunity to tour.  I went to Indian Brook, and 
this summer I went to Prince Edward Island to see the people on 
Lennox Island, the Micmacs.  I noticed one thing during my 
visit.  There was social peace everywhere.  The native 
community, and the non-native community, shared a lot of visions 
on the sea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there was the famous Marshall decision.  Unfortunately, I 
find that the government handled it very badly.  If we look at 
the turn of events, what is occurring in the Atlantic provinces 
is not very happy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I decided to raise the issue of the vision of the treaties, 
because, as we recall, the supreme court analyzed the Murray 
treaty before making this decision.  The native peoples viewed 
the treaties very differently from the Europeans.  For them, the 
treaties were not just between governments, but between nations 
as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we can also see in history is that all of the people in an 
aboriginal nation felt bound by the treaty.  Whether it was an 
ordinary treaty, a friendship treaty or a treaty of co-operation, 
all of the members of the nation felt bound by it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned the example of the Micmac guardians of the treaty 
known as the Putu's.  The guardians of these treaties, brought 
together the Micmac communities every year, reread the treaty 
and discussed it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We realize that the native view of the treaties is something 
both quite sacred and important.  Naturally, everyone knows, 
even if it is something rather folklorical for us, still it is a 
tradition that remains current.  There were a lot of festivities 
when a treaty was signed: singing, dancing and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Things were not the same for the Europeans.  It was more a 
business matter, where the signing meant as much hold as 
possible on all of the land.  Treaties were often signed by 
generals.  This was the case with the treaty at issue, General 
Murray's treaty.  No one knew the ins and outs of this treaty. 
They simply left it to the government or to the general signing 
the treaty and then forgot it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the treaty became a bit of a bother, it was stuck away in 
the bottom of a closet and forgotten.  This is the way the 
native people have always been treated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to tell a story to explain what is going on in the 
Atlantic provinces.  Two hundred years ago, a neighbour of my 
family decided to put up a fence that took in 50 feet of my 
property, and things stayed that way ever after.  Each 
successive generation said it would straighten the matter out, 
reclaim our land and our jurisdiction.  Two hundred years later, 
the highest court in the land, the Supreme Court of Canada, 
decided that the fence was in the wrong place.  How long will it 
take for the fence to be put back where it belongs?  No more 
than a day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was no surprise that native fishers set out in their boats 
immediately after the decision, because they want to force the 
issue.  They see that they have been left out in the cold and 
that it is very important that they get out quickly so as to 
perhaps force negotiations.  Unfortunately, negotiations are 
very slow in coming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would not want to forget the Murray treaty, because I 
mentioned this famous general earlier.  Early in the 17th 
century, there were a series of treaties in Virginia, 
Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. As I said earlier, the British 
crown drew up treaties with all aboriginal nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were treaties of this sort in Halifax in 1750.  Grand 
chief Jean-Baptiste Cope, the aboriginal negotiator, concluded 
treaties.  The one in dispute today, the 1760-1761 treaty, was 
concluded by General Murray, and had to do with matters of 
trade, including such things as trading posts.   This was the 
dispute, according to the Marshall decision.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nowadays, are aboriginal people allowed to trade a commercial 
fishery for goods or money? At the time, they had the right to 
do so and specific counters were set up for such activity. 
The English had total control over all commercial trading because, 
in signing the treaty, the aboriginals pledged to negotiate only 
with the British crown. That was for the Murray treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Centuries have passed and a number of major events have 
occurred, including the Constitution Act of 1982, which includes 
section 35. That section, which was drafted after long battles 
by aboriginals, was included in the Constitution Act. 
In my view, three paragraphs are particularly important: The 
existing aboriginal and treaty rights of the aboriginal peoples 
of Canada are recognized and confirmed. So, this type of treaty 
was reconfirmed by the court which said “Yes, this is valid”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the current act, “aboriginal peoples of Canada” includes the 
Indian, Inuit and Metis peoples of Canada. This means that the 
Micmacs and Malecites meet the definition of aboriginal peoples 
and Indians. For greater certainty, in subsection (1) “treaty 
rights” includes rights that now exist by way of land claims 
agreements or may be so acquired. This means that any land claim 
will now automatically be included and protected under the 
Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I looked at how the jurisprudence has evolved over time, because 
I feel it is important. 
Since this debate began, I have been hearing my colleagues 
commenting “We should go back to the supreme court in order to 
get it to specify what reasonable livelihood means; we should go 
back to the supreme court and ask it to suspend its decision”. 
Since 1973—I have gone back to 1973 but there are other earlier 
ones—aboriginal people have won just about all supreme court 
decisions.  The first one I will refer to is Calder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Calder is a Nisga'a—we shall shortly be addressing the 
Nisga'a question in the House—and he took a case to the supreme 
court back then, and the decision was as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Six of the seven justices of the Supreme Court recognize the 
existence of ancestral title based on land occupancy Canada law. 
The justices acknowledge that aboriginal territorial rights 
exist not only by virtue of the Royal Proclamation of 1763 but 
also under Indian title as the result of ancestral occupancy. 
Above and beyond the rights guaranteed by treaties or laws, 
aboriginal ancestral rights exist in Canada, that is to say 
customary rights that have survived colonization and the 
political transformation of the country. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The year 1973 constituted a very significant breakthrough for 
aboriginal peoples before the supreme court.  Then in 1984 there 
was Guérin.  In this case, the majority of the justices of the 
supreme court reaffirmed the existence of ancestral title and 
emphasized the federal government's fiduciary role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government, therefore, has an obligation to become 
involved in what is going on at the present time on the east 
coast. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Justices recognize that aboriginal ancestral rights existed 
before the British and Canadian regimes. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, the rights existed even before the Europeans arrived here. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The relationship between the Government of Canada and the 
aboriginal people is a fiduciary one and imposes real 
obligations on the federal authorities. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Note the wording “real obligations”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then came the Simon case. The decision was as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Supreme Court finds that native ancestral or treaty rights 
are not extinguished through the implicit effect of a statute. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That means that the Parliament of Canada, even if it passes a 
law, cannot extinguish native rights.  That is explained clearly 
in the decision in the Simon case, which dates back to 1985.  I 
am following a time line up to the present.  Members will 
realize that the solution is not necessarily a return to the 
supreme court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1989, there was the Sioui case.  In this decision: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Supreme Court recognizes the validity of the treaty signed 
by General Murray... in favour of the Hurons— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He had concluded an agreement with the Hurons on September 5, 
1760. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Court recognizes that the consent of the native peoples is 
obligatory to the extinguishment of treaty rights. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That means that, without the agreement of aboriginal peoples, 
rights cannot be extinguished.  Furthermore, 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>An ancestral or a treaty right may not be limited if public 
interest is served. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we come to the Sparrow case, which was pivotal to commercial 
and fishing activity in Canada.  A lot of things were said in 
it: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—provincial laws cannot limit an ancestral right, even if public 
interest is claimed.  Native fishing rights have absolute 
priority over others' fishing rights.  Only the survival or the 
depletion of wildlife stocks may limit this right. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that is currently recognized now.

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on to say that, furthermore, an ancestral right cannot be 
interpreted so as to take in the particular regulation prior to 
1982.  Regulations that applied to one thing way back then 
could apply to something totally different today.  That is the 
gist of the Marshall ruling.  It says that there were trading 
posts at that time, and today native peoples are being given the 
right to engage in commercial fishing.  This was the decision 
from which the case law evolved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It added that any government measure detrimental to the ancestral 
rights of native peoples must be justified explicitly and in a 
convincing manner. And the interpretation of treaties in 
particular must be generous and liberal. 
This means that when the supreme court judges look at a case, 
they are going to give the broadest possible interpretation to 
the words and provisions of the earlier decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there were the three famous decisions we often read about 
in the newspapers:  Gladstone, Van der Peet, and Smokehouse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Gladstone, the ancestral right to fish commercially was 
recognized.  In Van der Peet and Smokehouse, the claimants had 
to show that their nation had already fished commercially in 
order to be granted the right to continue doing so, and failed 
to make their case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Calder decision of 1996 recognized that the right to 
regulate for conservation still exists.  The minister is 
therefore right in saying that regulating conservation is an 
important role he must play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, there was the Delgamuukw ruling, which is 
revolutionizing our approach to aboriginals. 
Not only do we take into account the treaty, but also oral 
traditions. This means that someone appointed by his community 
could come before a court with oral traditions and say “I am in 
a position to demonstrate that we have always occupied that 
land”. If the oral tradition is accepted by the court, it would 
be as powerful as the signature on a treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am trying to show is that the legal basis of the 
aboriginals is absolutely unshakable. Whenever the minister of 
Indian affairs comes before the committee, once a year, I always 
make a point of asking him or her the following questions “When 
are you going to act regarding the aboriginal issue? When will 
you stop waiting for the courts to rule on this issue?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, parliament is faced with a supreme court ruling, and it 
is always the same story. 
All these decisions have led to minor changes in the 
government's policy. There are 1,000 grey areas in the Indian 
Act. There are 1,000 grey areas in the treaties. And what does 
the government do? It manages, but from one crisis to the next. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the crisis began on September 17, the government's 
attitude has been “If we can manage to solve this crisis and get 
it over with, we will go back to our business”. That has always 
been the problem. There will be other crises in natural 
resources. There will be other crises in forestry. There will be 
other crises regarding self-government, because of this 
government's total carelessness. It does not deal with the 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government begins discussions with various aboriginal groups 
and overlooks potential crises. When a crisis erupts, parliament 
must be called. Parliamentary decisions must be made. 
The minister needs to get his feet wet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Marshall, as in all the other decisions, the government is 
completely subservient to the courts, not only to the supreme 
court, because the situation had to gravitate there.  Instead of 
seeing what was up ahead, instead of saying “We will sit down 
and negotiate”, the government says “We will wait for the court 
to decide and then we shall see”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Marshall decision recognized the rights of aboriginal 
fishers on the east coast and now we are stuck with having to 
make room for them.  Certainly, this upsets the old way of doing 
things.  Ingrained habits die hard.  White fishers were not used 
to seeing other people allowed to enter their market, their 
fishery.  Someone is going to have to give in, and it is not the 
aboriginal people. 
Frankly, we are not going to send out the RCMP to arrest them 
when they have a Supreme Court of Canada decision that says they 
are entitled to be there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister ought to settle this by negotiation.  Earlier, I 
received some most alarming news over the news wire.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of the minister coming along with his colleague, the 
minister of Indian affairs, both of them proud as punch, to 
inform us that everything is just fine, that there are no 
problems, that now there is a moratorium, that the people will 
talk to each other, he should hop a plane this very night with 
his colleague, go down there to sit down and define what is a 
reasonable livelihood.  That is what the Marshall decision is 
all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Marshall, it is stated that they are entitled to fish 
commercially for a reasonable livelihood.  What does this mean? 
As I said, the Bloc Quebecois will certainly not be in favour of 
going back to the supreme court to ask it to define “reasonable 
livelihood”. 
Is that minimum wage?  Is it $100,000 a year? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This needs to be thoroughly discussed.  These discussions should 
be held at the bargaining table.  The definition of the suitable 
subsistence level must be negotiated, not determined by 
moratoriums that no one respects and by other interpretations 
that could be requested of the Supreme Court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think historical errors have been made.  For example, when the 
Fathers of Confederation signed the Constitution in 1867, the 
native peoples were not represented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Treaties have always been made for the benefit of the moment. 
When they were unfavourable, they were stuck in the closet. 
There is good reason why native peoples are reacting 
aggressively today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government totally lacks courage, and shows a total lack of 
care. 
The Indian Act dates back 100 years, and the government is still 
trying to manage the aboriginal peoples with an act that is 100 
years old.  Why does the government not speed up the issues of 
self-government and territorial claims? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So long as the native peoples lack the land and resources to be 
self-sufficient, we will go round in circles in this parliament, 
and the native peoples will react, especially since the supreme 
court decisions are in their favour.  As I said earlier, the 
score is about 50 to nil in their favour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me there are things to be done.  I say that Quebec's 
approach will be different.  It has always been different and 
will continue to be in a sovereign Quebec. 
In the bill that was introduced in the National Assembly, it was 
clear that aboriginal nations would sit down with the government 
to draft the Quebec constitution, something the Fathers of 
Confederation did not do in 1867. We want to avoid past errors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I say to aboriginal people that Quebec will always 
abide by the treaties that were signed by the British crown. It 
goes without saying that we must maintain the same statutes and 
the same conditions. In fact, we will probably improve them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The James Bay agreement signed in May of 1975 is proof of that. 
The Quebec government has already said to the Cree “If you want 
to update the agreement, we are prepared to do so”. This is not 
done in this parliament. Here, the government goes from one 
crisis to the next. Right now, some serious and dramatic events 
are taking place on the east coast. I will get to that in a 
minute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to tell aboriginal people that the Bloc Quebecois will 
always support their efforts to gain greater autonomy. The Bloc 
Quebecois is probably the one party in this house that is best 
able to determine and appreciate what it means to strive to 
achieve greater autonomy. I want to tell aboriginal people that 
we are on their side in this endeavour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that the minister is not here, and that the 
minister of Indian affairs is not here either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand:</B> It is true that I am not allowed to say 
that. Perhaps they are listening to me in the lobby. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have here with me the communique issued about an hour ago by 
all the chiefs on the east coast. I will read it in English.

</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tomorrow morning there will be problems.  That is why I told the 
minister to get on a plane this evening with the Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development.  They should go to the 
east coast.  The chiefs have just said that the moratorium is 
over and that they will resume fishing tomorrow. Their 
communique also states: 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“We are no longer asking our members to stop fishing should 
they wish to fish”, said Ben Sylliboy, Grand Chief of the 
Mi'kmaq Nation, in a statement. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was released at 7.16 p.m.  Here is proof of the 
government's negligence and carelessness, and we are paying the 
price.  I suggest that they take a plane this evening and sort 
this out.

I thank my colleague for his comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see that there is a crisis in the lobster fishery, but we 
also often forget to mention the social crisis in our regions. 
Tomorrow morning, our communities will still be facing a crisis. 
Tomorrow morning, children will go to school, and natives and 
non-natives will still be divided.  It is sad; families are 
affected by this problem.  Unfortunately, the Liberal government 
has refused to show leadership and take action.  It has left 
communities to fight it out, instead of stepping in, taking 
control, and sitting down and negotiating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important to remember that what is involved here is 
not just a crisis in the lobster fishery.  What my constituents 
are facing is a social crisis.  We have worked very hard to get 
along, to work and eat together, and in less than two weeks, 
everything is being destroyed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that the minister will take this into consideration and 
take action to ensure that we will be able to repair the damage 
to our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder whether my Bloc Quebecois colleague would agree with me 
on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand:</B> Madam Speaker, I am totally in agreement 
with my colleague from the Progressive Conservative Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said at the start of my speech, I was in the aboriginal 
communities this summer and the summer before that. I noted a 
very fine social peace between aboriginals and non-aboriginals. 
My fear now is that the government's carelessness and 
permissiveness in making decisions, and its lack of courage, 
will tear the community apart, as it has already begun to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has stopped momentarily. I believe from the 
communique I have just received that it is absolutely urgent to 
negotiate.  That is why I am suggesting that the minister take 
the plane tonight.  If he is short domestic travel points, I 
would give him one, two even, if he wants to take his Indian 
affairs colleague to the east coast.

past Conservative governments and the current Liberal government 
the current government must allocate financial and human 
resources?  The real leadership in this crisis will come from the 
grassroots.  The fishermen themselves and their communities will 
come up with short and long term solutions to the very serious 
crisis we now face in Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would my hon. colleague not agree that the government must 
provide immediately the human and financial resources to help 
solve this problem? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand: </B>Madam Speaker, I totally agree that, the 
mess having been caused by the federal government, it is once 
again up to the federal government to go and clean it up.  When 
I refer to cleaning up the mess, my colleague from 
Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madelein—Pabok will surely have 
suggestions shortly on how that can be done.  For instance, 
buying back licences, something that is often done, so that more 
space can be made for the aboriginal fishers who have had the 
supreme court rule in their favour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the government is going to have to roll up its sleeves and 
show some courage.  Instead of going back to the supreme court 
it is going to have to negotiate immediately, so that social 
peace may be restored to these communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>THE MESS is of its doing, as 
my colleague has said, the Progressive Conservatives as 
well.  When the Bloc Quebecois is in a sovereign Quebec, I will 
always be able to support my NDP colleagues, for I find their 
positions very close to those of our party.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, every 
member of the House and every Canadian who has been following 
recent events in the east coast lobster fishery appreciates the 
fragile nature of the situation that has developed in the 
aftermath of the recent supreme court decision affirming treaty 
rights for Mi'kmaq and for aboriginal people in Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT78"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Confirmation within the last hour of the collapse of the 
voluntary moratorium is very worrisome.  It underscores the 
importance for every member of the House to try to do everything 
humanly possible not to inflame the tension that has gripped 
communities in the east coast fisheries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say in that regard I find it frankly abhorrent to hear 
the intemperate, inflammatory and simply historically inaccurate 
references again and again by Reform Party members to a racially 
based fishery.  That does nothing to help move us toward a 
solution which will ensure a sound, sustainable fishery for all 
those who deserve their fair share in the aboriginal and 
non-aboriginal communities of the east coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is evident that major challenges are posed by the Marshall 
and the Delgamuukw decisions which will impact on a host of 
resource sectors and not just the fishery.  Both aboriginal and 
non-aboriginal will now be vying for access and will be demanding 
their fair share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There seems to have been very little appreciation of the 
enormous significance of these legal decisions, and I might say 
not only by the federal government but by the Government of Nova 
Scotia as well.  If there had been, both levels of government 
would surely have been working together and working overtime with 
all the stakeholders affected to develop a plan which would be 
ready to be put in place when the supreme court brought down its 
decision on the Marshall case.  Instead what we have seen is 
paralysis and ineffectual action, in fact virtual inaction by the 
federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's failure to have a contingency plan was 
inexcusable and has resulted in a vacuum into which various 
legitimate stakeholders inserted themselves with predictable 
results.  It is a response, incidentally, that is becoming all 
too frequent these days as Liberal lack of leadership in the 
agricultural and airline industry crises so sadly demonstrates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier in my throne speech remarks, that same 
lack of foresight was not displayed by the Mi'kmaq leadership. As 
early as April 1999 the Mi'kmaq implored governments to 
recognize, and I quote directly from a document dealing with the 
issue of the Mi'kmaq fishery, that the impending decision from 
the Supreme Court of Canada in the Queen versus Donald Marshall, 
Jr. case had increased Mi'kmaq expectations for greater access to 
the east coast fishery while at the same time creating 
uncertainty and anxiety within the existing industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is regrettable in the extreme the federal government did not 
have the foresight to at least take under serious advisement the 
urgings of the Mi'kmaq leadership to anticipate the outcome of 
the decision. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government did nothing as it awaited the Marshall 
decision.  Its inaction allowed tensions and chaos to take hold 
in the Atlantic fishing communities. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regrettably calm heads and voices were absent in the aftermath 
of the Marshall decision, precisely because the current fisheries 
minister and his predecessor had been conspicuously absent from 
this file prior to the supreme court decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is little wonder that lobster dependent coastal communities 
in Atlantic Canada have been wracked with tension and dissension 
in recent weeks.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely the answer is not to blame the supreme court for ruling 
on a treaty rights issue which was placed before it.  Nor is it 
acceptable, as the Prime Minister suggested, to stay the court's 
decision or, as some members in the debate keep insisting, to 
send the matter back to the supreme court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for us to acknowledge that aboriginal people 
have been waiting for two and a half centuries for a ruling to 
clarify their rights of access to the fishery under existing 
treaties.  A lack of preparation and foresight by the government 
is a lame and feeble excuse on which to criticize our highest 
court.  Talk about shooting the messenger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the right policy response to the challenges now 
confronting the lobster fishery and other commercial fisheries on 
the east coast?  Atlantic Canadians want and deserve a coherent 
answer to this question.  They want to see a post-Marshall regime 
based on principles of fairness, equity, sustainability and long 
term commercial viability. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the wake of the Marshall decision, Atlantic Canadians want a 
fair, just and sustainable fishing arrangement.  To achieve this 
end, those involved must be consulted and listened to. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To arrive at a workable set of rules governing access to the 
resource we first need to consult those who are directly 
involved, to listen patiently and respectfully to all the 
stakeholders. Without their insights, knowledge and at least 
tacit agreement we cannot proceed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Permit me however to outline briefly some broad ideas which 
might inform that process and might form the basis of an 
acceptable solution.  First, emphasis should be put on 
conservation, on preserving the long term health of the stocks. 
Sound principles of management and conservation based on well 
grounded science must be implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Atlantic Canadians cannot afford another government induced 
collapse along the lines of the cod fishery fiasco.  Independent 
expert advice must be sought and must be heeded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we need to find a way to allocate licences to aboriginal 
Canadians so that they may enjoy legal and uncontested access to 
the resource.  This may involve the government buying back some 
licences from commercial fishers.  Indications are that maybe 10% 
of those who are currently fishing would welcome the opportunity 
to make way for aboriginals to make their rightful claim to their 
fair share of the fishery.  Let us be clear that we are talking 
here about those who would choose voluntarily to exit the lobster 
fishery at this point in their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely critical to build consensus on a set of rules 
governing conservation, allowable catches and so on.  A level 
playing field is the only way that we are likely to get buy-in 
from all groups concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, we must work toward establishing community based fishery 
policies to replace the corporate industrial model which has 
enriched a few large companies at the expense of many independent 
inshore fishermen and their families.  The unemployment, the 
poverty and the out-migration in many of these fishery 
communities is eloquent and distressing testimony to the failure 
of that approach. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the long term, we must work to establish fishing policies 
that are more community oriented than industry oriented. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to recognize that the modest entry of aboriginal 
fishers into this resource is not the reason various Atlantic 
fisheries are under threat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my discussions with Mi'kmaq representatives over the last 
week they have expressed what is understandably a great deal of 
distress and, I think it is fair to say, hurt at the implication 
that the problems caused to the fishing stock in the east coast 
are in any way attributable to their entry into the fishery.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real threat comes from the indiscriminate and unsustainable 
practices of corporate fish companies and multinational 
conglomerates.  In my view the Leader of the Opposition was wrong 
today to condemn a communal approach to resource allocation as he 
did in respect of the Nisga'a treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is every reason to believe that increased meaningful local 
control and responsibility for the resource by fishing 
communities would generate rules that guarantee a reasonable 
livelihood for fishers, aboriginal and non-aboriginal, while 
preserving the future of the resource.  To believe otherwise is 
to demonstrate a striking lack of faith in the decency, fairness 
and sense of responsibility of fishers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I pay tribute to the important and ongoing work of the joint 
working group on the Mi'kmaq commercial fishery that was 
established in February of this year.  Let us hope that same 
careful, respectful, collaborative approach can get important 
progress back on track in moving us toward a solution by 
involving all stakeholders:  aboriginal, non-native and 
government.  That working group has been earnestly laying the 
groundwork for a viable commercial fishery that looks after the 
interests of all fishers, aboriginal and non-aboriginal alike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This kind of forward thinking is what we need from our leaders 
and decision makers at every level, and especially from the 
federal government where it has been so notably absent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me conclude by saying that we need public policies to govern 
our fisheries and other resources that are grounded in long term 
thinking, in devolving decision making to those closest to the 
resource, and in a sense of fairness and respect for the 
livelihoods of all.  The existing industrial factory style 
approach underwritten by bad science and greed has taken us to 
where we are today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us turn this page and refashion the fishery and our other 
resource industries as well so they will be around to provide a 
decent livelihood for our children for many generations to come.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I have a question for the member whose comments were quite 
insightful on this whole issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today in the House the minister was asked several questions.  On 
a couple of occasions the minister said that today we should 
applaud those aboriginal leaders, 33 out of 35, who on a 
voluntary basis decided to have a moratorium and not fish for 30 
days.  He went on further to say that was co-operation and 
dialogue and that they had a solution in place which was working 
because dialogue and co-operation was working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member now begin to believe that in order to have 
dialogue and co-operation it takes two trusting parties?  In this 
case where the aboriginal leaders have absolutely no trust in the 
minister and no trust in the government, how then can we have 
co-operation and dialogue and therefore how can we have some kind 
of co-operation with the minister and the department to solve 
this very serious issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B>  Madam Speaker, I do not think it 
gets us to a solution to be stating absolutely that this problem 
cannot be solved because aboriginal and non-aboriginal fishers in 
Atlantic Canada do not have trust in the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely true that fishers need to be able to build 
trust in the minister.  They are shaken by the fact that it was 
not just this minister who has been very absent and in fact 
stayed completely out of the arena when there was an urgent need 
for immediate leadership in the aftermath of the Marshall 
decision. 
However, I think they are badly shaken by the fact that the 
federal government and the Conservative government before it 
showed so little respect for the issue of treaty rights that they 
basically were forcing people into the courts, turning their 
backs on the important principle laid out in the recommendations 
of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples that we need to 
adopt an approach that says we negotiate, not litigate, these 
matters.

I want to state that the leader of the NDP in her speech did not

which called for a stay and a rehearing of the judgment so that 
they could work it out and get it right instead of getting it 
wrong and then the government going in with all kinds of 
weaknesses trying to negotiate, let alone legislate, an end to 
this problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was interested in her comments that slammed large companies as 
causing widespread poverty in the region affected. I wonder how 
she squares that with union support for her party that thrives in 
large successful corporate environments.  Is she totally against 
the corporations that fish in that area for lobsters?  She would 
rather see them all go out of business I take it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B>  Madam Speaker, again, I do not think 
it is very helpful to make sweeping statements about anything so 
ridiculous as condemning all large companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are talking about are fishing methods used by some of 
the large companies that virtually involve raping the ocean 
floor, ignoring the ecosystem, ignoring the food chain and 
ignoring the fact that if they are going to suck up everything 
that is in sight and throw fish overboard because they do not 
meet certain specifications what they will do is cause the kind 
of crisis that we now see in the east coast fishery.  I do not 
think it takes us anywhere to go down that blind path of 
ridiculous conclusions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to look carefully at what kind of fishing practices are 
sustainable and what ones are not.  For the benefit of all 
concerned, we need to adopt a regime of practices and regulations

Article 5 of that agreement provides that the signatories pledge 
to develop and to maintain a sustainable and cost-effective 
fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My problem here is that Canada must now deal with a requirement 
from the Supreme Court of Canada to the effect that we must 
guarantee adequate livelihood to aboriginal people. However, we 
still do not know what is meant by a cost-effective and, more 
importantly, a sustainable fishery, in the language and 
vocabulary used by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. 
Sustainable has to do with the proposed fishing gear, but will 
it be viable?

and without subsidy? What will this “without subsidy” mean? What 
do the words “viable” and “cost-effective” currently mean? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now, we are asking Gaspé Peninsula fishers to share their 
resources with aboriginal people. If the court forces them to do 
it, they will do it, but they will also share their misery. In 
the wintertime, they have to rely on employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How are we going to define the terms “viable” and 
“cost-effective”? Is the NDP prepared to team up with us to put 
pressure on the Liberal government to force them to develop that 
definition? We need it not only to solve the aboriginal crisis, 
but also to ensure sustainability in the fisheries of eastern 
Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me say first that I 
think the member who has raised the question would be the first 
to admit that the specific questions he raises are immensely 
complex, both in scientific and legal terms.  However, I agree 
absolutely with the point of the member's question, which is that 
the federal government has to be prepared to allocate the 
appropriate resources to ensure that we come up with answers to 
those questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation that the member describes in his own riding is one 
that is recognized by all of us who represent coastal 
communities.  It is a problem that results from the crisis 
management approach that this Liberal government and the 
Conservative government before it took by not recognizing that 
the concept of sustainability is absolutely crucial.  It is not a 
matter of unilateral regulations imposed by the federal 
government; it is a matter of recognizing that there have to be 
appropriate restrictions on fishing efforts for the benefit of 
all who are involved in the current fishery and those who want to 
depend on the fishery in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a matter of recognizing that solutions have to be local, 
regional, national and international.  That is why it is so 
important that we have international fishery agreements such as 
the one that is under discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a complicated scientific and legal issue and it is 
incumbent upon all of us to put pressure on the federal 
government to allocate the appropriate resources and to give the 
kind of respect that is needed to local fishers being involved in 
helping to devise the scheme and the regime that will govern the 
current and future fishery and to ensure that it is sustainable.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to rise in the emergency debate on the native commercial 
fishery on the east coast.  I will be sharing my time with my 
colleague for West Nova. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank our fisheries critic, the member for St. 
John's West, and our House leader, the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, for tabling this debate and 
bringing it to the floor of the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I tried several times to make a comment when the leader of the 
New Democratic Party was speaking.  I will make that comment now 
because I am sure the member must think that this is a catch and 
release fishery.  I would like to tell this House today that it 
is not a catch and release fishery.  This is very real to the 
people in eastern Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate comes as the result of the implications of a 
September 17 decision of the Supreme Court of Canada recognizing 
the treaty rights of the Mi'kmaq, Maliseet and Passamaquoddy 
people.  The Marshall decision states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1760 treaty does affirm the rights of the Mi'kmaq people to 
continue to provide for their own sustenance by taking the 
products of their hunting, fishing, and other gathering 
activities, and trading for what in 1760 was termed 
“necessaries”.  This right was always subject to regulation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This quote from the supreme court decision indicates that the 
impact of this decision could be far greater than simply fishing 
rights.  All crown based resources in Atlantic Canada, including 
logging, fishing and possibly even sub-surface rights, may be 
affected by this decision. 
That is why it is imperative to have direction and leadership 
from the government on this issue, something that has been 
lacking so far.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been 26 days since the supreme court decision and still 
the federal government does not have in place any sort of long 
term plan for regulating a sustainable fishery.  The lack of 
leadership the government has shown on this issue, and therefore 
the lack of confidence both native and non-native communities 
have in the minister and his department, will only worsen if we 
do not hear something concrete from the minister soon.  As it is, 
there has already been violence and near chaos in the fishery in 
Atlantic Canada.  Because the leadership has not been there to 
establish a clear plan for the future of the fishery this has 
occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a moment to reference the speech made 
yesterday by the member for Windsor—St. Clair.  In his comments 
on the throne speech he spoke well and he was extremely 
articulate.  In fact, he was too articulate.  He went on, and he 
went on, and he went on.  I thought for a moment that his 
grandmother had mistakenly vaccinated him with a gramophone 
needle.  I suspect that was not the case.  I reference it only 
because the government has been very quick to pat itself on the 
back whenever the occasion arises and it can find all kinds of 
accolades to congratulate itself with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In comparison, I point out the lack of comments, speeches and 
leadership, and the lack of a plan of any type coming from the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans before, during or after the 
September 17 decision of Regina v Marshall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also needs to be mentioned that former Liberal cronies in the 
Nova Scotia government did not even see fit to represent the 
province of Nova Scotia as an intervenor in the supreme court 
case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, it is not leadership from the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans that has put in place the 30 day moratorium.  Instead, 
this was the result of consultations and agreement among 33 of 
the 35 chiefs of the assembly of Atlantic Mi'kmaq chiefs who 
agreed to voluntarily suspend their fishing to allow all parities 
to reach a negotiated settlement.  Not the minister but the 
chiefs themselves put this in place.  Unfortunately, through 
continued government mismanagement and incompetence this is being 
rescinded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fisheries leaders have worked with native chiefs to find a way 
to recognize native treaty rights.  The result had been this 30 
day moratorium that should have given the government time to 
implement some plans and set in place guidelines and regulations 
for a long term, sustainable fishery, if we would have seen 
leadership.  It comes back time and time again to leadership and 
the confidence in this minister and in the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All fishers recognize the need to negotiate room in the fishery 
for native fishers, but conservation remains a concern for 
everyone.  The Sparrow decision acknowledged that there are 
arguments for limiting the aboriginal food fishery.  Conservation 
and resource management are justification for such measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have 4,900 fishing licences in the South Shore riding that I 
represent.  We have 1,700 lobster licences in the South Shore and 
West Nova.  All of these fishers fish under conservation.  They 
fish under rules.  They fish under management.  It is now the 
government's responsibility to ensure that conservation remains 
the priority of the department and that regulations are in place 
and enforced against everyone involved in the fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Resource management is based on conservation and regulations. 
Regulations were introduced back in the 1930s and continued with 
trap limits, size restrictions, licences, seasons and lobster 
fishing areas.  This and only this has preserved the resource. 
It is due to the fishers who have followed these regulations that 
we have the lucrative industry we have today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These rules apply evenly, whether they fish in Southwest Cove, 
Blandford, Indian Point, Port L'Hebert, Port Mouton, Little 
Harbour, Barrington, Clark's Harbour, Woods Harbour, Shag Harbour 
or Lunenburg.  Every one of those licences I mentioned earlier is 
more than a licence.  It also represents a family and in some 
cases two or more families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know where the Reform Party will stand on this issue.  It 
will argue that the native fishery is a fishery based on race. 
We must make sure that we do not fall into its trap.  There are 
answers, but inciting racism is not one of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister still has an opportunity.  It is still within his 
reach—

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Order, please. I do not 
think it is appropriate, especially in light of the words of the 
hon. member for Halifax earlier, to ascribe inciting racism to 
any party or any members in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  I withdraw those comments, Mr. Speaker. 
The point is well taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister still has an opportunity to reach a settlement with 
native and non-native fishers, but to do so he must show 
leadership.  Leadership requires taking a position and having a 
plan.  The government did not have a plan A let alone a plan B. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I state once again that this is about lack of leadership and the 
lack of confidence fishers have that their livelihoods are being 
protected. It is also about lack of confidence by first nations 
that the government intends to integrate them into the fishery. 
Separate seasons, no conservation and no way to regulate the 
native fishery will not integrate natives and non-natives in this 
fishery. It will and has caused violence.  Believe me when I say 
that this is only the tip of the iceberg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned earlier that Chief Justice Binnie stated in the 
Marshall case that the 1760 treaty right was always subject to 
regulation. This is not complicated.  This right was always 
subject to regulation.  Fishery representatives have stated from 
the beginning that the industry can accommodate the gradual 
integration of first nations if they fish the same seasons and 
have the same licensing structure and same regulations as 
non-natives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that because of the supreme court ruling we now have 
an important new player in the fishery.  If the government had 
shown any leadership at all, we would not be in the situation we 
are in tonight. 
<P><A NAME="LINK181"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta—South Richmond, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the priority native commercial fishery mandated by the 
Supreme Court of Canada in the Marshall decision reflects 
precisely the separate native commercial fishery imposed on 
British Columbia fishermen by the previous Conservative 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The regulations the minister is imposing on the east coast 
fishermen to manage the fallout from this decision are precisely 
the regulations that were imposed on the fishery in British 
Columbia and which have taken that fishery from profitability 
prior to 1992 to the point this year where there is no fishery on 
the Fraser. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should I believe the crocodile tears that are coming from 
the member who just spoke when the policy of his party was 
precisely the same as the policy mandated by the Supreme Court of 
Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, is the hon. member 
suggesting for a moment that we do not listen to the Supreme 
Court of Canada, that we are somehow above the law? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was an opportunity all along.  We were following this 
debate and the issue very closely.  The government failed to show 
leadership.  For the hon. member to raise questions and innuendo 
in the House on issues which he is obviously not cognizant of and 
for which he does not have the facts, including the aboriginal 
lobster fishery that existed previously, is a serious mistake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we have leadership from the government we have an opportunity 
to bring an end to the problem in this fishery right now.  We can 
put a moratorium in place.  However it was the Reform Party that 
did not want a moratorium.  It insisted that we could have a stay 
of proceedings.  Look where the stay of proceedings is right now. 
We are 72 hours from the end of this.  The stay of proceedings 
will not happen.  We went in the wrong direction with it.  We 
should have had a moratorium in the beginning.  That is the 
problem.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the concern of the 
member from the south shore of my beautiful province of Nova 
Scotia. 
Many of the fishermen in these communities we are talking about 
are in his riding. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2105"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spent an awful lot of time on the phone in the last few 
days talking to fishermen and representatives in the hon. 
member's riding.  A lot of them have said that possibly for the 
short term in terms of a solution to incorporate the aboriginal 
people into the fishery is a sort of voluntary buy-back program. 
There are 6,300 licences in the maritime provinces right now that 
incorporate lobster fishing.  Of those, roughly 10% belong to 
people who would voluntarily exit the industry if they got a 
decent price for their licences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member not agree that could be a short term 
solution as we work toward a long term goal?  The government 
could purchase these licences, transfer them over to the Mi'kmaw 
nation and everyone could fish under the same conservation 
guidelines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think the problem here 
is that the hon. member is mixing up short term and long term 
solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That could perhaps be part of a long term solution. It is a way 
to integrate the native fishery into the existing fishery. The 
bottom line for the fishery has to be very simple:  a commercial 
fishery based on rules and regulations, the same seasons, the 
same trap limits and the same lobster fishing areas for everyone 
in the fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can find ways and we can be innovative and we can bring the 
Mi'kmaw fishers into the fishery, but we have to do it under one 
set of rules with one set of regulations for everyone in the 
fishery. 
<P><A NAME="LINK183"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the supreme 
court rendered its decision on the Donald Marshall Jr. case on 
September 17.  Almost a month has gone by and only now has the 
government recognized the seriousness of this particular ruling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tonight's emergency debate is focused primarily on the fishery 
and more specifically on the lucrative Atlantic lobster fishery. 
Yet the supreme court ruling will have far greater implications 
for all future federal government negotiations with our 
aboriginal peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my hon. colleague from south shore has mentioned, this ruling 
will most definitely be used as a benchmark for future 
discussions over such things as logging rights, mineral rights 
and even land claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the importance of this decision, the government chose to 
postpone the opening of parliament by three weeks to introduce a 
new throne speech rather than reconvene parliament to address 
this situation.  Shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is more disturbing about the government's obvious contempt 
for the parliamentary process is the fact that Canada's fishery 
industry was almost totally ignored in the Speech from the 
Throne.  Except for a very brief mention in the speech, it would 
appear that this Liberal government could not care less about 
what happens to Atlantic Canada or the fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After watching the aftermath of the supreme court decision, can 
there be any doubt that the government was totally and utterly 
ill prepared to respond to the violent reaction among fishers 
that such a decision was bound to create?  It is absolutely 
unbelievable that the government did not have a strategy prepared 
for whether or not the supreme court ruled in favour of Mr. 
Marshall. That was exactly what happened. Instead of being a 
leader in this dispute, the minister has left it to the affected 
parties to come up with their own solutions to this impasse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Native leaders have just come up with their own solution. 
Following an emergency debate this afternoon, it was reported 
that native leaders have now decided to withdraw their support 
for a 30 day moratorium.  This means that native fishers will 
once again take to the waters without any government 
restrictions.  Such action will certainly heighten tensions in an 
already hostile environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Native leaders are charging the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans 
with negotiating in bad faith by imposing trap limits on two 
native reserves in Burnt Church and Indian Brook who refused to 
enter into a moratorium agreement along with the 33 other band 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Native leaders went to great pains to explain to the media that 
their original decision to agree to the moratorium was taken of 
their own accord and was not influenced by the request of the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.  It would appear as though they 
do not recognize the authority of the minister to impose a 
solution to this impending crisis in the fishery.  And why should 
they?  The minister and his own senior officials have shown 
clearly that they have no solution to offer either native or 
non-native fishers with regard to this dispute.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of the decision taken by native leaders today, it is 
vital that this minister and this government act immediately to 
establish at least a short term solution until a long term 
solution can be negotiated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was this government thinking?  Why was it so cocky that it 
could not even fathom the possibility of losing this case before 
the supreme court?  On what did it base this arrogance?  It could 
not be based on the Sparrow decision.  It could not be based on 
the recent logging disputes in New Brunswick.  The rulings in 
these cases should have triggered some kind of warning bell 
within the government.  Let me ask the question millions of 
Canadians have been asking themselves, one that our party 
repeated in the House today.  Why was the government not prepared 
to respond to this situation?  Why? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This case has been ongoing since 1993.  It is now 1999 and this 
government is acting as though the situation suddenly appeared 
from nowhere.  I have been in the House asking questions on the 
illegal lobster fishery that has been going on for the past two 
years.  The minister and his officials knew that was happening. 
He cannot say that he did not know.  He should have had a plan in 
place.  It is not acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our West Nova fishers perhaps are victims of their own success. 
Not so many years ago a lobster fisher was said to be involved in 
a poor man's profession.  There were virtually no markets for 
lobster.  Lobsters were used as fertilizers on our fields. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lucrative lobster industry did not just happen overnight. 
Through conservation, dedication and a lot of hard work, industry 
leaders slowly began developing markets for this crustacean.  We 
have gone from exporting lobster to the U.S. to opening lucrative 
markets in Europe.  A lobster licence that may have sold for $5 
30 years ago is now worth $250,000 in some cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lobster fishers risk huge amounts of money to participate in 
this lucrative fishery.  Besides the expense of a fishing 
licence, investments include the purchase of a vessel, fishing 
traps, bait, fuel and wages for their employees.  There is a huge 
overhead involved in this industry.  So much money is tied up in 
their investment that any major decrease in catches or a 
significant reduction in the price received for lobster would be 
catastrophic for many fishers, particularly those who have just 
recently entered into the fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us face it.  The government was caught with its pants down 
by not having a strategy in place to address the supreme court 
ruling.  Rather than admit its lack of preparedness and thereby 
ask the supreme court to grant a temporary stay of its ruling 
until new regulations could be established, the minister simply 
allowed a free for all within the Atlantic fishery which led to 
fear and ultimately violence.  This could all have been avoided 
had the minister of fisheries taken a leadership role in 
establishing temporary rules and regulations that would have 
encouraged dialogue leading to long term solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As tensions continued to rise, the minister kept telling 
Atlantic Canadians that he had the authority to impose 
restrictions based on conservation.  I asked the minister why, if 
he were legitimately concerned with conservation, he would allow 
anyone, native or non-native, to fish out of season. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supreme court has rendered its decision.  The native 
people's right to participate in the fishery has been upheld by 
Canada's highest court.  However, the decision did not clearly 
define how the fishery was to be conducted.  The supreme court 
decision left many questions unanswered, such as what constitutes 
a moderate livelihood and how those displaced by this decision 
will be compensated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many non-native fishers are frustrated by the lack of leadership 
coming from the minister's office.  The minister's initial 
reaction to the supreme court decision was to allow native 
fishers to participate in an unregulated, unrestricted fishery. 
Naturally, tensions were bound to escalate as commercial fishers 
feared the potential loss of their livelihoods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Atlantic fishery is worth over $1 billion to our economy.  I 
would consider that quite significant, yet this government has 
responded with a casual air of indifference toward this crisis.

with the recent decision by the aboriginal chiefs in Nova Scotia

idea for the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development

for his question.  I guess the answer is very obvious.  I have 
been saying all along that the minister should have been on the 
ground in Atlantic Canada three weeks ago, the day after the 
decision happened, so he could get a sense of what was happening.

sensed the tension that is in my part of the province.  The hon. 
member for South Shore and my colleagues from New Brunswick tell 
me the same.  The ministers should be on the ground.  They should 
be talking to be people who have a chance of resolving the

fears and the hurts that people are relating to him, are the same 
problems that we have been listening to for the last six or seven 
years in British Columbia.  They are problems that were brought 
on by the policy of the former Conservative government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solution that is proposed is the same solution.  The one 
season, one set of regulations solution is the same one that was

rejected wholeheartedly by the previous government and by this

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am still curious as to why the suggestion I made that a stay 
of judgment and a rehearing of the case be sought is rejected by 
my friend who just spoke.  The facts are clear that the 
moratorium will not work.  There is no compulsion on anybody to 
comply with the terms of the moratorium, but a stay of judgment 
would have some legal authority.  It would give voice to those 
people who are affected by the decision.  I would like to know 
why they reject that notion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am always impressed or not 
impressed by my hon. colleague's inflammatory remarks. It is by 
working together in trying to come to a solution that we can 
achieve peace and some kind of acceptable solution of the matter. 
It is not by driving a wedge between both parties or using 
derogatory or inflammatory comments that we will come to a 
solution.  We have to represent our people.  We have to speak out 
on their behalf.  We also have to encourage people to work 
together because that is the only way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once the court has made a decision it cannot be reheard.  There 
is no room for appeal or there is no ability to appeal a supreme 
court decision.  We have to work together instead of trying to 
drive a wedge, which my hon. colleague seems to be doing so well. 
I will have no part of that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Children and 
Youth), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to provide a 
preamble to the comments I want to make with the fact that 
throughout the great country of Canada for centuries aboriginal 
people have very generously stood by and watched the development 
of the country for commercial purposes, whatever the resources 
are.  It could be oil and gas.  It could be forestry if we look 
at B.C.  It could be mineral resources.  Aboriginals have reaped 
few of the benefits.  They have no resource sharing revenue 
mechanisms to have returns of revenues to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point in time in our history aboriginal people are 
saying that they want equity of access.  We want to be 
self-sustaining communities and we want to participate.  Quite 
clearly, to put this debate in context, we must understand that 
aboriginal people and non-aboriginal people have to work hard to 
allow cooler heads to prevail, to be reasoned and logical, and to 
try to find constructive solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In dealing with the debate and trying to help clarify the 
government's position on the Marshall decision, I am extremely 
impressed with my colleague, the minister of fisheries, who very 
appropriately went to the aboriginal people and the commercial 
fishery in the Atlantic region to deal with the problem.  It was 
very skilfully done.  The level of arbitration and consultation 
had proven results.  We have to work not only at dealing with an 
interim crisis but at a long term and strategic solution for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the supreme court ruling was handed down on September 17 
some people said we should have provided an instant analysis and 
announced some bold new initiatives.  Kind of a knee-jerk 
reaction was what was wanted.  Some critics even suggest we 
simply put down our fist and simply close the lobster fishery 
indefinitely.  Closing the fishery would have been in some 
respects an easy way out but would have been unproductive for all 
parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supreme court decision, my colleagues across the way should 
know, is the highest legal voice in the land and we must respect 
its rulings.  We cannot cherry pick on a decision that the 
supreme court makes when we feel that we do not like it or other 
people do not like it.  What kind of a country would we have? 
What would happen to the charter of rights under those 
conditions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case the court upheld the 1760 treaty with the Mi'kmaq 
but with the modern interpretation of what it means in 1999.  The 
judgment spoke of a moderate livelihood for natives and not an 
open-ended accumulation of wealth in the fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as important, the court also said the right could be 
regulated.  I am sure some people who want to inflame and create 
fear unnecessarily would have us believe that there would be 
anarchy on the seas, that native people would go out there 
indiscriminately after decades and years of depending on country 
foods and on the fishery for sustainability.  That they would go 
out there and pillage is ludicrous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we can see, the judgment is complex and there are still a 
number of issues to be resolved.  The minister immediately sought 
clarification of the ruling to provide the best possible response 
in the shortest period of time.  This analysis took less than two 
weeks when many other cases have required months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard in the House of Commons today a reference to what 
the opposition considers the fact, that this is a race based 
right.  It is very important to understand that the collective 
rights of aboriginal people are not race based.  Those comments 
are race based.  The collective rights of aboriginal peoples are 
human rights that accrue to them by virtue of their existence as 
people with their own cultural, legal and political traditions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aboriginal peoples have welcomed others to this land and have 
asked only for a reasonable accommodation of their fundamental 
human rights as individuals and as people.  With our particular 
brand of Canadian ingenuity we as Canadians have inherited and 
built upon a constitution that seeks accommodation between those 
people that were here and experienced colonization and all those 
that have come afterward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Mi'kmaq of the maritimes have waited 240 years to have their 
fundamental rights respected under a treaty entered with the 
crown, a treaty that is part of the constitutional fabric of the 
country.  The Mi'kmaq like other aboriginal people have been 
asked to respect the rule of law and they have done so by taking 
their claims to the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot express strongly enough my belief that Canadians of all 
origins are by nature a generous and accommodating people who 
respect the rule of law.  I have no doubt that we will continue 
to prove ourselves to be so in the future, but the will and the 
spirit to co-operate has to be there.  We cannot achieve that 
level of accommodation if we create fear in the public.  It is 
our responsibility to instil hope.  It is our responsibility to 
be responsible in what we say to the public.  If we inflame with 
those kinds of comments we are doing nothing to resolve the 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for the House to know the roles the minister of 
fisheries has played.  Instead of closing the fishery, as I 
mentioned earlier, the minister took the harder road of 
negotiations.  The minister and the government wanted to respect 
the supreme court ruling.  There were other suggestions that were 
not taken up for obvious reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where others might have given up the minister continues to seek 
solutions through dialogue and co-operation.  The minister 
continues to be involved on a daily basis.  He is in constant 
touch with the aboriginal leaders, the commercial fishery, 
government officials and Atlantic premiers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Early on the Marshall decision was a prominent issue when the 
Atlantic Council of Fisheries Ministers met in Quebec City last 
month.  There was a clear recognition from all jurisdictions of 
the need to clarify the implication of the court decision and to 
put in place a management regime.  The council recommended that 
regime must ensure the conservation objectives are not 
compromised and be fair to other interests in the fisheries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conservation is one issue but there is another issue.  We can 
play on that.  We can use that to be partisan.  We can use that 
to be smaller than we should be.  We can do that and that is 
about economic preservation.  Major investments have been made by 
the commercial fishermen out there.  They have increased the 
value of lobster licences.  It is a major investment.  It is 
their retirement package.  If we have a sudden influx of other 
people who would take up in that industry it devalues that 
investment.  That is a major concern.  That is an economic 
preservation concern.  That is another thing to think about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However it is quite interesting if put it into the proper 
context.  On district 23 in the Burnt Church area of Miramichi 
Bay the number of lobster trapped used by aboriginal people adds 
up to less than 1% of the number of traps used by the 
non-commercial fishery.  Is that a conservation crime?  Is that 
something that at this point we will have to be totally 
unreasonable about?  It is something we should think about.  We 
have to put everything in context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree that we should be looking at finding a solution.  We all 
witnessed the unfortunate incidents in the days following the 
court.  In conclusion, we have to work hard.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said in the beginning, closing the fishery would have been 
the easy solution, the quick fix.  But there is no quick fix on 
an issue that affects people's rights, lives and livelihoods.  I 
am confident that the minister's staff and department will 
continue working in the right direction to better the lives of 
everyone involved. 
<P><A NAME="LINK187"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate the hon. member for her 
remarks.  They were very insightful, passionate and sincere.  I 
could not agree more with the need for reasoned and moderate 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, along that line I would ask the hon. member, in all 
sincerity, that if this was the true intention, why did her 
government, three days after the Marshall decision was handed 
down, decide to prorogue parliament, thus hamstringing and in no 
small way completely doing away with the ability to debate this 
issue in the House of Commons?  It was the Progressive 
Conservative Party that had to call for this debate.  It was not 
done voluntarily by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is the case and if debate is what will lead to a 
solution—and I agree with the member that it will—why did her 
government do away with that ability by proroguing this House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think the issue 
on proroguing the House is a red herring.  It is irrelevant to 
the very important issue at hand.  We had a lot of things to 
consider.  There were a number of requirements that had to be 
met.  We were preparing for a throne speech and the installation 
of a new governor general.  Those are not excuses; those are 
reasons.  However, that does not take away from the importance of 
what was occurring, which was demonstrated in the action that the 
minister took.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like my hon. colleague opposite to repeat 
part of her speech. I want to be absolutely sure that I 
understood the interpreter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When she says that catches by native fishers represent 
approximately 1% of commercial catches, is she not contradicting 
the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans who says that we must 
ensure conservation of our stocks? One percent is nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know if she is contradicting the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans and if the problem is more of a management 
problem. How will the fishing be done—that is the problem we 
have with non native fishers—and, particularly, who will be 
doing it? That is the problem. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would never 
consider contradicting the minister.  The minister indicated that 
conservation is important, and it is an important issue, not just 
for the fisheries but for every resource.  That is an important 
issue and it is a general statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I did say was that the number of lobster traps used in 
District 23, Burnt Church, on Miramichi Bay by aboriginal 
lobster fishers adds up to less than 1% of the number used by the 
commercial fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can assume whatever we want, but what I went on to say was 
that there are other considerations besides conservation. 
Conservation is always important when we are dealing with a 
resource, but there is also economic preservation.  That was the 
point I was making.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have great respect for the hon. 
member and the area from which she comes.  If the member believes 
that this minister is doing such a fine job, then would she not 
try to convince her minister, because the people's perception of 
politics is their reality, and the Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development to get out of Ottawa, to get down to the 
maritime region and to deal with this issue firsthand, instead of 
dealing with it by long distance from Ottawa?  Would the member 
not make that suggestion to her minister and make it an 
imperative motion for him to get down there immediately to deal 
with this issue?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague 
knows that this is important to the minister.  I also know that 
the minister has a great deal of respect for members of the House 
and would want to be here to respond to their questions as he did 
today in question period.  He would want to be here to respond to 
those members who represent the people in the area, and he has 
been dealing with those people continuously.  That is not an 
issue.  The minister has demonstrated quite clearly that he is 
capable, committed and has the confidence to do the job. 
<P><A NAME="LINK190"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charles Hubbard (Miramichi, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Miramichi, as the hon. member opposite noted, is where Burnt 
Church is, where Red Bank is and where Eel Ground is, three of 
the reserves that I represent in the House.  Listening to some of 
the debate tonight I wonder how well some of our native people 
are being represented in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Across this country there are nearly one million status and 
non-status people who were the original people of this country. I 
take affront with some of the statements made in the House in 
terms of the rights those native people have and should have 
under the agreements our ancestors made with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also have a very valuable industry in my constituency, which 
is fishing.  Tonight we are talking about lobsters, but in terms 
of the fishery it is a much broader issue than just lobsters. 
Lobsters over the last 40 to 50 years have become one of our most 
valuable species, along with our snow crabs.  Those two species 
provide a lot of income to the people along the Baie de Chaleurs 
and Miramichi Bay areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have to recognize what happened and be very aware of the 
situation that developed which pitted one group of people against 
another group, the commercial fishermen.  I would like to point 
out to the House that some commercial fishermen are natives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aboriginal fishery strategy over the past decade has offered 
fishing licences and in fact the Burnt Church reserve has 
approximately 10 licences.  It is the same with the reserve at 
Big Cove where they have fishing licences and also with Indian 
Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a very unfortunate incident that happened on that Sunday 
some weeks ago when fishermen decided to take the law into their 
own hands.  There was a certain degree of frustration because 
they saw, in terms of the supreme court ruling, that their 
industry and their livelihood was at stake.  I met with some of 
those fishermen.  They came to my office in great numbers on the 
Wednesday prior to the incident that happened on Sunday.  It seems 
that there were other people who came into our area.  There were 
lobster boats and commercial boats that came from outside the 
Miramichi constituency to fish on the shores of Burnt Church. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to recognize the value of conservation.  The inner 
Miramichi Bay in the fall of the year has very warm water.  The 
lobsters come to change their shells, to moult.  It is a nursery 
where the lobsters procreate and develop for the next season 
ahead.  With that, the commercial fishermen saw a danger to their 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have to recognize that for the native people of Atlantic 
Canada the treaty rights they obtained as a result of the 
Marshall decision created a great period of exhilaration, a great 
victory they had won, a point they had been striving for and 
reaching for over many years.  Many of the native people took to 
the shores to set their pots and fishing traps to see what 
lobsters they could obtain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk of this in terms of wisdom.  Many of us are pointing at 
certain people who have made mistakes.  I would like to point 
out, Mr. Speaker, that when I point at you with one finger, I am 
actually pointing back at myself with my other three.  I think a lot of us 
in the House tonight, as we try to find some villain in this, are 
actually doing three times as much damage to ourselves as we are 
to the people we are pointing toward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some will criticize the supreme court.  They feel that the 
supreme court did not have enough wisdom in terms of the outcome 
of the decision it rendered.  The court might have stated in its 
own behalf that it recognized rural Canada and especially the 
Atlantic provinces if it had foreseen the difficulties, but that 
wisdom was not seen by the supreme court.

<A HREF="#LINKT92"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some will criticize the minister, but the minister has to 
look at those judgments.  He and his staff and the Department of 
Justice have to decide just what is said in those pages that have 
been written by the justices.  It takes some time for that to be 
brought to light and for the proper decisions to be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some will criticize the fishermen who were taken back by the 
decision.  They were very much concerned that an immediate 
process should evolve and that the minister should simply say 
“no native fishermen”.  That would not be a wise decision.  The 
native people have as much right to the resources of the country 
as anyone else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of perspective, we must mention that the fishery has 
grown over the years.  In the 1960s a commercial lobster licence 
could be obtained for about 25 cents.  Today licences are worth 
somewhere between $50,000 and $100,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have to recognize that over the years the lobster 
industry has been developed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read an article some years ago about teachers being sought in 
the southern part of New Brunswick.  At that time, during the 
great depression, teachers often boarded with parents in the 
community.  One promise that one school board made in southern 
New Brunswick was that no one boarding at their house would have 
to eat lobsters more than twice a week.  Lobsters were frowned 
upon in terms of being a commodity and only poor people ate 
lobsters.  Today, of course, such is not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to recognize that in Atlantic Canada the fishery has 
been developed.  The various species all have different values. 
We talk about smelts, clams, oysters and the list goes on.  In 
fact, the Marshall case dealt with eels.  The fact is that all of 
them will have to eventually be translated into accommodations in 
terms of how native and non-native fishermen will approach the 
fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that not only have native people been restricted in 
terms of the fishery; the people on the west coast talk about the 
public right to fish.  On the Atlantic side we do not have the 
public right to fish.  Fishing has been closely regulated and 
people have obtained fishing licences as a result of having paid 
fees over the years which have been applied by certain 
regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that in some way this matter can be resolved.  In the 
Miramichi constituency we have people with fear.  People are 
afraid that others may infringe on their rights.  We have had 
burnings, we have had trucks destroyed.  There was a special 
healing site that the native people in Burnt Church 
burned by fire.  A house has been destroyed.  All of those things 
have created great problems in our community.  With it, people 
who have lived side by side for some 200 years are suddenly no 
longer great friends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that in the debate tonight we can bring some reason to 
this problem that has been created in the Atlantic fishery, that 
people can restore some faith in their ability to relate and 
understand other people and that, above all, in the near future 
we can develop a fishery which can accommodate people, both 
native and non-native, and that the fishery can work in the best 
interests of the economy of Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wish to point out one final point.  Burnt Church is a 
very isolated reserve.  It consists of between 900 and 1,100 
people, depending upon the season.  The people of Burnt Church 
have great economic needs.  I think that is true of a great 
number of reserves across the country.  There are some 600 of 
them.  Many of them lack the economic resources to develop their 
own people and to provide a livelihood for their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us put all of that into perspective and hope that we as 
Canadians and as parliamentarians can join together to see a 
resolution to this great problem that will accommodate most of 
our people.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta—South Richmond, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it was suggested that returning to court for a stay of 
judgment and a rehearing was cherry picking.  It is not the case. 
The purpose of returning to court would be to avoid the type of 
confrontation we have seen and to seek a clarification of the 
court's intent in this decision.

</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, would they permit an infringement of the treaty 
right that they recommended?  I refer to paragraph 75 of the 
Gladstone decision where the court itself recognized that others 
had acquired rights to fish.  It said that reconciliation of 
aboriginal societies with the rest of Canadian society may well 
depend on achieving that balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member opposite not see a value in returning to the 
court and getting the court's opinion on how these conflicting 
rights could be adequately addressed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charles Hubbard:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not a lawyer and I 
certainly have to take under advisement what the hon. member has 
asked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The conclusion I come to is that since the early 1980s we have 
brought the Constitution home and the supreme court is the 
supreme court.  Certainly the Department of Justice may work out 
with members of the court an interpretation of some of their 
statements in terms of that judgment, but we cannot turn our 
backs on a supreme court decision.

which is adjacent to the riding of Acadie—Bathurst. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sympathize with the problems in his riding, but they are the 
same as in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague told us that fishers went to see him in his office 
on Wednesday, and all the problems occurred on Sunday. Then we 
learned that the minister went there two weeks later. I would 
like my colleague to comment on this situation. Is he 
disappointed with his minister's attitude or does he approve of 
the minister's slowness in handling this whole issue? There 
is a crisis in our region, and we must take action. 
I think the minister should not even be here tonight. He should 
be in Atlantic Canada trying to solve the problems of native and 
non-native fishers. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charles Hubbard:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in New Jersey on 
Thursday of last week I met with a number of people and I visited 
the Burnt Church reserve a short time later.  I made a statement 
that generally all people are good people but there are people in 
every group who want to create major problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that in terms of what happened there, we were unfortunate 
to have outsiders come to Burnt Church.  It was also unfortunate 
that some of the fishermen did what they did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the afternoon in question, members of the MFU and I spoke 
with the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.  I called him on the 
phone and he was readily available.  We discussed the problem in 
the presence of the MFU representatives. We said to them that 
there should be a solution early next week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the boats came from outside the constituency on the weekend 
certainly was a major factor.  From that, the Sunday morning 
episode resulted and then the Sunday night episode shortly after 
I visited.  I was down there that evening from about 6.30 to 7 
p.m. and shortly toward dark those vehicles were destroyed.  It 
is a very unfortunate thing, but the point is that it happened 
and we all have to live with it.  Hopefully the minister in the 
fine efforts he made in the week since has brought some 
resolution to it.  He has met with the 30 chiefs. He certainly 
had great courage in doing so and I want to commend him for it. 
He met with the MFU and hopefully we can resolve this.

Speaker, native communities, like many non-native communities, 
are in some economic difficulties.  The hon. member for Miramichi 
mentioned that.  There are a lot of native communities in 
difficulties.  That is why it is so important now that there is 
an opportunity for them to have some work in the fishing industry 
we make sure that 10 years from now there are still lobster out 
there.  That is going to benefit both communities.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am happy to 
engage in the debate this evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to start by focusing my remarks on the supreme 
court. I do not doubt for one moment its sincerity.  I do not 
doubt for one moment its character or the integrity of the nine 
justices who sit on the supreme court, as I do not doubt the 
integrity and the character of members opposite and of members in 
other political parties who hold different views than I do on 
this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope that members opposite would refrain from attacking 
the character and motives of people in this party every time the 
Reform Party disagrees with them on a philosophical basis on 
issues that are so fundamentally important to the future of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In saying that, I want to focus on the supreme court.  Many 
people and many members in the House look at the Supreme Court of 
Canada in awe.  They somehow see these nine justices as being 
virtually infallible and that somehow we have to accept anything 
handed down from the supreme court as being the final word.  It 
is as if these people were anointed or appointed by some higher 
being, by some deity that is unknown to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that the nine justices on the supreme court were all 
appointed by partisan prime ministers, either Conservative or 
Liberal. Over the past 30 or 40 years all the existing justices 
on the supreme court have received their elevation to the bench 
in that manner. While I would never want to accuse any of the 
justices on the supreme court of being partisan, it is important 
to note that I recognize that they are appointed within a certain 
milieu, a certain political prevailing philosophy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For about three decades or more that certain political 
prevailing philosophy can be characterized in several different 
ways.  We could call it more and more the posture of the 
politically correct.  We could call it progressive enlightened 
thinking.  Or, let me borrow from Thomas Sowell, the great 
American writer who said in his excellent book <I>The Vision of 
the Anointed</I> that these people have become enraptured with a 
certain vision that is predominantly a Liberal left vision.  The 
philosophy of that is so evident in our political, social and 
academic institutions. It has become progressively more so over 
the last three or four decades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not saying that these are bad people.  We are not saying 
that their characters are flawed.  We are not saying that they 
ought to be harshly rebuked and criticized for the views they 
hold.  What we do say is that they are fundamentally wrong in 
their thinking.  That is the problem we have with this issue 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people who embrace this vision of the anointed, again to 
borrow from Thomas Sowell, assume their own moral superiority 
because they are convinced of the rightness of their cause. 
Therefore, they believe they are somehow morally on a higher 
plane than anybody else.  They believe that anybody who disagrees 
is not only morally wrong, but is in sin.  We can see the 
evidence of that in the debate in this chamber from time to time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, these people who are ensconced in this vision of the 
anointed also tend to insulate themselves from the reality of the 
impacts of their own decisions.  They do not want to see the 
reality of the decisions they make.  When they make a decision 
and feedback comes back to them that somehow something has really 
gone wrong, they point their fingers at anyone and everyone and 
any other thing they can possibly dream up rather than seriously 
examine from an intellectually honest point of view their own 
positions and decisions to see how they affected the outcomes 
that they do not really want to see.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit that the Supreme Court of Canada is very much caught up 
in this vision of the anointed.  The political institutions of 
this country, the Liberal Party in particular, are also very much 
caught up in this vision of the anointed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have is a people who fervently believe that they can 
right the wrongs of history by ignoring the lessons of history. 
They do not want to give any regard to history's lessons.  They 
do not want to give regard to basic democratic principles and 
values.  They think they can ignore basic democratic principles 
and values and that because they are somehow more clever, gifted 
or more able, they can concoct some kind of new societal 
arrangement that will be successful while ignoring those 
principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit that 10,000 years of human history has proven that 
cannot be achieved.  Without democracy we return to the barbarism 
that all our ancestors experienced in the past.  Regardless of 
who we are in this House, that is where we came from.  We learned 
that through 10,000 years of recorded human history.  We learned 
from experience.  We learned by trial and error and many 
different kinds of societal arrangements that the best way to 
arrange our affairs so that we can have peace, harmony, 
prosperity and human rights is through basic democratic 
institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cornerstone or founding principle of democracy is the 
equality of all people before the law.  We cannot have it any 
other way.  We cannot be so smart, egotistical or arrogant as to 
believe we can somehow rearrange society and give special status 
and rights to be assigned on whatever basis, blindly ignoring the 
lessons of history and basic democratic principles and expect 
that we will have peace and harmony in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit that the evidence of that is before us today.  We have 
had three or four decades of successive policies emanating from 
government that have tried to encourage Canadians, aboriginal 
Canadians in particular, that this somehow can happen and that it 
somehow can work.  Not just in the case of the east coast lobster 
fishery but right across the country we are seeing more and more 
evidence that not only does it not work but it is leading to real 
conflict and disharmony in our society.  It is not healthy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not doubt the sincerity of the justices on the supreme 
court and that they were trying to do the right thing.  I 
question how they could come up with the decision they did when 
the treaty of 1760 on which they relied to render this decision 
does not even mention fish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly what they were trying to do was right the wrongs of 
history by reading into this treaty things that were not there 
and trying to create some kind of different societal structure 
that would in their view be a benefit to the Mi'kmaq people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As much as there are people in the east coast lobster fishery 
right now who are being displaced and are hurting financially and 
will continue to hurt financially until this issue is resolved, 
the people who will pay the biggest price for this folly before 
it is all said and done will be the Mi'kmaq people themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say it again for anybody in the House who cares to 
listen.  The people who will pay the biggest price before it is 
all said and done will be the Mi'kmaq people themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless the government can demonstrate leadership on this and can 
break with its failed vision of the past and embrace the genuine 
basic principles of democracy and encourage our aboriginal 
brothers and sisters to do the same, we will be in real trouble. 
We can see it coming everywhere.  I take absolutely no pleasure 
in saying this but it is coming.  It can be seen everywhere:  the 
Musqueam in Vancouver, the east coast lobster fishery, in 
Manitoba and in Northern B.C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is coming because we have had this political rhetoric in 
Canada that has encouraged aboriginal people to go down this 
path.  Think about that for a minute.  Talk about encouraging 
aboriginal people in the wrong direction. 
I would wager that the sons and daughters of members in this 
place are not trying to forge a future for themselves in a 
fishery somewhere.  The resource industries in Canada are mature 
to say the least and some of them are over mature as my colleague 
from Delta pointed out.  Some of these are declining industries.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The future economy in Canada and in the world is in high 
technology, in transportation and in the global economy.  It is 
not in fish.  The people who are in the fishery right now are 
there because they have a historical attachment to it.  They have 
a history with it and are earning a living right now.  I would 
wager that if we were to ask virtually any of those individuals, 
were they 18 or 19 and had to make the decision all over again, 
they would not be going into a fishery.  They would be going into 
something else where they could see a much more sustainable and 
prosperous future for themselves and their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are telling all other Canadians is that they should get 
into the information age and the technological age and think 
about the future in terms of global trade and global economies. 
We then turn to the aboriginal people and tell them to think of 
the future in terms of the fishery and logging, in terms of 
resource extraction and those industries that are already mature 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is only within democratic institutions that the value and 
worth of the ordinary individual is found.  When we get into 
assigning rights and status on the basis of anything other than 
individual equality, we end up going backward in time.  We end up 
building walls rather than bridges and we end up creating real 
conflict in society over time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supreme court and the democratic institutions of the country 
genuinely believe they can achieve what human beings have never 
been able to achieve in the past 10,000 years.  The evidence that 
they cannot is before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Marshall decision from the supreme court should be a real 
wake-up call for everyone who is considering what the Nisga'a 
agreement means.  The treaty I am talking about in this instance 
is a very thin document.  The Nisga'a treaty is 200 pages long 
with 400 pages of appendices and 50 or so agreements that have 
yet to be negotiated and do not even fall within the agreement as 
it exists today.  Each one of those conditions is subject to a 
supreme court decision at some point in the future.  Consider 
what that might mean for our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people who have negotiated these treaties have no idea. When 
we suggested in the spring that they submit that treaty to the 
supreme court for a reference so we could find out what the 
supreme court's view would be on the application of the charter 
of rights and freedoms and what the supreme court's view would be 
with respect to the constitutionality of that agreement, those 
people were so arrogant and so sure of themselves, again assuming 
their own moral superiority, that they looked at us, tried to 
mischaracterize what we were saying and ignored the warnings we 
were trying to give them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been trying to give these warnings for six years in this 
place.  We have been trying for six years to say, “hold on, we 
think you'd better think this through again.  You'd better take 
another look at it”.  It is not because we question their 
character, not because we question their motives, not because we 
think they are bad people, because we do not, but because we know 
they are fundamentally wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that the empirical evidence supports us.  The 
empirical evidence supports exactly what the Reform Party of 
Canada has been saying since its inception.  When we break away 
from the equality of all Canadians, when we start assigning 
special status or special rights or special access to resources, 
when we start assigning different rights to people on any basis, 
we have a recipe for disaster.  We have a recipe for disaster on 
the east coast of Canada right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know what the answer is but I do know how we got here. 
I know the government needs to take leadership.  It needs to 
demonstrate that it has the ability to lead and to govern for 
peace, order and good government which it fails to do. 
It routinely allows decisions to be made by the supreme court so 
it can duck the responsibility and the potential follow up for 
making those decisions itself.  That is why we are in the 
predicament we are in today.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit that there are people in the federal government and the 
justice department who are constitutional and legal experts. 
There has to be ways of dealing with this issue that will be 
fair, affordable and lead to a resolve of the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very first responsibility of this government or any federal 
government has to be to reach out to those aboriginal people who 
are caught betwixt and between and tell them that their existence 
with special status has never been of any benefit to them at all. 
We need to rethink the relationship between the aboriginal people 
and the Government of Canada and the rest of Canada. Obviously 
the existing relationship has not worked to the benefit of 
aboriginal people and has not worked to the benefit of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time that we broke from the failed thinking and failed 
policies of the past and came up with some new ideas, some new 
visions and some new ways to move forward.  If we do not do that, 
I fear that we are in for more conflict, more unrest and more of 
these kinds of events that have been occurring on the east coast 
of Canada.  I do believe that there is a potential for that if 
this government does not demonstrate that it has the ability to 
lead and the ability to change its thinking on these fundamental 
issues.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I can see that many members want to put questions, 
so I would like to give the hon. member for Skeena the 
opportunity to speak while the Ministers of Fisheries and Oceans 
and Indian Affairs are here, by asking him the following 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the House of Commons has recognized the need to hold, on 
this very first day of the session, after the government has 
prorogued Parliament, an emergency debate on the fishery crisis 
and the Marshall judgment, would it not have been important for 
the government to immediately re-establish both the standing 
committees on aboriginal affairs and fisheries, so that we could 
find out who would be representing the government on these 
committees? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members have told us tonight “We are not lawyers nor 
constitutional law experts”. 
This committee would have had the opportunity and the money to 
examine the ins and outs of this issue and help us make a more 
informed decision on what is happening here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have the feeling that the government, just like the minister 
who would like us to believe that he is doing something, would 
have us go round in circles. I would remind the House that we do 
not even have the right to vote on the issue being debated here 
tonight. In the end, I feel like I may be losing my time here, 
when there are things to be negotiated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, to be able to inform the people we represent, 
we should have access to correct and relevant information. I 
would like to know if my hon. colleague from Skeena is as eager 
as I am to find out the truth and to see if the government is 
indeed out of money. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I certainly appreciate my 
friend's question.  We have sat on the fisheries committee 
together in the past and I have appreciated his contribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the member would agree with me, since we have both sat 
on committees for a number of years now, in some cases together 
and in some cases apart, that the Liberal government is not 
fundamentally interested in having committees decide anything. It 
does not really want the committees to get into these issues and 
examine them because the committee might make some 
recommendations that it would not want to have to deal with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the hon. member would tend to agree with me that the 
government really does not know how to deal with the issue in 
front of it right now. 
It is almost like somebody rolled a grenade into the room.  The 
government does not know how to deal with it but it certainly 
does not want to allow any other body other than itself to come 
up with the final decision on it.  Part of the problem with our 
parliamentary system is that it is just not functioning the way 
it is supposed to.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest to the 
comments of the member for Skeena and the fact that he believes 
there are enough constitutional lawyers, enough legal opinions 
and enough bureaucrats in Ottawa to help find some sort of 
solution to this problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member not agree with me that the real solution to 
this issue probably lies in the fishermen themselves and in the 
coastal communities of Atlantic Canada?  In the last 26 days that 
this decision has been rendered, we have heard time and time 
again that the aboriginal people and non-aboriginal people have 
been getting together to come up with short term and then long 
term solutions for the long term viability and conservation 
minded aspects of the fishery.  The problem of course is that the 
government is not giving any human or financial resources to aid 
those people in their consultations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member not agree that a better solution to this would 
be from the ground up instead of the top down? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would have to agree with 
my friend that in most cases bottom up solutions are better. 
Being a member of a populace party, we certainly believe in 
populism and in grassroots democracy. I would like to think that 
there is hope for a resolution along those lines and maybe there 
will be.  I am not saying there will not.  Far be it for me to 
throw cold water on that idea.  Obviously something has to be 
done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have right now are two fundamentally competing 
interests.  Human nature being what it is, it is going to be very 
difficult to reconcile those competing interests.  Whether it can 
be done from the bottom up or not remains to be seen.  Hopefully 
there is some goodwill on both sides.  Hopefully there is an 
attempt being made as we speak to reconcile and to move forward 
in some spirit of cooperation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen other examples in other parts of Canada where we 
have competing interests and where there is a real economic value 
at stake, it is often difficult if not impossible to have that 
kind of reconciliation from the ground up.  I am not saying it 
cannot happen.  I am just saying that I am not holding my breath.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, our 
national anthem states that this is our home and native land. 
That applies to all Canadians.  The Mi'kmaq and the fishermen of 
Atlantic Canada have lived side by side in peace for hundreds of 
years.  All of a sudden one segment of society feels like it has 
a second class citizenship, that their citizenship is not a full 
citizenship anymore and we have bad relations all of a sudden. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague has commented on the bad situation that is 
occurring.  Before I ask him to comment further on that, I would 
like to say that our national anthem also says that we stand on 
guard for thee.  I would like to know who is standing guard for 
the nation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every group has its defenders.  Every group has people who speak 
for it.  I would like to know who is going to speak for the 
nation in this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, speaking for the nation is 
the role of the federal government.  Obviously right now we feel 
that it is sadly failing in that capacity.  There is no 
demonstrated leadership from the federal government right now and 
that is a big part of the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In speaking to the first comment made by my hon. colleague, I 
would have to go back to the comments I made in my intervention. 
When we break from basic democratic principles and values, when 
we wander away from the principle of the equality of all citizens 
before the law, regardless of how good our intentions are, 
regardless of how noble our motives are, we are creating the 
environment that leads to the kind of conflict and confrontation 
that we see today.

a way that we can move forward in peace and harmony.  When we

the Nass River to the Nisga'a.  Four other bands are competing 
for access to that resource whose treaty claims have not been 
negotiated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a treaty is a modern version of the 1760 treaty in 
Marshall that the supreme court ruled on.  It is a much expanded 
version, by the way, in that it gives natives a priority right to 
fish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seeing that there is so much consternation in the House today I 
would like to ask the member to his knowledge what position have 
other parties taken with regard to the Nisga'a treaty, given its 
close proximity in relationship to the treaty we are discussing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, to the very best of my 
knowledge every party in the House save the Reform Party of

indicated that they will be voting in favour of the treaty. Every 
party has expressed a desire to have the treaty passed with 
speed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly that is a good question by the member from Delta because 
with the problems that we see coming out of the supreme court in 
the Marshall case, based on this ancient treaty which as I said 
is very thin, we can just imagine the kinds of problems that 
could arise from the Nisga'a treaty.  It really bears sober 
second thought.  It really bears a good debate and it really 
bears careful consideration of the kinds of problems we might be 
opening ourselves to down the road, given the instance of the 
Marshall decision and how it has impacted on the east coast 
fishery.

I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Malpeque. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has been an interesting debate, a fruitful debate. 
Sometimes I wondered what the debate was about.  We had a lot of 
discussion about the Supreme Court of Canada and about judicial 
law making.  That is a valuable subject but it might deserve an 
arena in its own right.  It does touch on the issue of the 
fisheries and the issue of aboriginal rights, and I will treat it 
only in that context and where it does have a relevance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The important thing to remember here is the maxim of the wisest 
of common law legal philosophers, Jeremy Bentham.  He was saying 
that law was not made by any single person or institution.  He 
used his great phrase “by judge and company”.  When one asked 
him what he meant he said it was not simply the judges but it was 
the people who make the laws, the people who apply the laws and 
the parties who bring cases to the court.  I will have something 
to say on that in a moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been criticism of our supreme court but I suggested at 
the time of the adoption of the charter of rights and freedoms in 
1982 that it would effect fundamental changes in our 
constitutional system and it logically should be accompanied by a 
reform, a recasting of the supreme court and the judicial role. 
Not having had this advice followed, I have sympathy for judges 
who are under attack.  What I am about to suggest is a larger 
role for the judiciary and for other constitutional players. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most thoughtful of our members of the press gallery, 
Jeffrey Simpson, wrote several weeks ago in an article that 
reminded me of something I wrote many years ago on the discussion 
of Brown v Board of Education which has been much criticized in 
the House and elsewhere but by people who never the read the 
judgment.  This so often happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Brown v Board of Education is really two cases.  One is the 
actual judgment on school segregation.

<A HREF="#LINKT100"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second is the follow-up decision in Brown v Board of 
Education.  That is where we get the famous phrase which was 
borrowed directly from English law in the 17th century of moving 
with all deliberate speed.  It is a phrase taken from equity.  It 
was used by Mr. Justice Felix Frankfurter, the greatest of the 
Roosevelt appointments to the supreme court.  It directed 
attention to the basic point that complex social problems require 
complex solutions which need complex evidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is where the United States supreme court has perfected a 
role that may be helpful to us to study.  The solution of 
fisheries problems on the east coast, the solution of logging 
problems on the west bank of Okanagan Lake, and the solution of 
other problems of aboriginal rights should be done best against a 
background of social economic evidence.  We have in this country, 
because I see them consulted internationally, experts in economic 
resources and economic resource management.  This is the sort of 
case for wise decision that requires taking that type of evidence 
into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The big thrust of the second decision in Brown v the Board of 
Education was that there was a role for a third party in 
monitoring the solution.  The emphasis of the phrase “with all 
deliberate speed” was that it would not be a solution achieved 
in one day, or in a single ruling, but might require a number of 
years of supervision, monitoring, consulting with and directing 
the parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is where a role, whether it is executive, legislative, 
judicial, or a combination of both, is an essential part of the 
problem solving.  In the American context it was clearly an ample 
judicial role.  This in the Canadian context has to be borne in 
mind in connection with the nature of our supreme court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very much surprised and a little disturbed because I think 
it follows from lack of study of supreme court decisions a 
suggestion of class bias in the Supreme Court of Canada.  I would 
not have found that at all.  I would have suggested a highly 
technical approach that sometimes would benefit by more opening 
to sociological facts, economic facts which are the root of 
decision making.  In this case I would call for a Brandeis brief. 
The whole nature of jurisprudence before the constitutional 
court is the adducing of evidence, social and economic evidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of fisheries it would be the nature of the resource, 
how much is there, what proposals cans be made for its 
utilization and for its sharing.  Here I take us back to one of 
the nicer phrases of our supreme court, one of the wiser 
counsels, the obligations to negotiate and to negotiate in good 
faith.  It is a very positive factor in my approach to the 
Nisga'a treaty which I believe the chief and council of the 
Nisga'a band negotiated in good faith. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be less supportive of other initiatives in this area if 
I did not have the same feeling of satisfaction that negotiation 
in good faith involves a concept of recognition of good 
neighbourliness.  These are phrases that the World Court has used 
but they apply equally in the common law from which the Polish 
judge who cited them borrowed those phrases directly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are important gaps in our law as to aboriginal rights and 
treaty rights.  One of these very obviously is the meaning of 
aboriginal rights and treaty rights.  They are in sections 25 and 
35 of the charter, but they were put there as what is called 
saving clauses.  There is a Latin phrase for them.  I will simply 
translate it for greater caution.  They are put in there because 
they were not there in the original charter of rights. It was 
correctly felt to be necessary to put them in, but it was left to 
later constitutional actors to define and flesh them out. Whether 
executive, legislative, or judicial was not made clear, but that 
is certainly open to development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are further gaps in the law in so far as section 35(1) 
saves existing rights, but section 35(3) which was adopted 12 
months later recognizes and constitutionalizes future treaties.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have expressed in the House some questions on this point. 
Could a future treaty which ran counter to the charter or the 
constitution proper be constitutionalized and override them? 
That is an error or a gap being pointed out that was carefully 
corrected by the then minister of Indian affairs in the Native 
Lands Administration Act, Bill C-49.  I believe it is corrected 
in the federal enacting legislation for the Nisga'a treaty.  I 
simply point out that there is the need for work to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome in the exchanges in this debate the recognition by the 
two ministers who have spoken, the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans and the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, that it is not possible to view aboriginal rights in 
the context of single departments isolated from each other.  We 
are moving toward a comprehensive view, but it is an educational 
process that involves all the institutions of government and may, 
I respectfully suggest, involve all the members of Parliament. It 
is a learning experience for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular, one of the things I would suggest is that there 
is too much absolutism in this area.  The original theories of 
acquisition of rights by European settlers, whether they were 
British, French, German or Danish—one can run through the 
list—were based on absolutist theories such as terra nullius or 
unoccupied land.  These theories were rejected by the 
International Court in 1975 and, to give credit, were accepted by 
the early 1980s in Canadian thinking as incorrect.  The evidence 
led to the constitution repatriation project that was accepted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also suggest that it is an equal error to proceed to 
other absolutist views that it is one or the other, that one 
party wins absolutely and one loses absolutely.  The wise 
solutions here are in the recognition of comparative rights, that 
original so to speak inherent rights may also be subject to being 
balanced by supervening rights, particularly supervening rights 
obtained in good faith by those exercising them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are getting into is a complicated process of 
identifying, quantifying and balancing different competing 
rights.  The solutions here, and there ample ways of doing it 
that require work, are in terms of comparative equities.  Some of 
this work has been done in the complicated business of deciding 
property rights in central Europe which was originally under 
national territorial title, then under Soviet occupation, then 
under local communist governments, and then under post-communist 
governments.  The solution is never one absolutely that these are 
one's rights and everybody else loses.  It is a complicated 
process of sorting out and in a way sharing.  This is where we 
come back to the concept of judge and company.  All the players 
are involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate shows a recognition that some sort of long range 
solution is needed, but I do think we will need the courts as a 
part of it.  I do not think executive legislative authority can 
do it alone.  I do not think legislation can do it. I think the 
court can be brought into the processes more fully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those would be my suggestions to the House.  Criticisms of the 
court, as such, should be saved for another occasion and we will 
put forward suggestions for improving the court.  We may find 
that the judges are very well— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I am terribly sorry 
to interrupt, but if I did not stand I do not think the hon.

Mr. Speaker, I can see that you are trying to please everyone, 
but you should not make enemies in your own party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many members would like to speak, so I will ask the two 
questions I have. I am a bit surprised at the suggestion that we 
should go back to the court with this decision.

<A HREF="#LINKT102"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me ask first this question, just to make sure I did not 
misunderstand the last remarks of the hon. member opposite. Did 
he say that we will have to go back to the court to get an 
interpretation of the decision in the Marshall case? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is my second question. The hon. member has been talking 
about absolutist views, whereas in reality nothing is ever 
totally black or white. How can we deal with the situation, when 
the court asks us to do our job and negotiate what a moderate 
livelihood should mean? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member care to comment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B> Mr. Speaker, I suggested earlier a much more 
complex process involving the co-operation of three institutions, 
that is the supreme court, the executive and the parliament. I 
think that with such a process, it would take years to work out 
solutions to problems like the one on the east coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member repeat his second question? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier:</B> I wanted to know what a moderate livelihood 
is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> I am sorry to interrupt, 
but the hon. member's time is up. The hon. member for Delta—South 
Richmond. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta—South Richmond, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the member opposite raised the column by Jeffrey Simpson 
which appeared in the <I>Globe and Mail</I>.  I quote from a 
couple of paragraphs: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That court ruled in 1954 in Brown v Board of Education of Topeka 
that the so-called “separate but equal” doctrine used to 
justify segregation was unconstitutional because “separate 
educational facilities are inherently unequal”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an interesting concept when applied to the fisheries here. 
Mr. Simpson went on to write: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Usually forgotten is that there were two Brown cases.  The next 
year, after hearing evidence about how the 1954 ruling should be 
applied, the court gave school and political authorities 
breathing room to implement the first decision.  The judges said 
authorities should act with “all deliberate speed” and required 
them to “make a prompt and reasonable start”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They did not, in either the first or second Brown rulings, 
require that the next day the existing order of things be 
overturned.  The court was obviously alive both to the important 
principles it enunciated and to the need for a period of 
adjustment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would that the Supreme Court of Canada had been so alive in the 
Marshall case. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given these comments, would the member opposite not think it 
wise and prudent to go back to the court for a stay of judgment 
and a rehearing of the case to give some advise to the 
government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that was the question of 
the hon. member opposite and we answered it on the general point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What Mr. Simpson is referring to is what in fact followed with 
Brown v the Board of Education No. 2.  It was a process that was 
before the courts over a considerable number of years, not just a 
one shot return.  I have nothing against the one shot return, but 
I would envisage the solution of this problem, west coast logging 
and similar problems, a process that involves court and executive 
power working together, the parties constantly before the courts 
and over a period of years.  In my view that would be a 
sophisticated solution. 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, with 
respect, I have a question for the member on a point that the 
Reform is making.  We should be going back to the courts.  Part 
of the problem is that we have depended upon the courts to settle 
these issues instead of depending upon modern day treaties where 
we look at some type of conclusion and closure to the entire 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we continue to fight the before the courts we will get deeper 
and deeper into the quagmire we are in.  It is a mistake to go in 
that direction.  I would like the member's comments on that and 
the fact that if we continue to go before the courts we should 
listen to what the courts have told us in every solution they 
have brought down.  This is not their job.  They do not see it as 
their job and they do not want it to be their job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would not put words 
into the mouth of the courts as to what they want and do not 
want.  I would simply say, though, that this sort of solution 
when we are dealing with sharing a scarce resource does not allow 
for quick judgments by executive or legislative authority. 
It is better done by a third party that can examine evidence and 
weigh it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That seems to me to be best done by a court.  I envisage a 
process where evidence is led to the court and where it is 
reasoned over and argued over.  If we go that way we are into 
comparative equities.  That is what I was talking about. 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, a lot has 
been said tonight but we need to take a look at the motion itself 
and pull things into perspective.  The motion reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House take note of the difficulties in Canadian 
fisheries, especially as complicated by the Queen and Marshall 
case and its implications for both aboriginal and non-aboriginal 
peoples and for the future management of natural resources. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some have taken sides on that motion tonight.  I want to 
specifically say that I am not taking sides.  We have to 
recognize the decision and try to figure out a strategy as a 
government and as members of the parliament of Canada on how we 
implement that decision in a fair and reasonable way and ensure 
that all those players who fish and make their livelihoods at 
other natural resources can do so in a way that conserves the 
stocks and live in reasonable prosperity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the motion says, we are indeed faced with a serious crisis. 
Some members have mentioned this evening that this crisis seems 
to be escalating with the potential collapse of the voluntary 
moratorium negotiated by the minister last Sunday.  I have talked 
to the minister a number of times about the issue.  I know he had 
hoped that goodwill and tolerance would prevail.  Over the 
weekend the minister had gone a long way to achieving a 
satisfactory interim solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the news we heard in the media tonight that may have 
broken down.  I would appeal and I hope others would join me in 
appealing to the Mi'kmaq chiefs and others in those communities 
to let the agreement of last Sunday stand.  What we really need 
is peace in the water and a timeframe in which to institute a 
regulatory plan to manage the fishery situation in a reasonable 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The seriousness of the situation is perhaps outlined best by a 
constituent of mine, Barry Murray, who is a fisherman in the 
Malpeque Bay area.  He wrote to the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans.  I will quote sections from his letter because it 
outlines the seriousness.  He wrote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are individuals with strong feelings on both sides of this 
argument, and these personalities are at a heightened state of 
volatility that will take very few more sparks to ignite 
violence.  Once started, this slippery slope may quite possibly 
devastate both communities.  I am not trying to exaggerate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is potential for a lobster stock crisis and community 
unrest that would rival the cod crisis of the early eighties. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He closed by saying: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Minister, please close these out of control aboriginal 
fisheries for conservation reasons until such a time that an 
agreement can be put in place that will amply protect the stocks 
and protect our fishing communities. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Murray outlines the serious volatility and the serious 
situation in terms of the lobster fish stocks in Malpeque Bay, 
the area he knows best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not mind admitting I am disappointed that the supreme court 
did not grant a timeframe.  I do not know why, whether it is the 
responsibility of justice lawyers or the supreme court, but I am 
disappointed that the supreme court did not grant a timeframe 
within which to institute the regulatory plan to address the 
treaty rights.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for us to look at the facts tonight.  We are 
hearing all kinds of things, and people are basing their 
interpretations of what the supreme court said on the media 
instead of on reading the judgment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the decision say?  The supreme court found that Donald 
Marshall had a treaty right to fish for and to sell eels, which 
extended beyond the already established right of aboriginal 
people to fish for food and ceremonial purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The court also stated that this right to sell fish would be 
carried out within certain limits.  Section 58 of the decision 
states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is contemplated is not a right to trade generally for 
economic gain but rather a right to trade for necessaries. The 
treaty right is a regulated right and can be contained by 
regulation within its proper limits. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The court indicated that necessaries had been defined as 
moderate livelihood which according to the court in section 59 
includes “such basics as food, clothing and housing supplemented 
by a few amenities but not the accumulation of wealth.  It 
addresses day to day needs”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 61 of the decision places the limitations of the 
Marshall decision within context.  According to this section it 
is very important that “catch limits that could reasonably be 
expected to produce a moderate livelihood for individual Mi'kmaq 
families at present day standards can be established by 
regulation and enforced without violating the treaty right.  In 
that case regulations would accommodate the treaty right”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the decision states.  Members opposite have accused 
the minister and the government of not acting on the issue.  The 
fact is that the government had been proactive.  The aboriginal 
fishing strategy has been in place since 1992.  Because of the 
Sparrow decision it was moving along the line and doing what the 
supreme court now recognizes as a right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aboriginal fishing strategy was the government's response to 
the Sparrow decision. Through the aboriginal fishing strategy the 
Government of Canada and DFO were buying licenses from retiring 
fishermen and turning them over to the aboriginal community so it 
could have a livelihood on the water as the supreme court said is 
its right. Thirty-two million dollars annually has been spent on 
the aboriginal fishing strategy.  The member from Delta can like 
it or lump it.  Those are the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The court did affirm certain rights of the Mi'kmaq that 
originated with the treaties extending back to 1760.  What is at 
issue here is not the ruling but how to respond in a balanced way 
to the aboriginal community and the non-aboriginal community so 
they can survive and prosper together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I applaud the minister for his efforts through dialogue and 
co-operation.  However, if things might be happening tonight and 
the fishing effort is above the amount anticipated when the 
minister made his decision last Sunday, I believe he should 
consider using his authority under section 43 of the Fisheries 
Act in the interest of conservation.  At the moment the impact of 
even a small fishing effort on lobsters could be serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us we look at what has been happening with the government 
over the last number of years.  We could go back to a release by 
the former minister of fisheries on April 22, 1998.  It outlines 
that the November 1995 report of the Fisheries Resources 
Conservation Council advised that lobster fishermen were “taking 
too much and leaving too little”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of the FRCC report and as the minister of the day 
decided that we needed to double lobster egg production in the 
lobster fishing areas, new conservation measures were instituted. 
Escape mechanisms were put on traps.  Lobster tariffs and sizes 
were increased.  V-notching was considered.  Quite a number of 
management measures were imposed upon the industry.  It is 
serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I maintain that if there is any lobster fishing over 
and above what the minister anticipated on his agreement reached 
last Sunday, then he has the authority to act under section 43 of 
the Fisheries Act.  He should take that authority and institute 
that action to prevent jeopardizing the future of the lobster 
fishery.

Speaker, even though the Liberal member who just spoke has a lot 
of support for his comments from the Conservative Party behind 
me, that does not mean to say that he is correct.  When he said 
that the aboriginal fishing strategy of British Columbia was a 
direct result of the efforts by the government to try to enact 
the provisions of the Sparrow decision of the Supreme Court of 
Canada, he is just plain wrong, as was the judge in the R.

Columbia supreme court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Sparrow decision of the Supreme Court of Canada expressly

</I></B></P><P align=left>If members will recall what I said to the member for 
Delta—South Richmond and what I said in my remarks, it was that the 
government was being proactive.  The government recognized in the 
Sparrow decision the right of the fishery for food and ceremonial 
purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognized as a government that there may be other treaty 
rights coming along and that we had to involve the aboriginal 
community in the fishery sector.  We took a proactive strategy by 
trying to do that through the aboriginal fishing strategy to 
bring the aboriginal community in, in a managed way.  That is what 
we were doing and we were moving well on it. That is what it 
is all about.

ministers speak for themselves.  I will as well.  I always have 
spoken for myself and I will continue to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to get into a numbers game. The numbers game has 
been played in the media a fair bit, that there is only such and 
such a number of traps.  We have to keep in mind that in 
Malpeque Bay and some areas in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick at 
this time of year they trap at about five times the rate of that in 
June.  We cannot go by the trap numbers or percentages 
necessarily.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we go back to my remarks, what I argued was conservation. 
The food fishery for the native community in Malpeque Bay was 
shut down.  In my view, any lobsters taken over and above the 
current management plans, which are already maxed out in terms of 
the pressure on the resource, could be considered a concern for 
conservation.  We have to look at the current management plans 
and ensure that there is no greater effort on that resource as a 
result of this decision until we have the regulatory regime in 
place that recognizes this decision and does it in a managed way. 
<P><A NAME="LINK206"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have listened very carefully to the remarks by the 
hon. member whose riding is across the Northumberland Strait 
from my own in Nova Scotia.  As parliamentary secretary he was 
very involved in the ministry and speaks quite authoritatively 
about issues like conservation, changing the carapace size, which he 
supported even against some of the wishes of the fishers in his 
area, and other measures which were taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is this tardy response on this decision, which permits 
native fishers to enter this fishery unfettered by regulation and 
all the rules and regulations in place that are consistent with 
conservation, and his minister's inaction and his government's 
decision not to respond consistent with conservation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I really do not think the 
member opposite can accuse the minister of inaction.  He went 
down and visited with the native community and the commercial 
fishers.  He said very clearly that there will be a regulated 
fishery or no fishery at all.  What he tried to achieve 
through goodwill and discussion was to keep people off the water 
until the proper regulatory regime could be put in place.  He has 
the authority under the Fisheries Act to act if the conservation 
is jeopardized.  I think we will see he will take that kind 
of action if necessary.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I will have to share my time with my colleague from 
Beauharnois—Salaberry, unless the House gives us more time. The 
motion says that speeches cannot exceed 20 minutes, but if I can 
have more time, I will take it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I took a few notes during the minister's speech, and since he 
has not yet left to catch a plane despite the advice he was 
given, I will take this opportunity to tell him what I think. 
We like having the opportunity to talk to him, but when there is 
an emergency, he should be there where he is most needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister recognized right from the start that the natives 
have rights, which were confirmed by the supreme court, and that 
these rights are subject to regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All we need to do next is to define the words “moderate 
livelihood”. It is unfortunate that at this stage I am the one 
who has to answer the questions. However, I will ask a series 
of questions he can answer in the questions and comments period 
if he wants to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are trying to get a definition of is the expression 
“moderate livelihood”. That is the hardest thing to do here. And 
I know that the minister, who was a businessman, knows that. 
For a businessman, the hardest thing to do is to bring people to 
the negotiation table, but the minister's experience could be 
helpful in this instance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that the court gave some useful indications. I mean that 
when one does not want to be stuck, as we are, with a bad 
judgement, one tries to negotiate an agreement, even a bad one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the present situation, the minister will have the opportunity 
to introduce legislation, to regulate fisheries. I recognize 
that the other party will not like the first set of rules. 
However, the only way to settle the issue is to go to court or 
sit down and negotiate.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I imagine I am not telling the minister anything new this 
evening, but I am keen to see the agenda he will set.  All we 
saw on the television was the minister calling for a 30 day 
moratorium.  We were not told who he would be sitting down with 
to negotiate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also noted in my speech today the fact that he intends to 
negotiate with the current beneficiaries, and mentioned that 
they are the current incarnations of the treaty signatories.  I 
would like to get to know this better in good French or in 
business language, but I would like a complete list to be sure 
that there will not be other players joining a month after 
negotiations have begun. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like the minister to take note when I ask what he 
is going to do during his 30 days.  We would need to know his 
agenda, what will be negotiated and who will be sitting around 
the table.  Certainly, there will be representatives of the 
fishers, other federal ministers and provincial ones too, I 
hope. The House must be reminded that, for every seafaring man, 
there are, as a rule of thumb, five people working on land. 
Thought must be given as well to the consequences of processing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Still in the context of what is to be prepared, when will we 
know exactly who will be involved in the negotiations? 
Negotiations must deal with “moderate livelihood”, but the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans signed the UN fishing agreement 
this summer. 
Article 5 pertains to commercial fishers as we know them and 
mentions that the signatory countries are committed to 
establishing and developing sustainable and profitable fishing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this international agreement definition, I do not see the 
beginnings of the definition of profitable in the vocabulary of 
the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans here in Canada.  It is an 
international agreement in which all the UN countries say, each 
time the development of fisheries is discussed, “without 
subsidies”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does “without subsidies”, as used internationally, mean in 
Canadian terms?  Does it include EI?  Does it include the 
interest deductions allowed by certain provinces on boats? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I need to know what form the profitable fisheries the minister has 
already administered would take, because I already imagine the 
moderate livelihood they have in mind for aboriginals is at 
least one step up from the threshold of profitability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to see a start made on defining the level of 
profitability as understood by the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing that worried me about the minister's remarks was his 
comment that they had not yet taken in all the implications of 
the decision.  I would have preferred not to harangue the 
minister unduly when he is new to the job, but it is unfortunate 
that his department did not have a plan B, particularly when 
they lost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Out of respect for native and non-native fishers, I will perhaps 
avoid trite plays on words here this evening but, in some cases, 
they have a plan B ready, and in some cases they do not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to know what the minister thinks about the 
different management styles throughout the world because, while 
we are on the aboriginal problem, I think that the 1867 
legislation as it pertains to fisheries should also be revisited 
because, under the treaties, the discretionary nature of 
licences does not meet the aboriginal criterion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should take this opportunity to dust off Canada's old 
fisheries act.  But the most serious problem is the historic 
sharing between the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we end up having to define the resources we are going to have 
to give the native fishers, we will need to know where those 
resources are coming from. 
Rather than get into individual calculations, why not take the 
opportunity to look into some form of sharing?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are management systems and Canada is part of one in which 
the percentage of each participant is determined before the 
total allowable catch is calculated each year.  I refer to NAFO, 
the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization, to which Canada 
belongs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why could what is good for Canada when it seeks to reach 
agreement with its colleagues outside its borders not be good 
for working with colleagues within its borders?  I ask the 
minister that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If my choice of vocabulary happens to grate on the ears of the 
minister or his officials, I would invite them to re-examine the 
French model, which speaks of stabilization criteria rather than 
historical share.  In other words, I am appealing to a quality 
in the minister that can sometimes be a defect, but in this case 
can be positive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A businessman needs tools if he is to manage.  In order to 
manage, he must be able to plan, and to know how he is going to 
pay for his boat and for his groceries.  The same thing goes for 
an aboriginal fisher, who has to know how and where he is going 
to fish, and in what quantities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile, there are short term tools to determine what is 
needed to buy social peace. Second, the government must make it 
known to the fishers that it intends to make long term plans and 
it can take advantage of this winter season to start a permit 
buy-back program.  There are some people who need to make 
decisions about investing in a boat this winter.  They may say 
to themselves that it is better for them to sell their fishing 
licence to Fisheries and Oceans because the size of the quota 
for the coming years is too unpredictable.  The government needs 
to take all of this into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it does not do so as soon as possible, I think it will be 
irresponsible, and things will be worse than they were right 
after September 17.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to ask my hon. colleague who 
sits on the fisheries committee, who is from the beautiful area 
of the Gaspé, one very simple question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to my colleague's speech we heard the speech of a member 
of the Liberal Party, the governing party, and I am singing 
hallelujah for this.  They have finally recognized and are 
starting to believe exactly what the auditor general said last 
April, that shellfish stocks, mainly lobsters, are in trouble. 
This was back in April, long before the Marshall decision was 
rendered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who does the member think is responsible for the downturn in the 
lobster fishery which the auditor general pointed out and which 
DFO itself still does not recognize as a very serious problem in 
Atlantic Canada? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier:</B> I am glad the member has raised this point. 
This is something the auditor general raised. I know the 
representatives of some fishers' associations believe the 
auditor general is not really the one who should decide this. 
However, there is a problem. The member's question was right and 
very much to the point. It is up to us now to look into all 
this. 
I would remind the House that what the auditor general said and 
what is contained in the report of the Standing Committee on 
Fisheries and Oceans about the situation on the Atlantic coast— 
and this was a unanimous all-party report—is that everybody 
agrees that there is a management problem at Fisheries and 
Oceans and that things have to change. If the Marshall decision 
is the opportunity to start anew, I think we should seize it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is being pointed out is significant. However, what is going 
on in one lobster fishery differs from what is going on in 
another. 
There is a management problem. I am tired of hearing the same 
worn out old record to the effect that it is a conservation 
problem when it is in fact a management problem.

<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member has been in the Chamber tonight and he has listened 
to the to and fro of the debate.  There has been a lot of 
discussion about the Nisga'a treaty and about the supreme court. 
These are two issues upon which we need to shed more light. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, as was said earlier, the supreme court 
said in many of its earlier rulings that it does not see this 
as its job.  The supreme court sees this as the job of the 
government.  That is the first point. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2305"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT110"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT110"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 2305

<A HREF="#LINKT109"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point is that the Nisga'a treaty will bring 
consistency to that area of the west coast, to B.C. in 
particular.  What we have now are inconsistencies.  We do not 
have a modern day treaty.  We are dependent upon supreme court 
judgments, which have caused serious confusion, and we have also 
had a lack of response from the government on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member prefer a modern day treaty and consistency, or 
would he prefer that the supreme court deal with this so that we 
would have inconsistencies and a lack of response from the 
government?  What is his feeling on that? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier:</B> Mr. Speaker, if I understood the question, the 
member is asking me whether I prefer to go back to the courts or 
put up with further laxity and carelessness from the other side 
of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pardon the expression, but there is a French saying about it not 
mattering whether one is bitten by a dog or a bitch. I would not 
like to give the judges this responsibility, and I see that 
there is a lack of leadership on the other side. How will we, on 
this side of the House, find a way to put pressure on them so 
that they come to their senses? I do not know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people have suggested that the truth or the way to get out 
of this mess might well come from the grassroots, and I believe 
that. 
Once the stunned reaction of our non-native fishers has passed— I 
believe them to be very peaceful people—they will be able to 
come up with solutions. We must have confidence in eastern 
Canadians. We have always overcome crises, and we will again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Together, with the communities involved, we must find a way to 
get the government to take its responsibilities. But, I repeat, 
Grit or Tory, the problem always remains the same. There is a 
management problem at Fisheries and Oceans, and it is not for 
nothing that the standing committee unanimously pointed the 
finger not necessarily at the government but at the management 
style in that department. 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
try to breathe a bit of life into this debate in spite of the 
late hour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to rise after my colleague from 
Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok, who also speaks with so 
much conviction when he deals with fishery matters and when he 
talks on our party's behalf on those subjects that interest him 
so much and for which he serves his constituency so well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was also pleased to hear my colleague from Saint-Jean, our 
critic for aboriginal affairs, who presented his concerns on the 
subject debated tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind the House that the Bloc Quebecois is 
really interested in this subject because of its constitutional 
aspect. 
It is a matter that touches on the relations between the native 
people, or nations as we prefer to call them in Quebec, and the 
other inhabitants of the country. We now have to participate in 
a debate that will have consequences for our future, the future 
of Quebec and the future of Canada, the relations between 
Quebec, Canada and the natives people who belong to one or the 
other of those jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that this kind of debate was fully justified, 
especially as a solution must be arrived at quickly. There is 
increasing urgency, given the well-known facts that seem to have 
deepened the crisis, which gave rise to violence and to 
behaviours that are unacceptable in a free and democratic 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had the opportunity to hear part of the debate and I 
would now like to talk about constitutional issues and the 
Constitution, and mention that in a sovereign Quebec we will 
avoid problems such as those faced today by Canada as a result 
of the laissez-faire attitude of this government, and of its 
failure to truly follow through on its constitutional commitment 
as stated in section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982, which 
says, and I quote the first subsection “The existing aboriginal 
and treaty rights of the aboriginal peoples of Canada are hereby 
recognized and affirmed”.

<A HREF="#LINKT110"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Enshrining things in the Constitution is not enough. Native 
peoples know full well it is not enough to have their rights 
recognized and affirmed in the Constitution. These rights must 
be implemented and exercised; the existing laws, the laws which 
were in force when this section came into force in 1982 must be 
reviewed and amended to reflect those rights. This is the root 
cause of the problem we are facing today and which is the topic 
of the motion before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing has been done for 17 years. This provision came into 
force 17 years ago and successive governments have failed to 
implement it properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, if one looks at the Marshall decision, the 
court says something very telling about the refusal to recognize 
the treaty rights at issue in this case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The court said, and I quote: 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Mi'kmaq treaty rights were not accommodated in the regulations 
because presumably the crown's position was and continues to be 
that no such treaty rights existed”. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The court affirms that such were the position and the views of 
the crown. This clearly explains why regulations were adopted to 
give total discretion, and that discretion was exercised to deny 
rights granted by treaties that were, appropriately, widely and 
liberally interpreted by the Supreme Court of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, it is carelessness on the part of the government that has 
put citizens, people sharing the land who also want to share the 
resource, in a crisis situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We Quebecers experiencing this constitutional crisis fully 
understand and share the concerns of aboriginal nations, which 
have seen their constitutional rights trampled, a government 
hesitate and refuse to sit down and negotiate in good faith not 
only as regards the way their rights are recognized, but also 
the limitations that can be imposed on these rights, since the 
jurisprudence of the Supreme Court of Canada has led to the 
adoption of restrictions that are reasonable when it comes to 
the treaty rights of aboriginal nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this to say that, from a constitutional point of view, this 
shows once again the flaws of our constitution when dealing with 
one of the peoples of Canada, with aboriginal peoples in 
general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are here not only to discuss and to protect the interests of 
Quebec, but also to promote the sovereignty project, which is 
the reason for the presence of Bloc Quebecois members in this 
house. I simply want to solemnly reiterate to Quebec's 11 
aboriginal nations, that the Quebec government pledged long 
before other governments to recognize aboriginal nations. It did 
so in 1985 for 10 of them, and in 1987 for the Malecite nation. 
Not only did the Quebec government recognize their existence, it 
also indicated its determination to conclude agreements with 
each of the aboriginal nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1985 motion, these agreements guaranteed the right to 
hunt, fish, trap, harvest and participate in the management of 
wildlife resources. This explicit recognition of the right to 
fish was expressed in a motion dating back to 1985.

<A HREF="#LINKT111"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since then, negotiations have been carried out in good faith to 
follow up on these commitments. Sovereignist parties and members 
of this sovereignist coalition have also re-iterated the 
commitment they made in the 1990s to ensure that aboriginal 
people would be entitled to self-government within a sovereign 
Quebec and would even be able to take part in the drafting of a 
constitution where their autonomy would be recognized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we have so clearly said before, once the draft legislation on 
sovereignty has been proposed to Quebecers, once the bill on 
Quebec's future has been drafted, following numerous 
consultations of Quebecers through regional and national 
commissions, the Parti Quebecois's current agenda provides that: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the constitution of a sovereign Quebec recognize the right of 
the native people to govern themselves on lands belonging to 
their people and to take part in the development of Quebec. Also 
the current constitutional rights of aboriginal people, their 
treaty rights and their aboriginal titles would also be 
confirmed by a sovereign Quebec. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lastly, I want to say that the Bloc Quebecois is currently 
considering a major proposal in which its members are also urged 
to re-iterate their commitment to recognizing the existing rights 
of the aboriginal people, to confirming these rights and to 
ensuring that negotiations are carried out with the native 
people of Quebec in order to recognize their right to 
self-government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also stipulate in this major proposal that the relationship 
between the native people, a sovereign Quebec and Canada could 
be governed by a partnership agreement that would ensure that 
these people and nations continue to enjoy a friendly 
relationship and that the native people would not, as the 
supreme court said in the Marshall judgement, be considered as 
“citizens minus”, but as first-class citizens in a sovereign 
Quebec and a sovereign Canada.

order to manage and conserve the resource.

aboriginal nations in a broader fishing policy.

adopted and selected by the government and only the government. 
I can see a role for this House in implementing ancestral and 
sub-treaty rights for other aboriginal nations.

It is up to the government especially to ensure that this 
House assumes its responsibilities, something it does not seem 
to want to do at the moment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the question raised by the NDP member and the reply 
from the member for Beauharnois—Salaberry brings me to another 
point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What other skeletons are the Liberals hiding in their closet? 
Are there other costs like this that we are not aware of?  I do 
not mean to describe the aboriginal nations as skeletons.  What 
I mean is that the truth is being withheld from parliamentarians 
and non-native fishers.  People have a right to know.  All of us, 
myself included, were kept in the dark. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was a little boy, I played with friends, not knowing that 
they would have more rights than I do today.  I am very glad for 
them, but I did not know. 
Canadians should be told once and for all what other swords of 
Damocles are hanging over their heads, and not necessarily just 
in the fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This evening, we are looking at the native problem in the 
context of the Maritime fisheries crisis.  But to use a good old 
Maritime expression, this is perhaps just the tip of the iceberg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will only remind the House that 
the present crisis seems to be triggering other crises, since 
the Innu said that they could have additional claims relating to 
the Churchill Falls project. In British Columbia, the chief of 
the Nanoose first nation would like the confirmed or at least 
claimed rights of his people reviewed in light of the Marshall 
decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like my colleagues, I will say that there is a transparency 
problem; the government is not telling all and prefers to keep 
the information for itself for all kind of reasons. The House is 
often consulted only for appearances and I do not think that it 
is an acceptable way to govern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier today, we heard the Prime Minister say in his speech 
that Canada was a country about which many people dream. 
However, I do not think that it is the case of the Mi'kmaqs 
today. Canada probably gives them nightmares. This is 
unacceptable in a country that some people boast about being the 
best country in the world. 
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is getting 
late. It is 11.25 p.m. here and it is 12.25 a.m. in my riding. 
However, knowing that there are quite a few night owls among 
Acadians, I am sure some of them are listening to me right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a pleasure for me to say a few words tonight about the 
decision handed down by the supreme court in the Marshall case. 
This decision has been taken seriously by all Canadians, and we 
have been hearing about it for several weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The peace treaty was signed in 1760 and, 250 years later, we 
have to interpret what happened. We must not forget that, in 
those 250 years, the Conservatives were often in office, 
including for a period of nine years mostly in the 1980s. They 
cannot stand up and blame the Liberals, because problems 
occurred when both parties formed the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But, tonight, we can blame everybody. One thing we know is that 
there was a treaty. 
We can say that governments did not respond to the requests made 
by aboriginal people after the treaty. Today, we have to deal 
with a decision which was brought about by the inaction of 
governments.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Burnt Church is very close to my riding of Acadie—Bathurst, which 
means that people in my riding are also deeply affected by this 
decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fishers from my riding have contacted me to tell me that they 
are willing to recognize the rights of native fishers, but that 
we must negotiate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The more we wait, the harder these negotiations will be and the 
more it will hurt. 
An aboriginal woman from Burnt Church was quoted last week as 
saying that native-white relations had been developing in the 
right direction over the past hundred years. Today it seems to 
her that everything has to be started all over again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have some responsibility in all that.  When the decision was 
released, I recall that my colleague, the fisheries critic, sent 
a letter to the minister asking him to summon the all-party 
standing committee to a meeting in Ottawa in order to discuss 
the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week, I myself sent a letter to the minister, with no 
reply.  He is asking us all to work together.  Even today, as we 
speak, the all-party committee has not yet been called together 
to discuss the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only thing, then, is that violence is a possibility. 
All sorts of things can happen, but in the end it is negotiation 
that will solve these problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I am calling upon the people in my riding, as well as 
those in the neighbouring riding of Miramichi, to take things 
calmly, and to enter into negotiations in order to solve the 
problem.  That is the only means to settlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Judging from my labour union experience, regardless of what 
conflicts have taken place, regardless of whether it took three 
months to settle them, or six, the only place there was a 
settlement was at the negotiating table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This invitation must therefore be responded to.  The two groups, 
native and non-native, must be invited to the negotiating table, 
and it must be done as soon as possible.  Not a week from today. 
Let the invitation go out tomorrow morning.  Tomorrow morning 
the two groups need to sit down at the table: the aboriginal 
people and the unions representing the coastal fishers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go even farther. I will tell you that I have concerns. 
You know why?  The people at home  tell us, for example, that 
crab fishers are now beginning to be concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we going to wait yet again to have a crisis in the lobster 
industry and after that another crisis in the crab industry? 
And after that we will respond to that crisis and then we will 
have another one in the herring industry and after that  we will 
respond to the crisis in the herring industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say no.  I say the industry must be brought to the bargaining 
table.  This applies to all of the fishing industries, be it 
herring, groundfish or crab. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must find a solution together.  We must find a solution for 
everyone. Otherwise, we will end up with the violence that has 
been going on in recent weeks, and this is unacceptable in 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is capable of choosing an approach the fishers 
would agree to.  Some fishers might be ready to sell their 
license.  Some people who have reached the age of 55 or 60 would 
be prepared to retire.  So the government could become involved 
in buying back their licenses and make these licenses available 
to the native bands in order to resolve this problem that has 
gone on unresolved for 250 years.  We have a 250 year old 
treaty, with all the lawyers we have in Canada.  They are 
intelligent enough to be in the House of Commons? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy today not to be a lawyer.  I am also happy that the 
minister is not a lawyer.  So, perhaps we can solve the problem 
today.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It took 250 years to interpret a peace treaty signed with the 
aboriginals. Today, we are all panicking and we are not prepared 
to react after 250 years. We should be ashamed of our 
governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I urge you not to wait for a week. We cannot wait 
until people fight with one another. We cannot wait until 
violence erupts. People are concerned. They want to sit down, 
negotiate and find a solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It takes leadership to achieve that. When a party steps forward 
and says it wants to form the government, that means that it has 
leadership and that it is capable of leading the country. It 
should be able to manage the crises that we are facing today. 
There are crises everywhere these days. 
There is a problem with the airlines. There are two airlines in 
Canada, Canadian Airlines and Air Canada, and the government 
does not even know how to deal with this issue. 
There is a problem with the immigrants arriving in the Vancouver 
area. Again, the government does not know how to deal with this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are problems everywhere. It is time to act before we lose 
control of our country. The federal government and the Liberals 
have that responsibility that Canadians have given them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government waits for weeks on end, but the aboriginal people 
have been saying for years that they want a solution to their 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Conservatives signed the free trade agreement, it did 
not take them long to adjust the whole Canadian program to free 
trade. It did not take them years to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems as if the issue between aboriginal and white peoples 
could take a year or two to solve. This is not true. 
We cannot have such an attitude. We must settle the issue now. 
We must not wait a year to do that. We must sit with these 
people and solve the problem. There are solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced that when fishers, aboriginals and a government 
that shows leadership sit together at the table, solutions will 
be found. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the government, I urge the minister, who just got the 
job, to make a name for himself by being a good Minister of 
Fisheries and solving the problems we are facing in Canada. This 
is what I ask him to do. 
<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I will try to be brief, because I see that members 
still have many questions to ask. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to tell my colleague that he is right when he says 
that our constituents are wondering what they will be allowed to 
fish, even if they are not fishing lobster right now.  He 
mentioned those who fish herring or crab. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is right to say that some of them are wondering whether they 
will be able to go on fishing with the uncertain quotas the 
minister is offering, or whether they are ready to retire.  I 
think the member is quite right, and knows whereof he speaks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member to tell us what we can do to get the 
Liberals to see reason. 
At the same time, I would like to draw a parallel with what he 
said about their dealing with problems on a timely fashion. Let 
us not forget that, in the Atlantic provinces alone, it cost $1 
billion to harmonize the GST.  They sorted that out one spring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This time, people need to understand that a similar amount is 
involved, even more than with the moratorium on the fishery, 
with the Atlantic Groundfish Strategy, or TAGS.  This program 
cost $2 billion.  The ineptitude and negligence have been going 
on for 240 years and that is going to cost something.  The 
sooner we tackle the problem, the less painful it will be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague 
for his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He spoke about the harmonized GST and said that the matter was 
settled quickly. It does not mean, however, that we, the people 
of the Atlantic, welcomed it. But they did it anyway and it did 
not take long.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to thank the government for having allowed us, tonight, 
to discuss part of the problem. After all, I hope the minister, 
who is here tonight, who is listening to what we have to say, 
can react. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with my colleague who said that it will cost money and 
that the government must be ready to invest, but, then again, I 
would like to reiterate that the only place where it can be 
solved is at the negotiating table, and immediately—tomorrow 
morning, if necessary. We must act now and force the government 
to act and tell it that if it does not, it should not ask us to 
work with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It wants us to work with it. Therefore, we will make suggestions 
tonight and then we tell it to act. If it does not act, it 
should not tell us that we are unwilling to co-operate because, 
tonight, we are working with it and offering solutions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I heard 
a fair amount of discussion tonight from the NDP members who rose 
to speak.  There was discussion earlier that they had been in 
contact with fishermen who live in the South Shore riding and in 
West Nova riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was at the meeting in Yarmouth.  I was at the meeting in 
Shelburne.  I was at the meeting in Lunenburg.  I did not see any 
NDP members of Parliament there.  I have talked with hundreds of 
fishermen and I have not talked to one who has been in contact 
with these NDP members of Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have listened to what these members have said, which is little 
better than nothing.  What I now want to know is simple and I 
want a straightforward answer.   Would the New Democratic Party 
support a moratorium on this decision immediately to allow time 
for first nations, fishers and DFO to sit down and formulate a 
plan for the peaceful integration of first nations into the 
fishery?  Will it support an immediate moratorium on this 
decision? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is very sad that after 
250 years these members still cannot recognize that we have a 
problem and at the Supreme Court of Canada has made a decision. 
That is why I am recommending that we be at the negotiating table 
tomorrow morning to negotiate something with the two groups who 
are the non-natives and the native people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about the NDP not doing or saying anything.  I 
was on a radio station the other day when my colleague from 
Beauséjour—Petitcodiac said that it was not the government's 
responsibility to resolve the problem but the responsibility of 
the community and that the community was destroying itself right 
now.  It is the responsibility of the government to come down and 
resolve the problem with the people down home and get to the 
table.  We have spoken to more fishermen than you ever have as a 
Conservative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I would like to 
remind hon. members to address each other through the Chair 
please. 
<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is getting late in the evening 
and it looks as if I may be the last speaker on this very 
valuable debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank the Conservative Party's House leader for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough for bringing forward this issue 
for a take note debate.  It is too bad it is not an emergency 
debate.  I also wish to thank the government for allowing us this 
take note debate.  Unfortunately it is just a take note debate. 
I hope the government is doing more than just taking notes.  I 
hope the it is understanding the very serious nature of this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from New Brunswick mentioned that this is not just 
about lobsters.  This is about every single fish species that we 
have, not only in Atlantic Canada but clearly right across the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aboriginal people in our prairie provinces are looking at the 
Marshall decision to see what it means to their role at the FFMC 
that they have in Winnipeg.  They have great problems with that. 
Aboriginal people on the west coast are looking at this decision 
in terms of what they believe are their timber rights and their 
fishing rights.  People across the country are very seriously 
concerned about what this decision means in their lives.  It is 
not just about lobsters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about the lobster issue right now because 
tomorrow morning area 35, the Bay of Fundy region in Nova 
Scotia—New Brunswick, will be opening up to the commercial 
fishery which normally opens up this time of year.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those men and women will be putting out their boats and going 
out to catch lobsters.  We have still not heard a word from the 
government on how it plans to incorporate the Marshall decision 
with the aboriginal people to get them into this fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard from people like Mr. Arthur Bull of the Coastal 
Community Network of Digby who said they have been working 
overtime, literally day and night since this decision, to come up 
with reasonable compromises so that both sides, the aboriginal 
and the non-aboriginal people, can work together.  Unfortunately 
there is nothing but silence from the minister's department and 
the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must bear in mind, for those who do not know it, that the 
minister was recently appointed to his position at the Department 
of Fisheries and Oceans.  The people he has around him are fairly 
new to the portfolio as well.  Therein lies the problem. 
Obviously the minister is getting his advice from what I consider 
to be very elderly and tired people on the east coast in terms of 
DFO, people I have had many concerns about in terms of their 
management policies.  They are the policies of this government 
and previous governments.  It is interesting to hear the 
Conservatives talk about concerns when the Conservative 
government from 1984 to 1993 did absolutely nothing to deal with 
the issue.  The Liberal government from 1993 to 1999 has done 
absolutely nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The attitudes of the Conservative government and the Liberal 
government toward aboriginal people in the nation have been very 
much paternalistic.  They have told the aboriginal people time 
and time again that they refuse to negotiate and refuse to 
legislate.  In fact they are telling them to spend taxpayers 
dollars and go to court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is exactly what the aboriginal people have done.  They have 
gone to court and now the court has rendered its decision. 
Whether or not we like it, it is the legal opinion of the 
country.  The supreme court has ordered it.  It is not 
parliament's obligation and it is not the right of 
parliamentarians to tell the supreme court that we do not like 
the decision so it should be stayed, got rid of, changed or 
whatever.  If we start doing that to the Supreme Court of Canada 
within our constitution we are opening up a bigger can of worms 
than opposition members or anyone else who is claiming that would 
be the solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to give the minister four very concrete points on how 
he could come up with a short term solution.  One is to 
immediately reconvene the all party standing committee of 
fisheries and oceans down in the maritime region.  The minister 
and his department obviously refuse to go down there on a long 
term basis to deal with the issue.  Perception is everyone's 
reality.  They cannot be seen to be making decisions from Ottawa 
for Atlantic Canada.  They must be in Atlantic Canada to put the 
human and financial resources on the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The grassroots people who work the resource know the resource 
better than the minister and most politicians in this room.  They 
know what the short and long term solutions are.  The minister 
must commit the human and financial resources for them to carry 
on their work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the minister must consider a voluntary buyout package 
and a transfer of the licences over to the Mi'kmaq nation to 
include them in the fishery.  There are about 6,300 licences in 
the maritime region right now.  Roughly 10% of those people would 
be willing to sell their licences tomorrow morning.  The 
government must find out exactly how many licences would be 
required on the short term to bring the aboriginal people into 
the fishery.  This is very important because conservation is the 
key.  Everybody must fish under the same conservation guidelines. 
I do not think there is any debate on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general said last April that lobster stocks, and in 
fact all shellfish stocks, were in trouble in Atlantic Canada. 
Many people criticize the auditor general and me for espousing 
those views.  The fact is the auditor general was absolutely 
correct.  Last April he said that the management policies which 
caused the cod collapse in 1992 were the same policies in place 
to handle the groundfish stocks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that in the spring the Mi'kmaq asked the 
Government of Canada to sit at the table to come up with 
solutions for the short term because they suspected that the 
Marshall decision would go in their favour. 
They came with an open hand to government asking it to come up 
with solutions so we can evade the problems that are happening 
now.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from South Shore and my colleague from West Nova 
are absolutely correct when they say they have never felt the 
tensions greater than they are now.  They are absolutely correct 
when they say that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that the government by sitting back in Ottawa trying 
to come up with some solution it can grab out of the sky or grab 
out of the air will not solve the problems.  Government members 
have to go down there and talk directly to the people involved. 
They must do that in order to add calm to the equation of the 
argument that is happening right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing that has happened within DFO is severe budget cuts 
to the department itself.  The department does not have the human 
or financial resources to monitor enforcement policies, so it 
calls upon the RCMP to help.  However, that department's 
resources were cut as well.  The fact is that we do not even have 
the proper resources allocated right now in order to protect the 
stock.  That is the most important thing.  It is not just lobster 
stock but all other shellfish species out there as well.  If the 
auditor general was correct and they do collapse, it will make 
the cod prices look like a drop in the bucket.  Again, the 
responsibility falls upon this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every single member in this argument today, my colleagues in the 
Conservative Party, the Reform Party, the Bloc Quebecois and 
ourselves, has asked for and demanded leadership on this issue. 
It is imperative that the minister show leadership. He should get 
down there and start talking to these people.  He should not do 
it from Ottawa.  This is very important.  While he is down there 
discussing this issue, he should seriously consider a community 
based allocation of these stocks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Arthur Bull of Digby has asked many, many times of the 
Coastal Community Network of Atlantic Canada and those in western 
Canada as well to get away from the corporatization of our fish 
stocks which have concentrated the wealth of the fish stocks in 
very few hands.  It is time to start looking at a community based 
strategy so that all people, aboriginal and non-aboriginal, can 
work together for the long term benefit of this resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have to include what the corporate sector is saying 
right now. The one thing missing in this debate right now is what 
Clearwater, Highliner Foods and Donna Rae Limited are saying. 
What are these big corporations that have huge access to fish 
resources saying in this debate?  They have been very, very 
silent.  We have all been working very hard trying to concentrate 
on protecting the interests of the inshore fishermen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is needed now is leadership from this government.  This 
government should not be an ostrich and put its head in the sand 
and hope the problem goes away.  Government members must get down 
there and work with the people toward immediate short term 
solutions that have been presented by all members of the House 
today.  They must incorporate those ideas so that we can have a 
calm fishery.  We will all benefit in the long term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Before we go to 
questions and comments, I want to remind everyone once again to 
address each other through the Chair. 
<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta—South Richmond, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is not a matter of liking a decision or not liking a 
decision.  The reason for going back to the court is to get some 
guidance on what the court meant by the decision.  For example, 
the Supreme Court of Canada failed to accurately describe 
moderate living.  Some native advocates contend that a net annual 
income of $80,000 is a moderate living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Supreme Court of Canada did not say whether the aboriginal 
tax free status which exists would reduce needed fishery 
earnings.  The Supreme Court of Canada did not say whether 
government contributions to aboriginal communities through the 
Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development can offset 
earnings required from the fishery.  The Supreme Court of Canada 
did not determine whether non-status Mi'kmaq or Maliseet are 
legally able to participate in the fishery.  There are an unknown 
number of non-status Mi'kmaq or Maliseet, but it is estimated in 
the tens of thousands.  DFO is determined that non-status Mi'kmaq 
or Maliseet are not eligible under the treaty.  This will 
probably be met with a court challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All I am saying is that these issues will come before the court 
sooner or later.  Why not do it sooner?  Why not get the answers 
now before we go down a garden path that we do not want to be 
going down?

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are the elected officials of this country.  My colleagues 
from the Reform Party, the Conservative Party, the Bloc and the 
Liberal Party, we are the ones who are responsible ultimately to 
answer to the constituents of this country for legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If previous Conservative governments and the current Liberal 
government have refused to negotiate and to legislate, then it is 
quite obvious that the supreme court will dictate to us what it 
interprets as the rules and what it interprets as the law.  Once 
it does this, whether we like the decision or not, we have to 
live with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We find ourselves in the pickle we are in today because of the 
failed policies of the current Liberal government and past 
Conservative governments where they have refused to negotiate 
long term solutions for the resources of this country.  It is up 
to parliament to finally decide this issue.  It is not up to the 
supreme court.  It is our responsibility as parliamentarians to 
take this issue very seriously.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member is absolutely right.  It is up to parliament.  I will 
ask the hon. member the same question I asked of the hon. member 
for Acadie—Bathurst.  Would the NDP support a moratorium on the 
decision to allow time for first nations, fishers and DFO to sit 
down and formulate a plan for the peaceful integration of first 
nations into the licensed fishery? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if I may throw the 
question back so he can ask it of me again.  Is the member for 
South Shore asking me about a moratorium on the aboriginal 
fishery or about a moratorium on the non-aboriginal fishery? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, right now we have a 
supreme court decision dealing with the aboriginal fishery.  I 
suggested a moratorium on the aboriginal fishery because that is 
the only non-licensed fishery out there.  Any licensed fishery, 
any aboriginal boats that are involved in the licensed fishery 
would not be subject to it.  We are only dealing with what the 
supreme court decision brought down.  Will the NDP support that? 
I see no other way or plan to bring everyone to the table to 
allow for the resolution of this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as much as I would like 
to say yes to that solution in order to bring some calm to the 
irrationality, I cannot.  It is not up to us to break the law. 
The fact is that the supreme court has ordered that.  It has laid 
down quite clearly that the aboriginal people have the right to 
fish in this regard.  I do not like the idea of their fishing 
without proper conservation guidelines and without working under 
the same rules everyone else does.  However the fact is we cannot 
override the supreme court decision and say quite clearly that 
because we are in a mess and a pickle and because 
parliamentarians and government have screwed this issue up so 
badly that we are now going to say to the aboriginal people who 
have waited 240 years for their right that they can no longer do 
what the supreme court has said they can do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The majority of people I have spoken to down there are willing 
to incorporate the aboriginal fishery into the fishery.  This is 
what needs to happen, dialogue and conversation and not useless 
rhetoric.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to have the opportunity to 
participate in the final dying moments of this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I begin by congratulating the minister of fisheries who in a 
rare show of interest and willingness to listen to opposition 
members has stayed here in the House.  Even against the advice of 
some members of the House that he should be in New Brunswick or 
in Nova Scotia, he has stayed here and has genuinely listened to 
and participated in the debate.  I and other members of this 
party appreciate that effort and show of good faith. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must take him up on a comment he made in his remarks that he 
had acted quickly.  We have to revisit the chronology of what has 
taken place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On September 17 the Marshall decision was handed down by the 
supreme court.  He said that he acted within three days.  But 
what happened?  Within three days the Canadian public learned 
that the House of Commons was to be prorogued so he did not have 
the benefit of the wisdom of members who were very close to the 
issue, like my colleagues from South Shore and West Nova and 
other members of the House who have greatly benefited and even 
enlightened the minister to a degree during the course of the 
debate.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>From that point we know that on September 27 the minister spoke 
of implementing some form of a response, a government action, to 
inform all stakeholders of what the government intended to do. 
That did not come about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 9 the chiefs of the aboriginal communities stated 
that they were willing to embark on the possibility of a 
moratorium.  On October 13, after meeting with the minister, 
hours after he had departed the maritimes, the chiefs themselves 
imposed a moratorium.  It was a self-imposed pre-emptive move to 
give the government time to respond and to formulate its 
response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly, communications have now completely broken down to the 
point where we know the moratorium is no longer in place.  The 
chiefs have decided they will not abide by the self-imposed 
moratorium.  That is problematic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can engage in all kinds of partisan rhetoric.  It is very 
easy for the Reform and the NDP to cast aspersions on current and 
past governments, having never had the luxury of having to make 
those tough decisions.  It is a very easy thing to do, making 
statements that are not true.  It does not make them true simply 
because they are said in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The clock is ticking.  There is more than just preservation of 
stocks at stake; there is preservation of human lives at stake. 
The potential for violence is real.  It has already been played 
out in certain communities like Burnt Church and it is also on 
the tip of breaking out in parts of Nova Scotia, on the South 
Shore in particular and in parts of Cape Breton Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough there are many 
aboriginal participants already in the commercial fishery.  There 
is the ability for peaceful entry into this industry.  That has 
been displayed in the past.  That offer has been extended in the 
past and I assume it will be extended in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Timeliness is the issue now.  I know the minister is sincere in 
his efforts and in his words to find the solutions, but there is 
little time to waste. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister must be proactive.  We support him in his efforts 
to find the solutions, but those solutions will only come from 
the input of all stakeholders, including aboriginals and 
non-aboriginal fishers who have an equally important stake in the 
outcome.  Given what the supreme court has handed down, given 
this dark abyss that is now before us, it does not just pertain 
to fisheries, as we have heard many times in the debate this 
evening.  This goes far beyond one single industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the tip of the iceberg and the government is steaming 
toward that iceberg unless it acts quickly.  With the closing 
moments of the debate I implore the minister to continue on the 
road he is on, but to do so in a very pragmatic and measured way, 
and to listen to the stakeholders who are equally sincere and 
have the greatest stake in the resolution of the matter.  I 
encourage him to do so with post-haste.  We do support him in 
that and I sincerely wish him the very best in finding the 
solutions that will appease all of those who are looking for a 
peaceful resolution to the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciated the comments of my 
colleagues who represent areas which are farther north of my 
riding in Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His previous colleague asked about the moratorium on the 
aboriginal fishery and he just said that what we require are 
peaceful negotiations in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he believe that if the government enforced a moratorium on 
the aboriginal aspects of the fishery that it would lead and be 
conducive to peaceful negotiations and dialogue with the 
non-native people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, obviously an even-handed 
approach is needed.  One approach being suggested, that we would 
single out the aboriginals who have now been given this right by 
the supreme court and attempt to enforce it in a way that is 
unfettered, is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously the minister is not about to single out one of the two 
groups in the divide.  That I suggest would only lead to further 
confrontation and further violence.  The difficulty is that this 
is a tinderbox that is absolutely on the verge of an explosion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not mean to restate the obvious, but the minister has to 
act quickly.  This is something that is going to get out of 
control like wildfire in an instant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Pursuant to order 
made earlier this day, it being 12 o'clock midnight, the motion 
shall be deemed to have been withdrawn and the House shall 
adjourn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It being 12 o'clock midnight the House stands adjourned until 
tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 12.00 a.m.)
