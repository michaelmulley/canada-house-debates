	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
biodiversity means a richness of life as it surrounds us in nature. 
We must preserve biodiversity because it is nature's protection 
against catastrophes. The loss of biodiversity has serious 
implications for life on earth.
<P>
	We have been told that since the beginning of the century 75 
per cent of crop diversity has been lost. This leaves us 
vulnerable. For example uniformity in corn crops could have 
resulted in disaster when a severe blight threatened corn crops in 
the 1970s. By maintaining biodiversity we also help sustain 
ourselves.
<P>
	As a responsible society we in Canada must preserve our still 
rich biodiversity. From our forests and fields to our wetlands, 
lakeshores, parks and lawns our biodiversity is our most 
precious asset.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="AVERAGEINCOMEOFFRANCOPHONES">AVERAGE INCOME OF FRANCOPHONES</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Réjean Lefebvre (Champlain):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
morning's <I>Globe and Mail</I> reported on a Statistics Canada study 
which found that the median income of francophone Canadians 
was more than 10 per cent lower in 1992 than that of 
anglophones. The gap has more than doubled since 1977 and it is 
growing wider every year.
<P>
	Considering that the aim of the Official Languages Act passed 
by the Liberal Party was to give francophones their rightful 
place in the Canadian economy, the only conclusion that can be 
drawn is that the legislation has been a failure.
<P>
	The study also found that Quebec francophones had made up

yesterday after the announcement of the downgrading of 
Canada's rating for foreign currency debt, the Minister of 
Finance stated it only affected a small portion of our total debt 
so it was no big deal.

	Now the Bank of Canada has increased its key lending rate 
which undoubtedly will result in increased borrowing costs for 
Canadian consumers and businesses. It is also having an impact 
on the cost of government borrowing.

Canadians are starting to pay for this short-sightedness.

disaster and revise the budget to deal with the problems it has 
created? Could it be that the government believes that all

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance. During the 
election campaign, the Liberal Party shouted from the rooftops 
that its economic program was based on creating jobs, on 
reducing the deficit by cutting government spending, and on a 
monetary policy balancing job creation with the fight against 
inflation.
<P>
	The government failed at every level. Its first budget got a 
negative reception from the financial community as illustrated 
by the lowering of its credit rating announced the day before 
yesterday.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Finance admit that this lower credit 
rating is due to a negative response from a financial community 
disappointed by the timid and inadequate budget measures to 
reduce departmental operating expenditures?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, I cannot believe that the 
Leader of the Opposition who criticizes us at every turn because 
we have cut military bases, reformed unemployment insurance, 
and trimmed government machinery, who spent three months 
criticizing our cuts, suddenly rises to tell us we did not cut 
enough.
<P>
	So I ask you this: Where do you want us to cut? Tell us exactly 
in what areas!
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there are many areas and the minister knows it. Let us 
think about the family trusts he is protecting in a rather special 
fashion.
<P>
	I am convinced that the reason the financial community 
lowered Canada's credit rating is not because we cut too much, 
but because we did not cut deep enough, contrary to the 
commitments that were made.
<P>
	I would ask the minister to comment on the government's 
timid spending reduction efforts combined with its obsession 
with fighting inflation, which is almost non-existent, causing a 
rise in interest rates, and I ask him specifically whether it is right 
that the upward pressure on interest rates should compromise 
the already slim chances of economic recovery and job creation, 
with the well-known negative effects on businesses and the 
unemployed.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Yes, I am looking at you, Mr. 
Speaker. It is much better than looking elsewhere.
<P>
	First of all, interest rates even today are much lower than they 
were three months, six months or a year ago. Second, as you 
know full well, the increase in interest rates is due to 
international reasons that have nothing to do with the situation 
here in Canada.
<P>
	As far as budget cuts are concerned, we gave the Leader of the 
Opposition and his colleagues the opportunity to make 
suggestions in a pre-budget debate; they did not take that 
opportunity, so what are they telling us now?

speeches and noises we sometimes hear in this House, which 
take the place of monetary and fiscal policies. They spoke very 
toughly and very eloquently this week by lowering Canada's 
credit rating. There are also the unemployed and others.
<P>
	I ask the Minister of Finance whether he is willing to review 
his inefficient and unfair approach which consists in attacking 
the unemployed by cutting their benefits to force them to look 
for non-existent jobs instead of going after the actual causes of 
unemployment.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, regarding our fight 
against unemployment, our job-creation plan was endorsed by 
the G-7 countries, by France, Germany and the United States.
<P>
	When we look at the results for the month of February, 66,000 
new jobs were created, including 15,000 in Quebec. And when 
we look at what we did by lowering unemployment insurance 
premiums, everything we did for small and medium-sized 
businesses, the high-tech networks, when we look at the action 
plan to create jobs, it must be said that this government is doing 
the right thing.

us yesterday that he is doing the exact same thing as the 
Conservatives. He strongly reaffirmed the Bank of Canada's 
goal to fight inflation. What an about-face in four short months! 
One can wonder what to expect for the next four years, Mr.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> I will start over, Mr. Speaker. I thought you 
were rising to indicate that my preamble was too long. That is 
why I sat down.
<P>
	Let me put my question again to the minister. After tabling a 
Conservative-style budget, does the Minister of Finance not 
realize that he is reneging on his election commitment by 
pursuing the same obsessive fight against inflation and refusing 
to make lowering unemployment the priority of the Bank of 
Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>First of all, Mr. Speaker, I must say 
we were better off before the hon. member put his question. I 
want to congratulate him on the way he read the quote.
<P>
	As far as the question is concerned, is the hon. member going 
back on what his own leader said? Is he telling us that maybe we 
should not preserve what has been achieved in the fight against 
inflation, at the price of so much effort, as we know? Is the hon. 
member actually saying that we should not have low interest 
rates in this country? Should we not take advantage of these 
lower rates to stimulate employment in Canada? Is he denying 
all he has learned as an economics student? Not likely. Maybe. 
He says he denies it. What is he denying, the denial or having 
studied economics?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Let us not forget that we have several questions 
to hear today, from both sides. So, let us hear from this side now. 
I recognize the hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I have a supplementary question. It is strange all the same to see 
the Minister of Finance throw his short-term job creation creed 
out the window, just days after the G-7 Summit. So, I will ask 
him again.
<P>
	Does the minister not agree that, by pursuing this obsessive 
inflation reduction policy, which his own party fingered as the 
main cause of the latest recession, he is knowingly stifling any 
hope of economic recovery and employment development in 
Quebec as well as in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt in our 
minds that job creation is our number one priority. That is why 
we were so happy to see that 66,000 new jobs had been created in 
Canada in February, as I just mentioned, 15,000 of which are in 
Quebec.
<P>
	Let us assess the situation: consumer confidence has grown 13 
per cent during the fourth quarter; retail sales increased by 1.2 
per cent in January, following a 1.1 per cent increase in 
December; and car sales have increased significantly. Our 
economy is growing, and that is because of the confidence 
Canadians have in us.

my question is also for the Minister of Finance.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2668"> 2668 </A></B>
<P>
	The minister's budget projects a bank rate of 4.5 per cent, 
a long term bond rate of 6.4 per cent and interest costs of $41 
billion this year. It also predicts a 1 per cent rise in interest rates 
will add about $1.7 billion to the deficit.
<P>
	Today the Bank of Canada rate is already half a per cent higher 
than projected and rising interest rates are mainly due to higher 
interest rates in the United States over which the government 
has no control.
<P>
	Will the minister today acknowledge that his estimates for 
next year's budget deficit are simply too low? Just acknowledge 
it so that the House can get on with addressing the real problem 
that represents.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member's statement in terms of the 
short term interest rates is a little out of date as of the present 
time, although the numbers he cited were good as of about ten 
o'clock this morning.
<P>
	The member is nonetheless right in one area and that is on the 
long term rates. The long term rates are higher than those which 
we projected.
<P>
	When one looks at the degree of conservatism which we built 
into all of the forecasts, that is to say in terms of growth, 
inflation and interest rates, we are very confident that the 
projections we have made in our budget will be attained.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is the degree of conservatism that we are particularly worried 
about.
<P>
	Just last week the minister's parliamentary secretary 
answered a question on rising interest rates by saying: ``The 
outlines in the budget were done very conservatively. These 
types of considerations, that is higher interest rates, were taken 
into account''.
<P>
	Does the finance department actually have in place a 
contingency plan for dealing with the impact of higher interest 
rates on the budget as the minister's parliamentary secretary has 
implied?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, we remain very confident in the 
objectives and our ability to attain the objectives that have been 
set out in the budget.
<P>
	As I mentioned, the deficit projections that we made, the 
question of revenues and expenditures, are based on a series of 
projections. While the member is obviously right in terms of 
long term interest rates, the fact is that we are nonetheless easily 
within the safe side on the vast majority of our projections.
<P>
	I would like to say one other thing. The member made 
reference to my use of the word conservatism and the use of the 
same word by my parliamentary secretary. I share that 
difficulty. I wish I could find another word, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a further supplementary question.
<P>
	There must have been somebody in the finance department 
who had anticipated interest rates higher than those projected in 
the budget and what to do about it. I ask the minister if the 
government will be forthright and publish its real interest rate 
projections and its real interest cost projections as distinct from 
those contained in the red ink book.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, the interest rate projections are simply 
part of a series of projections within the budget. We remain 
confident that we are going to attain the objectives of the budget.
<P>
	We are going to have the opportunity to sit down some time 
after Easter with members of the Reform Party, as has been 
described in discussions with Mr. Speaker and myself. We are 
quite prepared to go through all of the various scenarios and 
discuss a multitude of contingencies.

my question is for the Minister responsible for the Federal 
Office of Regional Development in Quebec.
<P>
	Yesterday, the big three American automakers clearly 
indicated that they had no intention of taking over the Hyundai 
plant in Bromont. In answer to a question from the media, the 
Minister of Finance said that if the big three persist in ignoring 
the Bromont facility, the government might decide to look up 
companies from other sectors.
<P>
	Is the minister confirming that the big three American 
automakers do not intend to participate in the recovery of the 
Bromont plant, and can he specify which type of businesses he 
was referring to yesterday?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister

	As you know, the Quebec minister of Industry himself, Mr. 
Tremblay, said yesterday that he was still hoping to negotiate 
with the automakers and that he intended to contact them. In 
fact, I think he had already done so. Therefore, we should wait 
for the outcome of the discussions between Mr. Tremblay and 
those companies.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Péloquin (Brome-Missisquoi):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
does the minister agree that the closure of the car assembly plant 
in Bromont will put Quebec at an even greater disadvantage, 
compared to Ontario, regarding subcontracting in the auto 
industry, and that a real strategy must be implemented to correct 
this situation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
</B><B>responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, I already said that I was 
very disappointed by Hyundai's decision. I am very familiar 
with the situation-in fact, I live in the hon. member's 
constituency-and I know the region very well. I fully agree to 
co-operate with the Quebec government and the municipality of 
Bromont to truly find a solution to this situation.

	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
also for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	The minister has stated repeatedly that his budget is a 
two-part strategy and that severe cuts are coming next year. At 
the same time the Prime Minister maintains that all proposed 
cuts are already on the table.
<P>
	There are no spending cuts in the budget for next year which 
could be described as severe, and on this basis can the Minister 
of Finance tell Canadians if severe cuts are coming, and if so 
why is the Prime Minister not aware of them?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, what the Prime Minister said is exactly 
what I said in the House when the budget was presented, that the 
cuts and the actions taken in the February 22 budget in and of 
themselves will lead to a reduction of the deficit, bringing it to 
the point of 3 per cent of GDP in three years.
<P>
	At the same time in the budget, and the Prime Minister 
repeated it, there were a series of measures regarding the 
re-examination of the way that government operates. Some are 
led by the Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, a 
number of others are led by the Minister of Human Resources 
Development, and a  series of other ministers, including the 
Minister of Transport, is going to continue to lead our efforts to 
clean up the nation's finances.
<P>
	That is what the Prime Minister said, that is what I said, and 
that is our position.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert):</B> Mr. Speaker, the financial 
markets recognize that there must be severe cuts in spending if 
Canada is to avoid a severe financial crisis. Rising interest rates 
indicate that they expect the government to renege on their 
second round of cuts.
<P>
	The credibility of the Minister of Finance is at stake, and his 
audience extends well beyond the House. Will the minister 
assure us that the deep spending cuts are coming and will be 
imposed?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, we said very clearly that the February 
22 budget was the first stage of a two-stage process.
<P>
	We had been in power for slightly over 100 days when we 
brought in our first budget and what we were doing was 
reviewing all government operations. That review is under way 
and its results will be manifest not only in the next budget but in 
announcements that will be made by ministers over the course of 
the next year and in periods following.
<P>
<B>(1435 ) </B>
<P>
	We were elected on two bases, one to create jobs and one to 
clean up the nation's finances. There is no doubt in my mind that 
at the end of our mandate, the Canadian people will find that we 
have been faithful to our word.

attempted to reach out to Canadians in a wide variety of fora. We 
certainly look forward to the report of the committee.

other ways and means of tapping into the opinions of Canadians. 
As a result, my department and various provinces across the

could come and express their views, be heard, have a dialogue 
and get into a serious debate.

regular income program as a first step to introduce a guaranteed 
minimum income program throughout Canada and then to force

all she wants but the fact is that we are being very serious and 
sincere about soliciting the views of a large number of 
Canadians.
<P>
	One of the aspects we take very seriously is working with the 
provincial governments where we can develop a series of pilot 
projects, new models, and new techniques we can test out during 
this period of re-examination to determine what works well. In 
this day and age where there is such complexity in the job

best.

project the government is committed to making sure that we 
have an open process, a transparent process. As he also knows, 
thousands of pages of documents have been given out to make 
sure that all information is available in the BCUC hearings.
<P>
	In terms of intervener funding, as was indicated by the 
minister earlier we will look at groups that can apply to the 
department. We will be open and ensure that we will consider 
intervener groups. Some budget is available but they would have 
to make an application. We would look at it and we would

	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member raises a question that is causing grave 
concerns in the industry for shippers, consumers and clients. 
We are trying to encourage a solution that will be arrived at 
through consultation among the various players. It is a very 
complicated matter, as the hon. member would know.

for lease. We are actively pursuing this. I recognize the urgency 
of it and we will do the very best we can.

	<B>Mr. Alfonso Gagliano (Saint-Léonard):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
on a point of order. I want to bring to the attention of the House 
something which happened today in Question Period.
<P>
	Since the opening of the 35th Parliament, I think all members 
of this House and especially the whips have always tried to keep 
decorum so that we can have good debate.
<P>
	I understand that in the heat of debate sometimes members 
can heckle or speak a little bit louder. However, today I was very 
disturbed by what occurred, especially when it involved a 
political party that before, during and after the election lectured 
us about how we should behave here. Posters were displayed, 
not only by an individual member but by more than a row of their 
seats. I think it was deliberately organized. It is a shame that for 
the past three months we have been trying to have decorum and 
today regretfully we broke that practice.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> As a matter of fact, since the 35th Parliament 
began all hon. members, I believe, have done their utmost to 
have decorum in the House.
<P>
	As I mentioned in the course of Question Period, we did ask 
all hon. colleagues to cease and desist from any such displays. I 
am sure the words of the hon. whip will be taken to heart by all of 
us because I think it is coming along well and I would encourage 
hon. members to please keep a sense of decorum in the House.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SUPPLEMENTARYQUESTIONS">SUPPLEMENTARY QUESTIONS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, on a 
point of order. I would ask you to examine the blues from 
Question Period. You ruled my supplementary question out of 
order before I had a chance to put it. My question was: ``Would 
the government simply consider looking into these matters with 
its constitutional lawyer-''
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I will make this commitment to the hon. 
member. I will review the blues and if indeed there was an error 
on my part I will get back to the House and I will try to correct it.
<P>
	I try to listen as much as I can to the gist of the question before 
members get to it. Therefore, if I do err I would beg the 
indulgence of the House. I would also ask that if some questions 
could be better put on the Order Paper so as to get a more 
complete answer, then perhaps that is where hon. members 
should attempt to put that type of question. However, I will 
make that commitment and I will have a look at the blues.
<P>
	My colleagues, we are going to have tributes.

<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I was going to formally introduce our Librarian

ideas.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
pleased to have been asked by my party, the Bloc Quebecois, to 
rise in this House today to congratulate Mr. Erik John Spicer on 
his appointment as Parliamentary Librarian Emeritus.
<P>
	I was first elected to this House on November 21, 1988. As a 
newcomer and government member at the time, I wanted to 
know all there was to know. I am naturally curious, of course. I 
wanted all the information on all items on the agenda, 
particularly on a subject that has always concerned me: 
firearms. I wanted to know what legislation and regulations 
there were in European countries on that subject. I wanted to 
know under what authority the Americans kept saying that they 
had an almost 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2675"> 2675 </A></B>
<P>
natural right to own firearms. All my questions were answered 
by the Library of Parliament.
<P>
	Also, when we sat on committees, and it is still the case today, 
we could always count on the library, especially for legislative 
summaries on the various subjects. The Library of Parliament 
research branch is always ready and willing to provide 
information to assist us in our quest for truth.
<P>
	It has also developed briefings for members and departmental 
assistants so that we and our staff know where to look and who to 
contact to obtain all the information required for the smooth 
functioning of our offices.
<P>
	Furthermore, if you miss one of these briefings, you can 
always ask the Library of Parliament for the audio tapes. Again, 
you will get the same excellent service.
<P>
	All this to say that we greatly appreciate the services 
developed for us, members of Parliament, as well as for our 
assistants, to enable us to carry out our duties adequately. Many 
thanks to Mr. Spicer.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> We will hear from the hon. member for Beaver 
River. Inadvertently I cut off my colleague for Vancouver 
Quadra, whom I will recognize after the member for Beaver 
River.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on 
behalf of my party today as well and offer congratulations to Mr. 
Spicer for a long and remarkable career in this place, certainly 
longer than many have been able to celebrate.
<P>
	I have known Erik Spicer for five years in my capacity as the 
member of Parliament for Beaver River. Of course, in my unique 
position in the last Parliament I must say it was wonderful to 
have somebody to call on who knew what they were doing in 
Parliament. The services that were offered to me sitting as an 
independent member were just terrific.
<P>
	To know that there was an incredible number of well qualified 
people in the Library offering their services and help to me was 
marvellous. As a qualified English teacher who had spent 10 
years in the teaching profession to see a library like this at my 
disposal was marvellous. I want to thank Mr. Spicer so much for 
being helpful to me and to my staff.
<P>
	What I will always remember about Mr. Spicer as I look at 
him now in the gallery is his marvellous smile. He is somebody 
who has always been cheerful. I do not think there has been a 
time I have come across him, whether it has been in the elevator, 
the Library, anywhere in the hallways or in the cafeteria, when 
he has not been cheerful and very pleasant to work with. 
Certainly that is much appreciated as well.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	In this new Parliament of course the Library was just as 
astounded as the table and everybody else to see so many new 
members elected to this Parliament. I am sure that was a huge 
surprise but also an incredible amount of work.
<P>
	From the floor of the House of Commons today I would like to 
say thank you on behalf of all the members here, especially new 
members, for the orientation sessions that were offered 
regarding the Library and all the services that have been given.
<P>
	What a marvellous place to work in, the parliamentary library. 
I will never forget my first steps through that doorway and just 
literally having my breath taken away when I looked at that 
place. What a marvellous place to have worked for several 
decades now. I know that he will miss it a great deal.
<P>
	Mr. Spicer is leaving probably one of the most beautiful 
offices on Parliament Hill, but he is going to see all kinds of 
beautiful places.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, as you and I and the Spicers know, they love to 
travel. This will be a good jumping off spot for them, going from 
a beautiful office on Parliament Hill, the finest that Canada has 
to offer, to many other places.
<P>
	I would like to pay tribute to Erik and his wife Helen, both of 
whom are librarians. I was amused when I read in a recent issue 
of the <I>Hill Times</I>: ``That a major occupation for them while 
moving from a large home into a smaller condo has been the 
packing of their books for the move''. That is no small wonder. 
With two librarians one can imagine the number of books in 
their private library. I dare say that has been a huge challenge to 
both of them.
<P>
	I would like to pay tribute also to their daughter Erika who 
grew up in a home with I am sure an incredible love and respect 
for books. I am sure that she passes that on to her three daughters 
today. They are going from a beautiful place to many visits all 
around the world. I know they will be stopping in Vancouver 
regularly to visit their daughter and granddaughters.
<P>
	One final memory that I have which will remain special with 
me forever is being on the elevator a couple of weeks ago. There 
was a group of senior citizens who obviously had been for dinner 
in the parliamentary restaurant. I just happened to be on the 
elevator riding down from my fifth floor office and I had a little 
visit with one of the women there. She said to me: ``A group of 
friends and I have come from the lodge today and we had lunch 
in the parliamentary restaurant''. I said: ``Well, that is really 
nice. Is there a special occasion or what?'' She said: ``No, not 
particularly. We were just getting together. Erik Spicer is my 
son''. It was just a treat for her to be able to come and celebrate 
that. She just beamed when she talked about her son Erik. That 
was so special because they were out for lunch on Parliament 
Hill and having a marvellous time at it. I will always remember 
the gleam in her eye and the smile that  she shared with me when 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2676"> 2676 </A></B>
<P>
she said: ``Erik Spicer is my son''. She was proud of him and I 
would say she has ever reason to be proud of Erik.
<P>
	Good luck and congratulations to both of them as they retire. 
They are held in high esteem in this place. God bless them both.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
echo the remarks of the hon. member for Saint-Hubert and the 
hon. member for Beaver River in the gracious tribute they have 
paid to our parliamentary Librarian Emeritus. Erik Spicer 
served for 33 years at the rank of deputy minister. That must be a 
record of achievement for Ottawa. He has presided over the 
transition of the Library from the classic library formation to the 
electronic age, at the same time conserving the immense 
richness of the past of the accumulated collections.
<P>
	A librarian sometimes does not have the time to read his 
books he is so busy. However, this is a gentleman who has read 
books, a cultivated, witty, articulate gentleman. He has 
recognized, as Solon did, that wise law making rests upon wise 
study of the past of the accumulated wisdom in books. One 
cannot separate a library from the business of making laws. 
They go together.
<P>
	It is in this sense that the Library of Parliament represents a 
treasure house. It is the jewel in the crown in a real sense in this 
large parliamentary edifice over which you preside, Mr. 
Speaker.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	What Erik Spicer has done, the co-operation he has given, the 
great impartiality, the openness with which he has presided over 
the researchers-and never forget we have a magnificent 
research staff freely available to all parties, to people of all 
opinions within the House-has brought this together, 
concentrated in his own very unique personality. We shall all 
miss him.
<P>
	We wish him, his wife and his family a pleasant and I am sure 
an intellectually active retirement. Thank you very much for 
accepting the treasure of Parliament when you were appointed 
Librarian, for conserving it, for adding to it, for augmenting it 
and making it one of the great institutions of the 
Commonwealth, of the world which has inherited its 
parliamentary traditions ultimately from the Greeks and 
Romans and the Britons and the French and all the new cultures 
that our country represents.
<P>
	Thank you, sir, and a pleasant and honourable retirement 
which you have so richly earned.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too am pleased 
to join with my colleagues to wish our distinguished Librarian 
well.
<P>
	I could not help but think when the member for Beaver River 
indicated that the first time she walked into the Library and 
looked up she was awestruck, I thought she was going to say it 
was because of Erik Spicer. I think that is how we all felt when 
we first met Erik Spicer. He probably was the ultimate symbol of 
devoted public service.
<P>
	I remember over the years having all sorts of library needs or 
research needs that not only were always met and met in a timely 
way, but always beyond even my wildest expectations and 
wildest hopes. The leadership that he provided for so many years 
was nothing short of awesome and outstanding.
<P>
	Not only was Erik Spicer a distinguished Librarian for many 
years, but more than that, as my hon. friend from Beaver River 
intimated, he was a friend to everyone. Whenever you would 
encounter Erik Spicer you knew that you were with a friend, 
always there to ask a friendly word about how life was going and 
how your trials and tribulations were unfolding as a member of 
Parliament.
<P>
	He is a genuine individual, a gentleman in every sense of the 
term, an outstanding and dedicated Librarian, a professional 
known around the world for his ability and leadership in 
establishing for Canada and for us here in Parliament what must 
be one of the best libraries and research facilities available to 
parliamentarians anywhere.
<P>
	We will miss him, but we will be seeing Erik Spicer around, 
knowing the kind of gentleman he is. On behalf of my colleagues 
in the New Democratic Party and all of the independents we 
wish not only him but his wife Helen and daughter well. We hope 
to be seeing him for a long time in the future.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> As your Speaker it is very rare that I speak in 
the House, but I do take this opportunity as a parliamentarian, as 
one of you, to express our great vote of thanks to you, Mr. 
Spicer.
<P>
	You have brought distinction to your profession. Witness the 
title of Librarian Emeritus. There can be no higher honour paid.
<P>
	You leave us here with a wealth of books and in a sense a 
wealth of knowledge in this edifice. But more than that you have 
prepared countless parliamentarians by making information 
accessible to them, on which they can make rational and good 
decisions and good laws for all Canadians. You have done a 
great service to us here in the House and your service has 
extended to your country even beyond this House.
<P>
	Sir, you are well worthy of all of the accolades that you have 
heard on this day.
<P>
<B>(1520 ) </B>
<P>
	As Speaker, I wish you the very best of health. I hope that you 
and Helen will enjoy all of your many years to come, as much as

privilege I want to thank the hon. member for holding off on the 
point of privilege until these tributes were paid. I asked that he 
do this through my Clerk.
<P>
	I am going to hear the point of privilege. I would simply 
indicate to the hon. member that I as the Speaker have heard the 
point of privilege that was brought up earlier. I was prepared 
earlier to make a ruling on the information that was before me 
then, but (a) I was asked by the hon. member to withhold the 
decision, and (b) the hon. member withdrew that point of 
privilege.
<P>
	If this is the same point of privilege that the hon. member is 
bringing up, I would ask him to please at the beginning identify 
for me precisely which point has been infringed, and second, I 
would ask him to bring new information if there is such, or if it is 
the same point of privilege that the hon. member brought up 
before. If the hon. member would do that it would help the Chair

Mr. Speaker, this point of privilege relates to the question I 
raised on February 15 and it is very brief.
<P>
	I rise here today on the question of privilege after consulting 
with counsel and having discussed the issues of blackmail and 
the unfounded allegations made against me. I wish to re-submit 
my original question of privilege of February 15 so that all these 
issues may be investigated accordingly in the appropriate 
committee.
<P>
	I trust your decision will be favourable, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	Concerning all the information that has come up, after 
discussing it with counsel I was informed that the details were 
not so pressing as I had believed they were. Therefore the issue 
remains almost the same as I had raised earlier. The discussion 
which I had with counsel did not produce any new material at all.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> So that your Speaker is absolutely clear, the 
hon. member wishes me to make a ruling on the information 
which has been put before me at an earlier time.
<P>
	If this is what the hon. member is asking me, then I will gladly 
do that. I will review all of the notes. I will review <I>Hansard</I>. I 
will review all of the information which has been put before me 
and I will be making a ruling to this House at the earliest 
possible time.

would like to summarize these petitions.
<P>

teen smoking which will be caused by the change. The second 
which also has 25 signatures suggests there will be more

deaths in World War I and World War II combined. The third 
petition also with 25 signatures contains a reminder that the 
problem was Canadian tobacco which was being imported back 
into the country.
<P>
	The next petition also has 25 signatures and suggests that the 
change could create two million more tobacco addicts in 
Canada. The next petition points out that between one-third and 
one-half of all smokers eventually die from tobacco use. The 
next petition which has 75 signatures stresses the effective 
marking of all tobacco products.
<P>
	The second last petition with 25 signatures supports the idea 
of high export taxes rather than the lowering of the sales tax. The 
last one which has 34 signatures points out that in Peterborough 
riding alone 200 people die every year from tobacco use. It also 
points out that the incidence of lung cancer in women has tripled

	The House resumed from March 18 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-14, an act to provide borrowing authority for 
the fiscal year beginning April 1, 1994, be read the the third time 
and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
although I have spoken many times in the House during 
members' statements and question period, I am pleased to rise in 
the House for the first time without a severe time constraint in 
response to the debate on Bill C-14.
<P>
	I would first like to offer my congratulations to you on your 
appointment as Deputy Speaker of the House. I also 
congratulate all members of the House on their successful 
campaigns, especially those members who have been 
re-elected. During a time when the public is growing more wary 
of politicians being returned to Parliament that is a feat worth 
noting. It should be an interesting and productive Parliament.
<P>
	My thanks to the constituents of Kootenay West-Revelstoke 
for the confidence they have shown in me to be their 
representative here in Parliament.
<P>
	I will not take the usual time to wax eloquent about the beauty 
of my riding. Those who are from there know how incredible it 
is. Those who are from other places are mistaken in believing 
that theirs equal it.
<P>
	It is not the intention of the Reform Party to criticize the 
government just for the sake of opposition as was often the style 
of opposition parties in the past. We will be the first to 
acknowledge good legislation when it occurs. Likewise when 
we do not agree with the government position we will try to offer 
constructive alternatives.
<P>
	We want this Parliament to work for all Canadians, not just 
whoever makes the best speech from time to time. We stand 
prepared to work with the government and co-operate on any 
legislation that is in the best interests of the citizens of Canada.
<P>
	Bill C-14 is somewhat of an enigma. I recognize on one hand 
that the government must have funds to operate during the 
ensuing period of awaiting the arrival of some of the tax dollars 
Canadian taxpayers have been sentenced to pay. On the other 
hand I am in a position in which I cannot in good conscience vote 
to support providing the government with its first instalment of 
an unacceptable level of spending. What is the alternative?
<P>
<B>(1535 ) </B>
<P>
	The alternative is to have come out with a budget based on 
spending reductions leading to a balanced budget and ultimately 
tax reductions. Had this been done Canadian taxpayers, myself 
among them, may not have felt the same level of hostility about 
the lack of restraint  by the government. I would have been able 
to support this bill to temporarily borrow funds for reduced 
levels of spending.
<P>
	Whenever someone goes to the bank or another financial 
institution to borrow money, the first thing the lender does is to 
look at the ability of the borrower to repay the loan. The 
Canadian government goes to a lot of lenders these days. I can 
assure members that these lenders look very closely at Canada's 
ability to repay the loans and they do not like what they see.
<P>
	When these lenders look at Canada, do they see a borrower 
who needs to borrow to fulfil a short term shortage?-not likely. 
Canada has been in debt since the first world war. Do they see a 
borrower that is paying off its loan? Again the exact opposite is 
true. Not only are we not paying off our loan, we cannot even pay 
any of the interest on it.
<P>
	In 1993 we were going into debt at the alarming rate of 
$56,000 a minute. Now one year later and four months into the 
new Liberal government we are going into debt at the rate of 
$84,000 a minute. It would be bad enough if the rate at which our 
debt was increasing had not improved, but in reality we are 
heading into a national debt hole we may not be able to get out 
of, at the accelerated rate of 50 per cent faster than one year ago. 
This is hardly something to inspire the confidence of the 
international lending place.
<P>
	Do these lenders see a borrower that is expanding its business 
so as to be more profitable at some point in the future? There is 
no question that in the new budget the government intends to 
increase its revenues. Does this really relate to the equivalent of 
a business increasing its profits?-hardly. A more fitting 
analogy would be a situation where a business proposed to 
charge higher prices for its goods or services with absolutely no 
indication that anyone would or could pay this inflated price.
<P>
	The government's utopian projections are based on so many 
variables that even a fanatical optimist would be shaken.
<P>
	The next thing a lender looks at is the credibility of the main 
players in the company. They want to see if those major players 
are likely to lead the company to success and solvency or to 
greater debt and bankruptcy.
<P>
	If the lenders look at the main players in the government, who 
do they see? They would see the Minister of Finance, the main 
financial officer of the government who went on a great tour of 
Canada to find out what Canadians wanted them to do. An 
overwhelming number of those consulted and not consulted said 
we should cut the spending and we should not raise taxes.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2680"> 2680 </A></B>
<P>
	What did Canada's chief financial officer do? He increased 
government spending by $3.3 billion. He relied on increased 
revenues, taxes, to make up the difference in the spending hike, 
the exact opposite of what Canadians asked for. If he was not 
going to listen to what Canadians said, why then did he go 
through the sham and the expense of these hollow hearings?
<P>
	Who were these Canadians who spoke out against increased 
spending and taxes? They were everyday Canadians who turned 
out at meetings across this country. They were small business 
owners and major corporations. They were organizations like 
the Vancouver Board of Trade, the British Columbia Chamber of 
Commerce, the Fraser Institute and the Canadian Taxpayers 
Federation. They were publications like <I>Maclean's</I>, the 
Vancouver <I>Sun</I>, the Toronto <I>Globe and Mail</I> and the <I>Financial 
Post</I>. They were economists and financial experts from across 
this country.
<P>
	Even a member from the government side of the House was 
compelled to rise in defence of his own constituents. He pointed 
out to the Minister of Finance that if he had somehow heard 
Canadians state that they welcomed tax increases as he claimed 
they did, he did not hear it in the member's riding.
<P>
	If the lenders looked at the CEO of the government, the Prime 
Minister, what would they see in terms of assurance, of the will 
and the expertise to bring the country out of its financial crisis? 
They would see a former Minister of Finance in whose hands the 
debt of this nation rose by 60 per cent during the two fiscal years 
he held that position.
<P>
	During the week following the release of the 1994-95 budget 
figures the Prime Minister went on a national tour to sell this 
spending package. During an interview in Calgary in which it 
was very obvious the package was not selling well, the Prime 
Minister retorted that this was not a Tory budget nor a Reform 
budget nor an NDP budget; it was a Liberal budget. Of this there 
can be no doubt. It has always been the philosophy of the Liberal 
Party to tax and spend and in this it certainly has been true to its 
own philosophy. The question is can it work? The answer is a 
resounding no. The problem now is how do we get this point 
across to the main players of the government.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	Let us suppose for a moment that these two people were mere 
mortals like the rest of us. Let us suppose they had a house with a 
mortgage, a car loan, children going to college who needed 
financial help. Let us suppose they had a paycheque with an ever 
decreasing disposable income and an economic future that held 
very little security. Can either of them honestly suggest that if 
they were in that situation they would support an increase in the 
very taxes that drained the lifeblood from them, their families 
and their future? I think not.
<P>
	Would the Minister of Finance operate a company with the 
huge debt and interest payments this country has? Would he 
maintain inefficiency and duplication in that company by 
paying out more than required for various services and by 
expanding the company in areas that would lead to more debt 
without any increase in revenues or relief of the overall problem 
of the debt? Not very likely.
<P>
	Why then is he offering this as a solution to the identical 
problems of this country? Why is he going to the Canadian 
taxpayers by way of their elected representatives and asking for 
the authority to begin this great spending plan by borrowing 
money for round one?
<P>
	An explanation of the cause of this country's debt is not some 
great mystery like how they get the caramilk inside the 
chocolate bar. It is very simple for anyone who takes the trouble 
to look at the problem.
<P>
	Canadians are looking at two problems: unemployment and 
debt. To solve these problems we have to decide if one causes 
the other and if so, which one to remove to solve the other.
<P>
	If the government were to incur enough new debt to put every 
person in this country to work would that solve the debt 
problem? Of course it would not. If the country were able to get 
rid of its debt which is eating up our tax dollars and screaming 
ever louder for more would employment return? To answer that 
let us look at the unemployment problem and how it got so bad.
<P>
	As this country's debt became larger and larger so did its 
appetite for tax dollars. When taxes go up, individual Canadians 
have less disposable income to spend on Canadian goods and 
services. At the same time when the taxes of Canadian 
companies go up, it is reflected in the price of their products. 
This makes it even harder for Canadians to purchase those 
products and also makes it difficult for these companies to 
compete with their international trading partners.
<P>
	As a result, these companies have to shut down 
non-profitable sections of their operations and streamline the 
remaining operations. This results in the laying off of a great 
number of Canadian workers.
<P>
	The solution then is to reduce the government's appetite for 
these tax dollars by reducing spending, balancing the budget and 
then working toward the reduction of taxes in this country. 
Simply put, this will provide individual Canadians with more 
disposable income with which to purchase Canadian goods and 
services. It will reduce the cost of these same Canadian goods 
and services and will make Canadian companies more 
competitive with their international trading partners.
<P>
	It stands to reason if Canadian companies are able to market 
more products profitably they will expand and hire Canadians 
instead of closing down and laying Canadians off. Is this a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2681"> 2681 </A></B>
<P>
simplistic solution? Of course it is, but it is the only one that will 
work.
<P>
	Maybe part of the problem is that everyone wants to find some 
complex, earth shattering solution which puts their own 
personal stamp on the recovery. The real solution does not 
belong to any one party or person. It is a matter of facing reality 
and reversing the disastrous actions of the past. Maybe then 
Canadians would not be so reluctant to approve temporary 
borrowing authority.
<P>
	What we should do is take an honest look at how we got into 
our current financial mess. In the past the vote of Canadians has 
been for sale and the politicians of the past have bought that 
vote.
<P>
	They bought it with overly generous social spending; not 
overly generous for those in need but overly generous for those 
not in need. They bought it with subsidies to business; not all 
business, only specially selected businesses that were in a 
position to aid the politicians or parties providing the grants. 
They bought it with subsidies to crown corporations in answer to 
special interest groups. They bought it with grants to those same 
special interest groups instead of requiring them to get their 
funding from those they claimed to represent. They bought it 
from rich or politically well connected individuals with 
promises of plum patronage appointments. Then they made 
good on those appointments.
<P>
	Why would anyone act in a manner that is so detrimental to 
the needs of all Canadians?
<P>
<B>(1545 ) </B>
<P>
	In the politics of the past, with exceptions, there have been 
two rules. The first is to get elected and the second is to stay 
elected. Nothing else mattered. Now we have to pay the price. 
We have run up a debt of over half a trillion dollars and we are 
increasing that debt by $1 million every 12 minutes.
<P>
	If government members want to restore public confidence in 
them and get the country on its feet, they must alter the budget 
by reducing the government's spending and balancing the 
budget within the term of the 35th Parliament of Canada.
<P>
	The country will balance its budget and start paying off its 
huge debt in the foreseeable future. That is not in question. What 
is in question is the manner in which it will be done. We can 
choose to start now selecting the methods and speed with which 
we implement the program of financial responsibility, or we can 
wait as New Zealand did and have someone else make those 
decisions for us. Some might scoff at the idea of comparing 
ourselves with New Zealand and they would be right. The truth 
of the matter is that we are now much worse off financially than 
New Zealand was when it was forced to deal with its financial 
crisis.
<P>
	Could the government have made a significant reduction in 
spending in its first budget in 10 years? I bet it could and I 
suspect more than one of its members would like to follow that 
course of action.
<P>
	The areas in which the government could have reduced 
spending in its budget are numerous. I will list but a few 
examples of what could have been accomplished. Budget cuts in 
government operations will save $470 million. A reduction of 
15 per cent of non-salaried overhead is achievable and would 
save $1.25 billion and the elimination of low priority 
government functions would save hundreds of millions more.
<P>
	The budget reduced business subsidies by $120 million. 
Business subsidies are selective and available only to the chosen 
few. It would be far better off to eliminate all subsidies totalling 
up to $5 billion and work toward general tax deductions instead. 
If this had been done, the elimination of the capital gains 
exemption and tax increases on medium sized Canadian 
businesses would not have been necessary and job creation 
would have been stimulated, not discouraged. Instead of 
spending money to study funding of special interest groups, it 
could cut that funding, saving half a billion dollars a year.
<P>
	Reductions of supplements for senior citizens who have a 
higher than average income is not an unreasonable concept, but 
the government should have looked at family income rather than 
at individual income. An income of $26,000 a year is not 
particularly high, but if a couple has $52,000 a year income a 
reduction of non-contributory income or credits is not 
unreasonable. In that area refocusing of the old age pension on 
people with family income below $54,000 a year would save 
$3.5 billion. A 25 per cent reduction in the subsidy of crown 
corporations would save $1.25 billion a year.
<P>
	The government knows well that we have many other 
spending reduction proposals. I am sure it has many in mind. 
The few I have listed would have resulted in a reduction of this 
year's deficit by $10.5 billion. If the government complemented 
that by eliminating the spending increases in the budget, we 
would have had a deficit this year of approximately $26 billion. 
Had the government followed this course of action, I believe it 
would have won the approval of an overwhelming majority of 
taxpayers and I would have been able to support Bill C-14.
<P>
	It is not too late. If the government is now ready to accept the 
$153 billion spending cap proposed by the Reform Party in the 
throne speech debate, I would be pleased to support the 
government's bill to borrow money for necessary spending.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate the member on his maiden speech. I enjoyed it. I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2682"> 2682 </A></B>
<P>
thought he had a lot to say. I also enjoyed the fact that he put the 
details to his theories so that we could tell exactly what kind of 
budgetary savings were possible with his suggestions.
<P>
	A while ago there was a comment in the editorial section of 
the <I>Globe and Mail</I>. It went something along the lines that 
sustained profligate borrowing by several generations of 
politicians is committing not only this generation but future 
generations of Canadians to a lower standard of living.
<P>
<B>(1550 ) </B>
<P>
	In the last few days we have seen some real interest rate 
fluctuations and so on. People are theorising that there has been 
not only a run on the Canadian dollar but a huge jump in interest 
rates because the government has been unable to control its 
profligate spending.
<P>
	Could the member for Kootenay East give his opinion on the 
relationship between the growing size of our deficit and debt and 
the future of interest rates as he see them?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question.
<P>
	Certainly every time our debt seems to get a bit higher and a 
bit worse it makes international lenders look a little more 
sceptically at the ability of Canada to pay off these loans. We 
have seen our interest rating drop. I am sure we will see other 
measures taken by international lenders.
<P>
	I mentioned New Zealand in my speech. What happened in 
New Zealand was not something that it got a lot of warning 
about. It came to the point where lenders lost confidence in the 
ability of New Zealand to make its payments and in a one-month 
time period it was virtually cut off all foreign loans. That could 
happen to Canada. I am sure we have a much stronger economy 
than New Zealand had even though we also have more debt. I am 
sure people are waiting to see if we can do something in 
Parliament.
<P>
	Occasionally we hear encouraging words, unfortunately not 
followed by encouraging deeds, on the government side of the 
House. We are hoping that government members will come to 
their senses and deal with our tremendous debt and deficit. The 
lenders are waiting to see if they will come around to that. If 
they do not, I am sure we will see a further drop in our credit 
rating and higher interest rates.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am both 
surprised and disappointed to see that the Liberal Party did not 
have the courtesy to respond with questions and comments and 
failed to appreciate the speech by the hon. member of the 
Reform Party.
<P>
	Although I do not have the figures to which he referred, I was 
interested in what he said about calculating income tax on 
family income as opposed to individual income.
<P>
	I would appreciate more information on the subject, and I 
would ask the hon. member to expand on a topic that should be 
of interest to the members of the party in power.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would be happy to elaborate on 
that. I do not have the details of it in front of me, as the hon. 
member mentioned. However, the concept simply is that we 
have to start looking beyond the salary of the individual person.
<P>
	I mentioned the idea of the government setting a threshold in 
the reduction of old age credits at $26,000 which, as I said, is not 
a very high income for an individual. However, if we start 
combining incomes and the family income is higher that is when 
we should start looking. Obviously the expenses for two or more 
living as a family unit are not the same as those of individuals 
trying to provide their own housing, food and so on.
<P>
	Realistically we have to look at this in a way that we can 
reduce some government expenditures but at the same time not 
place a hardship on seniors. The idea of the old age pension to 
which I referred was something that was brought in to aid people 
who had a problem in sustaining a reasonable standard of living 
in their old age. Now we are giving it out to millionaires.
<P>
	The government answers on one hand by saying: ``We tax it 
back''. That is terrific. First we give away money to people who 
do not need it. We create a bureaucracy to give it to them and 
then we create another bureaucracy to get it back from them. The 
worst of it is that we let them keep some. The bottom line is that 
we cannot help the people who really need it if we keep on 
giving money to those who do not. That is the reason we have to 
address the concept of family income. It is a fair way of 
addressing that problem.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Again, the hon. member for Portneuf, 
this time on debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf):</B> Mr. Speaker, there are 
subjects we discuss with enthusiasm. There are bills that elicit 
much positive feeling and that are really worthwhile.
<P>
	Unfortunately, I am somewhat less than enthusiastic about 
speaking to the matter before the House today. This afternoon, 
the debate is on the motion of the Minister of Finance for third 
reading and passage of Bill C-14. And what is Bill C-14 about? 
Is it something we can applaud? Is this a bill that will give us 
reason to rejoice and look forward to a happy and prosperous 
future for all Canadians and Quebecers?
<P>
	This bill is an act to provide borrowing authority for the fiscal 
year beginning on April 1, 1994. The operative word is 
borrowing, and borrowing means deficit and deficit means debt. 
We are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2683"> 2683 </A></B>
<P>
now talking about getting into debt. The subject is the debts of 
this country and its citizens. Are these small debts? Are these 
debts we can pay back quickly? Were these debts incurred for 
capital spending on infrastructures and services that will be 
useful to this generation and future generations as well? Not 
exactly.
<P>
	What we are talking about is the cost of financing a deficit of 
$40 billion. That is a lot of money, and not many people can 
appreciate what this amount represents. Put in simple terms, let 
us say this boils down to $100 million per day. If we consider the 
bridge for Prince Edward Island, which raised quite a few 
questions because people felt that $900 million was too much, 
this bridge would be paid for in nine days, which means that we 
could afford forty of these bridges, and I mean forty per year.
<P>
	I suppose that could be called ``looking on the bright side'', 
but seriously, we should try and understand why we have to 
finance a debt of this magnitude. As the previous speaker 
pointed out, we are not paying the interest on our debt. We 
borrowed this money more than a decade ago. We borrowed, and 
since then, we have not paid back the capital and we have not 
paid back the interest incurred. We have not paid the cost of 
servicing the debt. Consequently, day after day, month after 
month, and year after year, the interest we have not paid off is 
being added to the debt. In fact, and most people who know 
something about compound interest will realize this 
immediately, we have a debt that is growing as a result of 
compound interest.
<P>
	Are we unable to pay because we do not pay enough taxes or 
because we spend too much? I suggest we look at the figures and 
try to draw certain conclusions later on.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	To begin with, the citizens of Quebec and Canada pay out 
roughly $120 billion each year in various kinds of taxes. This is 
a substantial amount of money and all of us can understand what 
it represents, since it either comes out of our wages or we pay it 
in the form of a goods and services tax.
<P>
	What does the government do with these $120 billion? Well, it 
spends it on various programs which result in services to the 
public or in more or less durable goods. All of which means that 
we spend what we pay out.
<P>
	The $40 billion deficit did not come about because we 
purchased services or goods without being able to pay for them. 
Basically, the $40 billion represents the interest on the debt 
which we are unable to pay.
<P>
	And the debt is getting bigger and bigger. It now stands at 
$500 billion! It may even be higher than that since, as the 
member before me mentioned, it is growing at the rate of 
$85,000 per minute. In the few minutes that I have been 
speaking, the debt has increased by an amount  which would 
allow several people to live quite comfortably for some time.
<P>
	Imagine, $500 billion! Few people can appreciate what this 
amount represents. As you know, I am a teacher by profession 
and a good instructor tries to find ways to illustrate the subject 
matter he is teaching. Therefore, I have tried to come up with an 
example which would give Quebecers and Canadians an idea of 
what $500 billion represents.
<P>
	So, here goes. The TransCanada Highway is a ribbon of 
asphalt about 7,000 kilometres long stretching from the Atlantic 
to the Pacific. Let us assume that the TransCanada Highway has 
four lanes: two heading from east to west, and two heading from 
west to East. This is a great deal of pavement, four lanes in all. 
Now, let me see if I have a coin in my pocket. It is unlikely 
though because it must have been eaten up by taxes. What if we 
were to pave this highway with one dollar coins, pave it from 
shoulder to shoulder, all four lanes, with loonies. Would we be 
able to get from Nova Scotia to New Brunswick or maybe even 
Quebec? How about Ontario, Saskatchewan or Manitoba? What 
about Alberta? Would we make it through the Rockies? Would 
we get to British Columbia? We are talking about 7,000 
kilometres of four-lane highway, and loonies are, after all, a 
relatively small coin and we only have 500 billion of them.
<P>
	I will give the House a few moments to think about this and 
then I will give you the answer. Not only would we be able to 
pave the highway from the Atlantic to the Pacific, we could go 
all the way back to the Atlantic and travel an additional 700 
kilometres in the opposite direction. That is what $500 billion 
represents. Where are we going to get the money to reimburse a 
debt of this magnitude?
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	That is obviously a major problem. I have heard on the radio, 
seen on television, read in papers-claims to that effect were 
even made in this House-that Quebec's sovereignty poses a 
serious threat to Canada. I will say this. The real threat to 
Canada, let us not forget it, is this absolutely enormous debt, this 
crushing debt, which is going to ruin us all if we do not make the 
right moves.
<P>
	Quebec's accession to sovereignty, I might add, would 
probably be a good time to change the current rules of the game 
and provide a golden opportunity to all parties to review these 
rules and finally deal with the public finance problem. Our 
public finances have obviously not been managed properly for 
decades and, as a result, an extremely heavy burden will be 
passed on to future generations.
<P>
	They will have a heavy burden to bear. We already do. What is 
the per capita share of this burden? How much does each and 
every one of us owe on the public debt? Some say $16,000, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2684"> 2684 </A></B>
<P>
others $16,500. It all depends of course on the time of day, 
seeing that the debt grows by the minute.
<P>
	For the sake of argument, let us say for the time being that 
each and every one of us, all 30 million of us in Quebec and 
across Canada, owes $16,384.22, but this figure grows as we 
speak.
<P>
	We also know that, given the current interest rates, the debt 
doubles every six or seven years. So, unless we act now, unless 
we start paying off the interest on the debt if not the capital, six 
or seven years from now, the public debt will have doubled and 
each of us will owe anywhere from $32,000 to $33,000 on it.
<P>
	If an individual goes to his or her bank or credit union and 
says to the manager: ``Look, I have debts, about $16,000 worth 
of debts, and I would like to consolidate all that'', the bank 
manager will frown, of course, but he or she will more than 
likely answer: ``Let us sit down together and see what we could 
do about your lifestyle. Let us try and work something out''.
<P>
	But six or seven years from now, if you go to your bank 
manager with a debt of approximately $32,000, I have a feeling 
that his or her immediate reaction will be: ``File for 
bankruptcy''. Sometimes I wonder if we should not file for 
bankruptcy and just start over under a new name. I can see 
certain members have understood what I am getting at.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	During the holiday season I volunteered to work with the Red 
Nose organization in my riding. English-Canadian communities 
probably have similar organizations where, during the holiday 
season, volunteers offer rides to people who have had a little too 
much to drink. These people make it home safely without having 
to drive their cars. It has become an institution in Quebec and in 
many other countries. The Red Nose organization allows people 
aware of the dangers associated with drinking and driving to act 
responsibly.
<P>
	That being said, I offered to drive people asking for a ride 
home, and one of my constituents said during the ride, ``Why not 
simply raise taxes to pay off the deficit so that we can get rid of it 
quickly?'' I asked her by how much she thought her taxes would 
go up and she said, ``By a small amount of money''. When she 
understood that we were talking of $16,000 for the interest 
alone, she realized we had a real problem on our hands.
<P>
	We are indeed in a dilemma. You see, if we increase income or 
consumption taxes, everyone will have less available income 
and, as a result, less money to spend on goods and services.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you are indicating to me that I have only three 
minutes left so I will be quick. If we raise taxes, consumers will 
have less money in their pockets to buy things with; if they 
consume less, businesses will eventually sell less; if businesses 
sell less, they will lay off workers. And we will just have 
increased the deficit. However, if we cut spending, again people 
will be laid off. These people will stop contributing to tax 
revenues, and again we are in trouble.
<P>
	We must redirect federal expenditures wisely, cut where it 
will hurt the least, and ensure that displaced workers can find 
new jobs. We have our work cut out for us; it will not happen as 
if by magic.
<P>
	In conclusion, I must quote the Minister of Finance not 
because I like his comments, but because they scare me. The 
Minister of Finance said, ``We clearly showed, in the first phase 
of our budget, that we would bring the deficit down to 3 per cent 
of GDP within three years. It will be the first time-he used the 
future-in 15 or 20 years that this goal has been achieved''. I 
hope so, but he should have said-it would have been more 
accurate in my opinion-``it would be the first time''. He could 
also have stated that it was not, unfortunately, the first time such 
promises were made to Canadian and Quebec voters. Although I 
sincerely hope that this budget will fulfil the promises made to 
us, I am afraid that it is just another illusion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to thank the hon. member for Portneuf for his speech.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	That is as much as I can get out at this time, but it is going to 
come.
<P>
	I would like to thank the member for his remarks. I am glad to 
see that he is concerned as many of us are with the size of not 
only the deficit but the size of the debt. The debt we all realize is 
driving this deficit problem that many of us at least on this side 
of the House seem to be quite concerned about.
<P>
<B>(1615 ) </B>
<P>
	I am also very pleased that he used the example of a national 
highway from sea to sea as an example of the size of the national 
debt. It is perhaps a symbolic gesture on his part of that 
continuity from ocean to ocean. I am glad he was willing to use 
that.
<P>
	I know the previous speaker gave some detailed examples of 
what he thought should happen in order to address the size of the 
debt and the deficit, specifically the year to year deficit. Other 
than some duplication of services which I know can be 
streamlined, with the size of the debt surely the hon. member has 
some specific ideas for saving significant amounts of dollars in 
order to bring this deficit more in line.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. de Savoye:</B> Mr. Speaker, during the election campaign, 
the Bloc Quebecois proposed a specific plan for reducing 
government spending and attacking the deficit.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2685"> 2685 </A></B>
<P>
	One of these measures was an infrastructure program, 
something much bigger that what the Liberal Party offered us. 
Let me point out here, and perhaps other members will want 
to react to this, that the federal government is advancing $2 
billion for the infrastructure program, but the federal 
government is now spending $20 billion on unemployment 
insurance.
<P>
	Look at the dichotomy. On the one hand, we have $2 billion to 
put people to work and, on the other, we have $20 billion for 
them not to work. I would have expected a much more solid 
proposal from the Liberal government for redirecting 
unemployment insurance funds to more productive things that 
are more promising for the future of all these unemployed 
people.
<P>
	At the present time, unfortunately, unemployment insurance 
is a way to help people survive until welfare becomes their only 
option. Unfortunately, there is no work once these weeks of 
unemployment insurance inexorably run out.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois's program also sought to redirect a 
greater share of federal spending to Quebec. You should realize 
that Quebec pays a total of $28 billion, more or less, in tax every 
year and receives the same amount of $28 billion from the 
federal government. The problem is that a large part of this $28 
billion is unemployment insurance and what is called welfare. If 
this money were spent on job creation, and what I am saying 
applies not only to Quebec but to all of Canada, people who 
work would pay taxes.
<P>
	An interesting statistic to which few people refer is the $120 
billion paid by people who work and consume. In Canada, about 
one in four employable persons does not work, which means that 
if they could work, they would pay $40 billion more in taxes and 
that is exactly what we need to wipe out the deficit.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, what are we waiting for to act?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Julian Reed (Halton-Peel):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with great interest to the words of the hon. member of Her 
Majesty's Loyal Opposition. He quite rightly points out the very 
difficult financial situation which exists in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1620 ) </B>
<P>
	We have all been through the stages leading up to where we 
are today. A brief history is that it started many years ago when 
Keynesian economics were applied to the economic situation of 
the day creating a national debt. The subsequent government 
that took over, if it was going to apply that same philosophy, 
during the years of increased economic activity in this country, 
should have been taking that money back and paying off the 
national debt. But it did not. Therefore what was a debt of $160 
billion 10 years ago escalated another $340 billion over the two 
terms of office of the previous government.
<P>
	The challenge has been how to turn the ship around without 
capsizing it in the process and put us on a new tack. Our Minister 
of Finance did an admirable job in focusing on the vision in the 
red book, which we all used during the last election campaign, 
and in applying it in the first phase of a double budget. My 
friends in the Reform Party have insisted we have to make more 
cuts. The government has introduced a multitude of measures.
<P>
	I fail to understand how the hon. member believes that 
separation, or as he words it, the sovereignty of Quebec, would 
help with this financial problem.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. de Savoye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I noticed that the hon. member 
seemed to want to go on for a while, and I thought I would have a 
little time to respond. I appreciate how he put his question.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I understand the sovereignty of Quebec is very important for 
everyone from coast to coast and believe me, more so for 
Quebecers.
<P>
	Something must be said in this House. The Quebec 
government over the years and for well over a decade has 
managed its public finances a lot better than what has been done 
in Ottawa.
<P>
	Furthermore I am a taxpayer and have been a taxpayer for a 
long, long time. I have paid my share I am sure, as all the other 
people in this country are doing.
<P>
	We send money to Ottawa on the assumption that it will be 
used to pay the interest on the debt and to reduce the deficit. I 
was told that. Everyone has been told that year after year after 
year for well over a decade by all the governments that have 
preceded this one. We are told that right now by this 
government.
<P>
	I send my money to Ottawa on the assumption that it will be 
used well. When I see it is not, I wonder why I should not give 
my money directly to the government that has proven in the past 
to be more able to take care of my finances. By that I mean 
Quebec. That is why I think Quebec would better administer the 
servicing of our debt than Ottawa has proven able to do in the 
past.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia):</B> Mr. Speaker, today we are asked to give 
extensive borrowing authority to a government that has already 
shown in its first budget that it is not only fiscally incompetent 
but also fiscally incontinent.
<P>
	On February 22, while the Minister of Finance was singing 
into our ears, I could not help but see the ghosts of Michael 
Wilson and Don Mazankowski coming back to haunt us. We 
heard all the old platitudes. For example-
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2686"> 2686 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
-restoring fiscal responsibility, a responsible social security 
system and a framework for economic renewal. There was even 
a mandatory pledge to get a handle on things next year and really 
take action the year after that.
<P>
	The minister bravely proclaimed it is time for the government 
to get its fiscal House in order while confessing that the 
government plans net spending increases of $3 billion in the 
next fiscal year.
<P>
	After nine years of Tory smoke and mirrors, inflated revenue 
estimates and broken promises, Canadians were entitled to 
expect something new, something better. All they got was the 
same old hokum that hardly anyone takes seriously any more.
<P>
	This government which plans to persist with the Tory practice 
of killing the economy with high taxes is nevertheless predicting 
that the economy is going to miraculously rebound, thus 
inflating its projected revenue.
<P>
	Personal income tax which unexpectedly fell by $6 billion 
this year is supposed to rebound by $7 billion next year. The 
anticipated increase of $1 billion from higher UIC premiums 
will probably come true. Why should GST revenues increase by 
$1 billion when anyone who has a few dollars is scared to death 
to spend them on consumer goods?
<P>
	Rather than face reality and cut spending now, the 
government wants to party on. It wants to borrow another $34 
billion to pay the tab. It has already been quite a party, twenty 
years of glorious excess.
<P>
	Now our children and our grandchildren are going to be stuck 
with both the bill and the hangover. The $500 billion that this 
government already owes is going to be around for generations. 
Because of it those future generations are going to have a lower 
standard of living than we have had. There is no way out.
<P>
	In the name of decency and common sense, how can we justify 
borrowing another $34 billion to make their burden heavier? 
More to the point, how can we talk about adding another $100 
billion to this load on their backs for the next three years?
<P>
	Remember that $100 billion is based on the rosy estimates of 
this government. If events of the last 20 years are any indication, 
it will probably be closer to $150 billion if the foreign money 
lenders do not come and take our credit card away before that 
happens.
<P>
	Thanks to the magic of compound interest the debt we have 
already accumulated is eating us alive. Debt service costs this 
fiscal year will equal the cost of old age pensions and UIC 
combined. Every second the federal government pays more than 
$1,200 in interest. A typical Canadian family of four pays $460 
in taxes every month just to cover the interest on the federal 
debt, a third of which is foreign debt.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	For 20 years the Grits and the Tories have told us soothingly 
that mounting government debts are not really a problem 
because they are internal, that we owe it to ourselves and since 
the interest payments remain within the domestic economy they 
constitute only a recirculation of funds, an economic perpetual 
motion machine.
<P>
	Even if one accepts this Disneyland approach to economics, 
the basic premise is no longer true. We are paying so much 
interest to foreigners that even though we have had a trade 
surplus every year for decades, our current account balance has 
been negative since 1985. This year our current account 
shortfall will be $25 billion and our foreign exchange reserves 
are shrinking.
<P>
	If provincial foreign debts are added to those accumulated in 
this place, and that is reasonable since most countries do not 
have states or provinces borrowing money on world markets, 
Canadian public foreign debt is greater than that of Mexico and 
on a per capita basis it is greater than that of Brazil.
<P>
	The government can wail ``But there is nothing we can do. If 
we cut spending it is going to hurt''. Sure it will but the pain can 
only be delayed, it cannot be avoided. Every time a year goes by 
and another $40 billion is added to the burden, the intensity of 
the potential pain becomes greater.
<P>
	What is more desirable, to cut voluntarily while we still can or 
wait for the inevitable fiscal meltdown to burn us up like New 
Zealand and Sweden? How long does the government think that 
our economy can survive if the foreign bankers cut us off? How 
long before we would have to go hat in hand to the IMF like a 
third world country?
<P>
	The government says it cannot cut spending because of its 
great compassion for the poor and the disadvantaged. I submit 
that the trick is to target social spending to those who need it. We 
can no longer afford to subsidize high income individuals and 
we can no longer afford to subsidize corporate Canada. If the 
government does not start to practise a little basic economic 
management, that compound interest machine is going to 
continue to accelerate.
<P>
	One-third of every tax dollar collected by the government is 
already being used to service existing debt. What happens in the 
not too distant future when that becomes 40 cents out of the 
dollar, 45 cents or even 50 cents? Where will the money come 
from to pay for social programs or even to provide basic 
government services?
<P>
	If the whole rotten structure comes tumbling down there will 
be no medicare, no pensions, no UIC, no welfare, nothing. Those 
who will suffer the most will be the weakest members of society: 
the sick, the old and the very young. That will be the govern-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2687"> 2687 </A></B>
<P>
ment's legacy to the people of Canada if it does not begin to take 
the problem seriously.
<P>
	The government has proven through its non-budget that it 
cannot be trusted with a credit card. That card should be locked 
away in a safe place before the foreign bankers come and take it 
away from us.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf):</B> Mr. Speaker, true, I talk a 
lot about the deficit but, you see, a few years ago I thought it was 
my money at stake, but I realized some time ago that it is my 
children's and perhaps even my grandchildren's money.
<P>
<B>(1635 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The hon. member mentioned many things, one of which I want 
to correct, if he would kindly allow me to do so. He said that 
one-third of the tax collected by the government is used to 
service the debt. Unfortunately, it is a lot worse than that. Zero 
per cent is used to service the debt. One hundred per cent is used 
for programs. We do not pay the debt and the interest just adds 
on. How unfortunate.
<P>
	However, I have a question for the hon. member if he does not 
mind. I will read something that was printed in <I>La Presse</I> in 
Montreal. I will read it in French. I am sure he will be able to 
follow it through the translation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
``The changes to the unemployment insurance program 
announced in the last federal budget make unemployed 
Canadians bear the brunt of over half of all new Liberal cuts'', as 
if cuts could be liberal, ``and will cost the provinces $1 billion, 
including $280 million in Quebec alone''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This is the question I would like the hon. member to address. 
It seems that the federal government has succeeded in keeping 
the deficit just below the $40 billion mark by shovelling part of 
the problem into the backyard of every one of the provinces. 
How does the member react to that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will address the first comment 
of the hon. member for Portneuf.
<P>
	Where does the money come from to pay the interest on the 
debt? I guess this is an exercise in semantics. You can take it out 
of their right pocket or you can take it out of their left pocket. 
The fact remains it collects $120 billion in taxes and $40 billion 
goes to pay interest on the debt.
<P>
	Yes, I agree with the hon. member. We are borrowing money 
to pay interest on the debt because we are not quite breaking 
even. We are borrowing more than the interest cost. Where this 
will end, the hon. member knows well.
<P>
	I want to compliment the hon. member for Portneuf on his 
original speech. I did not get a chance to stand up because 
everyone wanted to ask him questions. I applauded him. I 
thought he had perhaps become a Reformer when I listened to 
his economic analysis.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Canuel:</B> Le Bloc réformiste.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Yes, le Bloc réformiste, bien sûr.
<P>
	The only part of his address that bothered me and sort of 
spoiled the effect was when he persisted from time to time in 
referring to two different countries, Quebec and Canada. If he 
would accept the premise that we are all one country, I would 
really like to see him move many seats this way and display his 
considerable talents on behalf of the nation because he really 
knows his economics.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
as the House may or may not be aware, the hon. member for 
Swift Current is involved in the agricultural community.
<P>
	I wonder if the member could enlighten me and other 
members of the House of the effect on the agriculture industry of 
this chronic overspending and our inability to live within our 
means. Is it making our agricultural products less competitive in 
the world market?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Mr. Speaker, the answer is yes, it is having a 
very marked bad effect on our competitiveness in the 
agricultural markets.
<P>
	One of the main reasons that farm input costs are so high is the 
tax component they contain. It does not matter whether one is 
buying a tractor or a litre of diesel fuel or repairs for something 
on one's farm, the tax component if one tracks it backwards 
through every stage of production in many cases, I would 
suspect in most cases, amounts to some 50 per cent of the cost 
when the farmer goes to buy it from his agent.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	If we were not being taxed to death in order to maintain this 
excessive debt load, then the prices of farm inputs would 
automatically go down and we would be more competitive on 
the world stage.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to congratulate the member from Swift Current again 
for his presentation on the borrowing authority bill and to get 
away a little bit from the side issues. I guess they are all 
important, but to me it is a side issue, whether it affects 
agriculture per se or affects one region of the country more than 
another.
<P>
	I would like to focus on the borrowing aspect of this bill, the 
authority that it is giving the Government of Canada to borrow 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2688"> 2688 </A></B>
<P>
tens of billions of dollars at unknown interest rates, apparently 
ever on the increase, and the effect that is going to have on the 
government's budgetary predictions.
<P>
	I wonder if the member from Swift Current would comment 
on yesterday's announcement of the three-quarter per cent jump 
in the Canadian prime and the effect he feels this will have on 
the government's budgetary predictions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Mr. Speaker, we asked the Minister of 
Finance this morning to address that very question. We did not 
get an answer. My own interpretation is that it will probably cost 
about an extra $1.5 billion a year if this current increase 
continues.
<P>
	What I am more afraid of is that this is the shape of things to 
come and that we are going to have another spurt of interest rate 
increases. As our bond ratings are downgraded and as foreign 
investors begin to look more and more unkindly on us, we could 
very easily see 8 per cent interest rates by the end of this year. 
Then watch the deficit roll.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to speak again on this bill. I spoke at second reading. I 
raised some concerns at that time, concerns that have been 
expressed to me not only in post budget days but during the 
lead-up and the entire campaign period last fall, even during the 
time I was nominated before I entered into the campaign mode.
<P>
	This whole issue of deficit financing, the national debt, 
having to borrow and the fact that we are placing not only this 
nation and ourselves into a tremendous debt hole but are asking 
our children to try to dig us back out is an issue for which many 
of us in the Reform Party have become standard bearers.
<P>
	One of the major concerns that brought the Reform Party into 
being was the fact that the fiscal mismanagement of successive 
federal governments has placed us in an untenable position for 
which we will be paying for generations.
<P>
	When I first sought the nomination for Fraser Valley East the 
size of the deficit was forecast as perhaps going as high as $30 
billion. This was a couple of years ago. At the time I have to 
admit it was the last straw that catapulted me into the federal 
election arena. Just the thought that I was going to saddle the 
nation with a deficit of $30 billion was more than I could stand. I 
am not sure whether there was a national uproar, but in my area it 
was such a concern that many of us joined the Reform Party and 
said that we would try to do something to turn the tide so that our 
children would not be adversely affected.
<P>
	Thirty billion dollars is looking better every day. We are 
approaching a $45 billion deficit. By the government's own 
admission the best that it can hope for this year is in excess of 
$40 billion. Every day that the interest rate fluctuates or the 
dollar drops or the Minister of Finance has some musings, it 
changes the rates and the figures once again.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	It was a real concern at $30 billion. Now that it is $40 billion 
or $45 billion, depending on who one wants to believe, it is even 
more of a concern. I would suggest it has gone from a concern to 
a pending and possibly imminent disaster.
<P>
	Since it is bad and is getting worse we should describe, as the 
member did previously I think a little bit, the size of the debt and 
what it will mean to Canadians in the years to come. The debt is 
in excess of $500 billion, depending on the figures that were 
bandied about here a little bit earlier. Whether it is $16,000 per 
person or whatever, that only shows part of the picture. The 
other half of the picture, of course, is the added debt from the 
provinces, because there is only one taxpayer. Canadians are 
going to have to finance somehow by increased taxes, increased 
deficit, and more and more of these types of bills, borrowing 
authority acts, in all legislatures and Parliaments and that will 
continue to add to this burden for successive generations.
<P>
	The deficit, which is a year to year accumulation of the 
shortfall in the revenues from expenditures, is going to be at 
least $40 billion this year. That alone is going to add increased 
burdens on all the people who can least afford it. I seldom see 
people worth $10 million or $20 million running for cover when 
these figures are bandied about. What bothers me and concerns 
me the most is that the people who are least able to shoulder this 
type of load, those on fixed incomes, the people who are relying 
on a government pension that they have faithfully paid into and 
expect to reap some benefit from, the people who are needing 
some temporary help from a temporary loss of employment 
through a UI program, no matter how it is revised, will have to 
pay the price and pay increased taxes and will in the long run 
experience decreased services.
<P>
	I have a lot of concerns about that. These concerns have not 
gone away since I have come to Parliament. Over the last couple 
of months the concerns I think have been exacerbated by the 
signals being sent from the government side of the House.
<P>
	It seems there is no concept of fiscal restraint. The budget 
papers states: ``We will no longer nibble around the edges and 
just fuss with the minor details of the budget. This budget 
contains real cutbacks''. That is what the government would 
have us believe. When I turn the page I see that the total 
expenditures of the federal government have increased from 
$160 billion to $163 billion.
<P>
	How is that a cutback? It is not a cutback. It is increased 
spending. Our borrowing has increased, our taxes inevitably 
will go up, and our service inevitably will go down. That is a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2689"> 2689 </A></B>
<P>
problem. It is a concern to all of us. It certainly should be even 
more of a concern to the government side.
<P>
	If that is the problem, and I believe the problem is what I have 
described, we are going to pass this problem on to successive 
generations. What can we possibly do to control the deficit? 
What can we do to bring under control the year to year deficit so 
that this borrowing authority that we are debating today will no 
longer be necessary?
<P>
	We are not without examples of what can be done even within 
the Canadian jurisdiction, leaving New Zealand out of it for a 
moment. I know that is often bandied about. Within the 
Canadian jurisdiction there have been some examples of what 
can be done to control excessive spending by governments.
<P>
	We have an example from Alberta in which the provincial 
government has grabbed the bull by the horns, if I may use a 
western expression, and has said that enough is enough, we can 
no longer afford to continue to spend and tax and spend, and 
expect to maintain services and a business environment that will 
assure prosperity in the future.
<P>
	The premier of Alberta did the unthinkable in Canadian 
politics. He decided to get tough with some spending, and 
indeed he did get tough. Some people have done analyses on this 
and have suggested that if the federal government were to 
exercise as many spending cuts as the Alberta government 
proportionately, then it would have to slice $19 billion from its 
spending just to match the precedent set by Premier Klein in his 
budget. I am not saying Premier Klein's budget is perfect, but I 
use that as an example to show that it is possible to realize the 
severity of the problem. It is possible to reduce one's spending 
in real terms. It is possible to offer a light at the end of the tunnel 
for those Canadians concerned about the size of deficits, debts 
and the borrowing that is associated with it.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	Of all things, and I never thought I would say this, there is 
even an example in my own province of British Columbia. I hate 
to think that the federal government cannot match an NDP 
budget, but the B.C. budget brought down yesterday announces 
tax cuts of $112 million. It will reduce its deficit this year to 
$189 million which is a tremendous step in the right direction 
for a government not known for its fiscal responsibility. It is 
offering certain tangible benefits to businesses and some of that 
famous light at the end of that famous tunnel.
<P>
	For example, the Vancouver international airport, which is 
competing as all of B.C. must for Pacific rim business, is a big 
winner. The jet fuel taxes are being rolled back one cent to four 
cents a litre. Air cargo gets another boost. Last year's budget 
removed fuel taxes from cargo carriers altogether. There are 
ways to help businesses, consumers and people who are 
concerned about taxes, deficits and everything that just seems to 
snowball together. We can specifically reduce spending and by 
reducing that spending we can offer tax breaks to businesses, 
consumers and people on fixed incomes.
<P>
	For instance, in the B.C. budget there were the mining tax 
breaks estimated to be worth $18 million. This is unprecedented 
in B.C. recent budgetary history. The people are concerned 
about increased taxes, increased borrowing and the never ending 
spiral of hopelessness that involves. Now that the government 
has seen the light, if I can use that expression again, it has 
actually reduced taxes in specific areas to help businesses help 
themselves. These businesses are not going to receive a grant, a 
handout, regional development aid or anything else. These 
businesses are going to receive tax breaks which is all that 
businesses require.
<P>
	How many times have we heard small and medium sized 
businesses say that all they ask of government is to get out of 
their way and get off their backs so they can get on doing the job 
that they do best which is create jobs for Canadians?
<P>
	As I said, I did not know that I would ever compliment the 
B.C. government on its ability to bring in a budget, but I am not 
going to be totally complimentary to it either. The B.C. budget 
also brought in some total budgetary spending increases of 3.5 
per cent.
<P>
	What would have happened in B.C. if instead of bringing in 
increased budgetary spending it had brought in a zero increase in 
budgetary spending? All of the similar cuts that I talked about 
earlier could have gone on. The cuts in overall taxation levels 
could have gone on. The reduction in the taxation for jet fuel and 
so on and so forth could have gone on. What if, instead of 
increasing the spending in other areas by 3.5 per cent, the B.C. 
government had brought in a zero increase budget? Instead of 
predicting a balanced budget by 1997 it could have brought in a 
balanced budget within its term, within the next year or two. 
That would have been a tremendous feather in its cap and may 
have turned the tide in the popularity contest which it seems to 
be losing at the current time.
<P>
	Those are precedents that are within the Canadian round. If 
the federal government had brought in a zero increase budget 
and had just held flat at $160 billion, which is incredible as it is, 
but even if it had brought in that much without an extra $3 
billion or $4 billion in spending, then this government I think 
would have been perceived by the Canadian people as being 
serious about addressing what may be a crisis problem of 
deficits, debt and borrowing.
<P>
<B>(1655 ) </B>
<P>
	My riding extends from Boston Bar, which is pre-riding 
boundary adjustment time, in the north which is basically a one 
industry town, a lumber town that derives almost its entire 
economic activity from the forestry industry. It extends down 
through Hope which starts to diversify a little. There is some 
mining and basically a lot more forestry activity and a lot of 
tourism. It extends down through the Chilliwack area where I 
live and where we diversify into agriculture and again 
lumbering and forestry continue to be important. There  is a 
Canadian 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2690"> 2690 </A></B>
<P>
forces base there. My riding extends right into the Abbotsford 
area which has almost another flavour unto itself. It has a lot of 
urban commuters who drive in to Vancouver and work in the big 
city and it has a lot of retirement people as well.
<P>
	It does not matter where I go in my riding, whether I am 
talking to a lumberjack or a logger up in Boston Bar with his red 
strap suspenders and the whole ball of wax, if I talk to him about 
the size of the deficit and having to live within your means, that 
logger knows exactly what I am talking about. He will poke his 
finger into my chest and tell me to tell this government to quit 
spending money it does not have just like he has to manage 
things in his own household.
<P>
	If I extend down into Hope and into Chilliwack where I live 
and talk to a dairy farmer there who is worried about GATT and 
NAFTA and all sorts of things, he will tell me again as he sticks 
his finger into my chest: ``You tell that government to quit 
spending money it does not have. Quit borrowing money to 
spend on things we do not even need. Quit obligating my 
children to pay your debts. Tell that government to quit spending 
money''.
<P>
	If I go into Abbotsford where people live on a fixed income 
they will come up to me at a public meeting and tell me the same 
story. It does not matter what you do or where you live, the 
people know you have to live within your means.
<P>
	As soon as you get an allowance of two bucks a week when 
you are 10 years old, you know you have to live within your 
means. This government has not learned this lesson yet. This is 
why this government's borrowing authority act is asking for an 
unprecedented amount of money to keep government going. It 
has not learned the lessons it should have learned by watching, if 
I may be so bold, the PC government of the last eight, nine or ten 
years.
<P>
	If the government continues to spend this sort of money in the 
dollar amounts it is proposing, the electorate will turf it out at 
the next election with such a vengeance that we may again find a 
party decimated to the ranks with one or two people left. It has to 
listen to the Canadian people. The Canadian people want 
restraint. They want budgetary sanity brought back into 
government and they expect this government to do its part by 
restricting spending, bringing in a budget that does not include 
increased spending measures. Do it now. Do it not only for the 
people sitting here today but, more important, do it for the 
people of Canada who are demanding it.
<P>
	I ask the government to reconsider this bill. Do not pass it. Do 
not ask for this amount of money. Bring in a budget that we can 
support, something with a cap on spending, and do it now.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
comment and a question for the hon. member, who raised points 
which I wondered about several months ago already, and for 
which I found an answer. I am going to suggest that answer to the 
hon. member and, in the process, get his point of view.
<P>
	The hon. member says that the government must live 
according to its means. He adds that, for years now, in fact two 
decades, we progressively got more and more into debt.
<P>
	I noticed that too, and I wondered not only about the facts but 
also their cause. It is not enough to say that we notice something. 
We have to ask ourselves: How did we end up in this situation 
and why do we still find ourselves in it?
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	So, I asked myself this very simple question: Why is it that 
Mr. Trudeau-I think I can name him without violating the 
rules-started getting us into debt? Is it because he did not 
realize that it was not a very smart idea to incur debts? Or is it 
because he was incompetent or acted in bad faith? Certainly not! 
I am convinced that, at the time, Mr. Trudeau acted in good faith 
and followed what he believed to be excellent advice 
encouraging him to do what he did.
<P>
	Several years later, Mr. Mulroney promised to correct the 
situation and he failed. Did Mr. Mulroney act in bad faith? I do 
not think so. I believe that Mr. Mulroney really wanted to reduce 
the national debt.
<P>
	Did he receive bad advice? I think that, here in Ottawa, we 
have extremely competent civil servants who work very hard to 
make things happen. So, my question is: What happened?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
Portneuf for his question. He raised a couple of interesting 
points. I am not exactly sure what Mr. Trudeau was thinking 
when he started us down this path. Perhaps it is just a Liberal 
frame of mind. I am not sure but time will tell.
<P>
	I realize I am stretching it, but Mr. Trudeau and Mr. Mulroney 
have a similar problem or similar disease that afflicts new 
governments. It is called missed opportunities. When a new 
government takes the reins in Parliament it has a window of 
opportunity, which lasts a few months while the honeymoon 
period is on and while government members are glowing from 
ear to ear and from coast to coast, to make significant changes in 
the way that Parliament and Canada are run.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2691"> 2691 </A></B>
<P>
	Both Mr. Trudeau and Mr. Mulroney had a similar disease 
in that they missed opportunities. I am not sure exactly what 
the perception of Mr. Mulroney was in Quebec where he won 
a huge number of seats, but we voted for him in the west in 
1984 because we thought we were electing a fiscally 
responsible voice that would ensure our concerns were upheld 
in Parliament.
<P>
	During his first budget Mr. Mulroney missed a tremendous 
opportunity. People wanted a fiscally responsible budget 
brought down, but because of some vocal people who were 
naysayers he folded the tents and went scurrying with his tail 
between his legs.
<P>
	If I could come now to the 35th Parliament, I fear from 
looking at the budget that we have a similar phenomenon. We 
have a populace leader of the government who seems to be very 
much in tune with people. He seems on the outside to be one of 
the little guys from Shawinigan, just a regular guy, but he 
missed an opportunity in the budget to change the course of the 
35th Parliament. It will not get easier. If the hon. Minister of 
Finance thinks it will get easier as we get near the next election, 
he is totally wrong.
<P>
	As the hon. member said, whether they received bad advice or 
did not catch the full vision of what people were sending them to 
Ottawa to do, I am not sure. Regardless of what it was, if an 
opportunity is missed at the start of a parliament to set the tone 
for what the government is trying to accomplish the opportunity 
will never come back.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	Perhaps the government wonders why we make such a fuss 
about the borrowing authority, the budget and so on. It tells us to 
wait until next year, but we have heard this wait until next year 
stuff for at least 10 years and it never comes because it never 
gets easier.
<P>
	Any time we shrug something off and think that a problem 
will go away on its own it is just wishful thinking and there is a 
famous road paved with wishful thinking.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to address for the first time Bill C-14, an act to provide 
borrowing authority for the fiscal year beginning April 1, 1994. 
I speak against the bill because it is time we stopped living on 
borrowed money. The government has to start living within its 
means and resist the temptation to continue the mistakes of the 
past 25 years.
<P>
	In 1968 the Liberal government under Pierre Elliot Trudeau 
came into power. It generated the first deficit. Since 1968 and 
including that year every government has continued to spend 
more money each and every year than it generated in tax dollars. 
If we check the records, after the Liberal government was kicked 
out by the Conservative government it left a debt for the 
Conservatives of $175 billion in 1984.
<P>
	The Conservatives continued the same spending habits the 
Liberals had taught them while they were in government. Each 
and every year while the Conservatives were in power they 
continued to add to the debt to the point at which the people 
finally had enough. Under that government the debt grew to 
$460 billion. When the Conservatives were in power they kept 
blaming the Liberal government for the debt that grew every 
year because they had to pay interest out of the revenues to 
service the debt brought in by the Liberal government under Mr. 
Trudeau.
<P>
	Now the Liberals are back in power and they are blaming the 
Conservatives for the $460 billion debt. They say it is their fault 
and that the $40 billion interest payment is a result of their lack 
of fiscal responsibility. The Liberals are now expecting the 
Canadian public to buy the same argument again.
<P>
	Enough is enough. The finance minister's budget ignored the 
real problem. The finance minister presented a budget that 
accomplished nothing. The results would have been the same 
after 12 months if he had done nothing. It is a shame for him as a 
person with such good business background and business 
acumen not to heed the advice of his own experience.
<P>
	The real problem is the debt and the interest we must pay 
every year to service the debt which is in the $40 billion range. 
There is the deficit, the debt and the interest payment on the 
debt. The finance minister brought in a budget that increased 
overall spending by $3 billion. Yet his rhetoric sounds as if he 
read the Reform Party blue book and the zero in three plan.
<P>
	He talks tough. He talks about where we must take tough 
measures and make tough decisions. We must work toward a 
balanced budget. We must do this. We must do that. However, 
what does he do? He makes one sector of the economy, the 
military, suffer the most. It is suffering pain for no net gain 
because he increased spending by $3 billion overall.
<P>
	This is why we are concerned as members of the Reform 
Party. The finance minister says he understands the problem but 
he fails to address it in the budget. As a businessman I am doubly 
infuriated because every time the government interferes in the 
private sector through grants, subsidies and regional 
development funds it proves in the long run not to work. When 
the money runs out so do the businesses. It is unfair. It distorts 
the marketplace and it creates confusion.
<P>
	For instance, under the infrastructure program the federal 
government will contribute $2 billion if a province contributes 
$2 billion and the municipalities collectively contribute $2 
billion. Then we will have a $6 billion job creation program. It is 
creating confusion. In the heart of downtown Calgary in my 
riding is a building that contributes to infrastructure that already 
draws businesses and people. It is a round-up centre, a building 
called the Saddle Dome which houses the Calgary Flames, a 
professional hockey team. The municipal  council has now 
found a way to make application to the provincial government 
and through it to the federal government. The President of the 
Treasury Board will have to make a decision. I advise him to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2692"> 2692 </A></B>
<P>
decide against it because it is not a true use of infrastructure 
moneys. He will be asked to make a decision on whether it falls 
under the criterion and the definition. There is confusion.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	Therefore the federal government should make it a point that 
if it has an infrastructure program it should go toward 
infrastructure. Two other levels of government have decided 
that spending money on a facility that is already in place is 
infrastructure. Since the private sector is involved with the 
Calgary Flames and since it is the major tenant, I recommend the 
President of the Treasury Board take a good hard look at the 
application.
<P>
	My original point was that the infrastructure program was 
causing confusion. It is an intrusion into the marketplace. 
Another intrusion involves the province of Quebec and the 
manufacturer of the Hyundai car. Hyundai was originally 
subsidized, attracted to come to the province. It was to create 
1,000 jobs. We were to lend it $100 million and to sell 100,000 
cars at the end of this wonderful deal.
<P>
	Hyundai closed its doors when the money ran out. Some 856 
jobs were created, not 1,000. There were only 26,000 cars 
produced, not 100,000. However the Minister of Finance is 
considering lending more money for it to reopen the doors and 
gainfully employ another 800 people, the same 800 people.
<P>
	Has the government or the finance minister not even asked 
why it shut its doors. Is it because Hyundai is not competitive 
enough? Is it because it cannot sell cars?
<P>
	This is the private sector in which the federal government 
continues to intrude and continues to distort. The private sector 
wants the government off its back and out of its pockets. It wants 
to be left alone; it can create the infrastructure. It wants the 
government to do only what governments can do, and that is 
peace, order and good government, not investing in the private 
sector. I do not know how much more emphatically Reformers 
can say that and repeat that until it finally gets the message 
across.
<P>
	The government wants to pass Bill C-14 so that it can borrow 
money to meet its commitments in the red ink book. It wants to 
borrow money so that it can create jobs to fund our already too 
generous social programs rather than review them for ways and 
means in which it can create a social safety net that protects the 
truly needy, not those it protects now who do not really need the 
money.
<P>
	We have limited dollars. We are living on borrowed money. 
Why do we not stop wasting borrowed money and reduce the 
debt and thus reduce the amount we have to borrow? The proper 
signal should be sent to investors, lenders and consumers that 
the government will change the mistakes of the past 23 
governments and finally make a commitment to the proper 
principles of  economic growth. Lord knows, with all the advice 
we have available through bureaucracy we could do it.
<P>
	As a member of the Standing Committee on Finance I have 
heard some interesting presentations on a replacement tax for 
the GST. I have also had the very good privilege of questioning 
the deputy minister of finance, Mr. Dodge. It is worthwhile for 
the entire Liberal cabinet to listen to him, especially the finance 
minister to whom this man has to answer. Let me read a 
comment that he made to the committee referring to our huge 
debt. He said that the problem was not only a federal one but also 
a provincial and local one.
<P>
<B>(1715 ) </B>
<P>
	In 1992-93 our deficit stood at approximately $40 billion 
federally and approximately $25 million provincially. The debt 
at the federal level is getting very close to three-quarters of the 
GNP. We are paying interest rates that are about 2 per cent above 
the rate of growth of the economy. That means we have to divert 
increasing amounts of taxpayers revenues just to service the past 
debt.
<P>
	Canada's total budget deficit was the second highest among 
G-7 countries in 1992. We are just about leading the G-7 with 
respect to all levels of spending which is approximately 50 per 
cent of our GNP. The proportion of our debt that is 
internationally held has increased a great deal over the past 10 
years. It is to the point now where the combined federal 
provincial total is about $750 billion and $300 billion plus is 
foreign held.
<P>
	We must pay foreigners more and more to service Canada's 
foreign debt, approximately $1 of every $20 produced. All we 
can say is there may come a time when financial markets will 
feel they can no longer trust Canada to handle its problems. 
People will want to sell their Canadian bonds and we will no 
longer be able to borrow. We will face serious problems like 
New Zealand, Sweden, et cetera.
<P>
	The important part is that the moment of truth can arrive just 
like that. That means when the Liberal government's program 
and budget after this year and next year do not work, its final 
recourse may be the International Monetary Fund. The 
government may have to invite them here and I do not think we 
need that. Do we want to invite the International Monetary Fund 
to solve our problems? I do not think so.
<P>
	Is the finance minister listening to his own deputy Minister of 
Finance? Is the Liberal cabinet discussing the seriousness of the 
debt and the deficit and the interest costs on servicing that debt? 
What is going to happen if interest rates continue to rise? I will 
leave that for another speaker to possibly address.
<P>
	I recommend we handle our own problems before resorting to 
groups like the International Monetary Fund. I recommend a 
complete overhaul and entire review of the taxation system. 
Never mind just a GST study, make a commitment to an entire 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2693"> 2693 </A></B>
<P>
tax review. Get rid of the  income tax in its present form. Get rid 
of the 14,000 books of rules and regulations.
<P>
	Why does this government not take some advice from one of 
its own members who worked hard and true on this in 
opposition, the hon. member for Broadview-Greenwood? I 
know what his name is but I am not allowed to mention it. He 
wrote the book <I>The Single Tax</I>.
<P>
	That has a lot of merit. A flat tax for Canada would help 
spread the tax load. It would allow us to introduce a lower tax 
rate. It would help solve the problems with the social safety net 
with an exemption level for each person that generates money. 
That would solve the problem. They would not have to pay tax 
on the first $15,000 for instance. They could then look after 
themselves without government subsidies and aid. Then the 
money we did generate as a government could go to the truly 
needy, the people who really need welfare and those seniors who 
really need help under the guaranteed income supplement.
<P>
	Why will the Liberal government not focus on issues like 
this? There is a member within that party and he is not even in 
cabinet. He has been shunted right out and I do not understand 
why.
<P>
	A flat tax has some other advantages. A flat tax would allow 
all Canadians on a proportional basis, depending upon the size 
of their family and the size of their income, to pay the same rate 
of tax. That would be equal. It would be more equitable and it 
would be fair. The finance minister always likes to use the word 
``fair''. He has said in his budget speech that his intent and one 
of the objectives of the federal budget is to restore and sustain 
fiscal responsibility but I beg to differ.
<P>
	The other advantages of a flat tax, if the Liberal government 
were so inclined to review it, would be that being simple it 
eliminates the need and the work with all these exemptions and 
loopholes that the finance minister talks about in his budget.
<P>
	Today when we want to develop a certain sector of our natural 
resources, we create an incentive for people to invest and we 
give them a tax deduction. That starts to work or does not work 
and then later on we take the exemption away. We call it a 
loophole and we eliminate it. We give and take and give and 
take.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	If we had a flat tax we would not have to worry about 
incentives, loopholes and deductions. We would only have to 
figure out mechanisms over and above the personal exemption 
in terms of charitable donations, perhaps 1 per cent, and in terms 
of the child credit and child care costs. Those could be 
incorporated.
<P>
	After that we could draw a line. We would state what was 
made, make the deductions, multiply by 15 per cent and send 
that amount to the federal government. This system would be 
less complicated and understandable by everybody. It could be 
put on one sheet. Everybody would be doing it the same way. It 
is a proportional tax.
<P>
	I would love to have a debate on this. Perhaps I could 
convince my own caucus to make a motion at some future point 
to discuss this flat tax and have a situation in which we solve our 
own problems. I believe a major overhaul of the entire taxation 
system would entice more investment in Canada.
<P>
	We need capital. We need equity capital. Right now the 
government mentality, especially at the federal level is to 
continue to live on borrowed money which I call debt capital. 
There is a big difference. Money that is at risk motivates. 
Government money, especially borrowed money, is a waste.
<P>
	I wish at some point in time we could address our entire 
economic and social problems in a comprehensive and 
analytical manner. As some Bloc Quebecois members like to say 
in the finance committee, there should be a complete review of 
our taxation system category by category, allocation by 
allocation.
<P>
	We could then decide what programs we should be funding, 
what programs should remain in the public sector and what 
programs should be shunted off to the private sector. Yes, I am 
talking about privatization. There are a lot of Crown 
corporations that could be sold off if they are still necessary. If 
nobody in the private sector wishes to buy them, that is only 
proof nobody wants the service or needs it anyway.
<P>
	We could really clean house in this 35th Parliament if we 
made a commitment. I understand the Bloc Quebecois claims to 
be fiscally responsible. So does the Reform Party. Why do the 
cabinet ministers not swallow their pride and listen to some of 
the comments we make? They could take credit for being the 
greatest government that ever lived because it finally listened to 
the people on matters that really counted, money. We pay far too 
much in taxes and they need to be reduced.
<P>
	I speak against Bill C-14. I know the government ultimately 
can put this bill through, but I caution it to at least listen to some 
of the comments made in this House. Do more than give token 
interest to what we say. We are here to serve for another four and 
a half years. We want to be solving the problems for this country, 
not for some international association.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be brief 
because I really want to hear the Reform Party's answer to this 
question.
<P>
	Some time ago, because of a similar perception of the debt 
problem, I was invited to join the ranks of the Reform Party. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2694"> 2694 </A></B>
<P>
However, even though we may perceive the problem in a similar 
way, it does not necessarily  mean that we share the solution. 
Indeed, our respective solutions may differ.
<P>
	In this context, I said earlier that in the last decade or two no 
government was able to control the debt and the deficit.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	I submit that the reason for this failure rests with the system 
itself and that the system has to be changed. I would like to read 
the hon. member, if I may, Mr. Speaker, the end of the letter 
dated March 1st which the president and chief executive officer 
of the Quebec manufacturers' association, Richard Le Hir, 
wrote about the budget. It is only one paragraph long.
<P>
	Faced with this situation, the federal government's only 
strategy is the relentless pursuit of the same policy in spite of all 
the evidence. Nothing else can explain Mr. Martin's reserve in 
his recent budget. He and his Liberal colleagues are hoping that, 
contrary to all expectations, a miraculous upturn in the economy 
will save Canada from the disaster it is headed for. They are 
making the same mistake the Conservatives made before them. 
They refuse to admit there is a structural aspect to the Canadian 
public finances problem. And for a very good reason! If they 
did, it would call into doubt the very structure of the system: the 
sacrosanct Constitution. That would be tantamount to opening 
Pandora's box. That is why, as we now say in Montreal, `les jeux 
sont faits, rien ne va plus'!
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I enjoyed the commentary of the hon. 
member. That quote has a lot of merit. I would not dispute that.
<P>
	I would like to raise one thing that perhaps Bloc Quebecois 
members have not considered. I know the agenda they ran in the 
province of Quebec. They feel that separation is the best thing 
for Quebec. I respect their views on that. I respect why they feel 
that way. Perhaps members could give them other thoughts to 
consider.
<P>
	Why not stay in Canada? Why not work together for one 
Canada, a new federalism? The Bloc Quebecois would work 
within this confederation to gain the best possible for the 
province of Quebec in partnership with nine other equal 
provinces. As one country we would grow together and 
ultimately achieve our highest potential. Why does the hon. 
member not talk to his caucus about the economic advantages 
for the province of Quebec of staying in Canada? The signal that 
would send to the global community and the global market 
would have resounding positive financial rewards for the 
province of Quebec.
<P>
	As Reformers we would be happy to point out to the Bloc 
Quebecois what some of the advantages are to staying in 
confederation. This separatist point of view is divisive and 
confusing. There are the arguments and debates over 
immigration, over the debt and what Quebec's share would be, 
how we do this, how we do that. Why not work together? 
Financially it is advantageous for everyone concerned.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The Chair has received written notice 
from the hon. member for Davenport that he is unable to move 
his motion during private members' hour on Thursday, March 
24.
<P>
	It has not been possible to arrange an exchange of positions in 
the order of precedence according to Standing Order 94(2)(a). 
Accordingly it is necessary that the Chair ask the table officers 
to drop the item of business to the bottom of the order of 
precedence.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Pursuant to Standing Order 94(2)(<I>b</I>), Private Members' Hour 
will be suspended for the day and the House will continue with 
the business before it at the time.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It now being 5.30 p.m., pursuant to the order made on 
Tuesday, March 22, 1994, it is my duty to interrupt the 
proceedings and to put forthwith every question necessary to 
dispose of the third reading stage of the bill now before the 
House.
<P>
	Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> All those in favour of the motion will 
please say yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> All those opposed will please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> In my opinion the nays have it.
<P>
	<I>And more than five members having risen:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Call in the members.

	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should initiate an 
amendment to the Constitution Act, 1982 to delete section 33 (the 
notwithstanding clause).</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I would appreciate if we could get a 
little order in the House as it is difficult to speak over the noise.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Colleagues, your colleague wants to 
have some order and the Chair on his behalf would request order 
so that he might present his motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allmand:</B> Mr. Speaker, the motion which I have 
presented asks that the government initiate an amendment to the 
Constitution Act of 1982 to delete section 33, the 
notwithstanding clause.
<P>
	What are we talking about? In 1982 the Parliament of Canada 
and all the parliaments of the provinces passed the Constitution 
Act of 1982 which included for the first time in our history an 
entrenched Charter of Rights and Freedoms. These were such 
rights as the fundamental freedoms; the freedom of conscience 
and religion, the freedom of thought, the freedom of belief, 
opinion and expression, freedom of the press, freedom of 
peaceful assembly, freedom of association, our democratic 
rights-that is, the right to take part in elections, the right to run 
for office, mobility rights, legal rights, very important equality 
rights. That section said that all Canadians were equal 
irrespective of their sex, their age, their colour, their religion, 
their race, their national origin.
<P>
	In 1982 we entrenched those rights, which meant that those 
rights could not be taken away by ordinary legislation. 
Furthermore, those rights prevailed over all other legislation 
since they were in the Constitution.
<P>
	If a conflict arose between any other law in Canada and what 
was in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, then the Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms prevailed. The only way those rights could 
be taken away is by an amendment to the Constitution, which is 
a very complex thing, as we all know as a result of the 
Charlottetown accord experience.
<P>
	We took steps to give Canadians these entrenched rights and 
then at the same time we put in the very same act article 33, the 
notwithstanding clause, which allowed Parliament and all the 
legislatures of Canada to take away those very rights by the use 
of what is called a notwithstanding clause. This means that if a 
government introduced a bill which said: ``Notwithstanding the 
charter of rights, we legislate as follows'', then it would  
legislate away the right of freedom of the press or freedom of 
religion or freedom of equality, and so on.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	When Prime Minister Trudeau first introduced the Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms in 1981, the notwithstanding clause was 
not in it. At that point the Constitution of 1982 was clear, pure, 
simple and direct without any shenanigans or skulduggery 
whatsoever.
<P>
	However, in the negotiations with the provinces, between 
early 1981 and passage in late 1981, pressure was brought to 
bear and the notwithstanding clause was accepted.
<P>
	I always opposed the notwithstanding clause. As a matter of 
fact I voted for the Constitution Act of 1981 when it was first 
presented on the first round by Mr. Trudeau as a member of his 
party and supported it strongly. However, at the end of the 
process, when we voted again at the end of the year, I was 
obliged to oppose the package, not because I did not support 
many things in it but I could not accept the notwithstanding 
clause and there were a few other clauses that were added that I 
could not accept.
<P>
	Why am I so opposed to the notwithstanding clause? I just 
referred to these rights. These are not marginal rights that we are 
talking about. These are not supplementary rights. We are 
talking about basic, universal rights, rights that are recognized 
around the world. We are talking about rights that are 
recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of the 
United Nations. We are not talking about rights to own property 
or to build a house on a certain street. We are talking about 
things like freedom of religion, freedom of conscience, equality 
between races, equality between people of different religious 
backgrounds and so on. We are talking about things that are very 
basic.
<P>
	As far as I am concerned, rights are rights and they should not 
be subject to legislative suspension for any reason, not these 
kinds of rights. They cannot be legislated away.
<P>
	Some people would argue that no rights are unlimited. That is 
correct. For example, let us take freedom of speech. The 
principle of freedom of speech is, without a doubt, 
unchallengeable, but we cannot abuse it. We have accepted for a 
long time the crimes of liable and slander which are an abuse of 
the freedom of speech. We have now in our criminal law 
provisions against hate literature by which one cannot attack 
another ethnic or religious group in a demeaning way. It can add 
up to hate literature. That is an abuse of the freedom of speech.
<P>
	The Constitution Act of 1982 and the Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms provide for that in section 1. The notwithstanding 
clause is not necessary. Section 1 of the charter states: ``that the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the rights 
and freedoms set out in it subject only to such reasonable limits 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2698"> 2698 </A></B>
<P>
prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and 
democratic society''.
<P>
	We have had our liable and slander laws for many years, but if 
they were to be challenged as contrary to the Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms, the spokespersons for the government could 
argue that these were exceptions that were reasonable in a free 
and democratic society. In other words, one should not be able to 
tell lies that will hurt the reputation of other people.
<P>
	The difference with article 1 of the charter is that it is the court 
which decides whether the law being challenged is an exception 
to the charter or not and it is not a politically elected Parliament 
or legislature that decides. To me that is very important.
<P>
	What does it really mean when we have a notwithstanding 
clause in our Constitution and in our Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms? It means that our minorities really have no 
protection vis-à-vis the majority. It means that the minorities 
are subject to the rule of the majority. The notwithstanding 
clause becomes a contradiction to the very reason for the charter 
in the first place.
<P>
<B>(1810 ) </B>
<P>
	Those of us who argued in favour of the charter, including 
Prime Minister Trudeau, said that we must have a charter 
entrenched in our Constitution to protect minorities of different 
kinds against the rule of majorities in cases where fear often is 
demonstrated, where all of a sudden in certain situations people 
want to trample over the rights of the minorities. He said that we 
could not leave that to ordinary legislation, that we must 
recognize basic principles and put them beyond the rule of the 
majority. However if a notwithstanding clause is included that is 
contradicting what is being done in the first place. You are 
giving with one hand and then taking away with the other.
<P>
	To me that is hypocrisy. You really do not have a Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms if a legislature can pass a law using the 
notwithstanding clause, using the words ``notwithstanding the 
rights and freedoms we are legislating as follows''. You really 
do not have protection and that is what was supposed to be done 
in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. However you are giving 
with one hand and taking away with the other. It becomes a 
farce. It can even become mob rule. That is, the mob, the 
majority when they want to act, they act regardless of the basic 
rights of the minorities in society.
<P>
	I had the privilege of being educated at law school by Frank R. 
Scott, one of the great Canadian professors of law and one of the 
great civil rights lawyers in our entire history. He was able to 
challenge two laws Quebec Premier Duplessis passed in the 
post-war period.
<P>
	One was a law to ban the Jehovah Witnesses. Frank Scott with 
others was able to have that law overturned. We did not have the 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms in those days. However because 
he was a very imaginative lawyer he was able to do it by 
referring to other parts of the Constitution.
<P>
	Then Premier Duplessis passed a law called the padlock act. It 
allowed him to put locks on the doors of anybody suspected of 
being a Communist. I have no sympathy for Communists. The 
point is if it can be done for the Communists, it can be done for 
the Reform Party, the Liberal Party, the Conservative Party or 
any other party if you do not like them and you are allowed to 
pass a law banning a political party. Again, Frank Scott was able 
to win without the charter.
<P>
	However I put this to the House. If there had been a charter 
with the notwithstanding clause and Frank Scott had won in the 
Supreme Court of Canada, Mr. Duplessis would simply go back 
to his legislature and say: ``Notwithstanding the Supreme Court 
of Canada, notwithstanding the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, 
we are once again going to ban the Jehovah Witnesses. We are 
once again going to ban a political party''.
<P>
	When it was introduced and agreed to by my own party and 
our own government, it was said we were agreeing to it to get the 
package through. It was said that it would never be used and if it 
was going to be used, it would be rare.
<P>
	It has been used several times. It has been used in 
Saskatchewan; it has been used in Quebec to override the 
Supreme Court of Canada and to override other rulings of the 
court with respect to the charter.
<P>
	I ask Quebecers in particular to consider that if the legislature 
of Quebec can do it for language in that province, then another 
province can do it for language as well. If it can be done for 
language, it can be done for religion. If it can be done for 
religion, it can be done for equality between the races.
<P>
	Once you agree to do it, then one day you cannot say to the guy 
in the next province or to this Parliament that it should not be 
done for that when you have done it yourself. You cannot pick 
and choose on this kind of thing.
<P>
	Imagine what the situation would have been if the United 
States had a notwithstanding clause. I know it took a long time 
but it was finally in 1954 in the famous Brown case that the 
discrimination laws against blacks in the United States were 
finally struck down. They were laws that were enforced in 
several of the southern states that said that blacks must sit in the 
back of the bus, that said that blacks had to sit in a certain part of 
a cinema, that said that blacks could not go into certain parks, 
that they could not live in certain districts, that they could not go 
to certain schools.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2699"> 2699 </A></B>
<P>
	It was the constitution of the United States. It took a long 
while in American history but finally they won in 1954 by 
gathering together the funds necessary to challenge those laws. 
They won in the Supreme Court of the United States in that very 
famous case, the Brown case.
<P>
<B>(1815 ) </B>
<P>
	Can members imagine if they had a notwithstanding clause in 
the American constitution and Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia 
or any of those states could simply say that despite the Supreme 
Court of the United States, too bad, they are going to legislate 
exactly what they had in the first place. The constitution of the 
United States would not mean anything. That would be 
ridiculous. It is ridiculous in most countries. The 
notwithstanding clause was accepted as a political compromise 
and it was unfortunate and wrong.
<P>
	During the discussions on the Charlottetown accord there was 
discussion as to whether the committee of which I was a 
member, the Beaudoin-Dobbie committee-it was Castonguay 
at one point-should make recommendations against the 
notwithstanding clause.
<P>
	We debated it at great length and finally we left it aside, much 
to my dismay, on the grounds that while the notwithstanding 
clause is not correct in principle there was no chance we could 
get the provinces to agree, therefore we should not waste our 
time pursuing something that we could not get agreement on. I 
say that was unfortunate.
<P>
	There are other people who will argue that the last word must 
always be with the political people, the elected people. I can 
remember an NDP premier of Saskatchewan, Allan Blakeney, 
whom I respect for other things. He took that point of view.
<P>
	Legislatures and Parliaments in this country are not 
unlimited. The Constitution Act of 1867 puts limits on us in 
many respects. There are limits on catholic schools and 
protestant schools. There are limits on what one can legislate in 
the provinces and what one can legislate at the federal level.
<P>
	There are limits with respect to what one can do regarding the 
monarchy in the country. One cannot legislate in any respect 
whatever one wants. There have always been limitations. What 
the charter did was extend those limitations and say that certain 
rights belong to people and political bodies cannot take them 
away.
<P>
	The argument that political bodies should be completely free 
to do whatever they want or what they think right at any time is 
not right in principle and it is not acceptable even from a legal 
point of view.
<P>
	I want to remind the House that in 1986 at a large national 
convention after we lost in a devastating way the election of 
1984, the Liberal Party passed a resolution by well over 80 per 
cent of the delegates attending in 1986 in Ottawa, saying exactly 
what I have in my motion  today, that we should take steps to get 
rid of the notwithstanding clause.
<P>
	As a matter of fact, the then leader of our party, the Right Hon. 
John Turner, presented the same motion that I am presenting 
today. It was in his name until he retired. I have taken up the 
motion although I have always supported the same point of 
view.
<P>
	I am saying that if we are going to have a Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms on such basic rights as I have described-I would 
not say the same thing about marginal rights which are 
important or other types of rights-and that we have in this 
charter, they should never be subject to suspension.
<P>
	If one agrees to suspension in one case, then one leaves 
oneself open a little while down the road to the suspension of 
other rights whether they be religious rights or language rights 
or rights to express one's opinions, freely to write what one 
wants, to form a trade union, or to form a political party.
<P>
	I ask this House to take this motion seriously. This is not a 
piece of legislation in itself. It is a motion that will express the 
view of this Parliament.
<P>
	During the discussion right up to the Charlottetown accord 
some people said that we could not get rid of the 
notwithstanding clause altogether but that maybe we could get 
agreement on its limitation, maybe we could take it off the 
equality rights section, perhaps we could take it off the 
fundamental freedoms section but leave it on the political rights, 
in other words restrict its ambit of application.
<P>
	That was one solution proposed. Others said that maybe we 
could reduce the number of years for which the notwithstanding 
legislation is valid. As members know, right now when you pass 
a bill under the notwithstanding clause it is only good for five 
years and you must do it all over again. They said let us reduce 
that to three years, two years or whatever.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	Then others said maybe we should introduce a two-thirds 
requirement for its use. If you are going to suspend basic rights 
in the Constitution with the notwithstanding clause you should 
at least have to have two-thirds, three-quarters, not the ordinary 
51 per cent majority.
<P>
	If it was impossible to get rid of the clause altogether I would 
certainly accept those kind of compromises. I think they would 
go some distance in reducing the concern that the many 
minorities in this country have.
<P>
	Let me say this is a country of minorities. You look at the 
House we have today, we come from many parts of the world, we 
come from many linguistic backgrounds, many racial 
backgrounds, many religious backgrounds. It is not as it was in 
1867 when we were basically catholics, protestants, we were all 
white 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2700"> 2700 </A></B>
<P>
and we were either had French or British background. Today we 
are of many many backgrounds. We are all minorities.
<P>
	I think we would do ourselves well to declare ourselves on 
this. It is not to pass a law but it would show where this new 
Parliament stands on basic rights and freedoms and we would be 
saying loud and clear that these rights are our rights forever and 
a day and they cannot be suspended by any simple majority of a 
Parliament of Canada or a legislature of a province.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome this opportunity to speak to motion M-239, introduced 
by the hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, which requests 
withdrawal of section 33 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms of 1982, the notwithstanding clause, also known in 
Quebec as the ``clause nonobstant''.
<P>
	Need I recall that the legislation we are discussing, the 1982 
Canadian Charter, was passed by the Imperial Parliament in 
Westminster, after a debate in this House where the majority of 
Quebecers-there were a few exceptions-supported the 
request made to the Imperial Parliament?
<P>
	In fact, there was more opposition to the Constitution Act, 
1982, in the Imperial Parliament in Westminster than in this 
House. Westminster ratified this legislation, despite two 
memoranda by the Government of Quebec which vigorously 
objected to the process and also despite a resolution supported 
by both parties then represented in the Quebec National 
Assembly, the Parti québécois and the Liberal Party of Quebec, 
with only six members voting against the resolution.
<P>
	What we have now is legislation that may have its merits but 
is fundamentally flawed in terms of the process that was 
imposed on us to adopt it. The government amended Canada's 
Constitution and removed Quebec's right to legislate on 
language matters, a right guaranteed by section 92 of the 
Constitution Act, 1867, by what was always defined as a pact 
between the two founding peoples. What a fallacy, Mr. Speaker!
<P>
	Section 23 of the Constitution Act, 1982, ratified in London 
and amended in a Parliament on the other side of the Atlantic, 
amended section 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867, by restricting 
the powers of the Quebec National Assembly with respect to 
language in Quebec, and in many respects it was this section that 
caused so much trouble. How ironic that we should have to go to 
London to amend the Canadian Constitution and to incorporate 
in the constitutional amending formula provisions that, if they 
had existed in 1982, would have made it impossible to amend 
section 23 with respect to the powers of Quebec.
<P>
	They asked London to do the dirty work, so that would be the 
end of it. This is a strange interpretation of democracy. And with 
all due respect for the hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, 
who referred to decisions by the courts in Quebec and especially 
to Mr. Duplessis, I think we should not forget that in this trilogy 
of judgments made in the fifties, in Saumur versus the City of 
Quebec, the Switsman case and the Roncareli case, the Supreme 
Court of Canada came down on the side of those who defended 
civil rights and quashed the laws passed by the Legislative 
Assembly and Legislature of Quebec which restricted individual 
rights and freedoms. The rights of the Jehovah's Witnesses were 
recognized by the Supreme Court of Canada. The padlock act, 
passed by the Legislative Assembly and Legislature of Quebec, 
was declared null and void.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	But where was the hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce in 
1970, when this House passed the War Measures Act which 
provided for arrests without a warrant and arbitrary detention of 
Canadian citizens? Government by decree, that is exactly what 
they did in 1970, and the hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce voted in favour of this odious piece of 
legislation, which was last used in World War I. Was he there to 
defend the rights of Quebecers, when 500 were jailed without a 
warrant and could be detained for up to six months without trial? 
In most cases they received no compensation, or very little. 
Some people lost their jobs, their families and the love and 
respect of their friends. Where was the hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce then? Perhaps he should tell us 
someday.
<P>
	However, I understand some of the frustrations of the hon. 
member which are probably connected with Bill 178, passed by 
the Quebec National Assembly and proposed by the Liberal 
Premier of Quebec, Mr. Bourassa, which created two language 
categories in Quebec, one language which could be posted 
inside and another outside. There is nothing wrong with being 
able to post signs in one's own language. Bill 178 was highly 
questionable because it seemed to make English a language that 
had to be used furtively. And that should certainly not be the 
case.
<P>
	Getting back to the crux of the matter, since these precautions 
were taken, section 33, the famous notwithstanding clause, 
allows us to interpret the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms. It allows parliamentarians to interpret the Charter 
and, depending on the circumstances, to ask themselves this: 
Should we or can we distance ourselves from the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms?
<P>
	At the federal level, the decision to do so is made by the 
houses of the federal parliament, while at the provincial level, it 
is made by the members of the legislatures. The decision is only 
valid for five years. It is a serious matter which must be studied 
each time and the decision that is reached is valid for a period of 
five years,  which enables the legislator to have the final word. 
However, when it comes to justifying the use of the 
notwithstanding clause to the Canadian and provincial 
electorates, the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2701"> 2701 </A></B>
<P>
burden will fall to federal and provincial members of 
Parliament. And there may indeed be circumstances where the 
application of the notwithstanding clause is justifiable. For 
example, it may be justified in the case of political party funding 
where the sky is virtually the limit when it comes to 
contributions.
<P>
	Perhaps a notwithstanding clause will be referred to this 
Parliament, thereby making it possible to adjust today's reality 
to the deeply felt wishes of Canadian and Quebec society. 
Perhaps. There are cases. In any event, when there is a charter of 
rights or constitutional provision, such as the constitutional 
amendments to the constitution of the United States, there is no 
notwithstanding clause. The U.S. constitution does not contain 
one and the legislator is bound by his own constitutional 
provisions which must be upheld.
<P>
	The offshoot of this, however, is that if the legislator cannot 
do the job, the courts will do it. The courts take on the task, from 
time to time, of defining that which, in their opinion, is 
acceptable at a given point in time, based on how a society 
evolves. Over the decades and even the centuries now, the 
Supreme Court of the United States has not been shy about 
interpreting differently various provisions of the amendments to 
the American Constitution that guarantee certain rights 
associated with certain fundamental freedoms.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	I much prefer to have this discretionary power exercised by 
elected officials as in our country who must go before their 
constituents at least every five years, rather than by unelected 
judges who cannot be removed and are not accountable to 
anyone, since this is basically a political act. If we want to take 
politics out of Parliament and put it in the courts, the proposal of 
the hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce should be 
accepted. If political debates should go on in our stately 
courtrooms, let us adopt the motion presented by the hon. 
member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, but if we want political 
issues to be settled here in the House of Commons or in the 
Quebec National Assembly or in the provincial legislatures, 
please do not pass a motion like this one.
<P>
	Passing Motion No. 239 would be compounding the wrong 
done to us Quebecers in 1982, which came on top of the insult 
we had to put up with in October 1970, let me remind the hon. 
member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce in closing.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Excuse me. I wonder if the hon. 
member has not completed his remarks, perhaps he could have 
unanimous consent to do so. Has the hon. member for 
Bellechasse finished?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Langlois:</B> I think that this is a debate about the kind of 
society we want which could go on for years, Mr. Speaker. If you 
wish, give the floor to the hon. member for Chambly, who could 
use up my speaking time.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I would ask hon. members if there is 
unanimous consent to give the hon. member five minutes to 
complete his remarks? Do hon. members agree? I know that it is 
a very important subject. Can the hon. member for Bellechasse 
have more time to complete his remarks?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Langlois:</B> To conclude, Mr. Speaker, I would ask you to 
give the floor for the rest of my time to the hon. member for 
Chambly.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member's time has expired. 
Members who follow the member who presented this motion 
have ten minutes each.
<P>
	I think that two other members wish to speak. No, four 
members want to talk on this. Can we share the time, perhaps 
seven or eight minutes each?
<P>
	I now give the floor to the hon. member for Edmonton 
Southwest.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will share my time. I have a few very brief comments to make.
<P>
	I recognize the motion put forward by my hon. friend from 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce and accept the fact that it is a basic 
contradiction to speak against the motion. If article 33 is to be 
used to take away rights or freedoms, chances are that it will be 
used to take away rights and freedoms from where they are 
probably needed the most. There is a basic contradiction in 
speaking against the motion, which is what I intend to do this 
evening. I do so despite the fact that I am appreciative that it 
really is a conundrum when the Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
has an override provision on perhaps the most personal aspects 
of the charter.
<P>
	Under the Constitution Act, 1982, as was pointed out by my 
hon. friend from Quebec, when the Constitution came back to 
Canada it did not have unanimous support of all provinces. It 
also changed the fundamental values in the way our country 
relates, the way we relate as citizens one to another. We no 
longer have common law. The legislatures are not longer 
paramount in Canada; it is the Supreme Court. We found 
ourselves as a nation reacting to interpretations of the way we 
relate one to another by virtue of how the Supreme Court 
interprets a particular law.
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	The net result is that we have become a nation of entitlement 
rather than of responsibilities. I keep suggesting that perhaps we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2702"> 2702 </A></B>
<P>
could immeasurably improve the Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms if we were to change it to the charter of rights, 
freedoms and responsibilities, because there is no such thing as 
a right or a freedom without a corresponding responsibility.
<P>
	Bringing in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms with the 
Constitution Act has fundamentally changed the way we relate 
to each other as citizens and to our governments. The 
notwithstanding clause gives elected parliaments the 
opportunity to override the court which is unelected and 
appointed.
<P>
	Perhaps there would be some way we could evolve to some 
sort of compromise so that we could have the best of both 
worlds. I do not know what that compromise would be, but I 
know the people of Canada, at least in my opinion, would far 
rather have a country where elected bodies in our nation were 
paramount to appointed judicial bodies.
<P>
	For that reason I would vote against the bill and I would speak 
against the notion of striking the notwithstanding clause, 
keeping in mind that when invoked the notwithstanding clause 
must be redone every five years.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker:</B> Before I recognize the hon. member for 
Chambly, I would like to inform the House that there is enough 
time remaining for two members to speak for 10 minutes apiece.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am truly 
outraged by the motion of the hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-De-Grâce.
<P>
	A brief overview of the events of 1982 will make it clear to 
him that Quebec has always been opposed to the unilateral 
patriation of the Constitution and to the passage of laws 
overseas by a foreign country for the purpose of muzzling 
Quebec and taking away from it the only powers it had left as far 
as language was concerned.
<P>
	In the National Assembly, Quebecers in both parties opposed 
these measures. Now, twelve years later, is the member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce trying to hammer the final nail into the 
coffin of the French language in Quebec? I have to say that this 
is not very far from the truth.
<P>
	Quebec will never agree to the removal of such measures as 
the notwithstanding clause. All the more so because at the 
present time, the provisions of Quebec's education laws are 
being extended. Five laws are currently being debated in the 
National Assembly and the notwithstanding clause will be 
continued because it reflects the very essence of Quebecers and 
their existence in Quebec. If the hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce has not yet understood this after 25 or 
30 years in politics, then I wonder what he is doing here.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, this is not a negotiable issue as far as we are 
concerned. Nor will it ever be. I do not need 10 minutes to tell 
you that it will never fly in Quebec. If we have to, we will fight 
you on this tooth and nail.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak 
on the motion before us. I must say I have listened with a great 
deal of interest to some of the arguments presented by my friend 
in the Reform caucus, members of the Official Opposition and 
the hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce who moved the 
motion. I agree with the member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce 
that the notwithstanding clause in the Constitution is a 
fundamental and, some might say, fatal flaw which emasculates 
the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
	The override clause is contradictory to the idea of inalienable 
rights. On the one hand the charter says that the people of 
Canada have inalienable rights. On the other hand they can be 
taken away by legislation when the government chooses. That is 
a fundamental contradiction. It actually puts us in a position 
where we do not have a final set of inalienable rights that cannot 
be taken away from us at the whim of government.
<P>
	I want to talk about some of the ramifications of this point and 
then talk about some other flaws in the charter. As I said earlier, 
the government can suspend specific rights granted in the 
charter at its whim. Governments are usually elected with only a 
plurality of the vote and very seldom by a majority. Even when 
they are elected with a majority, the majority is giving them that 
endorsement on election day for a variety of reasons but often 
not specifically so that they have the legislative authority to take 
away fundamental rights.
<P>
	I could use my home province of British Columbia as an 
example. In the last election its government was elected with 38 
per cent of the popular vote. Now it is in a position to use 
legislative power to suspend charter rights in British Columbia 
if it so chooses, even though it were only elected with 38 per cent 
of the popular vote. At this point its popularity has gone down, 
not up. As we sit here today the Government of British Columbia 
probably enjoys less than 25 per cent support among the people.
<P>
	Again I say this is a fundamental flaw in the charter. It gives a 
government which enjoys very low popular support the ability to 
override fundamental rights in the charter. I consider that to be 
anti-democratic. It is very anti-democratic at its very roots. I 
therefore concur that the override provision in the charter is not 
in the interests of the people.
<P>
	The mover of the motion has gone. I wanted to ask him some 
questions. The way the process evolved that brought us the 
charter was flawed in itself. That is the reason we have problems 
with the charter. The framers of the charter never consulted in a 
meaningful way with the people. There was no opportunity for 
Canadians to  come out and express their opinion on the charter. 
Whether they agreed with it or disagreed with it or whether they 
<P>

<B><A NAME="2703"> 2703 </A></B>
<P>
wanted changes, it was framed by a group of elite politicians in a 
power brokering deal between the federal government and the 
provinces with very little if any opportunity for the people to put 
forward their points of view.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> All men, no women.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Skeena):</B> As my hon. friend said, it was a group of 
white Anglo-Saxon Protestant men. No women or minorities 
were reflected. It was very much a power brokering deal.
<P>
	I have read a bit of history and I understand that at the time 
Prime Minister Trudeau considered very carefully going to a 
referendum because he was having a problem getting the 
provinces to agree to the amendment of the Constitution. If the 
government of the day had gone to the people and had asked for 
their input, we would have today a charter without a 
notwithstanding clause. That was put in there at the request of 
the provinces. It was done in a power brokering deal 
arrangement made behind closed doors with a group of elite 
politicians.
<P>
	Does the member who moved the motion not agree that the 
process was flawed and that if we had the proper process we 
would not be in the situation we are in today? I guess that leads 
to the following questions. Where does sovereignty 
fundamentally reside? Does it reside in the federal government? 
Does it reside in the provincial governments? Is it shared 
between them? Or, does it reside in the people where it properly 
should reside?
<P>
	The power sharing arrangement was constructed by and for 
political interests.
<P>
<B>(1845 ) </B>
<P>
	I go on from there to say that the framers of the charter in my 
view have a fundamental misunderstanding of what a charter of 
rights is for. A charter of rights should be about freedoms from 
and not entitlements to.
<P>
	If we look at the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms as 
it is today, it is not that. There are certainly some reflections of 
that idea in there but it is more than that. It has some 
fundamental omissions in my opinion and it has some things in 
there that we could easily do without.
<P>
	I would like to talk about the omissions first. There is no 
entrenchment of private property rights. This was done to serve 
the interests of the provincial governments but it certainly is not 
in line with what Canadians want. I suggest again if the process 
had been right that would be in there.
<P>
	There is no tax limitation clause. There is no ability for the 
people to say that government can have only so much of my skin 
and I want the rest. There is no ability to do that within the 
charter. There is no deficit limitation clause. There is no ability 
for the people to say that government can only go into debt so 
far, that  government can only have deficits of such a per cent of 
gross domestic product and no more.
<P>
	That is not in the charter. There is no ability within the charter 
for referendums, initiative or recall and that could very well 
have been placed in there as well. It is something that we in this 
party know from campaigning and talking to people throughout 
Canada is very popular with the people but it is not in our 
charter.
<P>
	I want to talk now about a part of the charter that we could do 
without. Section 15 of the Constitution Act of 1982 provides in 
subsection (1) that no Canadian will be discriminated against 
because of race, sex, disability, et cetera. Subsection (2) of the 
same section notes that the first section does not mean that 
government may not enact laws that are intended to ameliorate 
past discriminations.
<P>
	What this subsection implies is that subsection (1) holds 
unless government has decided that a reverse discrimination 
program is in order. If there is such a program, the rights of those 
who are affected by such programs are simply forfeited in the 
interest of achieving the aims of the program.
<P>
	This reverse discrimination or affirmative action provision in 
effect means that there is no protection for individuals from 
discrimination against them by Parliament if Parliament deems 
that in some past period of time some group covered by 
subsection (2) was discriminated against. This is another 
fundamental flaw in the charter.
<P>
	While I agree that the notwithstanding clause is 
fundamentally undemocratic and its removal would enhance the 
charter and give it real meaning and protect the inalienable 
rights of Canadians, there are these other changes to the charter 
that need to be addressed as well.
<P>
	In line with that, as my hon. friend earlier suggested, we have 
to look at reforming appointments to the Supreme Court. We 
have to look at a more democratic way of having those 
appointments made so that people can feel that at the highest 
levels of protection of our democratic interests we do have a 
democratic institution, an institution that is elected and not 
appointed, that is there to safeguard those interests.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allmand:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. The hon. 
member for Skeena asked me a question and I am wondering 
with the permission of the House if I could briefly answer it.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent for the 
member to briefly answer the question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Allmand:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member asked me if I 
thought it was due that we got the notwithstanding clause 
because of the process. I would say absolutely correct.
<P>
	When Mr. Trudeau first introduced the charter, it did not have 
a notwithstanding clause. It only came about in the negotiations 
with the provinces. By the way, it was not Quebec that suggested 
it. It came from one of the western provinces.
<P>
	I also agree with him when he says that sovereignty lies with 
the people and not with governments or legislatures. We all get 
our power from the people. There may have been a different 
result if there had been a referendum on it. After going through 
several referendums I do not know.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> As no other hon. member wishes to 
speak and the motion was not selected as a votable item, the hour 
provided for the consideration of Private Members' Business 
has now expired and, pursuant to Standing Order 96 (1), this 
item is dropped from the Order Paper.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It being more or less seven o'clock, this House stands 
adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 
24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.51 p.m.)
