	<B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Don Valley North, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on February 14, 1996 Pleasant View Junior High School 
in my riding of Don Valley North held a special Canadian 
citizenship week to celebrate National Citizenship Week and mark 
the 25th anniversary of the school.
<P>
	I salute Pleasant View Junior High on its silver anniversary and 
commend the principal, staff and students in choosing the symbol 
of reaffirmation of their Canadian citizenship as a meaningful way 
to celebrate this significant milestone in Pleasant View's history.
<P>
	Congratulations Pleasant View junior high school and happy 
25th anniversary.

	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday's throne speech touched on security for Canadians, yet 
this government continues to add to the debt at a rate of $90 million 
per day. One has to wonder how Canadians manage to sleep at 
night.
<P>
	My province of Alberta has been able to balance its budget and 
enjoy strong economic growth. It did so by reducing spending by 
14 per cent.
<P>
	Just listen to this record of success: unemployment down; 
production up in both 1994 and 1995; continued diversification of 
its economy; and a budget surplus in 1995 with surpluses planned 
from now on.
<P>
	This performance demonstrates that real growth can occur as 
governments get their finances in order. Believe me, Canadians 
will feel a whole lot more secure once the government puts a solid 
plan in place for deficit elimination and debt pay down.
<P>
	Alberta has demonstrated how real long term jobs can be created 
by building confidence through a balanced budget.

Canada''. According to a survey of 30,000 air travellers carried out 
by the International Air Transport Association, Mirabel ranked 
fifth among world airports for efficiency.
<P>

Mr. Speaker, the Metis people of Canada, the Metis Nation of

great injustice in 1885 when the bell of Batoche was wrongfully 
removed from a Metis church, St. Antoine de Padoue, as a trophy

important period in Metis history.
<P>
	Since its removal from the church in 1885, the bell has been 
located first at the firehall in Millbrook and then moved to 
Millbrook Legion Hall in Millbrook, Ontario. However, the bell of

	My question is for the Prime Minister or rather the Deputy Prime

Quebecers and Canadians want desperately.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, you will 
agree that this new session is off to a strange start.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. Yesterday, the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs said that the statement in the 
throne speech might even mean a cross-Canada referendum on the 
Quebec question. Today, however, the Deputy Prime Minister 
made some adjustments saying it was not a referendum. The 
minister himself backed down, saying it was not a referendum for 
the moment.
<P>
	Probably someone is leading this government. I would like to 
know who, first, and I would also like to know who is telling the 
truth. Yes or no, is the government planning a cross-Canada 
referendum on the Quebec question?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the unfortunate part about 
the approach of the Leader of the Opposition- I assume he heard 
what the mayor of Montreal had to say. When the mayor of 
Montreal came here, he asked us to stop talking about the 
referendum and to get to work on rebuilding the economy in 
Montreal and in Quebec.
<P>
	I also assume he listens to commentators in Quebec, who are 
saying ``Good Speech'' and ``Ambitious Program'', in connection 
with our economic recovery  program. That is what Michel Vastel 
said. The newspaper <I>Le Soleil</I> said: ``Finally, a government that 
governs''. Would the people across the way be so kind as to join us 
in working on the real issues: economic recovery in Montreal, in 
Quebec and in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
questioning the government on yesterday's speech from the throne. 
I am questioning the government, and the whole national press 
gallery has raised elements that are the point of my question. The 
Deputy Prime Minister is accusing me of talking about the 
referendum, when I am questioning her on what they said. They are 
in some other world.
<P>
	My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister, and I would ask 
her to be clear. She and the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
definitely contradicted each other on the matter of the 
cross-Canada referendum. Here is my question: Which one of them 
is telling the truth?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, there is no contradiction. 
The government, like the mayor of Montreal, like the premier of 
Quebec, is saying that we are not after a referendum, but rather 
economic recovery. We are waiting for the premier of Quebec to 
come forward to work hand in hand with the Government of 
Canada to create jobs, which is something all Canadians, including 
Quebecers, are in need of.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would remind the Deputy Prime Minister that the mayor 
of Montreal himself said we should stop talking about partitioning 
Quebec. According to yesterday's throne speech, the federal 
government is willing to withdraw from job training, forestry, 
mining, and recreation, among other things. This is somewhat 
reminiscent of the Charlottetown accord, which was rejected by 
Quebecers and Canadians as a whole in 1992.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister 
admit that his proposal merely recycles part of the Charlottetown 
accord, which, as you may recall, was massively rejected by both 
Quebec and Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I think that, rather than 
doing something else, I will perhaps borrow from Claude Béland's 
analysis, according to which there has been enough 
decentralization to move forward, and Quebecers now have the 
powers they need to protect themselves. For several months, we 
have been asked to come up with programs. We proposed some 
innovative things, some new things with an open mind. All we ask 
from the opposition is some co-operation, precisely so we can go 
ahead with a plan that reflects Quebecers' real powers as described 
by Claude Béland.

	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, will the Deputy Prime Minister admit that her Prime 
Minister's proposal to withdraw immediately is nothing but smoke 
and mirrors, since the federal government will keep control over 
program policy and impose national standards? Let her give a real 
answer to this question if she can.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, yesterday, we showed 
how open-minded we are. For the first time, we proposed that the 
federal government not spend money in areas of exclusive 
provincial jurisdiction without the consent of the province 
concerned.
<P>
	We also proposed to enshrine Quebec's veto and status as a 
distinct society in the Constitution.
<P>
	These are specific demands that the Bloc Quebecois had made 
and I hope that, for once, the Bloc will be open-minded enough to 
work with us at building a better Canada.

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
yesterday's throne speech the government promised that 
``Canadians, no matter where they live, will have their say in the 
future of their country''.
<P>
	That is a big step forward for a government which shut out and 
shut up Canadians, even its own backbenchers, during the 
referendum campaign last fall.
<P>
	Like most things concerning national unity, there is a great deal 
of confusion in cabinet and in the whole caucus over what this 
strategy actually is, and what giving Canadians a say really means.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime 
Minister, the President of the Treasury Board, the Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration or the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs wherever he is. Will Canadians have a real say in the future 
of their country in a national, country-wide, binding referendum? 
Yes or no?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not surprised that the 
member is fixating on a particular issue.
<P>
	If she were listening to the people in her riding, I think she would 
hear them say that the real job of the government over the next 18 
months has to be getting Canadians back to work.
<P>
	We have provided a blueprint for economic reform. We have 
shown an openness to change. We believe that Canadians do not 
want more constitutional wrangling.  What they want is job 
creation. That is what we have delivered with the throne speech.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Exactly, Mr. 
Speaker. That is the point. Canadians want economic changes. 
They want to feel safer about it. They want to know that there is 
going to be a country here once the economy gets better. They want 
that security.
<P>
	They saw no tax relief, no tax reform in the speech from the 
throne yesterday. They are demanding a real say in the future of the 
country. They have ideas that are worth listening to on the 
economy, on areas of personal security and safety and on areas of 
national unity which seem to take up a fair bit of the throne speech.
<P>
	Is the government willing to bring Canadians in at the beginning 
of the unity process? Is it willing to listen to them truly? At the hind 
end of it, once all the plans are on the table, will the government 
say that it is giving the people the ultimate opportunity to say yes or 
no? At the end are these things going to make Canadians feel more 
secure? Will she commit to that, yes or no?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not want Canadians 
involved at the hind end. I want Canadians involved in the 
beginning. I want Canadians such as those I met last week on 
Signal Hill in Newfoundland who have pledged to do their bit to 
bring this country together, like the Canadians I met in Winnipeg 
who are fighting to keep this country together with innovation and 
new ideas. We want to listen to their ideas.
<P>
	We want to listen to the ideas of caucus members, like the 
member from Toronto who put together a plan to bring Canadians 
to see each other from coast to coast. We intend to involve 
Canadians in every step of the process of nation building.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the 
Deputy Prime Minister commits to having them involved in every 
stage of the process, it means that the government can do nothing 
less than have a national, binding referendum at the end once it gets 
going.
<P>
	I find this unbelievable. She talks about economic security. It is 
good to talk about but the track record of the government is such 
that it is not going to happen. Bringing people together is a great 
idea, except the Deputy Prime Minister said just the other day that 
we need to go back to the spirit of '67 and live it again.
<P>
	The year 1967 was a wonderful year but we are in 1996. We are

the uniqueness of my country. As a high school student I went to 
Expo'67. I saw the city of Montreal. I saw the francophone nature

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development, 
whom I congratulate on his appointment.
<P>
	In recent months, a wind of protest has been blowing across the 
country, even in the minister's own riding, against the so-called UI 
reform, which reduces benefits, limits access and penalizes young 
people, women and seasonal workers.
<P>
	In light of the deep concern expressed by so many people, 
including some of his own constituents, and of repeated requests 
from the vast coalition, in Quebec and Canada, against this UI 
reform and those who support it, notably the churches, does the 
minister undertake to withdraw and review his bill to ensure that 
the bill that will be tabled meet the expectations of Canadians and 
Quebecers?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for 
her question; indeed, it deals with a very important issue for people 
from coast to coast.
<P>
	We have heard time and time again that this reform hits some 
people harder than others. I wish to thank my predecessor who, 
before the House adjourned for the Christmas recess, had made a 
commitment to ensure that those provisions that cause the most 
concern, that is to say those setting the benefit amounts and the rule 
regarding the number of weeks of work, are amended.
<P>
	We must realize, and I hope my hon. colleague does, that the 
changes that need to be made to the whole UI plan are important 
and that they are supported by many people across the country.
<P>
	However, I fully agree with my hon. colleague that certain 
aspects should be reviewed. And because, during the past two 
months, all the hon. members of this House have had the 
opportunity to listen to what people are saying across the country, I 
hope that, once committee  work resumes, we will be able to put 
our heads together to resolve these thorny issues.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the thrust 
of this bill is to make cuts that will eventually amount to $2 billion. 
And unless changes are made, a great many people will suffer.
<P>
	Could the minister reassure the public, the men and women of 
my riding and his and every other riding in Canada, the ordinary 
people, by telling them today that those who have jobs and those 
who wish they did can rely on a real UI system, the one they are 
currently contributing to, wherever they live and regardless of their 
age?
<P>
<B>(1435)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can assure my hon. colleague 
and anyone who is concerned about this reform that we will be 
absolutely fair and we will try to ensure that access to the UI 
program always remains tied to the ability to find a job or to obtain 
training.
<P>
	I think that we can all agree that, try as we may to remedy the 
problems facing the jobless, the bottom line is that we really should 
find jobs for them.

Obviously that has not happened yet.
<P>
	Since 1989 Canadians have seen their disposable incomes fall by 
8.6 per cent. Leading up to the election campaign the current 
government made many promises about scrapping the GST, 
suggesting it was going to reverse that trend. That was what it 
suggested.
<P>
	However, yesterday in the throne speech it signalled that it has 
absolutely no intention of scrapping the GST. I would like to know 
from the finance minister why it is reneging on its promise.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
what was said in the throne speech is the exact wording, the exact 
spirit that was set out in the red book.
<P>
	It is our intention to harmonize the taxes. Clearly it is a request 
of thousands of consumers across this country and the vast majority 
of small and medium size businesses. This would give us a single 
tax with much more fairness and much greater ease of 
administration, which is our intention.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, maybe

Canadians want less taxes, not different taxes. I remind the finance

	Assuming the finance minister is a man of his word-I make that 
assumption-I ask him again why is he breaking his promise and 
not abolishing the GST?

	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question also 
is directed to the new Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	As we know, Quebec has been asking since 1965 that it be given 
full powers regarding manpower training. Yet, we learned this 
week that the new human resources development minister is giving 
himself three years to withdraw from this provincial area of 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	Why is the minister refusing to immediately give full powers to 
the Quebec government, when all the stakeholders from labour and 
management, the various community groups, and even provincial 
Liberals in Quebec support that demand?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I apologize for any 
misunderstanding which may have resulted from my discussions 
with the Quebec minister responsible for this matter. I fully agree 
with the hon. member that there is a consensus in Quebec regarding 
the manpower issue, but there is also the commitment made by the 
Prime Minister of Canada. That commitment was reflected in the 
second part of the UI legislation that was before Parliament at the 
time of prorogation.
<P>
	All I said, and I am repeating it, is that the act and the 
commitment made by the Prime Minister provided up to three 
years to withdraw from this area which, we all agree, should be 
transferred to the provinces.
<P>
	That being said, I usually do not take longer than is necessary to 
do what is required. Consequently, as soon as negotiations with 
Quebec and other interested Canadian provinces are completed, I 
will be pleased to give effect to the Prime Minister's commitment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
supplementary deals with a different but somewhat related issue. 
Will the minister confirm that manpower  training is part of the 
government's constitutional plan A and that the government is 
deliberately postponing its withdrawal from that area to extol the 
virtues of federalism in Quebec, at the expense of thousands of men 
and women, mostly young ones, waiting to get adequate training?

is for the justice minister.
<P>
	Canadians demand that the government address their concerns 
about personal security and they demand more than one measly 
paragraph in yesterday's throne speech. The immediate repeal of 
section 745 of the Criminal Code, which allows for the early 
release of first degree murderers, is one demand we are hearing 
from thousands of Canadians.
<P>
	Will the minister respond by removing section 745 from the 
Criminal Code and ensure that first degree murderers spend at least 
25 years in prison?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I urge the hon. member not to take 
the size of the paragraph in the throne speech as the measurement 
of the importance we attach to criminal justice issues.
<P>
	I would rather have the hon. member refer to the eight strong, 
separate pieces of legislation that have already been produced 
during this Parliament to strengthen the criminal justice system.
<P>
	I would rather have the hon. member bear in mind the important 
changes we brought to the sentencing process in the Criminal 
Code, to strengthen and toughen the responses in the Young 
Offenders Act to violent crime by young people, and to solid gun 
control. Those are the measures which make a difference.
<P>
	As to section 745, in Alberta a week and a half ago I met with 
Darlene Boyd, whose daughter was abducted and murdered some 
15 years ago. I spoke with her, as I have with so many other 
survivors of victims of murder about their concerns with section 
745. We have already made changes and are considering others to 
make sure this section fulfils at once the interests of victims and 
humanity in the justice system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the justice 
minister can show the people of Canada he is serious about the 
things he speaks about by the simple removal of this section from 
the Criminal Code, but he refuses to.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="39"> 39 </A></B>
<P>
	The prime suspects in the murder of Melanie Carpenter and 
Mrs. Salter from Edmonton were out on early release. The throne 
speech gave Canadians no reassurance that the early release of 
violent offenders will stop.
<P>
	I ask the Minister of Justice if he will introduce legislation to 
eliminate immediately the statutory release of offenders which has 
allowed these atrocities to take place.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is regrettable that in subjects that 
require certain rational analysis the hon. member resorts to a 
combination of oversimplification and distortion.
<P>
	No one released from prison under section 745 to date has been 
implicated in a crime of personal violence. Second, the suspect in 
the Melanie Carpenter case was not released under section 745, but 
was on parole for other offences.
<P>
	Third, we do not share the oversimplified view of the hon. 
member that the answer lies in scrapping the entire provision. That 
is one possible approach which we are considering. We also believe 
we should look at ways to improve the section and limit it to the 
exceptional cases for which it is intended so that we can achieve the 
dual objectives of protecting the public, including victims, and 
showing humanity in the system of justice.

	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	Last year, the government adopted a plan to promote gender 
equality. Among other things, that plan provided for a review of 
policies, in terms of their impact on gender equality. As we know, 
there is a major imbalance in the number of temporary and seasonal 
jobs held by men and women.
<P>
	Could the minister tell us about the results of the review 
conducted under that plan?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the question raised by the hon. 
member is a very important one. We are trying to apply, as a result 
of a lot of interest having been exhibited by individuals and groups 
very interested in this question, criteria to all of the programs we 
are considering as to what the impact would be in terms of equality 
across not just gender lines but also different age groups.
<P>
<B>(1445 )</B>
<P>
	It is an extremely complex question. Although significant work 
has been done on it, I can only advise the hon. member that I am 
looking forward to discussing the matter with colleagues from 
around the world, members of the OECD countries. The capacity to 
analyze the impact through a variety of programs which we have 
the responsibility of administering is extremely difficult. I do not 
want to suggest in any way that we are delaying what we would like 
to achieve.
<P>
	For example, I look forward to the parliamentary committee's 
being able to give us some direction on how we can address this 
extremely important question

	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, could

parliamentary committee meets again and reviews the legislation 
formerly known as Bill C-111 we can show why we feel it is 
essential to change certain aspects of the proposed legislation, 
precisely because the impact of that legislation on some sectors and 
groups was not acceptable.
<P>
	Those who will closely follow this issue will realize that the 
changes that we think we can make will correct, at least to some 
extent, a problem which has been in existence for a long time and 
which could not be solved by the bill. We intend to continue to

promised to restore economic prosperity and the confidence of 
Canadians.

the policies of the government have not failed to work.

surplus for the country and retail sales are showing an

they be so pessimistic?
<P>
	Canadians are likely to become even more pessimistic when they 
find out the throne speech has shifted the emphasis away from 
needed deficit elimination to costly subsidies and ineffective direct 
job creation programs.
<P>
	Does this shift in the financial priorities of the Liberals signal a 
return to traditional policies in a prebudget mode of damn the 
deficit and future generations, full steam ahead, getting re-elected 
at all costs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the throne speech reaffirmed the policies the government has 
undertaken since it took office, the policies set out in the red book. 
Those policies are a measured pace of deficit reduction that is 
giving us better results than almost any other industrial country. It 
is  giving us the policies that will give us a framework for growth 
and jobs in terms of newer technologies, in terms of support from 
small and medium size business and in terms of our exports.
<P>
	I am sure it was a misstep or a misquote by the hon. member. The

	This week it was made public on the Radio-Canada program 
``Enjeux'' that, in 1992, a special Canadian forces unit simulated a 
terrorist attack on the Citadel in Quebec City in order to test its

during this exercise, a tragic outcome was avoided by only a hair's 
breadth.

justify the fact that the senior officers who authorized them are not

been promoted since then?

military police investigation was launched and measures were 
taken by the military in terms of disciplining some of the people 
involved.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday in the throne speech the government talked about how it 
hoped there will be jobs for Canadians.
<P>
	In the upcoming budget the minister may be putting at risk the 
viability of the mining industry by discussing tax increases, 
changes to the resource allowance, that will have the effect of 
raising that industry's tax rate by up to 10 per cent.
<P>
	Will the minister promise the House that any changes to the 
resource allowance will be revenue neutral, thereby assuring the 
mining industry that it will be able to provide the jobs Canadians 
are demanding?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
having just announced the date of the budget I am sure the hon. 
member understands that I will wait until the budget is brought 
down before giving any indication of whatever kind of measures 
the government intends to bring in.
<P>
	On the other hand, I can assure the hon. member the Minister of 
Natural Resources takes her job very seriously. She has certainly 
made her views known to the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do 
not know if that is reassuring or not. What we need assurance of 
from the government is that its idea of tax fairness is not to tax and 
gouge everyone equally.
<P>
	Since he took power, this minister has increased taxes in each of 
his budgets. The resource industries need to know that this resource 
allowance will be revenue neutral.
<P>
	Can the minister assure the industry today that whatever changes 
he makes will be revenue neutral, and that the industry can go 
ahead and create the jobs Canadians want?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have already answered the hon. member's question. He knows that 
I am not going to reveal the budget piecemeal, that I am not going 
to answer his question today.
<P>
	I really wonder why he finds it so necessary to create strawmen, 
to create fears. Is he playing politics? I would find that absolutely 
unspeakable behaviour.

	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I hope we 
never see politics in the House of Commons ever again.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Finance indicated that he 
is going to introduce his budget next Wednesday. Since he has been 
consistent in setting targets for deficit reduction and for the rate of 
inflation, would the minister give some consideration in the 
upcoming budget to setting targets for job creation for the first time 
so that we could have a goal to work toward?
<P>
	Also, would he call on the corporate sector now to begin playing 
its role in becoming more responsible in creating jobs and getting 
Canadians back to work?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if 
you look at the record of job creation since the government took 
office, it is close to 600,000 jobs. It really demonstrates that the 
government would prefer to be judged by its actions rather than by 
predictions at some far flung date.
<P>
	In terms of challenging the private sector I believe the member's 
point is very very well taken. In the throne speech yesterday, the 
government indicated very clearly that as the Canadian people are 
in the process of cleaning up the national balance sheet and as a 
number of provinces are doing the same, there is no doubt the hon. 
member is right. The time has come for the Canadian corporate 
sector to do its share.

of the day I have received notice of two questions of privilege. The 
first one is from the hon. member for Beaver River.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SFTCOMMUNICATIONSBRIEFINGBOOK">SFT COMMUNICATIONS BRIEFING BOOK</A></H4>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
point out something which happened today that violated my rights 
and privileges as a member of Parliament.
<P>
	Joseph Maingot's <I>Parliamentary Privilege in Canada</I> states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When any of these rights and immunities, which are known under the general 
name of privileges, are disregarded or attacked by any individual or authority, 
the offence is called a breach of privilege and is punishable under the law of 
Parliament.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Yesterday I was handed a copy of a document entitled ``SFT 
Communications Briefing Book''. There was no author. There was 
no copyright, no confidential wording on it at all.
<P>
	As caucus chairman, I sent my staff to Printing this morning and 
ordered 60 copies of it for our caucus, for our research staff and for 
the press. I got a call later in the day saying that a Mr. Simpson in 
the Prime Minister's office told Printing not to reproduce or release 
copies to anyone except Liberal MPs.
<P>
	After caucus, I immediately called Mr. Simpson in the PMO and 
asked the reason for this ridiculous action. He said that someone in 
the Prime Minister's office had told Printing not to go ahead with 
my request and not to release the 48 copies that had already been 
run off. Mr. Simpson said that he did not know who gave the edict 
to deny my rightful request, but someone would get back to me.
<P>
	At 1.10 p.m., just before question period, I received a call from 
Printing saying that there was a mix-up and my job would be 
delivered to my office. And it was.
<P>
	I had also been requested some time during the morning to 
provide a copy of my ``With compliments of Deborah Grey'' slip to 
be reproduced with the document. Had I wanted that on there, I 
certainly would have sent it on to Printing. I did not send it down 
and it went ahead.
<P>
	When I make a request of Printing, I make the request hoping it 
will-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I must tell the hon. member that I was briefed on 
this matter before question period by my staff. The error that 
occurred was the fault of the House staff, therefore my staff.
<P>
	This has been corrected. We regret any inconvenience. We are 
glad that this matter has been cleared up. I assure the hon. member 
that we do not take our direction from anyone else. It was an error 
on the part of the House staff.
<P>
	As the spokesperson for the House staff, I apologize for it. I am 
glad that it has been cleared up. I do not believe that there is any 
need for a question of privilege to pursue this matter. I believe that 
I have been fully briefed. I believe this is the answer. I have looked 
into it. I wish to assure the member of that.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="APPOINTMENTOFASSISTANTDEPUTYCHAIRMANOFCOMMITTEESOFTHEWHOLE">APPOINTMENT OF ASSISTANT DEPUTY CHAIRMANOF COMMITTEES OF THE WHOLE</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a 
question of privilege of considerable importance. As members well 
know, a prime facie question of privilege arises when the rights of 
this House are transgressed, breached or usurped. What I raise is 
clearly a prime facie question of privilege.
<P>
	I refer the Chair to Standing Order 8:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>At the commencement of every session, or from time to time as necessity may 
arise, the House may appoint a Deputy Chairman of Committees of the Whole 
and also an Assistant Deputy Chairman of Committees of the Whole-</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1510 )</B>
<P>
	The phrase relevant to privilege and rights of the House is ``the 
House may appoint''.
<P>
	A press release dated February 26 on the letterhead of the Prime 
Minister's office reads: ``Prime Minister appoints''-and then the 
name of the member for Madawaska-Victoria-``as Assistant 
Deputy Chairman of Committees of the Whole''.
<P>
	Standing Order 8 is clear. This appointment is the right of the 
House as a whole, yet the Prime Minister has claimed the 
appointment as a power of his office. I contend that the Prime 
Minister has usurped and interfered with a vote of the House on this 
appointment, making and declaring the appointment as a fait 
accompli.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, if you find this to be a prima facie question of 
privilege I will move the appropriate motion to have it referred to 
the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs for 
deliberation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first, I think you will have recognized that this is not a 
question of privilege. Perhaps the member could argue that it is a 
breach of the standing orders but it would not be that either, 
although it would be the relevant thing for him to have raised.
<P>
	Second, this issue is presently awaiting a vote of the House. 
Deliberation on it by the House has concluded and the vote will 
take place later this day. Therefore I would argue that the Chair 
cannot even entertain the point in question had it been raised as a 
point of order which it was not. It was raised as a question of 
privilege.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="44"> 44 </A></B>
<P>
	Finally, I am sure the House knows that when the Prime 
Minister proposes the name of a candidate he does so on behalf 
of the majority of MPs in the House of Commons, those MPs 
being the supporters of the Prime Minister and the government. 
In any case, the point will become moot by the end of this day 
once the issue is voted on.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, I understand that after this 
announcement was put out there was a clarification within 24 
hours. We would hope this type of thing would not cause any 
inconvenience. I would rule that this is, in this case, not a question 
of privilege.

ruling here. However, I want to ask a very definite question of you, 
Mr. Speaker. I would like to know about censorship of individual 
members and I want to know about a breach of confidentiality. 
When I send something to Printing why in heaven's name is 
someone from the PMO or the Speaker's office even wondering 
what is in that document?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I well understand that the member raises this as a 
point of clarification. However, I thought I had explained the issue. 
I believe it was a series of compounded errors. It is the 
responsibility of the staff who answer to me. This type of thing will 
not happen again. I take full responsibility. No one is going to be 
able to censor what members of Parliament get or what they ask for 
if that is the clarification the member wants.

point of order regarding the question raised by the hon. member for 
Beaver River. I understand that you have settled the issue by saying 
that it was a mistake on the part of your staff, who refused to print 
the document. But the real question is this: are we to understand 
that there are people at the printing shop who make it their business 
to communicate to the Prime Minister's Office all the documents 
that members send over to the printing shop to have them printed?

something that was done, but that will no longer be done. It was a

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
think all of us would acknowledge that this is a difficult time for 
our country given the problems we have experienced with respect 
to national unity, et cetera. I think all Canadians would want to 
know that in the House of Commons as wide a spectrum of views 
as possible generated by them through elections and the electoral 
process is expressed. In view of this, I rise on a point of order to 
seek the unanimous consent of the House that following the 
spokespersons of the three official parties in the House in the 
address in reply to the speech from the throne that a representative 
of the New sDemocratic Party be allowed to speak. With a view to 
increasing the representativeness of the House at this difficult time, 
I think everyone should be heard.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	I ask that we be allowed to be heard after the first three speakers.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on 
the same point of order. In fact in the same spirit that my colleague 
made his comments and in the same spirit that we heard comments 
from representatives of the Reform Party yesterday on the issue of 
fairness, I rise today to ask the same consent.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Today is the day when the leaders will have an opportunity to 
reply to the speech from the throne. There was a lot said about 
national unity in yesterday's speech, and you certainly know that 
last November, when we-the New Democrats and the 
Conservatives-tried to take part in the debate on the distinct 
society resolution, we were denied unanimous consent by the 
opposition parties, namely the Bloc and Reform.
<P>
	Since that time, and I will be very brief here, I am happy to say 
that the present leader of the Bloc Quebecois has promised publicly 
on the radio in Sherbrooke to see to it that the leader of the 
Conservative Party has the opportunity to speak more often in the 
House of Commons. Therefore, it is in that spirit that we are now 
asking the consent of the House to have an opportunity to reply 
today to the speech from the throne.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, as far as the government is 
concerned, we would be willing to allow a twenty minute period to 
each party, as was requested, for speeches. We will pleased, for our 
part anyway, to accept this request.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, we stood in the House during the 
last session to explain that judgments were made on this question 
following the arguments put  forward by NDP and Conservative 
members at the time. I believe that the same judgment must be 
made today. We will not give our consent, and the leader of the 
Bloc Quebecois explained, or tried to explain, to the leader of the 
Conservative Party that if he wanted to take part in the debate, there 
was an essential condition: he had to be here more often.
<P>

Mr. Speaker, as a member of Parliament I am sure that I have made 
errors and staff members have made mistakes.
<P>
	I want a ruling from you, Mr. Speaker. The fact that someone 
makes a mistake, does that exempt it from being a breach of a 
member's privilege? I would like clarification from the Chair. Is an 
honest mistake or a dishonest mistake not cause or not eligible to 
be a breach of privilege?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I have already ruled on this particular matter but I 
would invite the hon. member if he would like to pursue the 
conversation with me to do so in my chambers, as I would any 
other members on this particular issue.

House leader has extended a letter to me. I intend to follow that up 
and look at possible ways we can facilitate his involvement in the 
House.
<P>
	I would also like to say to the leader of the Progressive 
Conservative Party that my leader extended an invitation to him to 
discuss how he could participate in the House in a further way and 
he rejected that offer. That offer was rejected so why should I open

<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today will be my first speech in this House as the new 
Leader of the Official Opposition. I imagine hon. members will be 
interested to know where the member for Roberval will be coming 
from.
<P>
	Let me reassure the House, first of all, that I intend to continue 
the tradition of respect and deference for the institution. Above all 
else, we in the official opposition want to contribute towards 
raising the level of the debate. We look forward to a debate that is 
calm and respectful of the rules of this House, in the same 
democratic spirit that has always characterized the Bloc Quebecois, 
even when addressing its fundamental opposition to this country. 
We expect and look forward to seeing the same respect and a 
similar spirit among our colleagues opposite and of course among 
the members of the third party.
<P>
	I may add that while we will undoubtedly represent the interests 
of Quebec, we also intend to promote and defend the interests of 
Canada as a whole, as we have done for the past two years. We will 
do this systematically, case by case. In other words, although 
mindful of our roots, we are the official opposition and we 
willingly accept a role that goes well beyond the party line.
<P>
	Yesterday when we heard the speech from the throne read by the 
Governor General of Canada, we had the distinct impression the 
government does not realize something has changed profoundly in 
Canada since the Quebec referendum on October 30.
<P>
	Since then, the final outcome of that battle has led many 
Canadians to see the sovereignty of Quebec as inevitable. The 
reactions of Canadians to that event were at times diametrically 
opposed to those of their leaders.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	We saw our English speaking fellow citizens getting together to 
form new interest groups such as Dialogue Canada, British 
Columbians for Canada, Canadians Together and Civitas Canada.
<P>
	Their members meet to discuss ways to define a new Canada, 
often without Quebec. The reactions of political leaders, however, 
have been immature and sometimes inconsistent. Verbal overkill 
and aggressive language have reached heights never equalled in the 
history of a country that has enjoyed such a long tradition of  
democracy. We saw ministers contradict each other, even today. We 
even heard a new Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs mention 
the partition of Quebec as a possibility.
<P>
	We saw a good example of the conciliatory approach in a recent 
statement by Ovide Mercredi, the Chief of the First Nations, who in 
no uncertain terms condemned the remarks of the Minister of 
Indian Affairs, and I quote:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
``The minister of Indian affairs does not speak for the Indian people 
when he raises the spectre of violence. I take great exception to 
that. He had no business to heighten the tension between us and the 
people of Quebec''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	At the same time he launched an appeal for a dialogue with 
Quebecers and the government of Quebec. That is the kind of 
consistent approach this government has sadly lacked during the 
past few weeks.
<P>
	However, one would expect our leaders to set a premium on 
wisdom and calm, especially the Prime Minister, who now seems 
unable to control either his ministers or his own actions. We on this 
side of the House draw some consolation from the fact that English 
Canada does not resemble its leaders and has shown it understands 
what is really at stake: the need for coexistence of the two peoples.
<P>
	The inevitability of Quebec's sovereignty is only a first step. For 
us in the Bloc Quebecois, sovereignty is as unavoidable as 
partnership is desirable in the interests of Canada and Quebec. We 
know that partnership implies respect for the other partner and it is 
that new wisdom we would like to see demonstrated on the part of 
the government.

	Sovereignty and partnership are both part of the same equation 
and part and parcel of the strategy of the Bloc Quebecois. 
Meanwhile, we have a mandate to defend the interests of Quebec 
and condemn the inequities and injustices that are often its lot. We 
must not forget it was the exercise of democracy that made the Bloc 
Quebecois the official opposition, a status we fully intend to keep.

recognize that federalism cannot be changed?

<P>
	Stéphane Dion said not long ago that the Massé Committee had 
A and B plans to deal with the problem of Quebec. Is he not aware 
of all the commissions and committees we had in the past: 
Laurendeau-Dunton, Pepin-Robarts, Charest-Spicer, 
Castonguay-Dobbie, Beaudoin-Dobbie, Beaudoin-Edwards? The 
federalists have had as many plans as there are letters in the 
alphabet. The real solution, the longlasting solution, the real plan is 
sovereignty for Quebec with an offer of partnership.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Following the referendum result, we have to wonder at the 
attitude of the Prime Minister of Canada. He has knowingly kept 
Canadians in ignorance of what is happening in Quebec; the 
increase in the number of sovereignty supporters caused in part by 
the dissatisfaction of Quebecers. With the federal government 
policies this very significant phenomenon has been concealed by 
the Prime Minister.

	This refusal to explain the situation clearly to Canadians during 
the referendum campaign largely explains English Canada's 
reactions now.
<P>
	The Prime Minister acted like nothing had happened in this 
country in the past 15 years, as if he himself had not had a major 
role in the course of events. He is, however, an integral part of 
Canada's problem; he seems to have forgotten that. Maybe he was 
not involved in the unilateral patriation of 1982. But he was one of 
the signatories as we well know. Maybe he did not speak out on the 
Meech Lake accord, but he was one of those who helped bury it. 
Maybe he played no part in the Charlottetown referendum; except 
that we know he did everything possible to reduce Quebec's share 
in this agreement, which was rejected. And, while we are at it, 
maybe there was no referendum in Quebec. Maybe the surveys are 
not indicating that support for sovereignty continues to rise.
<P>
	This irresponsible attitude coupled with the deplorable 
prevarication so ably exemplified by the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage in her remark to the effect that it was the fault of the 
separatists that the unemployed were demonstrating all across the 
country. Any unemployed individual in the Prime Minister's way 
deserves to be grabbed by the throat, as are all the unemployed as 
the result of the minister's reform. In any case, it is always the fault 
of the separatists, and for the Deputy Prime Minister this justifies 
all actions.
<P>
	We can only hope that cabinet pulls itself together and returns to 
an analysis of the situation that considers what is really going on.
<P>
	Until Quebec becomes sovereign, we will play by the rules, 
especially because it is our best interest to have our future partner 
in optimum political and economic health. The fact that Canada's 
economic health is of concern to us is in large measure due to the 
actions of the present government, which, in 1993, made firm and 
specific commitments it subsequently failed to keep for the most 
part. Had it done so, our economy would have grown, but it did not. 
Two years later, let us have a look at what the government did with 
its own commitments, those in the red book and those in the first 
throne speech.
<P>
	Quebecers and Canadians thought there was hope when the 
Liberals undertook in their red book to, and I quote, 
``-redistribute opportunity more broadly so that many more 
people have a decent standard of living and can build good lives for 
themselves and their families, allowing them to live with dignity 
and respect-''. Yet, with the first Liberal budget, barely a few 
months after an electoral campaign waxing passionately over the 
disadvantaged, our fellow citizens were blown away.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance announced up front that he was going to 
cut $5.6 billion from the unemployment insurance program. Last 
fall, he added to that by introducing into this House Bill C-111, 
commonly and cynically known as the employment insurance bill. 
It too provides for major cuts in funding to those who are or could 
become the victims of this scourge of underemployment.
<P>
	Never once, during the electoral campaign, in the fall of 1993, or 
in the speech from the throne was there any hint that the fight 
against the deficit would involve humiliating those in need, who 
are trying desperately to avoid abject poverty.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	Quebecers and Canadians did not suspect that, when the 
government said it wanted to achieve sustained economic growth 
by counting on human resources, it meant that it would, through 
Bill C-111, launch an attack against the unemployed now and in the 
future, as no Canadian is immune from this plague.
<P>
	No one suspected that Quebecers and Canadians would face a 
substantial increase in the number of weeks of work required to 
qualify for benefits, that this government would drastically reduce 
the level of benefits, or that it would force tens of thousands of 
households onto welfare in the next three years.
<P>
	This government did not make a commitment to attack women. 
Yet, women are the big losers of this reform. It did not make a 
commitment to rob the UI fund-to which the federal government 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="48"> 48 </A></B>
<P>
stopped contributing several years ago-of its annual $5 billion 
surplus, which  comes solely from worker and employer 
contributions. Yet, that is what it has done.
<P>
	Few people would have believed that the Liberals who solemnly 
rose in this House to condemn the Tories' actions would do worse 
in two years than their predecessors did over two mandates. It is 
certainly not on that basis that the Liberals gained the trust of 
Canadians in October 1993.
<P>
	As for the commitment to keep the deficit under control through 
sound management of government finances, we are far from it. 
They are reducing the deficit mostly by unscrupulously using UI 
fund surpluses and by cutting $7 billion from transfers to the 
provinces for health, post-secondary eduction and social 
assistance. In Quebec alone, these drastic cuts will translate into an 
additional tax burden of $650 million in 1996-97 and a $1.2 to $2 
billion shortfall in 1997-98, depending on how the cuts will be 
distributed. If it is done based on the population, Quebec alone will 
sustain 40 per cent of all cuts.
<P>
	On October 20, 1993, during an interview on the television 
program ``Canada AM'', the current Prime Minister had this to say 
about transfers to the provinces, and I quote:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
``We said in our platform we do not intend to reduce the transfer 
payments. What I said in the program, and I intend to keep my 
word, is we do not intend to cut further''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In fact, budget targets are not pursued through sound 
management but by cutting benefits to the unemployed and 
transfers to the provinces.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance's commitment is to limit debt growth. 
Our debt will exceed $600 billion this year.
<P>
	As far as employment is concerned, the promises made to 
Canadians and Quebecers have not been kept, although the Liberals 
had made it the cornerstone of their election platform. But what 
really happened on the labour market, while Quebecers and 
Canadians were hearing that tune ad nauseam? Decline and 
stagnation.
<P>
	Our economic difficulties have had serious consequences on the 
employment situation. In the last 12 months, only 120,000 new 
jobs have been created in Canada, almost four times less than the 
year before. Not only was employment stagnant, but participation 
in the labour force dropped. This situation cannot be tolerated in 
the long term, because it would impoverish the entire population.
<P>
	In fact, Canada's unemployment rate has not budged and, if we 
take into account the reduction in the labour force participation 
rate, it has even risen by half a point. It is not the federal 
government but exports that drive the economy and keep it from 
sinking into a recession.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	As for Montreal, the Liberal government did nothing to improve 
the situation in that area and to prevent one of the worst 
employment crises in its history. What did the government do to 
help Montreal restructure its economy? Nothing, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	Two years after the Liberals came to power, the people of 
Montreal are still waiting. In light of this neglectful attitude, is it 
any wonder that the greater Montreal area, which was to be the 
driving force of the Quebec economy, has the highest 
unemployment rate of any major urban centre in North America, or 
10.1 per cent? That is unacceptable.
<P>
	Is it any wonder that the labour force participation rate has 
dropped from 67 per cent to 63 per cent since 1989? This means 
that four per cent of the labour force, or 40,000 people, have given 
up all hope of finding a job. They do not even show up in official 
unemployment statistics any more, but they remain jobless, 
discouraged and underemployed, and are gradually being dragged 
into the vicious circle of poverty.
<P>
	If you include those who have stopped actively seeking work 
since 1989 because they have given up hope, the unemployment 
rate in the Montreal area actually rises from 10.1 to 15 per cent. 
What is the federal government doing about that? Absolutely 
nothing. This is one more promise the Liberals have broken.
<P>
	What has become of the promise to eliminate the GST? We will 
recall that the red book stated, on page 20, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-the GST undermined public confidence in the fairness of the tax system.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The GST has lengthened and deepened the recession. It is costly for small 
business to administer and very expensive for the government to collect.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	What did this government do? Nothing. What did the 
government do in 1993-94 to collect $6.6 billion in unpaid taxes? 
Nothing, or almost nothing. Only $250 million was collected on 
$6.6 billion in unpaid taxes. A mere $250 million amounts to 
almost nothing in that case.
<P>
	Also, what has become of the fairer tax system we were 
promised? We will come back to it later because this is a very 
important issue that needs to be discussed further.
<P>
	As for culture, we would have expected such a significant vote 
for a sovereignist party to bring about a more open-minded attitude 
toward the people and culture of Quebec. What did the government 
do about that? Nothing. The Canadian heritage legislation totally 
overlooked the existence of a Quebec culture.
<P>
	The Liberals promised $1 billion would be earmarked for the 
science and technology policy. God knows how important it is to 
invest in that area, for the future of the  Canadian economy and our 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="49"> 49 </A></B>
<P>
ability to create good steady jobs. We are still waiting. Nothing has 
been done.
<P>
	The list goes on and, while listing all the promises this 
government has not kept during the first part of its mandate is 
certainly tedious, it is nevertheless necessary in order to see the 
extent to which they failed to honour their commitments. 
Canadians deserve to know where they stand in this regard.
<P>
	The January 18, 1994, throne speech read in part, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>On October 25, 1993, Canadians chose a new Parliament and a new 
government. The Government has made a number of commitments to the people 
of Canada. They will be implemented.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is what the last throne speech said, yet the list of 
commitments that were not fulfilled appears endless.
<P>
	How can the people of Quebec and Canada believe in the 
policies and commitments set out in this speech from the throne? 
How could they be expected to trust a government that trampled 
most of its commitments underfoot? That was the government's 
record of unfulfilled undertakings.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	Yet, some things needed to be done in the last two years. We kept 
saying that, to put our fiscal house in order, a tax reform was 
necessary, particularly as regards tax expenditures, which include 
all the exemptions granted to individuals and businesses.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, do you know that, in a December 1993 document 
on tax expenditures, the Department of Finance listed 288 tax 
exemptions available to businesses? The department candidly 
admitted that 176 of these exemptions cost over $17 billion, adding 
that it did not know the dollar figure for the other 112 exemptions. 
This is unbelievable. And what has the government done since? 
Absolutely nothing.
<P>
	The lack of accurate information on tax expenditures compels us 
to demand that a review and a reform of the taxation system be 
undertaken. In fact, we suggested that even before this 
comprehensive reform the government should set a minimum tax 
on corporations' profits, not to unduly increase their tax burden, 
but to ensure that each and everyone of them makes a contribution 
to the Treasury.
<P>
	Last December, the International Monetary Fund, which is not 
recognized for its social-democratic convictions, proved the Bloc 
Quebecois right as regards corporate taxation. The December 8 
issue of <I>La Presse</I> provided a summary of the IMF report, which 
made a comparison between Canada and the other OECD 
countries. The article read: ``Corporate taxation represents a 
smaller proportion of the GDP in Canada. This leads us to believe 
that it may be possible to reduce some of the tax benefits granted to 
companies''.
<P>
	Let me also say that, under my leadership, tax reform will be, in 
1996, the official opposition's main target as regards public 
finances. We do not seek to impose an unfair tax burden on 
businesses. We simply want them to pay their fair share. Corporate 
income tax now accounts for a smaller proportion of the federal 
government's tax levy, while the contribution made by individual 
taxpayers has increased.
<P>
	This means that the government is overburdening the middle 
classes with taxes, while also targeting the poor in order to reduce 
its deficit. This does not make sense. Contrary to what was said in 
yesterday's speech, this lack of compassion for the poor is, in the 
case of this government, also accompanied by a tax avoidance 
policy that benefits the most powerful people, this at a time when 
major companies are reporting record profits and laying off people.
<P>
	The government's approach, which is patterned on what is being 
done abroad, protects the corporate tax system in the hope that 
large corporations will create jobs. But the fact is that, while profits 
are increasing, jobs are disappearing.
<P>
	GM Canada reported record profits of $1.39 billion, while at the 
same time laying off 2,500 employees. Total profits for the five 
major banks reached $4.9 billion, but 2,800 jobs were cut. In 1995, 
Bell Canada recorded profits of $502 million, but also eliminated 
3,200 jobs, this in addition to the 8,000 already lost since 1990. 
Petro-Canada's profits totalled $196 million in 1995, but the 
company eliminated 564 jobs.
<P>
	In conclusion, the time has come for the government to review 
its analyses and its priorities, so as to ensure that all businesses do 
their share as regards taxation and job creation. We have no choice 
but to say that, in this regard, the Liberal Party's economic program 
is a dismal failure.
<P>
	Unfortunately, in light of yesterday's speech from the throne, the 
government seems to be deliberately pursuing a tax avoidance 
policy which benefits large corporations and which even condones 
such practices as the use of tax havens, practices that are 
questionable, to say the least.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	In the July 1995 issue of the trade journal of the Canadian 
chartered accountants-not so long ago-it was recognized that 
almost all of the major multinational corporations of Canada used 
foreign affiliates as part of their financial strategy.
<P>
	In plain language, one could say that a Canadian corporation that 
operates a foreign affiliate under certain conditions can practically 
get away with paying almost no tax on the profits its affiliate made 
outside of Canada. However, we do have a few indicators that give 
us an idea of the amount of tax revenue that can be lost this way. 
The auditor general told us that, according to the most recent 
statistics, Canadian companies invest billions of  dollars in 
non-resident corporations and that these corporations have 
received 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="50"> 50 </A></B>
<P>
hundreds of millions of dollars in dividends they do not have to 
report.
<P>
	These tax havens, which are well known to the financial 
establishment, have very nice names like Barbados, Cyprus, 
Ireland, Liberia, the Caiman Islands et even Switzerland.
<P>
	Tax havens have never been so popular. Here are some figures I 
hope the Prime Minister and the government will take time to 
consider.
<P>
	According to International Privacy Corporation, a company 
specializing in tax havens, it deals with hundreds of Canadian 
clients. Moreover, of the 16,000 companies incorporated in Turks 
and Caicos, the majority belong to Canadian interests. Hundreds 
and hundreds of millions of dollars have been invested outside 
Canada.
<P>
	A few years back, the tax section of the Harris &amp; Harris law firm, 
in Toronto, had 30 to 40 client companies set up for tax avoidance 
purposes. It now has more than 300.
<P>
	Interestingly enough, of the 119 branches of the six major 
Canadian banks, 57 are operating in the West Indies, in the Cayman 
Islands. Over there, they have 28,000 corporations for 30,000 
inhabitants. The number of companies increases by 4,000 every 
year.
<P>
	Under these circumstances, the Minister of Finance could have a 
more balanced tax policy and go easy with cuts to the Canada 
assistance plan and established program financing. He could show 
some compassion, let the unemployed and the welfare recipients 
breathe a little easier and go after the right targets.
<P>
	In 1996, in what the United Nations call the International 
Anti-Poverty Year, it is deplorable that the federal government 
chooses to go after the poor instead of tackling poverty. Given the 
employment crisis, this is not a good time to reduce the deficit by 
cutting programs for the unemployed, especially since there is a 
surplus in the unemployment insurance fund.
<P>
	As for the shortage of jobs, the performance of the Liberals has 
been worse than that of the Conservatives. The rates under the 
Liberal government are worse than what we saw under the 
Conservatives. This same Liberal government has tried in almost 
every way to show its interest in the jobless and its commitment to 
job creation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	At the end of 1995 the major Canadian urban centres, Montreal, 
Toronto and Vancouver, had unemployment rates higher than that 
of the large American cities.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The situation in Canada is worse than anywhere else in North 
America. The deficit shovelling into the provinces' backyards, 
undertaken by the Conservatives  and carried on by the Liberals, 
has led to an increase in welfare recipients. The number of welfare 
recipients in Canada went up by 800,000 between 1990 and 1994, 
an increase of 35 per cent. In Ontario, their number rose by 45 per 
cent over the last five years. To make matters worse, provinces 
have had to cut benefits because the federal government has 
reduced its transfer payments. In 1993, the Liberal Party promised 
to give Canadians the dignity of a job. Can you imagine that, Mr. 
Speaker.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	What it did, really, is introduce a new poverty culture. In 1980, 
16 per cent of Canadians were below the low income cut off. In 
1994, 17.1 of them were, and that is more than 5 million people. 
Not only is poverty not declining, but the gap between the rich and 
the poor is getting wider.
<P>
	There is no improvement in sight either for those most in need, 
that is single parent women. In 1994, 56.4 per cent of them were 
below the low income cut off, a percentage that has not fluctuated 
for years.
<P>
	As if things were not bad enough, Statistics Canada reported on 
January 24 that poverty is a status that is hereditary. Those who are 
poor have every chance of staying poor.
<P>
	The feature that used to set Canada and the U.S. apart, that is our 
safety net, is collapsing. More and more, in both countries, poverty 
breeds poverty and wealth breeds wealth, and the middle class in 
slowly but surely sinking into poverty.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois does not oppose social program reform. 
Indeed, it repeatedly reaffirmed that all social programs should be 
modernized, and adjusted to our way of life, to the labour market 
and to the economy of the 1990s.
<P>
	The government has to acknowledge the consensus that has 
emerged in Quebec that it should be the sole policy maker as far as 
manpower and occupational training are concerned. This means 
that Quebec must regain control and administration of employment 
and manpower services. These matters should be under Quebec 
jurisdiction, unconditionally. I certainly hope the federal 
government will finally understand that.
<P>
	That is why the official opposition asks the government to do its 
homework, and not reinstate Bill C-111. We think this bill is unjust, 
regressive, detrimental to jobs and a source of poverty. Let the 
government drop that bill.
<P>
	Instead of cutting social programs, the Minister of Finance 
should turn to the national defence budget. There, he would find 
plenty of savings to be made. For example, the government should 
give up this idea of buying or leasing, at any price, submarines it 
has never been proven we need; it should replace only a limited 
number of shipborne helicopters and it should not insist  on 
submarine warfare capability for them. In the current state of world 
affairs, it is a luxury we cannot afford. We could have saved $2 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="51"> 51 </A></B>
<P>
billion by not ordering the new armoured vehicles. That purchase 
was never really justified. And what about the 1,600 new anti-tank 
missiles, ordered at a cost of $23.6 million in an overall weapons 
acquisition program of $230 million. These are expenditures a 
government that respects its citizens could reconsider instead of 
cutting benefits to the unemployed.
<P>
	Instead of taking money away from the unemployed and the 
welfare recipients, the government should review its strategy, 
impose a moratorium on new purchases, and allow its acquisition 
projects to be debated in the House so that members of Parliament 
can discuss them and indicate to Canadians why the government 
should stop pouring their money into projects of dubious 
importance.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	In foreign affairs, the Liberal Party has, in the last two years, put 
an end to the very old Canadian tradition of giving top priority to 
human rights.
<P>
	The new foreign policy statement ``Canada in the World'' 
confirms the about-face of the government which is now pursuing 
only its commercial interests at the expense of promoting 
democracy and human rights, as is shown by Team Canada's 
commercial missions.
<P>
	From now on, human rights will come after commercial 
imperatives. Let me give you two examples that clearly show this 
new attitude on the part of the Canadian government. While in 
India, the Prime Minister was reminded by a young Canadian of the 
mass exploitation if not the enslavement of children. It is 
appropriate here to pay special tribute to this 13-year old Canadian, 
Craig Kielburger, who, by his courageous condemnation, reminded 
the Prime Minister that Canada's foreign policy used to promote 
human rights.
<P>
	Everybody recognizes the importance of opening our country to 
international markets. Exports are the backbone of the Canadian 
economy. But, even when he is doing what is best, the Prime 
Minister has to turn everything into a show. During his trips abroad 
with Team Canada, the Prime Minister makes sure that human 
rights are well out of the spotlight and takes care to surround 
himself by a huge propaganda machine that streeses the form rather 
than the substance of the agreements. That is the lesson that the 
young Kielburger taught the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Finally, the Bloc Quebecois will be the defender of the cultural 
uniqueness of Quebec. In North America, Quebec's culture is 
unique and must be treated as such. As communications and new 
information technologies become more and more important, 
Quebec's culture must take the place it deserves. Quebec must not 
be kept out of the decision-making process in this area. Yet all the 
powers in the area of telecommunications, which is  vital to the 
future of Quebec's culture, are in the hands of the federal 
government.
<P>
	Quebec must no longer be considered as a province just like any 
other province. The Bloc Quebecois must force the federal 
government to recognize Quebec's cultural uniqueness. It intends 
to hound the federal government until the funds allocated to 
francophone cultural institutions are readjusted to reflect the need 
to protect Quebec's culture which is constantly threatened in a 
mostly anglophone environment of more than 250 million people.
<P>
	Right now, at the CBC, the English network receives double 
what the French network receives on average for one hour of 
production. This inequity is unacceptable and unjustified, 
especially considering that, in 1976-77, the average hourly cost of 
programming was shared equally between the two networks. 
Equity must be restored.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois must also ensure that federal decisions 
relating to the information highway preserve the cultural 
uniqueness of Quebec. The federal government is giving private 
businesses complete freedom for defining the content of the 
information highway. Yet the government has certain means at its 
disposal for the development of a Canadian and a Quebec content 
in the area of radio and television broadcasting. The Bloc 
Quebecois must see to it that the federal government does not rob 
Quebec's culture of its importance by lowering it to the level of a 
Canadian subculture. Quebec's culture is the culture of a people, of 
a real people.
<P>
	In its speech from the throne, the federal government has finally 
admitted that it has interfered, and still does, in areas under 
exclusive provincial jurisdiction. In the same breath, it undertakes 
to withdraw from certain areas and it even has the nerve to claim 
that it will turn over these areas of jurisdiction, which are not its 
own, to municipal governments or to the private sector. This is a 
strange way indeed of reversing policy.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	This behaviour is in line with the federal government's historical 
tendency to mess up federal-provincial relations.
<P>
	Once again, the federal government is trying to isolate Quebec, 
by suggesting that it could use its spending power to create new 
cost-shared programs in areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction. 
What takes the cake is that creating new programs would only 
require a simple majority of provinces.
<P>
	Worst of all, the government is intimating that it might hold a 
cross-Canada referendum. It must be clearly understood that 
Quebecers will never let their future be settled by a Canadian 
referendum.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="52"> 52 </A></B>
<P>
	In conclusion, we believe it to be essential for the House to be 
presented with a plan containing the following elements. This 
might provide the Prime Minister with food for thought and it 
might steer him in the right direction. First of all, the federal 
government must put its fiscal house in order by reducing its 
expenditures and eliminating waste; re-establishing tax justice in 
this country, especially with regard to big corporations; 
implementing a true and moderate reform of social programs 
instead of cutting them; creating jobs, especially in the high tech 
sector, since Canada is the OECD country which invests the least 
in this area. This is incredible. Should the government be 
reminded that grey matter is this country's main resource?
<P>
	Consequently, we want to move the following amendment to the 
throne speech. I move, seconded by my colleague, the House leader 
and member for Laurier-Sainte-Marie:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, the following words be added to the Address: This House deplores that 
Your Excellency's advisers have demonstrated a lack of vision in the face of the 
fundamental issues confronting Quebec and Canada, such as job creation, better 
administration of public funds, the re-establishment of fiscal justice for all, the 
recognition of Montreal as the economic hub of Quebec society, the need to 
protect Quebec culture;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And show a lack of sensitivity toward the poor by proposing a reform of the 
social programs that strikes at those who are unemployed or on welfare, as well 
as seniors and students;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And show a total lack of understanding of the referendum results.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to start by congratulating the member for 
Roberval on his appointment as the Leader of the Opposition.
<P>
	I must tell you that, in my student days at the Séminaire de 
Joliette, the students from Roberval and Saint-Félicien who had 
been requested to leave the Collège de Chicoutimi for being 
somewhat over-exuberant transferred to Joliette, and I became very 
good friends with some of them. In those days I would never have 
believed for a minute that one day I would be sitting in this House, 
as Prime Minister, across the way from a leader of the opposition 
from Roberval, almost next door to my riding. I felt I must make 
particular mention of this coincidence, and I offer the traditional 
wish of good luck to the Leader of the Opposition-not too much, 
but just enough to make the debates interesting and profitable for 
us all.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to congratulate the member for 
Saskatoon-Humboldt-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
-and the member for Ottawa-Vanier, for their excellent 
presentations yesterday in the House of Commons.
<P>
	They took me back in time with a bit of nostalgia, because I was 
a rooky MP for Saint-Maurice at the time of the Pearson 
government's second throne speech, and had the privilege and 
honour of speaking on that occasion. I know that they both have 
done their constituents proud.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We were very pleased with the member for 
Saskatoon-Humboldt. I would like to congratulate her on the 
quality of her French. It was pretty good. We were all impressed. 
She was probably not born when I made my speech but my English 
was not as good as her French is.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The member for Ottawa-Vanier is a Franco-Ontarian. There are 
a million francophones in Canada who are not Quebecers and who 
are deeply attached to, and proud of, their culture and their 
language. The member's speech yesterday demonstrated the 
vitality of the francophone community outside Quebec. We on this 
side of the House will never abandon francophones who have 
shown such courage and been so ably represented here.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This new session of Parliament marks the mid-point in the 
mandate of our government. We are halfway through our term, 
setting new goals, meeting new challenges and building on the 
accomplishments of two years and four months in office.
<P>
	It is often said that to know where you are going, you must 
remember where you have been. I will add that you should 
remember where you started. I remember where this government 
started just over two years ago.
<P>
	We inherited a country which was indeed in economic trouble. 
Unemployment was more than 11 per cent, the deficit was $42 
billion and growing every year. The economic malaise that we 
inherited was only half of the picture. As deep and destructive was 
the distrust and cynicism that Canadians felt toward their own 
government. Ministers served in the federal government who did 
not even believe in Canada. The taint of scandal forced the 
resignation of minister after minister and the business of 
government was dominated by lobbyists and fixers. This was the 
scene when we took office in 1993.
<P>
	This government rolled up its sleeves and got to work to turn 
things around. And turn things around we have.
<P>
<B>(1620 )</B>
<P>
	We came to government with a plan, the red book. In the last 
session of Parliament we passed almost 100 government bills and 
implemented almost three-quarters of our red book commitments. 
But these statistics do not tell the whole story: That more than half 
a million new jobs have been created in the Canadian economy 
since we took office; that the unemployment rate has fallen by two 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="53"> 53 </A></B>
<P>
points to under 10 per cent for the first time in half a  decade; that 
after years of empty promises and deferred actions, the federal 
government is finally getting its fiscal house in order.
<P>
	At the end of the new fiscal year we will have reduced our deficit 
to GDP ratio from more than 6 per cent to 3 per cent as promised in 
the red book, from $42 billion to $24 billion. Next year it will be 2 
per cent, another per cent lower, the lowest level in 20 years and it 
will keep going down. This has been accomplished not against the 
will of Canadians but with their active support.
<P>
	It has not been easy. I salute the work of the Minister of Finance 
who has been able to garner support for tough but fair budgets. And 
I want to thank the Canadian people for their understanding and 
commitment. We made it clear to Canadians and Canadians 
understood that deficit cutting is not an end in itself. We have not 
pursued it because we want to nor because we are driven by 
ideology, but because it is a necessary step in restoring the 
economic health of Canada in ensuring long term growth and jobs 
for Canadians.
<P>
	Accepting high deficits year after year has meant accepting high 
interest rates. That has meant higher mortgages for Canadians who 
own homes and it has made it more difficult for young families to 
buy their first home. It has meant that thousands of small 
businesses and farms cannot grow and expand and create jobs.
<P>
	Accepting high deficits year after year has also forced us to 
borrow money from abroad just to finance our debt. This has made 
us too vulnerable to the foreign money markets. It has limited our 
own economic sovereignty and every single Canadian has paid a 
heavy price.
<P>
	These are the reasons we have worked so hard and will continue 
to work hard to reduce the deficit. Our success so far is translating 
into real lasting benefits for all Canadians. Much has been 
accomplished. We are not yet at the end of the road, but for the first 
time in a long time the end is in sight as the Minister of Finance 
will show next week in the budget.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In the red book, we wrote that: ``The Liberal two-track policy of 
economic growth and fiscal responsibility will make possible a 
monetary policy that produces lower real interest rates and keeps 
inflation low, so we can be competitive with our major trading 
partners''.
<P>
	That is exactly what is happening. Interest rates have come down 
dramatically. Inflation in Canada is lower than it has been in 
decades-and lower than in virtually any other industrialized 
country.
<P>
	Since March of last year, short term interest rates have dropped 
by three percentage points. This decline is 2.5 percentage points 
more than the decline in the United  States. Today there is virtually 
no difference between Canadian and American short term interest 
rates.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	The way we are putting our fiscal house in order says a lot about 
our values as a government and as a society. We could have gone 
after spending with a meat cleaver-hacking everyone and 
everything with equal vigour. But that would have been unfair. As 
Canadians, we cherish the values of community, of equal 
opportunity, of tolerance and understanding, of compassion and 
support for the most vulnerable. We believe in simple decency and 
respect. Canadians want deeply to win this important battle against 
the deficit. But they absolutely refuse to do it on the backs of those 
in need of help. So does this government. And we are proud of that.
<P>
	That is why, for example, we have cut military spending, but we 
have actually increased spending on employment programs for 
young people. That is why we have cut subsidies to business by 
more than fifty per cent, but invested in a national infrastructure 
program that is resulting in capital projects in every province of 
Canada that have created tens of thousands of new jobs and will 
have important economic benefits for decades to come. That is why 
we have closed loopholes for family trusts and imposed a special 
tax on bank profits, but funded new programs such as the pre-natal 
nutrition program and the aboriginal head start program and 
restored the national literacy program.
<P>
	That is also why we eliminated the $100,000 capital gains 
exemption, and increased the Small Business Loans Act ceiling to 
$12 billion. That is why while we have worked to reduce the size of 
the federal public service, we have also created programs such as 
youth service Canada and the youth internship program to give 
thousands of young people the work experience they need to 
earn-and keep-that important first job.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is this sense of balance and priority that has been the hallmark 
of our government: tough, no nonsense deficit fighting, which 
frankly has broken the back of the deficit, combined with 
compassion, understanding and a willingness to invest in people, as 
we set out in the red book. We have proven that a government can 
be a tough, fair and effective financial and economic manager and 
that it can also be progressive and human. That more than anything 
else is the balanced approach Canadians voted for when they voted 
for us to lead Canada over two years ago. I am proud to say that, 
more than anything else, has been the accomplishment of the first 
half of our mandate.
<P>
	I mentioned earlier that our government inherited not just a 
fiscal deficit from our predecessors but a credibility deficit too. 
Canadians had given up on their public institutions. They had 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="54"> 54 </A></B>
<P>
stopped believing in their  government and they had stopped 
trusting elected officials.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	One can agree or disagree with our policies but no one, after 
more than two years in office, can question the honesty and 
integrity of the government and its ministers-no one. That is an 
accomplishment that not only makes me very proud but which has 
given Canadians a reason to believe in their government again. 
Canadians know that when the government gives its word, it keeps 
it.
<P>
	Restoring the Government of Canada as a competent fiscal and 
economic manager and restoring people's faith in government as an 
honest institution are our cumulative accomplishments half way 
through the mandate, accomplishments of which we are deeply 
proud. They set the stage for the second half of our mandate.
<P>
	Yesterday the throne speech announced the broad initiatives the 
government will take in this session, initiatives that continue the 
work we began two years ago, initiatives promised in the red book 
that promote economic growth and job creation, unity and the 
security of individual Canadians and their families.
<P>
	We were elected to restore the economic well-being of Canada. 
Unemployment is down considerably from the time we took office 
in 1993 but it is not down low enough for our liking or for the liking 
of Canadians. Too many Canadians are still out of work. Too many 
more are still worried about holding on to their jobs.
<P>
	Above all, we want young Canadians to become active 
participants in our economy. They want jobs. They deserve jobs. 
Young people want to embrace the future, not fear it. It is up to all 
of us to create that hope and opportunity for them.
<P>
	Youth unemployment is not unique to Canada. We see it 
everywhere in the industrialized world today, in every country, 
most far worse than here. However, that comparison should give us 
little comfort because we should not measure the success or 
self-fulfilment of our young people against those of other 
countries. We should measure them by our own hopes and 
ambitions and by our sense of obligation as the custodians of the 
society they will inherit. If we want Canada to continue to grow and 
prosper, if we truly want a country of hope and confidence, young 
people working hard in meaningful jobs, jobs with a future, is our 
only guarantee.
<P>
	In our first two years the government has done much to actively 
foster a climate of job creation and it has met with success. 
Government does not create jobs; it creates the climate for the 
private sector to create jobs. That is what we have done and 
continue to do, laying the foundations for long term sustained job 
growth. Now we need the active partnership of the other levels of  
government and the private sector to make that job growth happen.
<P>
	We have had a preview of how well that partnership can work 
with the right amount of commitment and effort. Nothing in many 
years has given Canadians a greater sense of pride in 
accomplishment than the Team Canada trade missions to foreign 
markets such as China, India, Malaysia, Pakistan and Indonesia.
<P>
<B>(1635 )</B>
<P>
	These trade missions, combined with the Latin America trade 
mission I led a year ago, brought home more than $20 billion in 
deals for Canadian businesses. That means tens of thousands of 
jobs in Canada and an important foothold in some of the fastest 
growing foreign markets in the world.
<P>
	Even more important than the impressive statistics of the Team 
Canada missions was the impact on Canadians of seeing their 
Prime Minister, their provincial premiers and leaders of businesses 
large and small working together to bring home jobs for Canadians. 
There were politicians from just about every party, representatives 
of just about every kind of business, small and large, all pulling in 
the same direction. For once the politicians stopped pointing 
fingers at each other. The business people stopped blaming 
government and everyone pulled together, working on the same 
team with the same goals.
<P>
	Canadians were used to seeing governments compete, first 
ministers bicker, but with Team Canada they saw us working 
together. They liked what they saw and they want to see more it.
<P>
	We can and must prove to Canadians that we, federal and 
provincial governments and the private sector, do not need to leave 
Canada in order to work together. Team Canada worked well in 
Beijing, Bombay and Buenos Aires but it can work as well in 
Burnaby, Brampton or Bromont. We should put the same Team 
Canada spirit to work here at home creating jobs in a true national 
partnership. I commit here and now before the eyes of the nation 
every resource of the federal government to creating that 
partnership. I urge the private sector and the provincial 
governments to join with us.
<P>
	To the private sector I have a very specific challenge. For many 
years you have urged the federal government to get its fiscal house 
in order. You have campaigned against deficit. You have warned us 
of the negative impact of too much government spending on the 
economy and you have urged us to get out of areas that are better 
dealt with by the private sector. You said that when this is done the 
private sector would create jobs. I say to you that the federal 
government has delivered. Now Canadians want the private sector 
to deliver.
<P>
	Now it is your turn to show your confidence in Canada and 
Canadians, especially young Canadians, to recognize that just as 
we have taken the lead in eliminating the  fiscal deficit, you have a 
responsibility to eliminate the human deficit of unemployment. No 
true balance sheet can ignore the heavy and growing cost of chronic 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="55"> 55 </A></B>
<P>
unemployment. It is wrong. It is wrong on a human level. It is 
wrong on an economic level. It is wrong on a commercial level. It 
is wrong on a moral level.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	You have a responsibility, just as surely as I and my colleagues in 
government have, to invest the energy and commitment it takes to 
solving this problem. That is why in the throne speech yesterday 
we announced that the federal government will be doubling its 
contribution to summer job creation this summer and urged the 
private sector and provincial and municipal governments to do the 
same. We need to encourage and help young people who are putting 
themselves through university and this is an important way we can 
do it.
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>
	Today I want to announce another initiative. In the weeks ahead I 
will be calling on businesses to join in launching a domestic Team 
Canada focused on creating jobs for young Canadians-primarily 
in the private sector. I will be appealing to businesses large and 
small to invest just one additional per cent of their payroll budget 
into jobs for young Canadians. This would create many tens of 
thousands of new jobs. It would further promote economic growth 
and consumer demand. And most of all, it would prove to millions 
of Canadians that Canada does work-not just for the powerful and 
the privileged, but for ordinary Canadians.
<P>
	And to the provinces I issue a challenge as well. I challenge you 
to join with us in rekindling the spirit of Team Canada-and 
making it work on a permanent basis. As we work on redefining 
and clarifying our responsibilities, let us work together on this jobs 
agenda. It may not be as exciting as picking fights with each other. 
It certainly will not be as easy. But we have proven we can work 
together for jobs and economic results. We owe it to Canadians to 
give it the effort it takes.
<P>
	We also owe Canadians the security that is provided them by our 
social programs. A healthy, growing economy means healthy, 
viable, sustainable social programs. That is why getting our fiscal 
house in order is such an important key to preserving the social 
programs we as Canadians hold so dear.
<P>
	But that is far from the limit of this government's commitment 
to social programs. We also know that if we want healthy social 
programs not just today and tomorrow, but ten and twenty years 
from now, we must plan for them now. And that is a responsibility 
that this government takes very seriously.
<P>
	In no area is this more important than in the public pensions 
system. Everybody recognizes that demographic changes in our 
society mean that we will have to make  changes to ensure that our 
pension system remains sustainable for future generations of 
Canadians.
<P>
	That is why we have begun discussions with the provinces to 
ensure that the Canada pension plan, which we run in partnership 
with the provinces, will be there for Canadians who work hard and 
contribute to the plan. The public has been asked to participate in 
these discussions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The next step is to ensure that the support provided to seniors 
through the old age security and guaranteed income supplement 
program is sustainable and will be there for future generations as 
well. You have our commitment that we will do it. We have an 
obligation to plan for the future. We do not take that obligation 
lightly.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	As we do that we will honour another commitment, a 
commitment I undertook in the House on behalf of the government. 
I made a promise to current seniors that I will repeat today. The 
OAS and GIS payments that you receive will not be reduced. We 
will also continue to ensure the health and sustainability of 
medicare, the most cherished social program of all.
<P>
	The government will ensure that the health system will be there 
for all Canadians, rich and poor alike. We will maintain substantial 
cash transfers through the Canada health and social transfer to 
ensure that the federal government always has a strong say in 
medicare and is able to preserve free, universal access to health 
care anywhere in Canada for every Canadian.
<P>
	Medicare is as much a part of our country as the air we breathe 
and the water that runs through our rivers and lakes. It defines what 
we are and who we want to be. It sets us apart from other countries. 
It draws us together no matter where we live in Canada. We will 
work to ensure it continues to draw Canadians together for a long 
time to come.
<P>
	Bringing Canadians together and keeping Canada united in 
common cause and purpose must be the number one priority of any 
government. The referendum on October 30 last year showed us 
that we can never take our magnificent country for granted. We 
need to remind ourselves every day why it is so good to live in 
Canada. We need to remind ourselves of all that we have in 
common: the values that we cherish, tolerance, respect, generosity 
and sharing. We need to remind ourselves what many generations 
of Canadians have accomplished to make our country the envy of 
the world. We need to remind ourselves of the genius of federalism 
and how it has accommodated our diversity while building on our 
strength.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="56"> 56 </A></B>
<P>
	A united Canada is a far nobler enterprise than the narrowing 
of vision proclaimed by those who want to break up this country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Canada is a vast country occupied by a diverse population. 
Thirty million people of diverse origins who live peacefully 
together in a land that the United Nations ranks as the very best for 
its quality of life.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	It is a great success on the world stage, a success that we cannot 
simply take for granted, a success which we must continue to build.
<P>
	In the community of nations, Canada is seen as a young country 
that is constantly evolving in an environment of rapid change. The 
global economy is transforming itself and becoming more and 
more interdependent as larger blocs of nations are formed, as in 
Europe. Canada itself has become a large collectivity as more and 
more provinces and territories have joined over the years to make 
us one of the seven leading industrial powers in the world. Canada 
has grown very quickly. It is only natural for us to review the way 
that our country functions. Economic globalization is forcing 
governments around the world to redefine themselves.
<P>
	The one constant in Canadian history has been our ability to 
adapt to new circumstances and new realities without sacrificing 
our principles and values. The Fathers of Confederation provided a 
framework that is as valid today as it was 130 years ago. They 
provided for strong, autonomous provinces capable of delivering 
services and of adapting them to local circumstances. They 
provided for provinces that could grow and flourish in their own 
individual ways. For example, all of Canada is richer because 
Saskatchewan invented Medicare. All of Canada is richer because 
British Columbia makes us a Pacific nation. And at a time when 
people are told to think globally but act locally, strong provinces 
are more important than ever.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	But the Fathers of Confederation also provided for a single 
national government, elected directly by all Canadians that speaks 
and acts directly for all Canadians on the great issues of the day. In 
the 21st century that national government will be as important as it 
has ever been.
<P>
	We will preserve the role of that national government in 
strengthening our economy and economic union to ensure a 
prosperous country for ourselves and our children; in enhancing 
social solidarity in Canada, in preserving and modernizing the 
social union so that the caring and sharing society is truly 
Canada-wide in scope; in pooling our national resources to achieve 
common goals efficiently and effectively; in protecting and 
promoting Canadian values and identity while celebrating  our 
diversity; and, in defending Canada's sovereignty and in speaking 
for Canadians collectively on the world's stage. Together we will 
modernize our federation with respect for our diversity and with 
confidence as we head into the 21st century.
<P>
	Clearly, Canadians face particular challenges following the 
referendum result in Quebec. This is not a time for major 
constitutional change. We must continue to adapt, modernize and 
develop our federation. I believe we can do so by focusing on 
practical steps within a spirit that respects the principles of 
federalism.
<P>
	The operation of our federation should be responsive to our 
common needs and diversity. It should show respect for each other 
and our institutions. It should involve partnership and dialogue 
between governments and citizens. It should be flexible. It should 
aim for efficiency and effectiveness in addressing our problems. 
The fact is Canada has largely operated in this way in the past. The 
federation has proven remarkably flexible and responsive to 
Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	What I propose now is a concerted effort between the federal and 
provincial governments to address a number of outstanding issues 
in the operation of the federation with a particular focus on 
strengthening our economic and social union. Our effort should 
focus on practical, concrete steps rather than a grand design or the 
emotional symbols of major constitutional change.
<P>
	Canada's economic union has been one of our greatest successes. 
Canadians underestimate the depth of our economic integration, 
which goes far beyond the economic integration we have with any 
foreign country, including the United States.
<P>
	Over the past generation we have seen regional disparities in 
Canada diminish. We have largely closed the gap between 
Canadian and American standards of living but we have still have 
not taken full advantage of our economic union. Maximizing the 
advantage is key to ensuring Canadian competitiveness 
internationally.
<P>
	I invite the provinces and all Canadians to consider how we can 
improve our economic union to enhance labour mobility between 
provinces, to reduce internal barriers to trade, to improve our 
internal capital markets, to enhance the sharing of technical 
knowledge and to co-operate better abroad.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	There is a strong consensus in Canada to promote our social 
union. The people want governments to work together to 
modernize our social safety net to ensure that it is sustainable in the 
long term and continues to reflect the values of Canadians from 
coast to coast. Working with provinces and individual Canadians, 
beginning with the principles that we have in common, our 
government will explore new approaches to social policy issues.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="57"> 57 </A></B>
<P>
	The development of our social union needs to respect the spirit 
of our federation as well as the fiscal realities we confront. In 
recognition of this, the government makes a formal engagement 
that any new national cost-shared programs in areas of exclusive 
provincial responsibility will require prior agreement of a majority 
of provinces. Such programs will be designed so that provinces 
choosing not to participate will be compensated provided they 
establish initiatives which are equivalent or compatible with 
national objectives.
<P>
	This is the first time any federal government has undertaken 
formally to restrict its use of the spending power outside a 
constitutional negotiation. Our undertaking recognizes that the use 
of this power for shared-cost programs has been a source of tension 
with the provinces. We believe we can build our social union within 
this spirit, as well as through other, non-financial means.
<P>
	Canadians want their governments to be flexible and to work 
effectively as partners so that the country functions well. We will 
work with the provinces to ensure that Canadians are served by the 
most appropriate level of government. In a number of areas, the 
federal government no longer has to be involved in order to serve 
its citizens effectively. We have made a start on transferring 
transportation infrastructures to municipal authorities and the 
private sector. Then, for example, we had a tourism program 
managed by the Department of Industry. Last year the tourism 
industry recommended that the private sector be made responsible 
for managing this program in co-operation with the public sector. 
We agreed. We withdrew from our own program and the Canadian 
Tourism Commission was set up. It is managed by the tourist 
industry in co-operation with the federal and provincial 
governments, with all parties working together. This has been a 
remarkable success which serves as a model of partnership 
between the various levels of government and the private sector for 
the 21st century.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	The federal government is also prepared to withdraw from its 
functions in such areas as labour market training, forestry, mining 
and recreation, that in the 21st century will be more appropriately 
the responsibility of others-provinces, municipalities or the 
private sector.
<P>
	There are a number of fields in which both levels of government 
have a genuine role to play. In those sectors, we must achieve 
maximum efficiency in our actions, to ensure that taxpayers get 
value for money. The government will ask the provinces to increase 
their efforts to eliminate duplication and overlap and identify other 
grey areas that could be discussed.
<P>
	In the months to come, a first ministers' conference will 
consider better ways of working together for job creation in 
Canada, how to secure the social safety net,  and how to put in place 
a common agenda for change to renew Canada.
<P>
	Preserving and enhancing Canadian unity requires more than a 
rebalancing of roles and responsibilities of levels of government. It 
requires us to remember what we have in common, by promoting 
culture, the arts and our heritage.
<P>
	Preserving Canadian unity requires us to offer, to Quebecers 
tempted by an alternative, a nobler vision of a Canada in which 
Quebecers-like all Canadians-feel at home wherever they are in 
the country; a Canada that believes it is the best assurance of the 
French fact in North America.
<P>
	Democracies endowed with more than one official language, and 
accordingly a broader window on the universe of cultures, make 
special arrangements to help their linguistic groups live together in 
harmony. Our Official Languages Act and the recognition of 
language rights in the Constitution are a model of such 
arrangements. We need only go further and recognize as a strength, 
as a piece of good fortune for Canada, that anglophone America 
contains a society that functions in French and takes action so that 
it can continue to do so.
<P>
	On a continent where only one person in forty is francophone, 
we must all appreciate the concerns of many of our francophone 
fellow citizens in Quebec and elsewhere in Canada. They are 
worried not only about the survival of their language and culture, 
but also about their development.
<P>
	Quebec wants to be recognized as a distinct society through its 
language, its culture and its institutions. The House of Commons 
has passed a resolution in those terms, and a regional veto 
guaranteeing that there will be no constitutional change without the 
consent of every region of Canada was also approved here in this 
House.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	We want to entrench these changes in the Constitution. We know 
it will not be easy. We must convince and explain that recognizing 
the distinctness of Quebec society does not take anything away 
from anyone but simply reflects reality. A reality that represents an 
asset for our country.
<P>
	Last week, we all found out what the former premier of Quebec, 
Mr. Parizeau, would have said if the result on October 30 had been 
in his favour. The result was irreversible; democracy had spoken; 
the page had been turned; everyone had to support the choice. Why 
not accept that Quebecers chose Canada for the second time in 15 
years?

every Canadian city, town and region needs it. Political stability 
benefits all Canadians, and that is very important.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Let us work together to preserve what we have built together. It 
will not be easy, but it was never easy to build this great country in 
which we have the extraordinary good fortune to live. Canada was 
built with courage and determination. It was built with the desire to 
live together, recognizing our differences are also our strengths. 
That is our heritage. It is up to us to preserve and to build on it.
<P>
	There are different ways of measuring greatness. Some measure 
the greatness of nations in terms of wealth or power. I believe we in 
Canada have found our own special definition of greatness by 
achieving the greatest balance between economic success and 
social justice of any nation.
<P>
	I have had the privilege of travelling to foreign countries, 
representing Canada and Canadians to the world. I have had the 
opportunity to see how the world sees Canada. What it sees is very 
much a real country, un vrai pays, make no mistake about it.
<P>
	What it sees much more is a large and diverse society that has 
turned diversity into prosperity. It sees a country of promise and 
integrity built by people from every corner of the world. It sees a 
land where each individual citizen has the opportunity to be the 
best they can possibly be but where there is also a true sense of 
caring and compassion, a true sense of community.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	We have seen that when the world looks to Canada. What it sees 
is the future, or rather the best hope for the future of the world. 
Together let us build that model of hope and confidence, that model 
for all mankind.
<P>
	When I was in Kuala Lumpur a few weeks ago I realized what 
Canada is all about. I was invited to visit the two biggest towers in 
the world, which have just been completed. They wanted to link the 
two towers together but they needed the best technology. They have 
problems with weather there as well, but not snow. They needed a 
bridge very high in the air between the two towers. They came to 
Canadians to test the technology. When we crossed from one 
building to the other they told us this is their Canadian connection; 
it was build by Canadians.
<P>
	I was also invited to visit a construction site in Kuala Lumpur for 
a light transit system.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	SNC Lavalin and Bombardier were there, who were building this 
advanced system in co-operation with companies from Vancouver 
and Toronto. They were all  working together, all these Canadians, 
who are all proud of this French- and English-speaking country 
selling an outstanding technology a few days after we left Pakistan, 
where they were awarded the contract for the construction of a 
similar system in the city of Karachi.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I saw everybody there, French and English, east and west 
together, and the joy when one government was on the stage with 
the business community of that province signing contracts. The 
premier of Ontario was congratulating the socialist premier of B.C. 
when he was doing well. Others were turning to the premier of New 
Brunswick because he had made a great deal for a farming 
community of New Brunswick. It was such a good deal that he was 
telling me he will need some cattle from Quebec. I said fine, we 
will talk with the Bloc and send some there, and even from 
Manitoba. There were congratulations from each other and the 
people were looking at us.
<P>
	They were not buying Canadian goods and services because we 
were Canadian. A lot of them remember that we were there at the 
time of the Columbo plan. They remember that. They were buying 
Canadian goods and services because they are the best on the 
market.
<P>
	If we can build a bridge in Kuala Lumpur between the two 
highest towers in the world, we will build a bridge that will keep 
the greatest nation in the world together.
<P>
<B>(1715 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to respond to the government's second speech from the 
throne in this 35th Parliament, or we could refer to it as its second 
kick at the can.
<P>
	This second try is full of words, hope and promise. We certainly 
have just heard an hour's worth of them from our Prime Minister. It 
is an indication that at last the government seems at least to be 
hearing the anxious voices of Canadians and recognizing that 
Canadians are scared. They are scared for their own futures, the 
future of their country and the future of their children.
<P>
	It is a speech that gives an indication that at last the government 
seems to recognize and is attempting at least to remedy the past 
mistakes and strategic inaction of the last couple of years.
<P>
	This second speech from the throne is in many ways an 
admission of failure by the government, but it is an attempt at a 
jump start.
<P>
	When the Liberals came to power in 1993 expectations were 
high right across the country. At last the Conservatives had paid the 
ultimate price, the price of arrogance and the Liberals were 
promising hope, jobs and a bright secure future.
<P>
	In 1993 Canadians were told not to worry, the mighty Liberal 
Party was back in power. Today in 1996 though, two and a half 
years later, the hope has faded. The real,  long term jobs have never 
really materialized. It is one thing to say that jobs have been 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="59"> 59 </A></B>
<P>
created but the Prime Minister did not note how many jobs have 
been lost in that amount of time.
<P>
	The Liberal promises of a bright future were shown to be nothing 
more than empty election rhetoric. Any sense of security and hope 
that Canadians had in 1993 withered away as the months and 
months of Liberal do nothing government drifted by.
<P>
	Yesterday the throne speech talked about giving Canadians hope 
and lifting them out of the despair they feel right across the 
country. What it did not acknowledge however was that the Liberal 
government's inaction, its lack of a plan, lack of innovation and 
lack of vision contributed to that overwhelming sense of 
hopelessness and despair in the country.
<P>
	This is where we stand now in 1996 and it is why the government 
is beginning again. It has shown in the throne speech that it can 
speak the words of the Canadian public, but the question of course, 
and one which we will be asking time and time again is: Can it 
deliver? This is what we have to analyse today as we sift through 
the guarded wording and cloaked phrases of the Liberals' second 
try.
<P>
	Everyone deserves a second chance, even if they make an 
incorrect ruling. Everyone deserves a second chance. Do not get me 
wrong. That is something with which I am sure Canadians agree. 
But three strikes and your are out. That is the way it is done in 
baseball and that is the way I think it should be done here.
<P>
	So in the spirit of second chances and second tries, let us look at 
what the Liberal government in this speech has promised the 
people of Canada. Let us look at what it is intending to do to restore 
hope, confidence and security to Canadians, all of which we so 
desperately need in these times of uncertainty and fading hope.
<P>
	Jobs and financial security are of concern. In an attempt to 
convince Canadians that the government is working toward long 
term economic growth, it is heralding its new and improved deficit 
reduction target of 2 per cent of gross domestic product. Low 
targets are always easy to reach. We need deficit elimination and a 
balanced budget. Quit digging the big debt hole deeper. The 
digging must be stopped period before starting to fill in the hole.
<P>
<B>(1720 )</B>
<P>
	The government still stubbornly refuses to produce its firm 
timetable for totally eliminating the deficit. Two year rolling 
targets are rolling along. As we come to the end of the century I am 
wondering how long they are going to continue to roll.
<P>
	Without totally eliminating the deficit or the yearly amount 
which we are spending more than we are bringing in, the federal 
debt continues to increase at an alarming rate and interest payments 
continue to eat more and more of the money that government needs 
to spend on securing our essential social programs. Billions and 
billions of dollars every year we are spending just on interest on the 
debt. There is something inherently wrong in that and we need to 
get that totally under control.
<P>
	By the government taking this go slow approach it might just as 
well be promising to raise taxes because that would be the result. If 
we are going to continue to overspend, there is a way that we have 
to be able to feed that appetite and there is nothing more than 
increasing taxes when we are going to do that.
<P>
	Elimination of the deficit on the other hand as Reformers have 
proposed will stop the further unnecessary erosion of our social 
programs. It will enable the government to begin paying down the 
massive debt, a debt that successive Liberal and Conservative 
governments have piled up incidentally over the last 32 years while 
our Prime Minister has been on the public scene. It will enable the 
government to give much needed tax relief to Canadians.
<P>
	We saw nothing about tax relief in the throne speech. If there is 
anything that is going to cheer Canadians up it is the promise of 
real live tax relief so that they will have more money in their 
pockets.
<P>
	Elimination of the federal deficit will not just give us a light at 
the end of the tunnel; it will bring us out of the seemingly endless 
tunnel and finally into the light, not just a glimmer at the end of it. 
Canadians will once again control their own destinies. Social 
programs will be financially sustainable. People will have more 
money in their pockets. With that money, they can use it to pay 
down their growing debts, buy new houses, new cars and have a 
plan for the future of their families.
<P>
	Another thing that would improve consumer confidence and 
even voter confidence in this government is scrapping the GST. 
The throne speech back in 1994 promised it. It is promising it again 
now. It talks about progress on it, but time is running out on this 
Liberal government and on the political career of the Deputy Prime 
Minister. This is an actual quote from her. During a CBC town hall 
program on October 18, 1993, one week before the last federal 
election, she said: ``If the GST is not abolished under a Liberal 
government, I will resign''. We are still waiting for it. It would be 
easy for her to stand up and say that the Liberals are planning to 
abolish it. In my estimation from what I know of the English 
language, abolish does not equal harmonize, or make a few 
changes, or rename it, or whatever. Abolish means abolish.
<P>
	The Deputy Prime Minister has said that the Liberals will 
abolish the GST. They will not just harmonize it with provincial 
sales taxes. In my province of Alberta we do not have a provincial 
sales tax. That is the last thing on their minds, harmonizing 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="60"> 60 </A></B>
<P>
something on the GST, on  which the Deputy Prime Minister said 
she would resign. I say, we are waiting.
<P>
	On April 4, 1990 before the last election when the present 
finance minister was in opposition he said this which I thought was 
kind of excellent: ``I would abolish the GST''. There is that word 
again, abolish. Not harmonize, not change, not rename, not 
whatever, but abolish. That means over, done with, toast. He would 
abolish it. ``The manufacturers' sales tax was a bad tax but there is 
no excuse to repeal one bad thing by bringing in another''. Oops, 
how times change. How things change when one moves across the 
aisle. I suspect you know that feeling, Mr. Speaker. You have been 
in government and I have not yet but we are working on it.
<P>
	This is what is particularly painful. When something comes from 
opposition it is one thing but when it comes from right within 
government it is painful. Just yesterday the Liberal member for 
Mississauga West said: ``I keep hearing from the finance 
department that Canadians are getting used to the GST and they 
now accept it''. She went on to say: ``If anyone really believes that, 
I don't think they are in touch with reality''. That is a Liberal 
backbencher.
<P>
	Most of the insecurity and worry being felt by Canadians today 
relates to their jobs and job security. Instead of addressing this 
genuine concern however, the government has decided to embark 
on programs that create artificial jobs or, as they have been so aptly 
termed, bubble jobs; they are here and gone just like that. That is 
not long term. That is not something people are working toward.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	The government has announced a plan to double for one year the 
number of federal summer student jobs. Unfortunately though, 
with youth unemployment stuck at a staggering 16 per cent, 
although well intentioned, it will do little to ease the job prospects 
for thousands and thousands of our struggling youth. It looks good 
on paper and I am sure people will appreciate it in the short run, but 
the question I and I am sure many young people would like to ask 
is: Why is the government going to give young people money now 
and then yank it back later from them plus interest? That is what is 
happening. It is easy to say the cash will be given out now, but 
because our interest payments are just so incredible the 
government is going to yank it back later from those people and 
from their kids when they get to be my age and later at your age, 
Mr. Speaker, but not that much later.
<P>
	What else is this government going to do to create jobs and job 
security for Canadians? From this it does not look like very much. 
Without eliminating the federal deficit, growing interest payments 
on the national debt continue to endanger social spending, continue 
to endanger the health, education and pension systems of 
Canadians.
<P>
	When it comes to the Canada pension plan, the government is 
planning to dramatically increase the amount snatched from 
Canadians' paycheques while at the same time lowering the 
benefits. Such actions will further depress the job market adding 
undue payroll tax stress on Canada's small and medium size 
business. This is stress that neither the job market nor Canadian 
business can afford. Such moves will do nothing to increase the 
security of Canadians. In fact it might depress them even more.
<P>
	Reformers encourage the government to look seriously at our 
approach to address Canada's pension crisis through the 
introduction of super RRSPs. This does not need to be partisan. We 
need to get out of this mess we are in. Mandatory contributions into 
self-directed retirement funds will ensure that all generations will 
get their fair share of benefits without dramatic contribution 
increases. At the very least, it would be great if the finance minister 
would have the political courage to at least put it on the table for 
discussion.
<P>
	The government states it wants to co-operate with the provinces 
in establishing new national standards in the area of social policy. 
The government however has a record of confrontation not 
co-operation, of inflexibility not accommodation. We need to 
correct that problem. If the government is serious about 
co-operating with the provinces in social policy areas, it should 
transfer tax points to the provinces; that is, let the provinces 
determine what their taxation levels should be. That would not just 
ensure stable funding for health, education and welfare, it would 
also provide a mechanism for the growth of funding in these areas. 
Heaven knows, we need that in this day and age.
<P>
	Canadians wanted firm measures to improve their financial 
security and bold initiatives to stop the drain on their social 
security. Unfortunately, in the throne speech they heard nothing 
more than half measures. At least in these two areas the 
government is making some positive moves. When it comes to 
personal security the throne speech lacks both substance and 
rhetoric.
<P>
	Criminal justice is another area that at least was touched on in 
the throne speech but it was one single paragraph out of the entire 
speech. That is all the government felt the fears of Canadians for 
their safety and the safety of their families and property warranted.
<P>
	The government has spent half of its mandate harassing 
law-abiding farmers, hunters and gun collectors and is now feebly 
paying lip service to addressing the criminal element. Let us spend 
more energy, time and resources hitting the criminal element and 
leave the law-abiding citizens alone.
<P>
	If the federal government really means business on criminal 
justice reform, it must make the protection of life and property the 
number one priority of the criminal justice system. The law must 
reflect the values held by the majority of Canadians that all 
offenders must be held  accountable and responsible for their 
criminal acts and the rights of victims must supersede the rights of 
criminals always, every time.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="61"> 61 </A></B>
<P>
	The government must amend the Corrections and Conditional 
Release Act to ensure that violent offenders serve their full 
sentences. Once released, some violent offenders and all repeat 
offenders should be under parole supervision for the rest of their 
lives. To allow for the indefinite incarceration of dangerous 
offenders, the government should amend the current dangerous 
offenders law to allow for the designation of ``dangerous offender'' 
prior to, during, or at the end of that offender's sentence. Such 
offenders have no right to live in society and the people of Canada 
are right to demand protection. They are right to demand their 
indefinite incarceration. Canadians want and need to be freed from 
fear.
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
	Canadians want security so their kids can walk home after school 
or over to a friend's house and not have to worry about what is 
going to happen to them on the way, so women can walk to their 
cars, as we do all the time, so they can wander through airports and 
hotels alone across the country, so we would feel safe, so we would 
not feel threatened of being mugged or assaulted.
<P>
	Canadians need the assurance that violent criminals, whether 
they are at home or on the street, are being dealt with by a criminal 
justice system that knows and understands the severity of their 
crimes, and will protect Canadians from them always.
<P>
	Regarding national unity, the government has begun to realize 
that over centralization, bringing the power to the centre, in large 
measure has contributed to the frustration and alienation Canadians 
have felt toward their federal government. Any movement on this 
front is welcome.
<P>
	The government is to be commended for expressing its desire to 
strengthen the economic situation and lower internal trade barriers, 
but it has to go beyond just desire. The federal government should 
seek more power in this area in exchange for giving other powers to 
the provinces, powers they originally had vested in them that 
federal governments have taken away over the decades.
<P>
	Canadians from coast to coast have indicated that they want 
Canada to be a balanced federation in which Ottawa would play a 
co-operative role but not a dominating role. Reform has advanced 
20 new Confederation proposals that help to establish this 
arrangement for the long term.
<P>
	There have been longstanding concerns about the arsenal of 
centralizing powers, that power that is used by the federal 
government under the Constitution, and about the over 
concentration of power in the hands of the executive in the cabinet. 
The throne speech indicates a willingness to address some of those 
concerns but of course it does not go nearly far enough.
<P>
	Now is not the time for half measures and tinkering. Canadians 
want leadership. They want to know where they are going as they 
get closer to the next century. Future governments have to be able 
to respond more effectively to the needs of ordinary Canadians 
through a revitalized federal system, one that addresses the historic 
concerns of dissatisfied Canadians, both inside and outside 
Quebec.
<P>
	There are dissatisfied Canadians right across the country and I 
think it is time we realized it. National unity is more than a 
rebalancing of roles, responsibilities and levels of government, as 
the speech from the throne has pointed out. The ending of over 
centralization must be coupled with substantial democratic reforms 
to federal institutions, reforms that will ensure that Canadians 
themselves have more input into the way the federal government 
runs, the directions it takes and the decisions it makes.
<P>
	Democratic reforms such as referendums, an elected Senate, 
citizens' initiatives, recall and freer votes in the House of 
Commons are all needed to ensure the long term unity of our 
country, to put an end to political uncertainty and to make Canada 
one of the most progressive democracies in the world. Sadly, we 
saw nothing about that in the throne speech.
<P>
	Again, we are encouraged by the signs in the speech that the 
Liberals have finally recognized that any constitutional change 
must be put to the people directly for ratification in a referendum. 
It is one thing to say ``people will have a say on it''.
<P>
	As I said earlier in question period, when people are told they 
will have say they equate that to having a vote. The Charlottetown 
accord changed everything in this country. Since people were given 
an actual vote on that issue, they will never again put up with 
anything less. That was the best thing about the Charlottetown 
accord.
<P>
	Reformers and all Canadians must also be pleased to see the 
government has learned its lesson from the last Quebec 
referendum. The government will take its responsibility seriously 
with any future referendum in the province of Quebec to debate the 
consequences of secession based on a real or possible scenario that 
there may be a yes vote.
<P>
	The federal government should develop now a Canadian position 
on terms and conditions of secession rather than what it did last 
time, nothing. If that would have been on the table, if the people of 
Quebec knew there would be real consequences of a yes vote, they 
would have said: ``Wow, there are serious consequences and I think 
my vote is going to be to stay with Canada''. We hope that happens 
next time.
<P>
	However, the government needs to lay out on the table that if the 
people of Quebec decide to vote yes, they had better be prepared 
for some hard answers and some hard negotiations. ``These are the 
terms and conditions of  secession. We want you to think again''. I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="62"> 62 </A></B>
<P>
think Quebecers will vote strongly to remain a part of Canada. We 
are confident that this can and will happen if the government 
responds to it, rather than leaving everyone out of the debate as it 
did last October. We can all live together and prosper.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	In the end, where has the government left Canadians? That is the 
question people are asking. There appear to be glimmers of hope 
and I want to give the government credit for those glimmers. The 
Liberals are learning from their past mistakes, however reluctantly, 
and the real concerns and fears of Canadians for their own security 
and the security of their country are finally being heard. That is a 
good move.
<P>
	The real question is, can they deliver on these promises? We will 
watch during the second session of this Parliament. Where progress 
is made, we will encourage it. Where they fail, we will propose 
constructive alternatives so that they can rethink their positions.
<P>
	We truly feel for Canadians and the stress that all are under 
during this time in our history, the sense of insecurity in their lives 
and jobs, and the constant threat of the break-up of our country. 
These things must be dealt with once and for all.
<P>
	Reformers will do everything in their power to ease this stress 
and to calm the worry Canadians have about the future of their 
country. We share their feelings and we will never give up their 
cause.
<P>
	Therefore, I would like to amend the Bloc amendment by adding 
the words:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-and in particular, providing more personal security; the need to effectively 
reduce the budget deficit; simplifying the tax system and balancing the budget; 
greater personal social security by providing a permanent and stable source of 
social program funding in the areas of health, education and social assistance; 
greater public safety; understanding the need to communicate to Quebec 
honestly and openly what will be the stance of the rest of Canada concerning 
separation; understanding the need to pledge their unconditional commitment 
to protect and defend our rights and freedoms as Canadians wanting to remain 
Canadians in Quebec both before and after a possible yes vote in the future.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I have signed that Deborah Grey, member of Parliament, Beaver 
River.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Generally the amendment seems to be in order. I 
wonder if the hon. member might give the Chair the liberty of 
adding three small words at the end of ``and in particular does not 
address''. We have to have a verb in there. Being old school 
teachers we happen to know that.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Beth Phinney (Hamilton Mountain, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Winnipeg North 
Centre.
<P>
	It is a pleasure to have this opportunity to take part in the debate 
on the throne speech. This is an exciting time in the history of our 
country. As we approach the 21st century, a world of opportunity 
lies before us. We must continue to build a strong economy to 
secure our communities, and to strengthen our country to take 
advantage of those tremendous opportunities.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	The government has been laying the foundation for a strong and 
prosperous economy. In the last two years, 497,000 full time jobs 
have been created. Inflation is low and interest rates are declining.
<P>
	In Hamilton, my home town, the unemployment rate is 6 per 
cent. This is down from a rate of 11.3 per cent two years ago, a 5 
per cent decline since this government was elected. The low 
unemployment rate is a testament to the advantage of co-operation 
between business, unions, schools, community groups and 
government that exists in Hamilton. Organizations like Mohawk 
College in my riding have been co-operating closely with unions 
and management and the federal government to develop training 
programs for workers that have increased productivity. Increased 
productivity is leading to more jobs as resources are used more 
efficiently.
<P>
	Through hard work and co-operation among everyone in 
Hamilton over the last five years, we have turned Hamilton into a 
world recognized model of sustainable community development. It 
took a lot of hard work, which is continuing, but the achievement 
was well worth it. I am sure that similar effort and co-operation 
among all Canadians can be equally successful across the country. 
That is the government's goal, as we heard the Prime Minister state 
earlier this afternoon.
<P>
	Just as the Team Canada approach to external trade promotions 
is paying dividends, Team Canada co-operation can pay off in job 
creation. As was said in the throne speech, it is time to harness the 
energy of the Team Canada partnership to create hope, opportunity 
and jobs.
<P>
	The government's balanced and steady approach to deficit 
reduction has led to a steady reduction in the deficit and in interest 
rates. Careful spending cuts, coupled with a well thought out 
restructuring of the government will lead to a stronger economy 
and to job growth.
<P>
	Members of the business community have often stated that if 
government would get it finances in order, private industry would 
create jobs. The government is putting its finances in order and is 
challenging Canadian businesses to move forward on job creation, 
particularly for our young children.
<P>
	Of course, getting the government's finances in order is not an 
end in itself. The steps we are taking are necessary to defend and 
maintain social programs, such as medicare, that embody the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="63"> 63 </A></B>
<P>
values that Canadians hold  dear such as caring for the less 
fortunate and maintaining a high quality of life in all areas of the 
country.
<P>
	As was stated yesterday in the throne speech, the government 
will continue to defend the principles of the Canada Health Act: 
comprehensiveness, universality, portability and accessibility. The 
government will maintain the sustainability of social programs by 
putting a floor under the cash component of the Canada health and 
social transfer so there is a steady level of cash transfers to the 
provinces. The government will also be working with the provinces 
to develop common standards to maintain our social programs.
<P>
	Youth unemployment is a major challenge to the government 
and it is addressing this through programs such as the youth 
internship program and Youth Service Canada. The proposal to 
double the number of federal summer jobs this coming summer 
will be a great help to students. These programs help young people 
make the transition to the working world giving them the 
experience they need to get their first job.
<P>
	Whenever I visit Mohawk College or the high schools on 
Hamilton Mountain, I am impressed by the intelligence and 
enthusiasm of these students. Canada's young people are 
tremendously talented and have a great deal to offer our country.
<P>
	It is our responsibility through programs such as Youth Service 
Canada to give young Canadians the opportunity to put their talents 
to use. In my riding of Hamilton Mountain a $150,000 youth 
service project, which will help to reduce the incidence of car theft 
and vandalism, is co-sponsored by the Hamilton-Wentworth 
Regional Police and the federal government. Along with improving 
community safety this project will provide young Hamiltonians 
with valuable experience in planning management and 
communication skills. The government has also taken steps in the 
throne speech to reassure all Canadians that their retirement years 
will be financially secure years. The benefits of current seniors will 
be protected. Adjustments to the Canada pension plan will be made 
to ensure that future seniors can enjoy their retirement.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	Canada is the best country in the world to live in. In order to keep 
making our country even greater we must take steps to enhance the 
security of our communities as well as improve our economic 
security.
<P>
	Recent reforms of the justice system such as amendments to the 
corrections act, gun control legislation and amendments to the 
Young Offenders Act will help ensure the safety of our streets and 
neighbourhoods. Proposed changes such as legislation on 
dangerous offenders, improvements to the stalking legislation and 
the establishment of DNA data banks will future enhance safety for 
Canadians.
<P>
	Security of our communities does not simply refer to personal 
safety. Environmental protection is equally important. The health 
of Canada's air and water is vital to our quality of life. In 
recognition of the importance of our environment, the government 
is committed to modernizing the Environmental Protection Act. 
We must take steps now to ensure our children can still enjoy a 
clean environment in the future.
<P>
	The Liberal government is determined to work with all 
Canadians to build a modern, united country to face the challenges 
and opportunities of the 21st century. For all our differences, 
Canadians live in peace and we have together built a successful and 
prosperous country that is the envy of the world. Our shared values 
unite us more than our differences divide us. Our success in the 
world is proof of the wisdom of continuing to build on those 
common values.
<P>
	Canada is more than the sum of its parts. Together we can and we 
will build on our common achievements to create an even better 
country in the years ahead. Canada is a country committed to 
international co-operation, open to the world and open to new 
citizens of every heritage.
<P>
	Canada must continue to engage in the events of the world and 
promote peace, economic development and environmental 
protection on a worldwide basis.
<P>
	While continuing efforts to reduce economic barriers around the 
world, we must continue efforts to reduce trade barriers among our 
own provinces. All Canadians have a role to play in modernizing 
our country. Every single citizen can and must have a say in our 
future. We must not let the voices of disaffection dominate the 
discussion or convince us that we would be better off divided and 
separate rather than united and working together.
<P>
	Working together, we can build on our wonderful heritage, our 
incredible blessings, our amazing diversity and our limitless 
opportunities to ensure that Canada will always be a beacon to the 
world of hope, of freedom, of human dignity, of peace and of 
decency. It is a very exciting future that Canadians can and will 
chart together. That is the message of the speech from the throne, 
for that is the real message of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there has been negotiation among the parties and I believe you will 
find unanimous consent that the House continue to sit this day after 
6.30 p.m. in order to consider the following motion:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House take note of Canada's current and future international 
peacekeeping commitments in Haiti, with particular reference to Canada's 
willingness to play a major role in the next phase of the international 
community's efforts to sustain a secure and stable environment in Haiti.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="64"> 64 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, during consideration of the said motion, no member shall speak for more 
than 10 minutes and no dilatory motions or quorum calls shall be receivable; and</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>At 9.30 p.m., or when no more members rise to speak, whichever is earlier, 
the Speaker shall adjourn the House until the next sitting day.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1750 )</B>
<P>
	(Motion agreed to.)
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Winnipeg North Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, before beginning my speech in response to the speech 
from the throne I would like to take a minute to thank the House for 
the co-operation I received as Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Finance. It is a heavy workload and requires the 
patience of the Speakers and of the table officers to make sure the 
work gets done.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to thank the Bloc Quebecois member who will sit 
with me on the finance committee. I think we will have a great time 
working together.
<P>
	We are proud of our record for the first two years of our mandate. 
We have fulfilled the vast majority of the commitments made in the 
red book and our first speech from the throne. We have focused on 
our plan to promote job creation and economic growth. As a result, 
500,000 jobs were created and our growth rate is one of the highest 
among industrialized countries.
<P>
	This throne speech outlines our plan of action for the second half 
of our mandate. Our goals remain unchanged. We want to build on 
what we have accomplished so far. This throne speech has three 
main thrusts: job creation and economic growth, the security of 
individual Canadians, and streamlining the federal system to 
strengthen Canadian unity.
<P>
	We will put special emphasis on three major areas, namely 
young people, science and technology, and trade.
<P>
	We will continue to foster a healthy economic climate by 
strengthening the basic parameters of our economy. To this end, we 
will meet our deficit reduction targets and work together with the 
provinces at harmonizing sales taxes and eliminating domestic 
trade impediments.
<P>
	We will therefore rely on the Team Canada partnership between 
federal and provincial governments and the private sector to create 
jobs for young people; double the number of federal summer 
student jobs as early as this summer; support technology 
development in the aerospace industry, in environmental 
technologies and in biotechnology, and launch a Canadian 
technology network; expand the access to the information highway, 
particularly in rural communities; undertake further Team Canada 
missions under the leadership of the Prime Minister; and finally, 
announce new measures to enhance export development and 
financing.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I will also spend some time today addressing the very real issue 
facing Canadians, the Canadian pension system, an issue that 
perhaps has been discussed the most in the time leading up to the 
speech from the throne and next week's budget, as announced by 
the Minister of Finance today.
<P>
	I cannot think of anything that hits more at home to the security 
of Canadians than what they believe their pensions will be as they 
retire. Because of great media speculation the government has 
decided to take the initiative to bring security to the system.
<P>
	I as a Canadian and as a Liberal and now as a parliamentarian am 
very proud of the progress made among our seniors since the 
mid-1960s. The cornerstones of that program are the Canada 
pension plan, old age security and the guaranteed income 
supplement.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	We have designed a program which, more so than any other 
country in the industrial world, has lifted literally millions of 
people from the edge of poverty or in dire straits during their 
retirement years to having a secured monthly pension.
<P>
	Any discussions in public debate, whether from the government 
in the House, from the public in general or from researchers, that 
insinuates the Canada pension plan cannot be secured and that old 
age security is about to be taken away creates an insecurity among 
older Canadians that reverberates across the country. My 
constituency of Winnipeg North Centre is one of the areas in which 
many elderly live in very poor conditions. This worries people.
<P>
	Let me assure the House on behalf of the government that we are 
making every effort to secure and modernize our pension plan. 
Perhaps the best way to think about this is to realize that people my 
age, in their late 40s, the baby boomers, will be hitting retirement 
age in approximately 15 years. That means an effective planning 
system has to be set in motion and we literally need a 15-year 
countdown. We have to facilitate and maintain the security of those 
who are already in retirement because they have the least flexibility 
to respond to new situations.
<P>
	That is why our low inflation strategy, our price stability 
strategy, helps so many seniors. It gives them the security that their 
monthly pensions will not be eaten away at 5 per cent, 10 per cent 
or 15 per cent per year, rates which are not just a nightmare but 
rates we have already had in our own lifetime.
<P>
	The purpose of the Canada pension plan review, which will be 
launched in March with the co-operation of the provinces, done 
jointly with them, is to ask Canadians how they want to secure their 
Canada pension plan. Do you want to see any cuts in benefits? Do 
you want to see  increases in contribution rates? Do you want to see 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="65"> 65 </A></B>
<P>
changes in disability pensions? Do you want to see changes in the 
age of entitlement?
<P>
	None of the 11 governments involved, as well as the two 
territories, is coming with preconceived ideas as to how it should 
be changed. However, they are coming with the one idea that it 
must be changed and that it must be done jointly. I am very 
optimistic that by the time the new year rolls around again we will 
have a resecured Canada pension plan with a new structure that will 
enable Canadians to understand that long into this 15-year horizon 
they will have a plan that is stable and able to finance their own 
retirement.
<P>
	On the issue of government funded pensions, not the CPP which 
is paid for by the employers and employees but the general pension 
plan, it is incumbent on all parliamentarians to enter into a debate 
with the retired and also with people in their 40s and 50s about the 
retirement plans they have, how we can best structure all the 
components, whether RRSPs, the OAS or the GIS, and what sort of 
package can we put together that will help them in their retirement 
plans.
<P>
	I can think of no other purpose for parliamentarians, no higher 
calling right now, than the accomplishment of security for seniors. 
This will require work at a time when the government maintains its 
deficit reduction strategy. The less call we make on the public 
purse the better off the country will be.
<P>
	Because we are a Liberal government we have priorities. Our 
priorities are to focus on social security. We will have negotiations 
with the provinces this year to jointly set out a framework for the 
continuation of social and health transfers. We will make sure that 
social policy has direction and that the right thing is done for 
Canadians from sea to sea to sea.
<P>
	We will also ensure, as outlined in the speech from the throne, 
that the cash component of the transfer does not disappear and that 
Canadians know that real money will continue to be put in the 
system by the federal government. This will bring upon us a new 
level of co-operation among the provinces so we can be assured 
that we have a transfer which is flexible, which allows the 
provinces to do what they think is best and is done in the 
framework agreed to by all of us and with the declared values we 
have as Canadians toward the health system, social assistance and 
post-secondary education.
<P>
	These are the parameters of the government. This is what we are 
trying to do. The social agenda is evolving. It began with the 
former Minister of Human Resources Development. It is being 
continued with the present minister who is being assisted by the 
Minister of Finance and is being led by the Prime Minister. This is 
the cornerstone to providing social security for Canadians of all 
ages and turning our attention to the youth.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	I say to the people of Winnipeg North Centre, this speech from 
the throne addresses issues of prime concern to you. We will have 
in front of us an agenda that treats people as fairly as possible and 
gives us a sense of purpose in our social policy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I wish I could share the optimism that the hon. 
member had for the future of the Canada pension plan. He seems to 
think that some minor adjustments and a slight increase of the 
contributions to the plan will salvage it.
<P>
	He also talked about the baby boomers in his presentation. I 
happen to be in that group and one of many millions of Canadians 
who wonder whether there will be a CPP around when we reach 
eligibility age.
<P>
	Another factor that he did not discuss in his speech should be 
considered. When we baby boomers were teenagers at the time of 
the centennial, the federal debt was only $17 billion. The 
population was about 20 million. Twenty-nine years later, 1996, the 
debt has multiplied 34 times. It is now $570-odd billion and is 
growing by over $90 million per day. This debt will be borne by the 
baby boomers as well.
<P>
	How does the hon. member expect the younger generation, the 
children of the baby boomers, to make higher contributions to the 
CPP to fund our retirement while heaping on them a debt that is 
continuing to grow by $90 million a day? There are already three 
Liberal budgets or another $100 billion to add to that debt.
<P>
	If it were just the CPP contributions that were going to go up, 
maybe the younger generation would be able to shoulder it. They 
will have to shoulder the interest on the increase of $100 billion in 
three years and no plan to balance the budget in the near future. The 
projection now is 2 per cent of GDP and 2 per cent is still billions 
and billions of dollars added to our debt every year.
<P>
	We are handing this over to the baby boomers' children as well. 
They are going to be shouldering higher CPP deductions or 
premiums or however we arrange it, plus paying higher taxes to 
pay the interest on the debt which continues to grow.
<P>
	Certainly it is not a fair burden to place on our children. I do not 
really think they will be able to shoulder it unless we take more 
responsible actions sooner.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not share the total pessimism of 
the opposition spokesperson but I understand his frustration. If he 
thinks he is frustrated, I can say what it is like being a 
parliamentary secretary in the Department of Finance for the last 
two years and having to deal with reality every month.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="66"> 66 </A></B>
<P>
	The reality is that the government has made tremendous strides 
in the steps of reduction strategy and  that it will in the next couple 
of years reach the targets that are acceptable to all Canadians. It 
will show tremendous progress on that front.
<P>
	It has to be remembered that the drain being put on young people 
is untenable unless we change our ways. We agree with members 
opposite 100 per cent on that issue. It is hard to imagine that the 
Government of Canada will probably have to have a cash excess 
each year of about $50 billion to match interest rates for a while. 
That is a tremendous burden.
<P>
	Having said that, the reductions that we are making in public 
expenditures and in interest rates, and the modest economic growth 
that we are seeing, are still contributing to a more positive cash 
flow situation for the federal government. I am optimistic that we 
will be able to hit these targets and give people enough tax base so 
that they can accommodate any changes in the CPP.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we also are very concerned about what is happening with 
CPP money. We hear the government is floating ideas such as the 
age of qualification is going to have to change, the amount of 
premiums that are collected are going to have to increase and 
perhaps benefits decrease, or a combination of those.
<P>
<B>(1805 )</B>
<P>
	Looking at the money that is collected, I understand that it is 
then loaned back to the provinces at non-market rates. What is the 
government suggesting that it do? Perhaps the money that is 
collected can receive a proper return on the international market 
rather than be given at non-market rates to the provinces.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> Mr. Speaker, the reality is that the Government of 
Canada has not made any of these proposals but all 11 
governments, including the 10 provinces, have agreed to discuss 
these ideas. What Canadians tell us will be the way that we decide 
to go.
<P>
	On the question of the money being available to the provinces, 
that is true. One of the questions in the discussion paper that has 
been circulated is whether or not that should continue. If premiums 
change, for example, there could be quite a pool of capital and I 
think we should all take an interest in how it should be invested.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to take part in this debate on the throne 
speech. What surprised me most in the throne speech the governor 
general made yesterday is the way in which the truth was doctored. 
In the speech from the throne, the government is doctoring the truth 
when it says that is has honoured its commitments. This is the first 
comment that came to our minds and it is crystal-clear.
<P>
	When you examine the speech from the throne, you realize that 
some of the commitments mentioned in there are somewhat similar 
to the commitments the federal government made in its inaugural 
speech, on January 18, 1994. Let us review some of these 
commitments, one by one. The first commitment made by the 
government, and it was even mentioned in its platform, was to 
control the increase of the national debt and to control, through 
sound management practices, the deficit, year after year.
<P>
	But, as you well know, Mr. Speaker, to control the annual deficit, 
the Minister of Finance is not using sound management practices, 
but rather measures to get out of his responsibilities in terms of 
public finance. The first of these measures, as we keep telling 
everyone, is to reduce the deficit by shovelling part of it into the 
provinces' backyards. These cuts already represent $7 billion in 
Canada, and almost $2 billion in Quebec, which the provincial 
government will have to make up for in the next two years.
<P>
	We also know that, far from controlling the deficit by efficiently 
managing public finances, the Minister of Finance is stealing the 
surplus in the unemployment insurance fund, surplus that should 
reach in the next few years an average of $5 billion a year. What the 
Minister of Finance is not saying and what does not transpire in the 
speech from the throne is that the federal government stopped 
putting money into the unemployment insurance fund several years 
ago. Since the surplus in the unemployment insurance fund is used 
for this purpose, I guess we can say that the government is using it 
as a hidden tax to control the deficit.
<P>
	Otherwise, the deficit control we were promised in the first 
speech from the throne and again in yesterday's speech would 
never come about, because nothing has been done to reduce the 
deficit in a correct and fair way, through good fiscal management. 
Nothing has been done to reduce the deficit. This is the first 
commitment that has not been honoured.
<P>
	The second commitment that has not been honoured, and we see 
it again in yesterday's speech from the throne, is the abolition of 
the GST. The Prime Minister had even made this a major campaign 
issue in the fall of 1993. The government is dragging its feet. It is 
searching for a solution to this commitment made by the Prime 
Minister, and Quebecers as well as Canadians are still waiting for 
this promise to be fulfilled. So that is another commitment that has 
not been honoured.
<P>
	Third commitment. The government is speaking as if it had just 
arrived in this House.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	It says that we need a research and development policy, a policy 
in the bio-food industry. It says we need a research and 
development policy because Canada is lagging behind. Canada has 
been lagging behind for ten years and it has been nearly three years 
since government  members had made this a major issue in the 
1993 campaign, even before being elected. I remember the 
Minister of Finance making a speech in Montreal, as early as 1989, 
on the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="67"> 67 </A></B>
<P>
importance of research and development. I remember him saying 
that year that Canada was lagging behind considerably in this area, 
which undermined its ability to create in the medium term steady 
and meaningful jobs.
<P>
	This government and its spokesperson, the Minister of Finance, 
are making empty promises. The research and development policy 
never became reality, the money was never spent, the billion 
dollars that were promised during the election campaign were 
never invested, and the government is now telling us in this speech 
from the throne that it is going to do all that.
<P>
	What is another commitment from the Liberal government 
worth when it did not honour its previous commitments in the first 
half of its mandate? As for the fourth commitment, the government 
promised to help Montreal get back on its feet. As the Leader of the 
Opposition was saying this afternoon, Montrealers are still waiting 
for concrete measures that will help them get out of the slump.
<P>
	Another commitment, and it struck me as soon as I heard the 
speech from the throne. Not only have the Liberals not honoured 
their commitments, but they also have shirked their 
responsibilities. Regarding the environment, the speech says that 
``The solutions to many environmental problems lie outside our 
borders''. It is shameful to say such a thing. At the present time, we 
have a major environmental problem called the raising of the 
<I>Irving Whale</I>. The Deputy Prime Minister, who recently held the 
environment portfolio, spent over $12 million on a solution which 
we knew would fail; now, we have to go back to square one and the 
whole shoreline of the Magdalene Islands might be polluted. When 
I see such statements, I am ashamed of this government.
<P>
	This afternoon, I listened to the Prime Minister. I listened to him 
religiously since he is the chief of state, the Prime Minister. He 
urged us to follow up on Canada's success story. He said: ``A 
success which we must continue to build''. But on which 
foundations? The foundations can be found in the throne speech; 
the first one is national unity. The government wants to continue to 
build this country by refusing to recognize Quebec's specificity, 
Quebec's identity, and the existence of a people in Quebec.
<P>
	The throne speech is nothing but a frame-up; it says that the 
government wants to entrench the distinct society in the 
Constitution. But what the Prime Minister does not say, and what 
the governor general did not say yesterday while speaking on his 
behalf, is that entrenching an empty shell does not change the fact 
that it is still an empty shell. This is the kind of distinct society the 
Prime Minister would eventually like to entrench in the 
Constitution while trying to convince the  other provinces that it 
would not deprive them of anything. This is what the Prime 
Minister was saying this afternoon. However what the Prime 
Minister overlooked is that if that concept does not take away from 
other provinces and does not offload anything in the provinces' 
backyards, maybe it means nothing to Quebec. That is what we 
understood and that is what Quebecers understood last October 30.
<P>
	Now we see that the Prime Minister did not get that message. 
Quebecers are no longer looking for symbolism, they want real 
actions, real measures, a true recognition, and the Prime Minister 
will not be able to fool them. He asks us to continue building 
Canada's prosperity on another basis. We find the same thing again 
in the throne speech on the continuation of jurisdictional fights. 
What a wonderful program. What a fine perspective. In two 
different places in the throne speech, they announce that, first of 
all, the federal government will withdraw from certain areas of 
jurisdiction it now occupies. We should thank the government, but 
at the same time, it announces that the measures taken in those 
areas could be transferred to municipal authorities or to the private 
sector, that it could bypass the provinces and go directly to those 
instances.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	When the federal government speaks about withdrawing from 
certain fields, certain areas it now occupies illegitimately, because 
they are areas of provincial jurisdiction, of Quebec jurisdiction, 
like occupational training, forestry and mining, it is not offering us 
a gift. And it is certainly not offering a gift when it says: ``Not only 
do I recognize that I was occupying these areas inequitably, but 
from now on, I will go over the head of the Quebec government and 
contact directly its own creations, the municipalities, or I will 
simply give more power to the private sector in areas falling under 
Quebec's jurisdiction''.
<P>
	This does not make any sense. We should also thank it for asking 
us to continue to build on the success of Canada when it more or 
less says in the throne speech: ``From now on, I will continue 
invading jurisdictions that are exclusively provincial and I will do 
so with the help of a majority of Canadian provinces''.
<P>
	What it means is that if Quebec, a distinct people, does not want 
the federal government to implement a Canada-wide program in an 
area which is its exclusive jurisdiction, it will be isolated if a 
majority of provinces decide otherwise. This is a way of isolating 
Quebec. This is what the government calls an invitation to build on 
this country's success.
<P>
	The government is also inviting us to continue building this 
country on the basis of a smaller social security net. Let us not kid 
ourselves. I almost blew my top when I read that in the speech from 
the throne. The Governor General started the speech by talking 
about compassion, he said the government showed compassion. 
The truth is,  this government has shown less compassion that the 
Conservatives during their nine year rule. Liberals did their utmost 
to shrink the social security net. How else would you interpret the 
reform of social programs? How else would you interpret the 
general dissatisfaction throughout Canada about this reform of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="68"> 68 </A></B>
<P>
social programs? How else would you interpret this systematic 
attack against the unemployed?
<P>
	Quebecers, like Canadians, know that between talk and action, 
between commitments and what is actually being done, the 
government has left a large gap, and it will remain during the 
second part of its mandate.
<P>
	How could it ask us, ask Quebecers, to continue to build a 
country on the basis of a systematic squandering of public funds? 
How can it ask us to continue working within a system which has 
recently allowed spending $2 billion to buy armoured vehicles in 
peacetime? We should be grateful that we are at peace. How can we 
continue building a country which is buying 1,600 antitank 
missiles at a cost of $23.6 million out of a total program of $230 
million in peacetime? Is this the way to success, to continue 
building a country on the basis of continuing fiscal inequities? We 
can only repeat that popular phrase: ``No thanks''.
<P>
	It is incredible that a government whose spokespersons have 
been talking about compassion, social justice, fiscal justice and 
equity for two years, would have come to a point where it refuses to 
examine the whole system of tax exemptions, a system benefiting 
mostly large corporations which have the means to take advantage 
of it. The government readily accepts that Revenue Canada does 
not even know how much half of the more than 250 such 
exemptions are costing the federal government. We know the value 
of about half of these exemptions.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	According to the Department of Finance, these exemptions to 
large businesses cost taxpayers in Quebec and Canada more than 
$17 billion a year. But for the other part, the other hundred or so 
exemptions, the finance minister and all the government 
representatives have systematically refused for the last two years 
and a half that the House examine their content, their scope, their 
objectives and their costs. Why? In order to continue to build this 
country on the flouting of democratic rules. We also say no thanks, 
Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	A country where, from the very first pages of the throne speech, 
the government says that it respects the October 30 verdict and then 
says: ``But if that happens again, we will not respect it, we will not 
allow Quebecers to choose their future for themselves, we will hold 
a referendum or a Canada-wide consultation to do that'', is a 
country that does not make any sense. It is a country I have more 
and more trouble relating to. It is a country that accepts a 
democratic verdict one day, when it suits it, and at the same time 
decides, through its political representatives, that, if Quebecers 
were to decide  tomorrow to choose a country for themselves, 
perhaps it would not recognize this verdict or perhaps it would hold 
a Canada-wide consultation so that Canadians from the other 
provinces can determine Quebecers' fate and future.
<P>
	In conclusion, I was listening to the Prime Minister who was 
saying earlier, and I quote: ``The world sees Canada very much as a 
real country''. I wondered that he meant by that. We never doubted 
that Canada is a real country. But what the Prime Minister has 
failed to understand is that, next time, Quebecers will also choose a 
real country for themselves, a country where they will feel at home, 
a country where they will not feel increasingly crowded in, for a 
increasing majority of them, a country that they will also be proud 
of, a country where values of compassion, fairness and social 
justice will be expressed in policies on employment, the fight 
against poverty, economic growth and tax reform. That will be a 
real country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Geoff Regan (Halifax West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with interest to the hon. member's speech. He had all sorts of 
complaints about Canada, but he did not make any comparison to 
show the relative importance of all these problems. It is true that 
we, in our country, have many problems. There are always 
problems. The way to solve them is to find solutions. Before saying 
that we must leave this country, however, we should first look at 
the options. We should look at how other countries operate. 
Otherwise, we work in a vacuum. The hon. member has not taken 
that into consideration. I feel that Canadians should always 
consider our position in the world.
<P>
	I have seen very poor countries in the world, such as Haiti. 
Haitians would love to trade their problems for ours, because ours 
are much smaller than theirs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It seems the hon. member is a bit like the airline passenger 
aboard an aeroplane in mid air who decided it was too noisy and so 
he decided to get out. This country may not be perfect. It has a lot 
of problems. It is probably the worst there is, except for all the 
others. The United Nations said it is the best country in the world to 
live in.
<P>
	This member does not want to consider that. He wants to look 
only at the negatives and only at the problems. Yes, there are 
problems and yes, we are committed to working on those problems. 
In the throne speech the government talked about how it is very 
important that we focus on problems like job creation even more 
than we have in the past.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	We have to keep focusing on deficit reduction. It is important we 
get our economic fundamentals right so the economy can create 
jobs. We have interest rates down. We started two years ago. Our 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="69"> 69 </A></B>
<P>
interest rates were three  points above the American's. Now they 
are about the same. That is a great improvement.
<P>
	However, there are still problems. We still need to create more 
jobs. People in my riding of Halifax West are looking for jobs. The 
government has to keep focusing on that. We have to focus more on 
that in the next couple of years. I was glad to hear in the throne 
speech that we will do that.
<P>
	It seems the throne speech sets the government in the right 
direction. The priorities set in the throne speech are Canadian 
priorities. They are priorities of the people of Canada from coast to 
coast, from sea to sea to sea, and they are the priorities of the 
government, as they should be.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier: </B>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member raised several 
points, as comments rather than as questions. I will deal with two 
of those. To be sure, there are problems in Canada and everywhere 
in the world. I am not saying that there are more problems here. I 
am saying, however, that in Canada we are creating our own 
problems.
<P>
	Your government creates problems. Producing a speech from the 
throne that promotes all sorts of measures likely to lead to 
constitutional friction and jurisdictional disputes, regardless of 
how cautiously the government wants to proceed, that is creating 
problems.
<P>
	The other point is the reference to Canada as the best country in 
the world. To say that there is a best country in the world is to insult 
other countries. It is insulting to other countries, because if you live 
in the best country, it means that the others are not as good. The 
fact is that countries are different. The best country is the one we 
have in our heart; it is the one we will build in Quebec.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We must understand the real and durable solution for Quebec 
and Canada, for Quebecers and Canadians, is sovereignty for 
Quebec and the development of a new relationship between the two 
peoples.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am specifically interested in the member's comments earlier 
regarding the armed forces.
<P>
	CFB Chilliwack in my riding is now doomed and destined to be 
closed. It is, unfortunately, the last armed forces base in British 
Columbia. It has brought a lot of consternation and concern to 
many British Columbians that we no longer have an armed forces 
base in British Columbia.
<P>
	The member said we should not be spending money on personnel 
carriers or on weaponry in peace time. To follow that logic, would 
he be willing to give up some of the military establishments in his 
province?
<P>
	Perhaps he could encourage the premier of his province and his 
own party to consider the closure of perhaps Saint-Jean, perhaps 
the F-18 service contract, some of the things that were taken from 
the west. If he finds it offensive, we are willing to look after those 
military establishments in the rest of Canada. I wonder if he thinks 
they should be shut down and moved out of his province or what he 
has in mind for the military.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have this answer to the hon. 
member's two questions. First, as far as Quebec and National 
Defence are concerned, Quebec gets far less than what it pays in 
taxes to the federal government. We get about 13 per cent of the 
spending-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Look at the figures instead of acting like your 
minds are already made up. Look at the Statistics Canada reports, 
look at the figures for spending and investment by National 
Defence in Quebec and compare them with the figures of the other 
provinces, and you will realize what is going on. You say you are 
pragmatic, so be pragmatic for once. Check your information. 
Quebec gets 13 per cent of National Defence spending although it 
pays 25 per cent of the tax bill.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I would appreciate it if hon. members 
would address the Chair. I get very lonesome when you speak 
directly to the other members.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> I apologize, Mr. Speaker. They were talking about 
downsizing at the Department of National Defence. Downsizing 
should not mean closing bases right and left but taking a long hard 
look at what should and should not be done.
<P>
	Does it make sense that at Canada's Department of National 
Defence, there are ten times more officers in the senior ranks than 
in most industrialized countries? These senior officers are paid 
salaries ranging from $75,000 to $150,000, or more, plus a 
chauffeur and a limousine, in some cases. Could there be too many 
of them? Does it make sense to spend money on anti-tank missiles 
in peacetime nowadays? Does it serve any purpose to invest in very 
sophisticated submarines?
<P>
	Downsizing also means looking at the mandate of the 
Department of National Defence. In peacetime, it should be 
peacekeeping. Peacekeepers need training, they need bases and all 
the infrastructures, but they do not need anti-tank missiles.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I recognize the hon. member for 
Kootenay East. The hon. member will appreciate that the debate 
ends in two minutes. There will be two minutes remaining until 
next time. He has a minute and his colleague will have a minute to 
reply.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the two 
years that we have been here we have heard the  Bloc Quebecois 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="70"> 70 </A></B>
<P>
members consistently talk about their vision of Quebec, which I 
suppose is fine except when they are the official opposition.
<P>
	In the context of the majority of the member's comments, would 
he not agree that they are all virtually focused on the whole issue of 
the province of Quebec as a province of Canada and that is it? In 
other words, in his judgment what purpose is he or his party serving 
in this House in the role of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, my answer to my Reform Party 
colleague is simply this: During the past two years we have spoken 
to Canadians across Canada, from east to west, and recently we 
heard from Canadians who said they liked the Bloc Quebecois as 
the official opposition and even hoped we would win the three 
byelections in Quebec, so there would be no more of this talk about 
the Reform Party claiming to be the official opposition on the right.

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> My colleagues, this is the 
first opportunity I have had since the new session started to thank 
you all for the support you have shown for me in my role as the 
Chair.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I appreciate your renewed confidence in my abilities and will

	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.)</B> 
moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House take note of Canada's current and future international 
peacekeeping commitments in Haiti, with particular reference to Canada's 
willingness to play a major role in the next phase of the international 
community's efforts to sustain a secure and stable environment in Haiti.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I remind all colleagues that 
each intervention will be only 10 minutes without questions or 
comments.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Ten minutes without questions and comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to open this special debate on Canada's participation in 
another peacekeeping mission in Haiti.
<P>
	First of all, I would like to thank my fellow members of this 
House, members of the Bloc Quebecois, the Reform Party, the 
Conservative Party, the New Democratic Party as well as those of 
my own party, the government party. This debate would not have 
been possible without your support, and I thank you for it.
<P>
	I am sorry this debate was held on such short notice. As you 
know, things are happening very fast in New York, at the UN, and 
the Canadian government may have to make a decision in the very 
near future. I appreciate the co-operation of all parties in this new 
Parliament. This way, the people of Canada will be able to express 
their views to their elected representatives on an important foreign 
affairs issue.
<P>
	I also want to point out that today's consultation will not the last 
on Canada's foreign policy or on Haiti. And I promise that, as far as 
possible, future debates will be held under better circumstances.
<P>
<B>(1905)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We all know how important the situation in Haiti is to us as 
Canadians, to the Haitians and to the world community as a whole. 
It has in the last several months been a remarkable demonstration 
of a country under a major process of democratization. For a 
country that used to be dominated by dictatorship, severe police, 
autocracy and by a total elimination of human rights and economic 
hope, it has now had some of that restored.
<P>
	Now that the euphoria of the first months of freedom is 
beginning to set into reality, we must dedicate ourselves to the 
continuous building and construction of that country.
<P>
	The new president, Préval, was sworn in on February 7. I am 
pleased to say my new colleague, the hon. Pierre Pettigrew, 
Minister of International Co-operation, attended the inauguration. 
The president made a representation to the United Nations of the 
need for continued assistance while his country does the 
rebuilding. The first necessary condition is long term stability.
<P>
	Haitian police force members, many having been trained by our 
country and by others, are ready to ensure their responsibilities. 
However, they are young and inexperienced and still need time to 
learn on the job. As a result there has to be a complementary 
international presence to ensure stability and security for the 
population to allow its fledgling institutions of democracy to be 
formed. It they are left on their own at this crucial stage, the 
likelihood is that the problems would mount and there would be no 
backup or security for their initial efforts.
<P>
	Over the past few weeks I have had a number of consultations on 
the issue of Haiti. My first trip as foreign affairs minister was to the 
United Nations where I  consulted with the secretary-general and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="72"> 72 </A></B>
<P>
officials of the UN to ensure that any continuation of mandate in 
Haiti would have sufficient resources to meet the task.
<P>
	We have learned our lessons. We realize that when the United 
Nations takes on a role there must be proper and effective resources 
to meet the needs.
<P>
	I have also had the opportunity to hold consultations with 
members of the opposition parties in the past two weeks to talk to 
them about what their concerns would be.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Last week, I met with members of the Haitian community in 
Montreal. They show great solidarity. They are also quite inventive 
in coming up with solutions to the problems facing their home 
country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I also brought the views of Canadians to bear by opening up this 
question on the Internet so we were able to ensure that Canadians 
from a wide variety of perspectives could let us know what their 
thoughts were. The vast majority are very supportive of the 
continuation of Canada's role of support.
<P>
	As members know, at the present moment the security council is 
still debating the issue. The secretary-general has made a request 
that Canada would take leadership as the mandate of the Americans 
comes to an end at the end of this week.
<P>
	The security council is considering the questions of the size of 
the force and the length of the tenure. Certain members of the 
security council have raised questions, as they have a right to do. 
However, because we believe so strongly in the need to continue 
and maintain a UN presence, an international presence in Haiti, we 
have come forward with proposals and solutions we think will 
allow that force to continue and allow the deadlock to be broken, 
once again demonstrating that as a country we are in a unique and 
special position to provide leadership, to put forward ideas and to 
help create bridges, as our Prime Minister said earlier, for solutions 
to this problem.
<P>
	What we are suggesting in effect is that if the size of the UN 
force is not sufficient to meet the task, we could provide auxiliary 
forces still under the control of a Canadian general, under the UN 
rules of engagement admission, to ensure that fully adequate 
resources are available when necessary to maintain the full and 
adequate positioning of the international forces there and to 
maintain the security and stability required.
<P>
	It is our hope the proposals we have put forward will serve as the 
basis for the resolution of this matter.
<P>
<B>(1910)</B>
<P>
	At this moment the UN security council has not made its final 
decision. It is looking at these proposals and although the time is 
getting short we are confident that  because of interventions we 
made we will find an adequate, proper and effective response to the 
request of the Haitian government.
<P>
	We still need and want the expressions of opinion of members of 
Parliament on what they think would be the most effective, 
adequate, proper, constructive way for the force to continue its 
leadership.
<P>
	When the official decision is made by the security council we 
would be in a position to make a proper and immediate response. 
Our will is there. Our inclination and disposition are there. We are 
finding the solutions but we need to have the views of members of 
Parliament.
<P>
	If the decision is made by the security council for Canada to take 
on its leadership and for us to provide the kind of resources 
required, I will maintain constant communication and discussion 
with the new foreign affairs committee so that it will be fully 
informed on an ongoing basis.
<P>
	I have had discussions with members of the opposition and they 
have expressed to me their interest in having the committee as a 
monitoring agency able to maintain a constant overview and 
assessment of Canadian overseas operations. We will make that 
initiative with the committee once it is established, report on a 
periodic basis and receive responses so that Parliament is a 
constant partner in this very important mission.
<P>
	Canada will not be alone. Other countries are making their own 
interest known. The Pakistan and Bangladesh governments have 
indicated their willingness to continue the missions. The French 
government has told me that it is continuing to be involved in the 
training of police forces and the maintenance of that area. The 
Americans are maintaining missions of economic development and 
support in that country.
<P>
	Beyond the pure maintenance of order we must also ensure 
rebuilding, economic development, social development, 
development of a civil society in Haiti, building up judicial 
institutions and proper ways the government is allowed to conduct 
its efforts.
<P>
	Canada cannot try to solve every problem everywhere in the 
world but this is a place where we can make a difference as 
Canadians. We have been asked to take a role. We have the 
reputation and the experience.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Our country is a bilingual country capable of providing 
peacekeeping services in French. Since Haiti is a member of the 
Francophonie, this special role played by Canada will make a 
difference for the people of Haiti.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I hope we as Canadians can offer hope to the people of that 
country. They are looking for help. They want support. They are 
starting an exciting process of rebuilding a country, rebuilding a 
democracy. Canada can make a difference to those people in terms 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="73"> 73 </A></B>
<P>
of expanding  and enhancing the role of the United Nations, giving 
the international community a place and once again demonstrating 
to the world that Canada is the real peacekeeper.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, for 
some time now we have been given the opportunity to participate in 
debates on peacekeeping missions. In that regard, I want to tell the 
new Minister of Foreign Affairs, whom I congratulate on his 
appointment, that we are pleased to once again take part in a debate 
on peacekeeping missions in which Canada might take part.
<P>
	In light of previous debates on this issue, of the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs' speech, and of the motion, it goes without saying 
that, as a matter of principle, the Bloc Quebecois supports this type 
of motion, which proposes that Canada play a role in helping to 
maintain peace in Haiti whose population, as we know, was ruled 
by dictators for many years.
<P>
<B>(1915)</B>
<P>
	However, I remember that we asked on several occasions, 
including the two debates on Bosnia, that the government come up 
with specific and well-defined criteria before holding a debate in 
the House.
<P>
	In his speech, the Minister of Foreign Affairs shows a great deal 
of compassion and goodwill, reflecting Canadian values regarding 
peacekeeping missions, and the Bloc Quebecois fully agrees with 
those. We have no problem with that.
<P>
	However, we also said on several occasions that some specific 
criteria should be set, that the duration of the missions should be 
determined, as well as the mandate, the number of troops to be 
sent, and the cost of these missions. It appears that nothing has yet 
been decided, even though cabinet apparently agreed, based on the 
information that we have, to send some 750 peacekeepers to Haiti 
to carry out that mission and to ensure the establishment of a 
democracy.
<P>
	But nowhere is there any mention of what Canada's mandate 
would be. It was assumed that Canada might take over command of 
the UN mission and that American troops would leave, to be 
replaced by troops from other countries.
<P>
	As I said, we readily support this principle but I may have to play 
the killjoy here and say that, in my view, not much has changed in 
the preparation of peace missions. We seem to answer requests by 
the UN without knowing in advance what the real needs are or what 
we can offer.
<P>
	It even happened a few times that we exhausted our own 
peacekeepers. I see the Minister of National Defence sitting in the 
front benches, and I remember quite well that we often heard him 
say that if we were to provide more peacekeepers we would not 
have enough soldiers  for the turnover. Some of them were on their 
fourth or fifth tour of duty in Bosnia. And here we are, committing 
to yet another mission. Far from me to suggest that we do not agree 
with that except that, in the last debate on Bosnia, we had asked for 
exact figures and we still have not received them.
<P>
	The planning seems to be somewhat improvised. I would say this 
is rather what we have come to expect from this government over 
the last two years. There is no shortage of great ideas and grand 
principles, but there does not seem to be any planning. Right now 
in Bosnia and in Haiti there are almost 6,000 peacekeepers, 
Americans, a few French, Canadian, and Dutch troops, etc. I will 
not give a full list. There are also almost 800 police officers. Yet in 
spite of all that aid, there are problems. It is very difficult to disarm 
the Haitian putschists. In fact, Haitian citizens have complained 
about the non-application of these standards.
<P>
	Considering the scenario that is slowly unfolding, and this is my 
reservation on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois, if the Americans 
withdraw from Haiti and Canada takes over command of the UN 
force with some 2,000 peacekeepers and 500 to 600 police officers, 
how can we expect as Canadians to disarm the putschists? 
Moreover, the UN expects, and this is mentioned in the motion, the 
problems to be solved within six months. Unfortunately, I do not 
agree with that when we see all the problems that have occurred 
since 1991-92. I have a hard time acknowledging that simply by 
arriving with a new mission we will really get what we want.
<P>
<B>(1920)</B>
<P>
	We could support the principle for another reason. During the 
defence policy review, the Bloc Quebecois suggested in its 
dissenting report that Canada should also consider whether its 
universal mission was not overly ambitious and whether it would 
not be more appropriate for it to concentrate its efforts in areas of 
the world where its presence is more natural, such as in America 
and the Caribbean. We said that, by establishing a regional profile, 
Canada could better manage and plan requests from the UN while 
giving Canadian military peacekeepers better and more thorough 
training. This suggestion was made in a dissenting report tabled in 
October 1994. We repeated it in the debate on Bosnia and it seems 
to have gone unheeded, unfortunately. Here is another instance of 
lack of planning.
<P>
	I say again, in terms of the principle itself, the Bloc Quebecois 
supports the Canadian mission without hesitation. We would even 
say that-as the Minister of Foreign Affairs said-it is really 
Canada's role, in the end, given that Haitians are part of the 
francophone community. Obviously, being French speaking, troops 
coming from the Val-Cartier base, in my riding, will find it easier 
to relate to the Haitian people than American peacekeepers did due 
to the language barrier.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="74"> 74 </A></B>
<P>
	On the other hand, I do have other reservations regarding this 
mission. This afternoon, during question period, I asked the 
defence minister to confirm the information we had to the effect 
that General Daigle might be appointed the commanding officer 
of the UN force in Haiti.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, allow me to raise the issue again since the defence 
minister told me that he would comment on it during the 
emergency debate. I am referring to the problems in Somalia, to the 
attack on the Quebec Citadel, and other problems the minister is 
probably aware of, including the incidents in Gagetown when 
General Daigle was not yet general. There seems to be a trend as 
revealed by the inquiry on the deployment of the airborne regiment 
in Somalia and all the problems surrounding certain individuals. 
This causes me some concern and my colleagues are of a same 
mind. We are concerned even though the minister told us he has 
full confidence in the new general. We are concerned about the 
history of problems which have been more or less fixed and, I 
would say, sometimes covered up. This is another reservation I 
want to mention, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	In conclusion, I will say that the Bloc agrees in principle, with a 
few reservations: we do not know the costs, and we do not know the 
mandate nor the criteria, and this is not the first time we are saying 
this. I believe the time has come to present a more specific plan 
before making any further commitment.
<P>
	To conclude, I would like to say there is no doubt that the Haitian 
people needs this and that Canada, because of its geography, must 
take part in this mission. However, as usual, I would appreciate if 
we could have more detailed information, as we have requested, in 
order to apprise the people of the role our peacekeepers are going to 
play in Haiti, as well as the costs and the means provided to carry 
on this mission.
<P>
<B>(1925)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, before I begin my 
speech I want to comment on the minister's statement. He said that 
he would consider using the foreign affairs committee as a vehicle 
through which members could discuss this sort of thing. That 
should be very positive. If foreign affairs is not an area that we can 
approach in a non-partisan way, then there probably is not an area 
where we can. I look forward to that co-operation. I certainly hope 
it works.
<P>
	A few areas must be talked about with regard to Haiti and this 
decision. As the last speaker mentioned, this is in our hemisphere. 
We have a great deal at stake in maintaining stability within the 
Americas and can set an example that hopefully the Europeans will 
look at when considerations come up later in the year regarding 
Bosnia.
<P>
	We have to talk about the leadership role we can play in Haiti. I 
believe we are giving an important message which I hope will be
<P>
picked up by everyone. Obviously we are doing a favour for the 
U.S. It is election year but we will not talk about that issue. 
However, we expect this should weigh rather heavily when the US. 
considers setting policy in such matters as international trade and 
removing anti-Canada provisions in the Helms-Burton bill. We 
expect the Minister of Foreign Affairs to make very clear to the 
Americans the help Canada is providing them in this area and that 
certainly we need consideration in other areas-wink, wink.
<P>
	We need to talk about the problems, the factions that exist in 
Haiti and their long history. Guns are still in the hands of people, 
particularly in the countryside. We could talk about the hatred that 
has built up in this country. These are all issues that could be talked 
about.
<P>
	As I understand it, Canada will have control of this mission. That 
was something that really bothered us in Bosnia where we were not 
even part of the contact group. This is a move forward.
<P>
	I want to tell the minister that I was at a town hall meeting last 
night which over 300 people attended. I gave a 20-minute 
presentation on Haiti because I knew this debate was coming 
tonight. That is just about as grassroots and as immediate as one 
can get. A wide range of people were there, not simply party 
members. I think the group was a typical cross section of 
Canadians.
<P>
	I was rather surprised at the message which was: ``You're cutting 
our health care, you're threatening our pensions. Now what about 
this going off to other places?'' I was rather surprised that the 
message was quite as blatant as this, that it was so outspoken.
<P>
	Two people said that Canadians should go but that we should be 
sure the soldiers have the right equipment and the right training. 
They put qualifications on their going. However, a huge number of 
that 300-person crowd said: ``We have real concerns. We think you 
should hold back until you have all the criteria''.
<P>
	What should those criteria be? The message certainly included 
the length of stay. The resolution in the UN very clearly says that 
this is an extension for six months. I listened carefully to the 
minister, making sure that he emphasized that part of the mandate 
in the UN resolution. I trust it will be made clear that in fact it is six 
months. Conditions could arise that would cause us to reconsider 
but there is a six-month period in there.
<P>
	The government should tell Canadians the cost of this. If on 
September 30, 1996, the government tabled in this House what this 
mission cost us, that kind of openness would help to build the 
confidence of the public, certainly the 300 people I talked to last 
night.
<P>
	Is there a contingency plan? When the Americans were there 
they had a carrier in the harbour. They had attack helicopters that 
could be brought in. That is a pretty big  stick to hold over anyone. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="75"> 75 </A></B>
<P>
My question is: Do we have any kind of contingency plan, any kind 
of big stick that we might use to keep people in line?
<P>
<B>(1930)</B>
<P>
	I bring forth again the U.S. election situation. Obviously this 
plays very heavily on why the Americans want to leave. They want 
to leave because they cannot afford to have any ripples and 
obviously this is a major issue.
<P>
	I also want to ask about the OAS. I want to know what the OAS 
has said, what it is going to do, how strongly it is supporting this 
sort of mission. Can we count on the OAS for support and help and 
what sort of help will that entail?
<P>
	It seems to me that the OAS should become a much more 
important body. If we talk about the regional nature of the 
Americas, the OAS should be the one that helps monitor problems 
within that sphere. Obviously Europe is another area and possibly 
Africa is in their sphere. In southeast Asia there is the whole area of 
the Asia-Pacific. If we have these spheres we can then start to 
create a more peaceful world in which all of us can live, trade and 
get along.
<P>
	I also would like to know about the reconstruction. Haiti is a 
country that does not have an education system, that does not have 
the services, the social system. Certainly there are the problems in 
the countryside which we have read about. What sort of plan does 
the UN have, if it has a plan, for the reconstruction of this country? 
We need a long term solution. We do not need to go back in a few 
months, years, or whatever. We need a plan.
<P>
	In conclusion and in talking about this take note debate, I know 
the minister is aware of my concerns that we do not have a sham of 
a debate. We must have a true debate where all members take part 
and represent their constituents on a non-partisan issue like this 
one, where they can actually hear the pros and cons of the debate. 
They would then have the duty in a free vote to vote on what this 
assembly has heard on an issue like this one.
<P>
	Let us take the politics out of it and put it into the area where we 
are really representing. This would be a perfect area to do that. If 
we are sending over 100 troops we should have that sort of debate.
<P>
	As well, it is important that the government at least 48 hours 
prior tells us of the tentative budget, the mission's mandate, the 
size and duration of the commitment, the rules of engagement and 
certainly the rotation and so on planned for those troops. We owe 
that to Canadians. If we cannot get that information then we should 
not be signing a blank cheque. If the UN is so disorganized that it 
cannot provide it, then perhaps we should not be going.
<P>
	These sorts of things are the big issues for Canadians and they 
are asking these questions: What is the  mandate? Would you send 
your son or daughter on this mission? Is it safe? Do we have the 
equipment? Do we have the mandate? We owe it to Canadians to 
come up with the answers to those questions.
<P>
	I believe the House will respond to that in a very positive way. 
That is how we build up the feeling as Canadians that we are proud 
of our peacekeepers, that we are proud of our missions abroad, that 
we are proud to be Canadians. We tend to be shy when we talk 
about ourselves. I know that all members on all sides of the House 
would agree it is time that we became proud Canadians. We can 
demonstrate it through missions like this one provided we have the 
confidence of the people. The way to have that confidence is to 
make it transparent, make it open, let them be part of it, let the 
members of Parliament be part of it and ask the people.
<P>
	I welcome this opportunity to deliver this message. I know that 
our new minister is listening.
<P>
<B>(1935)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I am very happy 
to take part in this debate because it is crucial to Canada's 
peacekeeping mission.
<P>
	It is appropriate that Canada was called upon to play an 
important role in Haiti because we have for a long time participated 
in the peacekeeping missions of the UN and we have made great 
efforts to ensure the security and the stability in the western 
hemisphere.
<P>
	Our participation in Haiti also reflects the reality of bilingualism 
in Canada and our role as a leader within the francophonie.
<P>
	Canada helped in many ways: members of the Canadian armed 
forces and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police participated in the 
UN mission in Haiti; Canada trained Haitians who would form a 
national police force in Haiti; finally, we offered bilateral financial 
help in order to facilitate the social and economical stabilization of 
the country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We have assisted in the last number of months in Haiti. I visited 
our forces last fall in Port-au-Prince and also on a mission to 
Gonaïves.
<P>
	The forces have been composed of about 600 members of the 
Royal Canadian Air Force, some army, but largely air force. I 
underscore this because people often think that peacekeeping 
missions are simply the reserve of the army. The fact is that the 
navy and the air force do participate in these missions and of course 
the air force has carried the load so far in Haiti.
<P>
	What we are talking about this evening and my colleague the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs has talked about the ongoing debate in 
New York, we are talking  about a force that Canada might send of 
up to 750 personnel. It may be configured in an imaginative way, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="76"> 76 </A></B>
<P>
perhaps not all under blue berets, perhaps under green berets. The 
fact is that what is envisaged is to have a Canadian commander.
<P>
	On that point I do regret the comments made by the hon. 
member-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
-for Charlesbourg because he criticized one of our generals. It is 
unfortunate because, as I said during Question Period, I trust all the 
generals in the Canadian forces and I also trust the person who 
raised that question this afternoon and this evening.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The decision as to who commands the Canadian force should we 
participate is a decision for the chief of defence staff. That is an 
operational decision and is one that I shall support.
<P>
	A lot of good work has to be done in Haiti. The reconstruction of 
Haiti is needed. The force in the last six months under the 
leadership of the United Nations has established a degree of peace 
in that area. The crime rate has gone down. Democratic elections 
have been held. Really it has been quite successful.
<P>
	I understand the reservations some members have with respect to 
Canada participating yet again in terms of the length of the mission 
and especially the cost of the mission. I stood up in this House 
sometime ago and I gave an approximate cost for IFOR. I have 
been quite amazed that not the incremental costs on the Canadian 
side but the costs on the NATO side have escalated.
<P>
	I think the hon. members for Red Deer and Charlevoix have 
raised very good points about getting a better handle on the costs 
before we go into these missions. I will not be able to give a full 
accounting of IFOR for a few weeks. I will come back to the House 
and give that information but we do have to be very very careful.
<P>
	With respect to the rules of engagement, we have to be very sure 
that we know under what auspices we are operating there. We have 
had some unpleasant experiences before, one in Somalia, and we 
have learned a lot of lessons.
<P>
	As I mentioned in the IFOR debate before Christmas, it was 
because of the lessons that we had learned in the past that we were 
able to work with our colleagues in NATO to develop rules of 
engagement that were applicable to that particular situation. We 
want to make sure that the rules of engagement for any mission in 
Haiti are certainly ironed out and that we know what we are getting 
into.
<P>
	With respect to the resources devoted to the development of the 
Haitian national police, that is also something we want to know 
about. This is just not a Canadian Armed Forces operation; the 
RCMP have been involved and involved in a terrific way. Inspector 
Pouliot of the RCMP has been well received and has been widely 
congratulated for the efforts he has given to the Haitian police 
force.
<P>
<B>(1940)</B>
<P>
	However we would like to know what the UN has in mind in 
terms of financial resources for that force. The mandate has to be 
appropriate and achievable under the circumstances. We have to 
know the rules of engagement. We have to know what the ultimate 
force size and composition are and they are the subject of 
negotiation, as my colleague just said, and we do not really have a 
clear handle on that. When we get all the costs and conditions, we 
will be in a position to know if the mission is viable. I think it will 
be viable but the questions raised here today have to be answered.
<P>
	The hon. member for Red Deer talked about the public meeting 
in his constituency. I applaud him for having that kind of grassroots 
debate before we came here this evening. He made a statement that 
I would really like to challenge, which is that Canadians, despite 
our own financial woes, despite our own domestic pressures are 
unwilling or unable to help less fortunate nations.
<P>
	Those of us on this side of the House believe that no matter what 
belt tightening we have to do as a government or as a people, the 
generosity of Canadians and the richness of our society is such that 
we must continue to do our bit in helping less fortunate patrons in 
the world. From time to time we run into doubting Thomases so to 
speak about our involvement and where it gets us. We have a track 
record, whether it has been in Somalia, whether in Bosnia, Croatia, 
Rwanda, Haiti in the last number of months, I think the UN 
missions have been successful. They have been worth participating 
in and the UN has made a difference. It has made a difference 
because it has been able to count on the dedication of forces from 
around the world.
<P>
	We have heard the Prime Minister say in this House how highly 
regarded the Canadian men and women of the Canadian Armed 
Forces are, how highly regarded men and women of the Royal 
Canadian Mounted Police are, as are other civilian officials who 
monitor elections, are involved in overseas development work, are 
involved in bringing aid, in monitoring and are involved as 
observers. All the Canadians who have been involved in missions 
in the last few years have done an excellent job. That is why the UN 
needs us.
<P>
	The UN frankly needs Canada. We have been in the forefront of 
peacekeeping development and overseas development generally in 
the last 50 years. If Canada is asked, if the conditions are right and 
if my colleague and I are satisfied that certainly the conditions 
under which we want to operate which we described this evening 
are met, then we should entertain participation in that force.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="77"> 77 </A></B>
<P>
	We owe a helping hand to Haiti. It is the poorest country in 
this hemisphere. I know the country well. I have been there at least 
a dozen times on various business and overseas development 
missions. It is a tragic case of where a people and a country have 
been exploited unduly. We as well as others in the United Nations 
are trying to make a difference to at last get Haiti back on the 
right path to democracy and to the improvement of its economy 
and the lot and lives of individuals.
<P>
	The hon. member for Red Deer raised a very good point, that is, 
the whole question of what guarantees there are if there is a 
problem. This is not quite like Bosnia or Croatia but there are 
precedents where the United States particularly was willing to 
extract forces from Somalia. The U.S. was certainly willing with 
the allies to extract forces from UNPROFOR last year. In fact, we 
were part of that planning. The hon. member should rest assured 
that should anything untoward happen, we have the means, we have 
the ability, we have the equipment and we have the belief that our 
friends and allies would make sure that if there were any undue 
emergencies, they would be there to help us in a difficult situation. 
The precedents have already been set.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the motion 
introduced by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, providing that 
Canada assume control of the UN Mission in Haiti shows, first of 
all, that the United Nations Organization has a great trust in Canada 
and its peacekeeping missions.
<P>
<B>(1945)</B>
<P>
	I would like to stress that the Bloc Quebecois is pleased to see 
that the new Minister of Foreign Affairs is willing to consult 
members of Parliament regarding the Canada's involvement in this 
mission. The goal is to continue the peace mission already in 
progress in Haiti. As I said previously, Canada shows a great deal 
of openness towards countries in need of humanitarian help, or 
support in re-establishing democracy and respect for human rights, 
or help in maintaining a stable and peaceful society, in short, help 
in their peacebuilding efforts.
<P>
	We are currently living in a world where a country cannot ignore 
what other countries are doing or experiencing, and even more so 
when such a country is a friend and almost a neighbour. The need to 
live in peace in the world requires actions and initiatives which 
promote better conditions. Some would tell us, wrongly, that we 
should take care of our deficit and our own problems before giving 
any help to foreign countries. This would be a shortsighted view 
when faced with a problem which might endanger our own 
security.
<P>
	To get a better understanding of the context which led to the 
motion we are debating today, I would like to review briefly the 
various interventions of the UN in  Haiti. In December 1990 the 
long awaited first democratic election brought President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power. The success of that election was 
in part the result of the good work of an international mission of 
observers under the direction of Pierre F. Côté, director general of 
elections in Quebec.
<P>
	Less than a year later, a coup perpetrated by the Haitian army 
forced the new president into exile. Following the coup of 
September 30, 1991 and until the President's return, the people of 
Haiti were under a military regime that scorned the fundamental 
principles of democracy. During those three years, more than 3,000 
people were killed by putschists in summary executions, over and 
above others acts of torture. In the absence of any willingness on 
the part of the military to restore democracy, severe economic 
sanctions were imposed on the country by UN and OAS members.
<P>
	Quebecers and Canadians were among the first to call upon their 
elected representatives to make major efforts in order to restore 
democracy and ensure President Aristide's return. Canada also 
took part in several humanitarian missions under the UN and the 
OAS.
<P>
	Furthermore, more than 500 police officers and peacekeepers 
from Canada and Quebec were involved in the UN mission to Haiti, 
known as UNMIH. That mission was launched pursuant to 
Resolution 867 of the Security Council. It was aimed at 
implementing the Governors Island agreement in order to ensure 
the President's return as soon as possible. In July 1994, just a year 
and a half ago, the UN mission to Haiti being unable to give effect 
to that agreement, Canada took part in setting up a multinational 
force under U.S. command, in order to hasten the departure of the 
Haitian military leaders.
<P>
	The UN Security Council then gave increased capabilities to the 
multinational force, which would give over these powers to the UN 
mission to Haiti once the situation had been stabilized. As of 
March 31, 1995, Canada had provided 100 RCMP officers and 500 
members of its armed forces to the UN mission. Since then, the UN 
mission has taken over from the multinational military 
implementation force. It includes a military contingent of 6,000 
soldiers and a police component of 800 officers from 30 countries.
<P>
	The Haitian people gave a warm welcome to the troops and 
police officers, and there has been a substantial drop in the crime 
rate over the past 12 months. Peaceful demonstrations are now 
allowed. Journalists are free to do their job. The international 
community, however, still has one concern: the mandate of 
UNMIH expires tomorrow.
<P>
<B>(1950)</B>
<P>
	Since the situation in Haiti is still precarious, the Secretary 
General of the UN, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, recently indicated that 
a smaller transition mission would be desirable in order to 
strengthen the young Haitian  democracy. This mission would 
focus on 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="78"> 78 </A></B>
<P>
supervising the new Haitian police and supporting the civilian 
institutions. The military aspects of its mandate would be reduced.
<P>
	We must be assured that this new national police force, which 
would be trained by Canadian instructors among others, will be 
able to maintain order after the peacekeepers leave. The newly 
elected President of Haiti, Mr. Préval, has already stated his 
intention to ask the Security Council to extend the mission.
<P>
	The challenge of democratization has not been won yet. It seems 
that the disarming of the former supporters of the putschists is far 
from over, and that there is still a risk that hostilities will resume 
after the international forces leave.
<P>
	Despite its reservations, the Bloc Quebecois feels that the 
presence of UN troops, which will be under the direction of Canada 
for a while, will undoubtedly be a great help in rebuilding Haiti. 
Maintaining foreign troops is desirable until we have more 
evidence that democracy prevails in that country. However, before 
committing Canadian Forces any further and responding to the 
UN's request, we wish to express certain reservations.
<P>
	First of all, the government must set the rules and criteria 
governing its intervention and assess the resources needed to carry 
out this mission. The minister seemed prepared earlier to take into 
account what his colleagues were saying, and I hope it was not idle 
talk.
<P>
	The government must immediately specify what the mandate of 
our troops will be in Haiti, to avoid repeating the ad-libbing that 
has taken place during other missions. We believe that their 
primary task should be to consolidate democracy by supervising 
and training local forces and reinforcing civilian institutions.
<P>
	Since the American troops are scheduled to leave next month, 
the Bloc Quebecois questions whether this new mission will be 
able to keep the peace in Haiti. We think that the Canadian 
government should negotiate with the UN and the U.S. government 
the withdrawal, possibly over a six-month period, of the American 
and Pakistani troops currently deployed.
<P>
	The multinational force under U.S. command included 6,000 
troops. Canada should know from the start how many troops we 
will be able to count on when we will take over command, and 
make sure that the UN will provide all the resources we will need to 
fulfil our mandate properly.
<P>
	As for the Canadian troops in the field, the Bloc Quebecois is of 
the opinion that no more than 750 peacekeepers should be sent to 
Haiti, as my colleague, the defence critic, indicated. More than 
1,000 Canadian military have already been assigned various tasks 
with regard to the implementation of the Dayton accords in Bosnia. 
While being generous and compassionate,  Canada must also take 
into account what if any resources are available.
<P>
	So far, the government has not told us much about the costs 
involved in this mission. Again, the minister seemed to take that 
aspect into consideration. For the sake of transparency and 
integrity, taxpayers in Quebec and Canada must know what 
expenses the government will incur during this mission.
<P>
	In June 1995, I took part in an observer mission for the 
verification of parliamentary and senatorial elections in Haiti. I 
saw for myself that the presence of foreign forces was absolutely 
necessary if an atmosphere of detente and security was to prevail 
over there. For far too long, the people of Haiti have been afraid of 
walking in the streets, of speaking, singing and expressing 
themselves freely.
<P>
<B>(1955)</B>
<P>
	Democracy is a wonderful means of integrating citizens in the 
society to which they belong. This can take place provided that 
citizens can play an active and responsible role in society. The 
democracy emerging in Haiti deserves to survive, if only it will be 
given a chance.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos (Saint-Denis, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise for the first time in this new session of Parliament to 
debate the role of Canada in Haiti. We all recall that an emergency 
debate on our peacekeepers was among the first topics discussed in 
the first session of this Parliament. It was also my maiden speech in 
Parliament. Since then the government has consulted, as promised, 
this House on several occasions because it believes in hearing the 
opinions of its members as representatives of all Canadians.
<P>
	Today, once again, the Liberal government is turning to us for 
our views on the subject of Haiti where Canada has played a 
fundamental role in helping to restore peace and democracy. More 
than ever, Canada continues to be asked to assist in such missions 
as the one we are debating today. The reason for this, as the Prime 
Minister said in his speech this afternoon, is because they see 
Canada as a model for hope for the future and they aspire to 
achieve what we have in our country.
<P>
	I feel it is our duty as well as our responsibility to help these 
nations, which I will call also our brothers and our sisters in need. 
After all, we live on this planet earth together and we are all a 
global family.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Haitians see us as a partner and a strong ally who has never let 
them down. As for the UN, it sees us as an active participant in a 
multilateral system, and also as a country with a deep respect for 
peacekeeping. Today, both of them are showing the great 
confidence they have in our country and its citizens.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="79"> 79 </A></B>
<P>
	I want to focus on two themes that, I think, justify our 
participation in that mission: to help strengthen the civilian  
authorities in Haiti, and to ensure the safety of individuals.
<P>
	On February 7, our new colleague, the Minister for International 
Co-operation and Minister for Francophonie, went to 
Port-au-Prince to represent our country at the swearing-in 
ceremony of the new President of Haiti, René Préval.
<P>
	This was the minister's first trip, which is an indication of the 
importance given to the Haitian situation by our government. The 
minister was able to see first hand the rebuilding going on, as well 
as the magnitude of the job that awaits Canada and other donor 
countries willing to help Haiti meet the basic needs of its 
population.
<P>
	Canada has played, and continues to play, a major role in the 
march of the Haitian people towards democracy. Our immediate 
concern is to maintain a stable and safe environment in Haiti. In 
order to do that, the UN peacekeeping mission must remain in 
Haiti. Canada will continue to support the development of the rule 
of law in Haiti and help strengthen the civilian authorities in that 
country.
<P>
	In the long term, this will not only mean helping Haiti reorganize 
its courts, but also train its judges and help reform its whole legal 
system. The Canadian International Development Agency is 
currently developing a program that will help Haiti train judges as 
well as court officers. That program will also help the Haitian 
government reorganize trial courts and develop its own training 
capabilities. Technical assistance is currently being provided to the 
Haitian justice department through that program.
<P>
	As a Montrealer, I am pleased to know that over 245 police 
officers from Montreal's urban community volunteered to spend 
three to six months in Haiti, where they will join the 15 or so 
officers who are already there, to help train their new Haitian 
colleagues. This type of exchange shows the value and the strength 
of international co-operation.
<P>
<B>(2000)</B>
<P>
	This program will not only help the new Haitian police force, but 
will certainly work to bring together the SPCUM and the cultural 
communities of Montreal. This shows what co-operation can do. 
This is a fine example of what international co-operation can bring 
to all of us in Canada.
<P>
	We need to help Haitians not only to overall their justice system, 
but also to discover and protect their rights. With its Human Right 
Education and Promotion Program, CIDA is teaching the Haitian 
people, at the community level, how to exercise and protect their 
rights. This program will promote a sense of civic duty and try to 
make the Haitian people more responsible, while the  lack of such a 
sense of civic duty has only led to violence and fear in Haiti.
<P>
	We will help Haiti to further develop this sense of civic duty by 
revitalizing its co-operative movement. The Haitian people will 
gain a better understanding of the true value of participatory 
democracy. The co-operative movement has been in existence in 
Canada for a long time. Whether it is in Quebec with its caisses 
populaires or in Western Canada with its wheat pools, we know the 
many benefits this movement can bring to the community. The 
co-operative movement helps to create and protect jobs and to 
distribute wealth, but also teaches its members about democracy 
and gets them involved in society. This is why CIDA implemented 
a five-year program to promote the co-operative system as the key 
to economic growth and to the social and financial security of its 
members.
<P>
	Strengthening democracy in Haiti will lead to social 
development. The Haitian people had the courage to take the first 
steps in what will be a long and difficult march. Haitians have let 
go of their painful and violent past and are working hard to build a 
peaceful society where all their fellow citizens will share the 
benefits of development and progress.
<P>
	They can be proud of what they have accomplished in such a 
short period of time. We agree with President Préval, when he said 
in his inaugural speech that, in the end, it will be up to the Haitian 
people to take responsibility for their future.
<P>
	Even if they have taken their future into their own hands, we 
must continue to stand beside them and to give them a hand. We 
cannot let the gap between aspirations and reality get any wider in 
Haiti. The longer people have to wait for real change, the greater 
the potential for violence and instability. For this reason, Canada's 
two priorities in Haiti are to seek and maintain a stable and 
peaceful environment, and to reduce poverty and foster economic 
growth.
<P>
	Canada is convinced that Haiti must have sustainable 
development. If there is to be any chance of that development 
fostering any hope, it absolutely must integrate all of the 
environmental, social, economic and cultural challenges that face 
Haiti. This holistic approach is the key to reducing Haitian poverty. 
Too often poverty, coupled with inequality, injustice and 
systematic abuses, leads to violence. We must break that vicious 
circle, and this we can do if we create the necessary conditions for 
growth and for job creation.
<P>
	If we contribute to maintaining the current atmosphere of 
stability in Haiti, and if we can consolidate it still further, national 
and international investors will be more inclined to make 
investments there. In the meantime, Canada has concentrated its 
efforts on small labour intensive infrastructure projects throughout 
Haiti, such as rebuilding schools and nursing stations, repairing 
roads and improving irrigation and drainage ditches.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="80"> 80 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(2005)</B>
<P>
	In addition to supplying technical assistance in various forms, 
since 1994 Canada has provided more than 300,000 tools such as 
hoes and shovels-simple, but in scarce supply-to allow these 
projects to take shape. So we have a grasp on the magnitude of the 
task Haiti has before it.
<P>
	In conclusion, Canada is aware that the Haitian people have 
great confidence in us. On behalf of myself, and of all Canadians I 
believe, I wish to thank them for their confidence and to assure 
them that we intend to show ourselves worthy of it. We and our 
ministers will work hand in hand with them, while respecting their 
differences, at fulfilling their aspirations for peace and 
development.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I wish once again to applaud the efforts the Liberal government 
and our ministers have made in helping to restore democracy in 
Haiti. It is important for us to continue to do all we can to 
strengthen our commitment to our brothers and sisters in Haiti.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of the people of 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt to speak to the motion of the 
House, this take note debate have before us tonight, on Canada's 
current and future international peacekeeping commitments in 
Haiti, with particular reference to the United Nations aspect for 
Canada to take military command of the United Nations mission in 
Haiti.
<P>
	To me and other members of the House this take note debate is 
purely smoke and mirrors. Although we would like to see pure 
consultation with members of the House of Commons, we 
recognize there will be no vote with respect to the information that 
comes out of this debate tonight. The Reform Party deplores the 
hypocritical attitude the Liberal government has toward the 
Canadian people in this regard.
<P>
	For several weeks now the media has been reporting that the 
government has decided to commit troops to Haiti. The chief of 
defence staff advised the cabinet that we have the capability to 
participate, and military preparations have been underway for some 
time now.
<P>
	The Liberal government even referred to this mission in 
yesterday's throne speech. Despite the hypocrisy of the 
government, the Reform Party supports in principal taking 
command of the UN mission to Haiti. Canadians recognize the 
importance of stability in Haiti, the poorest country in our 
hemisphere, and Canadians support the principle of democratic 
reform.
<P>
	This is a dangerous mission and Canadians should be fully aware 
of that fact. It is dangerous and this is not a traditional 
peacekeeping mission. We will not be monitoring opposing armies 
but playing a role in  maintaining political stability in Haiti. 
Canadians recognize that our armed forces are ready and capable of 
success in this mission because we have a trained, combat capable, 
professional armed forces to do the job.
<P>
	However, the Reform Party is concerned about the government's 
handling of Canada's defence policy. One of the most important 
tasks of any national government is to support the existence of 
sufficient combat capable armed forces to match the nation's 
defence policy. This is not something that is just desirable, this is a 
responsibility and a requirement of any sound national 
government. It would be an abdication of the government to fail in 
this regard.
<P>
<B>(2010 )</B>
<P>
	In 1994 the special joint committee on Canada's defence policy, 
after careful consideration, identified that we must maintain at 
least 66,700 military personnel. Yet the minister in his white paper 
stated that he intended to reduce the size of the armed forces to 
some 60,000, almost 7,000 fewer than identified during the eight 
months the special joint committee was working on this very issue.
<P>
	The commitment capability gap does not stop there. In the white 
paper the Minister of National Defence also announced the 
government intends to cut the primary reserves to 23,000 from 
29,000 personnel. This is strategically and fiscally irresponsible for 
this minister. The militia provided more than 20 per cent of the 
UNPROFOR mission to the former Yugoslavia. The militia cost the 
Canadian taxpayers only 4 per cent of the entire armed forces 
budget. The militia is a very cost effective way of having a national 
defence plan.
<P>
	If the Liberal government accepts the recommendation of the 
1995 Dickson commission report on the restructuring of the 
reserves, 50 per cent of Canada's militia units will be disbanded 
across the country.
<P>
	Only two weeks ago the Liberal government changed 50 years of 
Canadian defence policy by saying that Canada does not have nor 
does it need to maintain combat capable land forces. On February 
13 the new chief of the defence staff told Canadians that land forces 
are unfit to fight in a serious war: ``If the government asked me to 
go into a high intensity theatre with the equipment I have today, I 
would have to say I can't do it''.
<P>
	The Minister of National Defence, contradicting his own white 
paper, said that General Boyle's comments were pretty fair. He 
added that General Boyle's comments reflect the 1994 white paper 
on defence. Then the Minister of Foreign Affairs went even further 
in reversing the defence policy of the government, stating: ``A lot 
of defence purchases have been geared toward the peacekeeping 
effort because that is the changing nature of the world. The notion 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="81"> 81 </A></B>
<P>
that we might re-engage  in a major conflict like the second world 
war does not seem to be there''.
<P>
	These statements, in a matter of a 10-second news clip, by the 
Minister of National Defence and the Minister of Foreign Affairs 
destroyed the work of the special joint committee, destroyed the 
work of the Minister of National Defence's own white paper on 
defence.
<P>
	In Gaza in 1956 Canadian General Burns said you can always 
turn down a fire hose to water a garden but you can never turn up a 
garden hose to put out a blazing fire. General Burns was telling 
Canadians the Canadian Armed Forces must be able to tackle a 
variety of challenges in the dangerous and unpredictable world we 
live in today. Our armed forces personnel must be first and 
foremost combat capable professionals which then and only then 
enables them to be the finest peacekeepers in the world.
<P>
	The Minister of National Defence should take heed of General 
Burns' illustration. If the minister would listen tonight I would say 
stabilize the size of the Canadian Armed Forces and make sure the 
resources go toward making it first and foremost combat capable. 
He should live up to the combat capability which he committed an 
entire chapter to in the white paper.
<P>
	The Minister of Foreign Affairs also must consider the 
illustration of General Burns. It is fine and dandy for the Minister 
of Foreign Affairs to commit our armed forces to Liberal 
government foreign policy objectives. However, they must not be 
trained only for peacekeeping; they must remain combat capable 
professionals, as they are today.
<P>
	The Reform Party supports in principle taking command of the 
United Nations mission in Haiti. Canadians are confident in the 
ability of our armed forces. However, Canadians are not as 
confident in the Liberal government. Canadians call on the 
government to stop abdicating its responsibility. We have reached 
the critical mass where further cuts and reductions to our armed 
forces will make them an impotent marching band.
<P>
<B>(2015)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Godfrey (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Cooperation):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am quite pleased to 
rise in this House today to support the government's motion for 
increased Canadian involvement in the UN mission in Haiti.
<P>
	But first of all, let me stress the fact that this motion is moved in 
the context of the government's willingness to consult Canadians 
and parliamentarians on broad foreign policy issues.
<P>
	This House has been given the opportunity to discuss the 
government's new foreign policy and, on several occasions, the 
involvement of our troops in UN missions in Bosnia and elsewhere.
<P>
	As the minister said, this debate is something of a last minute 
proposition. I know some members would have liked to have more 
time to prepare for this debate. I want to say to hon. members that 
the government will make every effort to give more notice of future 
debates such as this one, whenever possible.
<P>
	The government's foreign policy review has indicated that 
Canadians want to be more involved in the making of our foreign 
policy. For the first time, the government has asked Canadians to 
express their views through Internet on Canadian participation in 
the UN mission in Haiti. I am pleased to report that, out of about a 
hundred responses, 75 were in favour. We got many relevant 
comments and useful suggestions.
<P>
	I am pleased to see that today's debate gives us once again the 
opportunity to talk about Canada's participation in a mission led by 
the United Nations. We have the chance not only to reaffirm the 
unique role our country plays within the United Nations system, 
but also to review the special contribution Canada has made these 
last few years to help the Haitian people on its way towards 
democracy.
<P>
	In 1990, the Haitian people took a first big step towards 
democracy when they elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
The 1991 coup led by the Haitian army served to show how fragile 
the movement towards democracy was. The determination of the 
world community, of the United Nations, of the friends of Haiti and 
of the president in exile showed however that that was the only way 
the Haitian people could go.
<P>
	The Canadian population and the Canadian government never 
wavered in their support for the Haitian people and for its fight for 
democracy and freedom.
<P>
	Besides helping to organize presidential elections in 1990, we 
worked for the return of Jean-Bertrand Aristide, we were there to 
welcome him back to his country, we helped Haiti to hold 
legislative and presidential elections last year and we were there, a 
few weeks ago, to assist for the first ever handing of power from 
one democratically elected president to another.
<P>
	Our new colleague, the Minister for International Cooperation 
and the Minister responsible for Francophonie, Mr. Pierre 
Pettigrew, went to Haiti to attend this event. It was his first official 
trip, which goes to show how important the Haitian issue is to the 
government.
<P>
	And now that a new president has been elected and that Haiti is 
on the way toward building its civilian society, Canada will still be 
supporting the Haitian people.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="82"> 82 </A></B>
<P>
	We can be proud of what the international community and 
Canada have accomplished in Haiti in such a short time after 
President Aristide's return. We have quickly identified the most 
urgent needs of the Haitian people and coordinated the activities 
of all donor nations to provide adequate assistance.
<P>
	Canada has helped to restore power supply in Port-au-Prince not 
only by fixing the actual power stations but also by providing 
back-up stations. As well as providing emergency food aid, we 
have helped the Haitian people to build schools and health care 
units.
<P>
<B>(2020)</B>
<P>
	The sad episode of the de facto government served to show the 
harsh reality: democracy is fragile in Haiti. It is still threatening for 
certain interests. That is why we must try to consolidate it so that it 
can put deep roots in the Haitian society. It must allow all groups in 
the Haitian society to express themselves and get involved.
<P>
	To this end, we must continue to favour the onset of a secure 
environment, to rebuild the judicial infrastructure of the country 
and to help Haiti embark upon the economic transition it needs to 
ensure its future and its stability.
<P>
	As the government stated yesterday in its speech from the 
throne, the future of our societies depends on the safety of their 
citizens. This sums up Canada's action in Haiti as well as in other 
developing countries.
<P>
	We must give the Haitian people the time it needs to bring about 
these changes. The more the months to come will be stable and the 
more the democratic institutions will have the time to develop and 
to consolidate, the stronger the economy will be.
<P>
	Haiti is facing huge challenges. And yet, I am sure it will be able 
to rise to them. Just think about it. Only two years ago, Haiti fell 
prey to political violence. Haitians were afraid to walk in the streets 
and rightly so. It is estimated that 4,000 to 5,000 Haitians were 
killed during the Cédras regime.
<P>
	Today, there is almost no more political violence. Arbitrary 
action is a thing of the past. A year ago, setting up a professional 
police force in Haiti seemed an impossible dream. Let us consider 
the challenge taken up by the Haitian government more than 12 
months ago: abolishing the army, and training and deploying 5,000 
police officers, with the help of Canada, among others, before the 
end of the UNMIH, which is scheduled for tomorrow. Nonetheless, 
a few days ago, the lastest graduates of the Haiti police academy 
were deployed throughout the country.
<P>
	During the next few months, Canadian police officers will 
continue to help the new Haitian police force learn community 
police techniques and field methods. At the same time, they will 
continue to train the new recruits.
<P>
	I know Canadians will be happy to learn that the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police, of which we are all proud in this country, has 
agreed to play an even more active role in Haiti. There is still much 
to be done, including providing adequate training to senior officers 
to ensure that the police can face with all kinds of situations in a 
professional and disciplined manner.
<P>
	Canada's participation in the multinational police force in Haiti 
is a good example of what Canadians from all regions of the 
country can accomplish when they work together. More than 100 
police officers from the RCMP and several municipal police forces 
across the country worked together to train their new Haitian 
colleagues.
<P>
	I was impressed to learn that more than 245 police officers of the 
Communauté urbaine de Montréal applied to serve in Haiti. For 
me, that enthusiasm shows that the officers of the SPCUM see that 
exchange as an excellent opportunity to share their knowledge with 
their new Haitians colleagues, but also, to learn first hand about the 
harsh reality in Haiti to better understand and interact with the 
Haitian community in Montreal.
<P>
<B>(2025)</B>
<P>
	This illustrates perfectly well how international co-operation is 
not for the sole benefit of others. It must also allow us to learn from 
others.
<P>
	A few months ago, we celebrated the 50th anniversary of the 
United Nations. I believe that what the UN is doing in Haiti is 
nothing short of remarkable. The United Nations never undertook 
such a complex mission. It is not the kind of traditional 
peacekeeping mission Canadians got used to long ago. It is much 
more than that: it goes from ensuring a stable environment to 
establishing a new police force, from the reform of the Haitian 
justice system to the organization and supervision of two elections 
in less than one year, from meeting basic human needs to 
establishing the foundation of a civilian and democratic society.
<P>
	But we must admit that the mission will not be an easy one. 
There are risks involved. Democratic and social development in 
Haiti will continue well after the UN have left. Stability in Haiti 
remains fragile.
<P>
	However, our successes in the last two years are encouraging for 
the future, not only of Haiti, but of the UN itself. Canada is eager to 
play a greater role for the United Nations in Haiti and to help that 
country to reach its full potential.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, when we 
talk about Haiti, I am always reminded of the hundreds of priests, 
nuns, missionaries and young volunteers who have gone there at 
some point in their life to try and give these people a little more 
happiness in this world.
<P>
	I am also reminded of my former colleague, the late Gaston 
Péloquin, a member of the Bloc Quebecois, who  spent two years in 
Haiti and who adopted a young Haitian child who now lives in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="83"> 83 </A></B>
<P>
Quebec. Pascal must be 18 now. I am also reminded of all these 
Haitians who have come to live in Quebec and elsewhere, mainly in 
Montreal, and who may be watching us tonight on television. I take 
this opportunity to say hello to them.
<P>
	The Bloc supports and salutes the government for its present and 
future international commitments with regard to the peacekeeping 
mission in Haiti.
<P>
	Because of our concern for Haiti and of our peacekeeping policy, 
Canada is now called upon by the United Nations to take military 
command of the UN mission in Haiti.
<P>
	I am also very happy with the foreign affairs minister's decision 
to consult his parliamentary colleagues about Canada's 
participation in this mission. We, members of the Bloc, believe that 
it is very important.
<P>
	This consulting of Parliament is very much in line with the 
recommendations made by the Bloc Quebecois in its dissenting 
report on Canada's foreign policy in November 1994.
<P>
	In this report, on page 4, under chapter 1.2, the Bloc Quebecois 
insists that the government should, and I quote: ``submit any 
decision to participate in peacekeeping missions to a vote in the 
House of Commons, as rapidly as possible, where time allows''.
<P>
	I think it is important to note that fact because it clearly 
demonstrates that, as the official opposition, the Bloc Quebecois is 
doing its job conscientiously, adhering to highly democratic values.
<P>
<B>(2030)</B>
<P>
	As the Minister of Foreign Affairs is demonstrating today, 
members of the Bloc often make recommendations which are very 
practical and reflect current events.
<P>
	As a matter of fact, I believe that one of the main roles of 
Canadian forces on the international scene must be to support 
peacekeeping operations by taking part in them. Such participation 
is undeniably an asset for Canada and one of its major international 
accomplishments.
<P>
	Canada must learn from previous operations. The case of Haïti 
reminds us that our interventions must absolutely be based on the 
legitimate democratic system that is gradually emerging in that 
country.
<P>
	As my colleagues on this side of the House and myself have 
already said, the development of democratic institutions in Eastern 
Europe and closer to us in the Americas is crucial to the 
preservation of social peace and to economic development in the 
world.
<P>
	I believe that reinforcement of democratic institutions and 
respect of human rights are necessary pillars to the security of the 
new international environment.
<P>
	This is a major foreign policy concern that must be shared by 
stable democratic societies likes ours.
<P>
	When something like the United Nations mission in Haïti takes 
leading to joint action, that concern yields results.
<P>
	The end of dictatorship and restoration of democracy in Haïti are 
largely the result of the tenacity of the international community, 
which put its democratic ideals above everything else.
<P>
	We, as members of this House, must take good note of this fact 
but we must above all make sure that Canada will give it a leading 
role in its foreign policy and also in its domestic policy. We ought 
to be able to practice at home what we want to implement 
elsewhere.
<P>
	I understand that cabinet has already agreed in principle to the 
deployment of 750 peacekeepers from Valcartier, which means an 
additional 250 troops and a six-month extension of Canadian 
participation in the United Nations mission in Haïti.
<P>
	This means Canada will take over command of the mission from 
the United States.
<P>
	As I see it, the presence of UN troops under Canadian 
supervision for a limited time will undoubtedly be very helpful to a 
country formerly known as the Pearl of the Antilles.
<P>
	The new responsibilities taken on by Canada may also help to 
restore a credibility that was damaged by the events in Somalia. 
However, we can allow no recurrence of what happened in 
Somalia. That would be unacceptable and an outrage in the eyes of 
all those who put their trust in these missions and who send people 
over there.
<P>
	Our participation will help to rebuild democratic and economic 
institutions in that country.
<P>
	Our support for the newly-elected President of Haiti, René 
Préval, and his brand new Prime Minister, Rony Smarth, is a 
continuation of our support for the democratic process triggered by 
none other than Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
<P>
	In his quest for democracy, Mr. Aristide managed to give back to 
the Haitian people their dignity and independent institutions which 
are a guarantee of a lasting peace.
<P>
	According to the Bloc Quebecois, the mandate of Canadian 
troops should consist mainly in co-ordinating reconstruction efforts 
and supporting the current process of democratic growth so that 
there will be a viable system by the end of that mandate.
<P>
<B>(2035)</B>
<P>
	Since this transitional mission will be smaller in size, it should 
concentrate on training the new Haitian police and on supporting 
civilian institutions. The military aspects of the mandate should be 
substantially reduced.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="84"> 84 </A></B>
<P>
	If the government wants the Official Opposition to support its 
decision, it should make it clear that this particular mission will 
be carefully planned, that its objectives will be realistic and clearly 
identified, and finally, that adequate means will be provided to 
achieve those objectives.
<P>
	In concluding, I want to say again that when Canada and Quebec, 
because as you know we are still part of Canada, when we send 
Canadian troops as UN peacekeepers, I think it is important, and 
everyone in this House will understand, that these people are well 
prepared and above reproach. After all, they represent us, and as 
long as they do that well, we are proud of them. If they break the 
rules, we all bear the blame.
<P>
	And finally, I want to say that our young people, our young 
soldiers who are over there, our young policemen who are over 
there and who are helping a country that is discovering again what 
democracy means, this is fine, we support and encourage them, and 
we support the government's motion.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Christine Stewart (Secretary of State (Latin America 
and Africa), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to have the 
opportunity to participate in the debate this evening. The 
government has asked Parliament to convene to discuss how 
Canada should participate in the extension of the United Nations 
Mission in Haiti, UNMIH.
<P>
	The government is requesting that Parliament support Canada's 
participation in the extension of UNMIH with a leading role. Haiti 
has requested this UN mission be extended. The Secretary-General 
of the United Nations also has asked that the mission be extended. 
In fact he has asked that Canada head that extended mission. As I 
have said, I am very pleased the government has suggested that 
Canada participate, and we wait this very evening for the security 
council to finish its deliberations on the resolution before it.
<P>
	I have some personal attachment to the debate tonight, having 
served in my pre-political years in a capacity where I assisted in 
some of the development programs that Canada supported in Haiti. 
I am certainly very aware of the chronic oppression and poverty 
that so many thousands and thousands of people in Haiti have 
suffered for far too long.
<P>
	Now that progress is being made as a result of the United 
Nations' participation in the process of the development of 
democracy in Haiti, it would be a sad day if Canada were to come 
away from this mission at this time.
<P>
	As we all know, Canada has had a long history of participation in 
UN peacekeeping missions. We have been the one nation in the 
world with the record of participating in all of the UN 
peacekeeping missions around the world. We do so in reflection as 
well on our new foreign affairs policy which states that two of our 
objectives are to protect security here in Canada, security in the 
world and also to project our values.
<P>
	It seems extremely logical that with those two key objectives in 
mind we would look to Haiti as a very important place for Canada 
to play a continuing role, to make sure those objectives are 
attained, that we are doing our part. Because we feel so strongly 
about Haiti now that we have joined the OAS and are fully 
integrated members of regional hemispheric organizations we 
place a special emphasis on Haiti. This has also been reflected by 
the visit of the Hon. Pierre Pettigrew, Minister for International 
Co-operation, to the inauguration of President Préval shortly after 
his installation in cabinet.
<P>
<B>(2040)</B>
<P>
	It is also logical to participate in this mission because Canada 
has a long tradition of supporting multilateralism in the world. We 
do not believe, especially in a fast changing world, that Canada or 
any other nation can achieve important objectives alone. Therefore 
we support multilateralism.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We have in Haiti proof that a multilateral system can work, that 
we can learn from past successes and failures, that the United 
Nations can be efficient and creative. The UN mission in Haiti has 
done an excellent job and the security of the people of Haiti has 
greatly improved in recent months. Elections were held in a calm 
atmosphere and democracy is starting to take root.
<P>
	A new pluralistic civilian regime is beginning to emerge, based 
increasingly on law and on respect of the individual, and this is 
happening because of the courage of the Haitian people and the 
assistance of Haiti's friends, such as Canada and the UN.
<P>
	Haiti offers proof to the whole world-the USA in particular, 
who made a constructive contribution to the multilateral efforts 
there-that multilateralism works if countries are committed to 
making it work. Canada wants that success to be ongoing.
<P>
	There are several other reasons Haiti holds particular importance 
for Canada. By working with the Haitian population to make the 
development of democracy a durable and solid phenomenon, we 
are demonstrating the importance Canada attaches to a broader role 
in Latin America and the Caribbean. This is a region which has 
made remarkable advances in the areas of economics and 
democracy, and one which has provided Canada with immigrants 
who make up an increasing large part of the Canadian social fabric; 
it offers us new outlets for pursuing Canada's objectives.
<P>
	As well, our assistance to Haiti also demonstrates our 
commitment to partnerships between francophone countries. 
Canada and France in particular, two of the key French spraking 
nations, are working together in Haiti to ensure the establishment 
of a
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="85"> 85 </A></B>
<P>
democratic and peaceful civilian society, one which can continue to 
develop once the peacekeeping operation is over.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Canada would not go into this peacekeeping operation or suggest 
that this operation be extended if the government did not feel that it 
was important, if it did not believe that the troops were qualified, 
adequately equipped and safe. We cannot always guarantee the 
safety of our troops but the government can guarantee that it is 
doing its best to assure that every precaution is taken. With my 
colleagues around the House I can share as well my great support 
for the remarkable work and the courage of our troops in the field.
<P>
	I could go on about how Canada has been involved in not only 
the training of police in Haiti, involved in the peacekeeping 
mission in Haiti but how we have helped to restore energy services 
to that country, how we are helping to rehabilitate lower court 
buildings so that the rule of law can be provided. We have helped to 
provide the basic human needs in that country.
<P>
	The foreign minister referred to the fact that given Parliament 
was not in session when this topic was much within the public 
realm, we provided the facility for Canadians to provide the 
government with their comments about our involvement in Haiti 
via the Internet.
<P>
<B>(2045 )</B>
<P>
	I thought it would be appropriate, rather than to go on from our 
own point of view about what Canada was doing, to share some 
comments from a Canadian NGO, non-government organization, 
that Canada has been supporting in its important work.
<P>
	The following statement appeared on the Internet from CARE 
Canada:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>CARE Canada supports the proposal that Canadian Peacekeeping forces play 
a continued and expanded role in the United Nations mission in Haiti.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Canada should accept this leading role and exercise the knowledge gained 
through its many international Peacekeeping efforts in general and build on its 
specific recent history in Haiti. As a close neighbour, with intimate links to the 
Caribbean, Canada has an unquestionable role to play in the security and 
peaceful development of Haiti.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The establishment of democratic institutions is essential for the health and 
growth of a nation. Such activities support and mirror the efforts of aid agencies 
like CARE which are working with Haitians to improve economic 
self-sufficiency and social services.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>With support valued at $3 million Canadian from the Canadian International 
Development Agency, CARE is managing the monetization of Canadian food 
commodities which will be sold to private merchants in Haiti. The revenue from 
the sale of the food will be used for an integrated development programme in 
Departement du Sud. The programme will include activities in  primary health 
care, water and sanitation and agriculture and natural resources.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Development projects alone cannot ensure a secure social environment. In 
situations like Haiti, emerging from years of turmoil and conflict, the efforts of 
all partners of good will are required to develop a peaceful and secure 
environment.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Canada must continue to play a leading role. CARE Canada hopes that the 
government of Canada will accept the UN's request to take the lead in the next 
phase of its very successful mission.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In the course of this debate my colleague from across the floor 
asked a question about the role of the OAS. Last week I had the 
opportunity to speak with the secretary general of the OAS in 
Washington. We talked in general about security issues in the 
hemisphere. Again, Canada supports the multilateral approach. We 
encouraged the secretary general of the OAS in his efforts in 
security. In fact he told me he had just returned from New York 
where he had met and talked with the UN Security Council about 
the situation in Haiti because he believes as we believe that the 
OAS has an important role to play in the follow up to a 
peacekeeping mission which we hope will come to a successful end 
some day.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Finally, we hope to be able to show that our country, Canada, can 
make a difference in the world and that not only the government, 
but all Canadians can make this a reality. Tonight's debate, our use 
of the Internet to get Canadians' comments on this question and our 
other consultations indicate that the government is committed to 
involving Canadians in major foreign policy decisions. In Haiti, 
Canadian personnel, peacekeeping troops, non governmental 
organizations and ordinary Canadians are putting this principle into 
effect through their hard work and their devotion.
<P>
	With the guidance of our government, our commitment in Haiti 
will, I am sure, show that Canadians are still capable of doing great 
things internationally when they work together.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as one who is somewhat 
pedantic about the use of language, I look around this vast almost 
empty Chamber and I wonder why what we are doing here tonight 
is called a debate.
<P>
<B>(2050 )</B>
<P>
	I would call it a series of monologues, commentaries on 
decisions previously made by the government. I suspect that even 
as we speak there are similar discussions going on in several bars in 
Ottawa that would be equally productive and have equal effect on 
the decisions that this government may ultimately make.
<P>
	Haiti was the second nation in this hemisphere after the U.S.A. 
to gain its independence. Unfortunately from that point onward 
nothing seemed to go right. That was  their last success. It has been 
an unremitting history of bloodshed, brutality, poverty and misery 
for almost two centuries. The only prolonged period of peace and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="86"> 86 </A></B>
<P>
stability was during the occupation by the U.S. marines during the 
1920s and 1930s.
<P>
	Even when I was working in Haiti, which was only about 15 
years ago, the infrastructure that we had was almost entirely the 
legacy of the U.S. occupation and any that was left had been built 
by foreign aid within very recent times.
<P>
	It is a sad commentary but those are the magnitudes of the 
problems which Canada or other countries will be facing trying to 
pull Haiti perhaps kicking and screaming into the 20th century and 
trying to build a democratic state there.
<P>
	As Canadians, we do have a vested interest in maintaining 
political and economic stability in the Caribbean. We do have a 
vested interest in creating a democratic state in Haiti. There are two 
very important reasons why we have this vested interest. One is 
that we have trade and investment links in this area not so much 
with Haiti itself but with its neighbours and most particularly with 
the Dominican Republic which shares the island of Hispaniola with 
Haiti. Therefore, if Haiti blows it up, it will have a direct influence 
on our well-being in this country.
<P>
	The second big interest we have and one we share with almost 
every country in the hemisphere is the question of refugees. If Haiti 
again does not succeed and everything turns upside down there will 
be another great flood of Haitians trying to get out of the place in 
unseaworthy boats going willy-nilly to whatever shore they may 
find. These people, by the thousands or the tens of thousands, will 
then become a burden on the recipient countries.
<P>
	How much better to send some aid and a few people into Haiti to 
try to straighten out the situation there than to end up with another 
disaster equivalent to the one we had about four years ago? I do 
support Canadian intervention. I do support our sending additional 
troops there to take command now that the Americans have decided 
it is time for them to leave.
<P>
	Besides being in our national interest, there is a certain moral 
imperative for our continued presence in that unhappy country to 
preserve life and also to provide or assist in the provision of 
humanitarian assistance.
<P>
	Finally, unlike the situation in Bosnia, this is an assignment that 
is well within the capability of our poorly equipped military. There 
are no heavy weapons to contend with and no well organized 
opposition. Although, like in any military operation there is always 
a risk, that risk will not be high unless we do not have adequate 
rules of engagement. If the rules of engagement are adequate and 
clearly defined and if our troops will not be unduly restrained from 
defending themselves,  then we should be there. If they are going to 
be unduly restrained then they should not go. We do not send our 
people overseas as human sacrifices. That is my primary 
consideration. The only caveat I would add to my support for this 
project is that if our military are there they must be able to defend 
themselves. I have that small reservation.
<P>
<B>(2055)</B>
<P>
	I will at this time lend my support to the ministers in whatever 
they have decided to do, whether they are going to send 500 or 750. 
I know the decision has been made but we will give it our blessing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
thanks to the minister and to the government for providing me with 
an opportunity to participate in this debate.
<P>
	I will begin by sending my congratulations to the new Minister 
of Foreign Affairs, the hon. member for Winnipeg South Centre. I 
had the opportunity to work with the new Minister of Foreign 
Affairs when he was the foreign affairs critic for the official 
opposition in a previous Parliament and I was as I am now the 
foreign affairs critic for the NDP.
<P>
	We had the opportunity to work together on the Standing 
Committee on External Affairs and International Trade. We also 
worked together as members of a much smaller committee, the 
Special Committee on the Central America Peace Process, which 
was created around the time of the peace process in 1988.
<P>
	The special committee made recommendations for Canadian 
participation in Central America with respect to the training of 
police and to create in countries where the police have not always 
had it, the political neutrality one would expect from police. 
Canada had a role in training police forces in that part of the world.
<P>
	By way of extending that conclusion we came to with respect to 
Central America, I have no problem listening to the minister's 
arguments being offered tonight about the need to consolidate and 
to amplify what progress has already been made in Haiti with 
respect to the training of police with a view to creating further 
stability in that country.
<P>
	It is a very new democracy which exists in Haiti in spite of the 
fact that it has been independent for almost 200 years as a member 
just mentioned. That new democracy when it first came into being 
with the election of former President Aristide did not last very 
long. One of the reasons it did not last very long was that the 
political culture and civil infrastructure and all the things that are 
necessary to support the democratic experiment were not there. It 
was not long before the military, who were used to running the 
country, decided that they did not like this experiment. The next 
thing was that the new president was in exile.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="87"> 87 </A></B>
<P>
	I am convinced that President Aristide was in exile a lot longer 
than he had to be. The Americans were not in any hurry to have 
President Aristide back in power in Haiti because of his 
ideological leanings. They took their sweet time knowing that the 
constitution in Haiti prevented President Aristide from running for 
re-election. The longer they took, the less time President Aristide 
would have when he actually returned to Haiti.
<P>
	I feel it was only in the final analysis that the Americans were 
embarrassed into doing something about Haiti. As a result we have 
had a new election in Haiti and we have a successor to President 
Aristide, a man who I understand has served as President Aristide's 
prime minister.
<P>
<B>(2100)</B>
<P>
	In a way the will of the people of Haiti, which was expressed in 
that first election but which was overthrown first by the military 
and then by the delay in doing anything to get President Aristide 
back has been expressed again. We hope this time around it can be 
expressed not only in terms of the election but also in terms of 
giving that government the opportunity to implement policies 
consistent with what the people thought they were voting for in this 
most recent presidential election.
<P>
	We therefore support in principle the government's apparent 
decision to respond to the call of the UN to take over command of 
the UN operation in Haiti. Like others who have spoken here 
tonight, we wish we had more details in front of us, some cost 
estimates, rules of engagement. We wish we had specific numbers 
as to what troops will be sent and how many in addition to the 
people already there, all those kinds of things.
<P>
	We understand it might have been difficult for the government to 
come up with this information by now, although one wonders about 
that. We do understand this matter has been in dispute at the United 
Nations and therefore the government might not want to second 
guess the outcome of the debate at the United Nations or at least it 
might not want to second guess it until necessary. In effect we are 
doing that tonight.
<P>
	The government was in some difficulty with respect to the 
timing which is why we were willing to co-operate with the 
minister in order to permit this debate tonight. In spite of the fact 
that member for Swift Current-Maple Creek-Assiniboia thinks 
more productive discussions might be going on in bars somewhere 
in Ottawa, this is nevertheless the beginning of a good tradition that 
whenever Canadian troops are deployed there is an opportunity to 
discuss it in Parliament.
<P>
	We are discussing the issue in the sense that there is no real 
proposal to debate and there are no real details to debate. There is 
no motion to vote on. Nevertheless this is a worthy procedure that 
perhaps if improved could be  something we do with more detail, in 
a more timely fashion and that we do not just do as a gesture to 
parliamentary accountability. Rather, we should have something 
more substantive in nature.
<P>
	Having said we support this in principle, we enter the caveat that 
we reserve the right to be critical of the government in future if we 
come across ways this is being implemented that we find to be 
inadequate.
<P>
	The minister said he was thinking about having the committee 
act as a sort of monitoring agency for this Canadian operation and 
perhaps for others. I welcome that gesture on the part of the 
minister. I am not exactly sure what he has in mind for the 
committee, but certainly the idea of there being some kind of 
parliamentary oversight on this kind of thing is worth exploring.
<P>
	I regret to say that as much as I think it is a good idea, since New 
Democrats are not allowed to be full members of committees, we 
might not be able to participate in this to the extent we would like, 
perhaps not at all. That is a shame. A number of us have had a lot of 
experience in the House, in foreign affairs, on that particular 
committee, and on special committees struck to deal with external 
affairs issues. Yet we find ourselves frozen out of the process. That 
is regrettable.
<P>
<B>(2105)</B>
<P>
	As we commit these Canadians to this task in Haiti for six 
months, presumably-although it is not clear exactly how long 
because these things have a tendency to grow or to be 
extended-we need to commit ourselves to a way of understanding 
the situation in Haiti and in other countries that realizes the limits 
of electoral democracy. It is not just enough to have elections.
<P>
	The government has recognized that to some degree by saying 
we need a police force trained in ways of policing that are not 
politically motivated. Too often police forces and the military in 
that part of the world are an extension of the political agenda of the 
government of the day. To some degree the limits of elections in 
and by themselves have been recognized by the government.
<P>
	I also hope the government would be working not just with 
respect to Haiti but with respect to a number of other countries in 
that area of the world, particularly Central America, to do what it 
can to put pressure on those governments which have been 
legitimately or democratically elected but which continue to 
permit, to encourage, to turn a blind eye to or however we describe 
it, which would vary from country to country, human rights 
violations in spite of the fact that elections have now been held and 
the presidents of various countries are democratically elected.
<P>
	I am thinking of Guatemala. Hardly a day goes by in my office 
that I do not get a letter from some Canadian concerned about what 
is happening to Guatemalan refugees returning to Guatemala. 
There is a great deal of  concern about some of the things that have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="88"> 88 </A></B>
<P>
happened recently in El Salvador and in Nicaragua. These are all 
countries which became democratic in the 1980s.
<P>
	I hope the attention of the minister could be turned to what the 
Canadian government could be doing in that respect as well. In the 
meantime, what we are committing ourselves to in Haiti seems to 
be something we all must collectively hope works out for the best 
for the people of Haiti and for the future of democracy in that 
region.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
followed this debate with great attention and I care about this issue, 
because I come from Latin America, which is very close to Haiti. 
That country has been through some very difficult times. All 
Latin-American countries have had difficult years, especially Haiti, 
which fought for years to get rid of the Duvalier dictatorship.
<P>
	Second, I am the member for Bourassa, including Montreal 
North, which has the highest number of Haitians per riding in 
Canada. This vibrant community is very well organized and makes 
a great contribution to the city of Montreal North, to Quebec and to 
Canada, despite a few problems that we have noticed, especially in 
the area of immigration. It is currently difficult for Haitians in my 
riding or in Montreal, in Quebec, to bring their families over. Many 
problems arise at the Canadian embassy in Haiti, which requires all 
kinds of medical exams to prove that the people are related. These 
blood tests are very expensive. Many improvements are needed to 
help Haitians immigrate to this country.
<P>
<B>(2110)</B>
<P>
	The Haitians in my riding and in Quebec in general remain very 
attached to their homeland. They pay frequent visits whenever they 
can afford it. It is close to Quebec, and they experience the events 
in Haiti as though they were there. I remember that when 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide was elected President of Haiti, people in 
Montreal North and Montreal were overjoyed because he had been 
elected by a vast majority of the population and also enjoyed the 
support of the Haitian diaspora in Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	As you know, the armed forces were not happy with this very 
democratic president who cared about the majority of poor people. 
Haiti is the poorest country in Latin American, in the Caribbean. 
There was a military coup and President Aristide had to go into 
exile. He came to Montreal, where I had the opportunity of meeting 
him. He also visited Ottawa.
<P>
	Luckily for the Organization of American States, they did a good 
job and actively restored democracy in Haiti, as did the United 
Nations, Canada-it must be said-the U.S. as well as certain Latin 
American countries. Many Latin American countries were 
instrumental in restoring democracy to Haiti. I will only mention 
Argentina and Chile today. While facing economic difficulties of 
its  own, Chile set up a special assistance program for the people of 
Haiti.
<P>
	I should also point out the outstanding help Quebec has provided 
the people of Haiti. A person was named to oversee Quebec's aid to 
Haiti because Quebec has close relations with that country, and it is 
not only because they are both French speaking nations, but also 
because there is a strong solidarity and an unfailing generosity in 
Quebec toward the poorest nations of the world.
<P>
	I was also very happy when President Aristide decided to 
dismantle the Haitian army, a dictatorial army that did not respect 
the regime in place, that did not respect the Constitution. We, in 
Quebec, particularly myself, have also worked hard to get rid of the 
army in Haiti. It was not necessary to have an army there, and we 
followed the example of two other democratic countries that do not 
have an army, particularly Costa Rica. That country has not had an 
army for decades and it is the most democratic country in Latin 
America. It has also been the case with Panama for a number of 
years and I do hope that other developing countries will follow the 
same path and do away with armed forces which have no 
justification in the present context.
<P>
	I must support the motion of the government. I agree to a six 
month extension of the UN's mandate in Haiti. As my colleagues of 
the Bloc have already said, I believe it is important to define 
precisely the mandate of our troops in Haiti, the duration of their 
mission and its costs.
<P>
<B>(2115)</B>
<P>
	I believe Canada and Quebec have an obligation to contribute to 
the construction of a democratic society in Haiti, a society 
respectful of human rights, a society where everyone, including the 
poorest, have opportunities and decent living conditions.
<P>
	For all those reasons, I agree with this motion and I support an 
extension of at least six months of the UN's mandate in Haiti.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leonard Hopkins (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to 
participate in this very important debate on Canada's role with the 
United Nations in Haiti. Haiti has had a very tumultuous past.
<P>
	Canada has an immense national interest in the Caribbean area. 
That is why it is very important for Canada to be associated with 
the United Nations in the very important task of helping to 
establish a permanent democracy in Haiti. The national interests of 
Canada are served by what the Canadian Armed Forces are doing in 
that region because we have a tremendous relationship with the 
countries throughout the Caribbean and in South America.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="89"> 89 </A></B>
<P>
	I want to give an example of the respect with which Canada 
is held in the eyes of countries in the Caribbean. I remember a 
number of years ago when Lincoln Alexander, a former member 
of this House and former Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario, and I 
went to the Caribbean to a meeting as Canadian observers.
<P>
	There were about 64 delegates from around the Caribbean at that 
meeting. At the beginning, one of the Prime Ministers who was 
chairing the meeting said that he wanted Canadians to know that 
not only were they welcome, but even though they were observers, 
he wanted them to feel free to participate in the discussions at any 
time they wished to do so.
<P>
	The Prime Minister of one of the countries went on to say that it 
was because Canada was its greatest friend in the world. Britain 
came second and after that, he did not even enumerate them.
<P>
	It is very important that Canada look after her interests in the 
Caribbean. As we know, Canada is really synonymous with 
peacekeeping excellence. Over the past 50 years, our peacekeepers 
have served throughout the world and their experience and 
expertise remain unsurpassed.
<P>
	The Canadian forces are always combat ready. They are 
peacekeeping ready. They are also diplomats when they go abroad 
because they do so much good work while there on a volunteer 
basis. They are well trained. They get along well with the people 
wherever they are. They help those people out.
<P>
	As we debate this issue, let us remember that every time a 
peacekeeper goes abroad on duty there is a family back home. I 
want to pay tribute tonight to the families that remain at home and 
the challenges they face while a spouse, a father or mother, is 
abroad with a peacekeeping force. Let us remember them as well in 
this debate.
<P>
	It comes as no surprise to any of us that the international 
community is looking to Canada to assume a significant role in the 
ongoing work in Haiti. Our peacekeepers have already shown that 
they are well suited for this mission. They may now have an 
opportunity to go a step further in assisting Haiti and its people 
during a difficult period of transition.
<P>
<B>(2120 )</B>
<P>
	My purpose today is to review Canada's peacekeeping record 
and remind members of the superb qualifications that Canadian 
forces personnel bring to this job. They have the skills necessary to 
meet the demands of modern operations.
<P>
	Peacekeeping began modestly for Canada. In the late 1940s the 
UN began deploying unarmed military personnel to observe peace 
agreements in some of the world's conflict ridden regions. 
Canada's participation in two of these early missions continues to 
this day. I am referring to the UN truce supervision organization in 
the  Middle East and the UN military observer group in India and 
Pakistan.
<P>
	Peacekeeping moved beyond observing and took on a more 
demanding role with the Suez crisis of 1956. Lester B. Pearson, 
Canada's Secretary of State for External Affairs at the time, 
recommended placing a UN force between the warring parties once 
a ceasefire had been signed. The multinational force would then 
police the ceasefire, setting the stage for a negotiated settlement. 
Mr. Pearson argued his case with skill and determination, 
overcoming the scepticism of some of the UN members. The 
United Nations Emergency Force was thus born and Mr. Pearson 
was awarded the Nobel peace prize.
<P>
	The first commander of the United Nations emergency force was 
a Canadian, Lieutenant-General E. L. M. Burns. General Burns, 
operating in unfamiliar territory, was often forced to chart his own 
course as he carried out the difficult job of keeping the peace 
between Arab and Israeli. In the end he excelled in this delicate 
task. Why? Because he was well trained for the job in the Canadian 
military community.
<P>
	Suez was an important precedent for the United Nations. Over 
the next three decades most peacekeeping missions rested on the 
principles established by the United Nations Emergency Force.
<P>
	Peacekeeping forces were expected to be lightly armed and 
impartial, and enjoy the consent of the warring parties. During this 
period Canada established herself as a leader in the peacekeeping 
field. We participated in virtually every UN mission and some 
outside the UN as well.
<P>
	By the end of the cold war more than 80,000 Canadian forces' 
personnel had served in peacekeeping operations: from the Congo 
and West New Guinea to Cyprus and the Golan Heights. Canada's 
peacekeeping excellence did not disappear with the end of the cold 
war. Indeed, in recent years our expertise has been more in demand 
than ever.
<P>
	Since 1989 the United Nations has become a much more active 
and interventionist organization. It has become more involved in 
interstate disputes and it has tackled human rights and 
humanitarian issues on a greater scale than ever before. As well, it 
has played a larger role in helping states embrace democracy and 
recover from the ravages of war.
<P>
	Our soldiers, while serving on UN duty, quite often on a 
volunteer basis build bridges, roads, schools, homes. They teach 
people trades and occupations. They teach people how to farm, 
how to grow their food. This is all done on a voluntary basis. These 
are the things for which our forces very seldom get credit in the 
public media.
<P>
	As a result, the number of UN peacekeeping missions has 
increased dramatically because of all the ravages of war in the hot 
spots that exist around the world in recent  times. What is more, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="90"> 90 </A></B>
<P>
these missions have become more complex and even more 
demanding.
<P>
	Modern peace support operations, as they might more accurately 
be labelled, include preventive deployment, the delivery of 
humanitarian assistance, peace enforcement and peace building in 
addition to traditional peacekeeping.
<P>
<B>(2125 )</B>
<P>
	These operations are multi-functional and multi-disciplinary, 
encompassing both military and civilian activities. Whether it is 
police officers, election observers, humanitarian workers or 
engineers, civilians are playing an increasing role in peace support 
operations. They are part of the new peacekeeping partnership.
<P>
	Canada and in particular the Pearson International Peacekeeping 
Training Centre at Cornwallis are helping pave the way for greater 
co-operation between military and civilians working together in 
support of peace.
<P>
	Canada has taken other steps to help improve peace support 
operations. Our study looking into ways to enhance the UN's 
capability to respond rapidly to a crisis stands out. But our greatest 
contribution remains our people in the field.
<P>
	Modern peace support operations demand a full range of military 
capabilities on the ground, in the air and at sea. Canada, with its 
combat capable, multi-purpose forces, has been able to respond to 
this demand and play an important role in many of these new 
missions whether in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia or 
Central America.
<P>
	In the former Yugoslavia, for example, Canadian ground troops 
performed a wide range of humanitarian tasks while the conflict 
raged. Currently we have nearly 1,000 troops in Bosnia, many of 
whom come from Petawawa, my home community. They are 
serving there with the NATO-led peace implementation force.
<P>
	In Cambodia we have personnel serving with the Cambodian 
Mine Action Centre which is responsible for mine clearance 
operations.
<P>
	At sea, Canadian naval forces have participated in operations off 
the coast of the former Yugoslavia, enforcing economic sanctions 
and arms embargoes.
<P>
	We also have had Canadian personnel involved in naval 
peacekeeping operations in Cambodia, the Middle East and Central 
America. In the air we have had personnel serving aboard NATO 
airborne warning and control system aircraft, AWACS, enforcing 
the no-fly zone in the former Yugoslavia.
<P>
	At present there are about 2,000 Canadian forces personnel 
participating in peace support operations worldwide. They 
continue to carry out a broad range of activities.
<P>
	In all these operations, Canadians carry out their tasks with skill 
and professionalism, proving once again that fully trained soldiers 
are the best peacekeepers. Combined with specialized instruction 
in such areas as cultural sensitivity, combat training gives 
Canadian forces all the tools required to meet new challenges.
<P>
	Given this impressive record, there should be no doubt that 
Canada can make a significant contribution to a mission in Haiti 
operating under a new mandate. We have been an active participant 
in attempts to restore Haitian democracy since 1991. Canadian 
ships helped enforce economic sanctions in an effort to convince 
Haiti's illegal regime to step down and Canadian forces personnel 
have been participating in the United Nations Mission in Haiti 
since March 1995.
<P>
	Canada's participation in the United Nations Mission in Haiti 
currently includes about 500 Canadian forces personnel with 
helicopter transport and engineering support, and almost 100 
civilian police to help establish a professional Haitian police force.
<P>
	Canadians know the country, they know the people, they know 
the challenges that must be faced. Canada is also no stranger to 
commanding multilateral military forces. Finally, Canadians know 
a great deal about being a civil, democratic society.
<P>
	We could play a critical role as part of the international 
community in helping maintain a secure and stable environment 
and pave the way for the full restoration of democracy in Haiti.
<P>
	Since 1947, more than 100,000 Canadians have participated in 
over 30 peacekeeping and related missions, a contribution which 
remains unmatched.
<P>
<B>(2130 )</B>
<P>
	Over 100 Canadians have lost their lives in the line of duty and 
many more have been wounded. Canada, in short, understands 
peacekeeping like few other countries. We understand its 
effectiveness in promoting international peace and security. We 
understand its ability to help lay the groundwork for democracy. 
Perhaps most important of all, we understand how it works.
<P>
	The world has always looked to Canada for peacekeeping 
experience and know how. In the case of Haiti it is doing so again. 
We can help Haiti build a better future and in doing so continue a 
long and proud peacekeeping tradition.
<P>
	Tonight as this debate goes on, Canada's name has been carried 
around the world in much of the good work that has been done by 
the Canadian Armed Forces. Whatever the decision is we wish its 
members well with the United Nations. I know they will do a good 
job for Canada.
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I confess to not seeing the 
clock too rigidly, particularly to the last member who spoke. I 
admit in great part it was out of respect for his sincere interest 
and expertise in this area.
<P>
	I wonder, in the spirit the House has demonstrated all evening, if 
I might seek your agreement to not see the clock so the member for 
Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca could be given the full 10 minutes by the 
Chair. He will conclude the debate on this issue this evening.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the House for its consideration. I very much 
appreciate entering into this debate on Haiti.
<P>
	The people of Haiti have endured over 150 years of tyranny, 
bloodshed and destitution under successive dictators and bloody 
regimes. However, the Haiti we see today on the eve of the U.S. 
pull-out is not much different from the Haiti of the last 150 years. 
There is still a desperate population and an economy in ruins.
<P>
	In this land that teeters between anarchy and hope we have been 
asked by the United Nations to take over from the United States in 
managing the peacekeeping force. However, the role the United 
Nations has completed there is far from complete.
<P>
	I am very disappointed in the government for bringing this 
debate to the House in a less than meaningful fashion. If this debate 
is to be meaningful it has to be votable. The people of Canada 
through us as their elected representatives must have the right to 
have these issues debated and voted on so their democratic rights 
can be exercised. They must know when, if and how their sons, 
daughters, husbands and wives will be sent to far off lands to 
potentially lay their lives down in the name of peace.
<P>
	There is no question in my mind that we should engage in this 
role for a number of reasons. It is our responsibility with Haiti 
lying within our sphere of geopolitical influence. The 
consequences of inaction are huge. As my colleague from Swift 
Current-Maple Creek-Assiniboia mentioned, if we do not act on 
this and Haiti descends into anarchy and bloodshed, there will be a 
mass migration of people to other shores, not to mention the basic 
humanitarian needs of these impoverished individuals for which 
we as Canadians are known to champion.
<P>
	Conditional on our involvement is that a few questions must be 
answered: first, the length of stay; second, we must have 
parameters in terms of the cost of the involvement; third, we must 
have a well defined mandate. These three principles should be 
applied to any subsequent peacekeeping operation we as a country 
dare to entertain.
<P>
	I have some suggestions for the Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
President René Préval cannot govern properly and bring peace to 
his country if he cannot govern safely. Therefore law and order 
must be restored to Haiti.
<P>
<B>(2135)</B>
<P>
	We must engage in training a constabulary in the form of a police 
force. The United States was engaging in training these individuals 
not as a police force but as a military force. That is a can of worms 
that will explode in its face.
<P>
	There must be a stable judiciary in Haiti, and this is where 
Canada can involve the United Nations and the World Court in 
helping to train a fair, equitable and democratic judiciary in Haiti.
<P>
	We must have a demilitarization of the army and paramilitary 
groups. As we look at the history of Haiti in the last 150 years, 
successive paramilitary/military groups have wreaked havoc in that 
country and have driven it repeatedly into a state of utter 
destitution and bloodshed.
<P>
	We need the help of the United States. That is why we should 
take the request of President Préval and ask the United States to 
stay on for another six months. We will need it for that and also for 
a number of other interventions if peace is to take hold in Haiti for 
the long term.
<P>
	We have to stop the shipments of arms that are clandestinely 
taking place into Haiti. This has a huge destabilizing effect on the 
country. We have to utilize international financial institutions, the 
World Bank and the IMF, to involve an integrated international 
approach for restructuring the economy in Haiti. If there is not a 
viable economy in Haiti, then there is a desperate people. If there is 
a desperate people, there is anarchy, bloodshed and it ends up 
exactly where it started.
<P>
	One may argue this is a heavy handed approach but even with 
President Aristide before President Préval, moneys given to Haiti 
for aid and development went into the pockets of corrupt officials 
and were spent in a completely useless fashion. It will require very 
much an interventionist approach from the international financial 
institutions to make sure that economic restructuring and moneys 
designated for economic restructuring go where they are supposed 
to.
<P>
	The restructuring of this land will be complex and will involve 
the multifactorial approach with the IFIs and the Organization of 
American States, as the secretary of state mentioned earlier. We 
need to take a leadership role in this because nobody is actually 
pushing these groups to take this multifactorial approach. We 
should be pushing these groups to do that for the long term.
<P>
	This issue is too large for any one country to deal with, 
particularly ours. We must do our part because international 
security, our security, is intimately entwined with the ability of 
international structures to provide for umbrellas of international 
and regional security. We cannot provide this on our own.
<P>
	I recommend again that the government involve the international 
financial institutions with a co-ordinated  plan that involves 
economic restructuring, internal security and the construction of 
good governance and democratic institutions in Haiti if it is to get 
on its feet in the future. If we do not, it will again descend into a 
bloody mess.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="92"> 92 </A></B>
<P>
	All one has to do to see how unbalanced this situation is is to 
scratch the veneer on Haiti today and see that democracy is only 
skin deep.
<P>
	As an extension of the problem in Haiti, I warn the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs of an impending problem in the Caribbean, 
particularly germane with the shooting down last week of the two 
planes from United States by Cuba. Cuba will be a huge security 
problem for Canada if we do not act in a preventative fashion. I 
urge the foreign affairs minister to do all he can to convince Mr. 
Clinton to defeat the xenophobic rhetoric forth by Jesse Helms and 
Mr. Burton in the United States.
<P>
	Their mandate is driven by the rich Cuban expatriate groups in 
the United States trying to manipulate the situation in a presidential 
year. It is definitely the wrong thing for the people of Cuba and 
definitely the wrong thing for Canada. The implications of this bill 
will have a widespread effect also on our companies trying to 
operate in Cuba in a constructive way.
<P>
	The quickest way to end the destitution and the communist 
structure in Cuba is for Canada along with other countries in a 
constructive fashion to build up the economy of the middle class in 
Cuba. If they do not, when Mr. Castro dies there will be a power 
vacuum left in a country that is economically destitute, which will 
cause anarchy and bloodshed in exactly the same way as in Haiti.
<P>
	I put that out as a warning for the minister. Again, I support what 
the government is doing in Haiti and I hope in future we will have 
further meaningful debates in the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Graham:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, I noticed that 
your vision had been obscured by the eloquence of the members of 
the House in terms of seeing the clock at the end of the Chamber. If 
I might suggest that hon. members grant the hon. parliamentary 
secretary to the minister an opportunity to speak to the issue. I 
know he intends to be very brief. I think it would be appropriate if 
he followed up on the debate.
<P>
	I ask the permission of hon. members to enable you, Mr. 
Speaker, to have the obscured vision you were good enough to have 
for the last speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It seems that my obscured 
vision is coming into question again even after a long career in 
hockey refereeing. Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Francis G. LeBlanc (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the House 
for granting me this short period of time to wrap up the debate.
<P>
	It is clear there is broad agreement on all sides of the House for 
Canada to assume a leadership role and continue its work in Haiti 
with the UN mission and to help restore democracy and security.
<P>
	We on this side of the House have received some very valuable 
contributions from the opposition to guide the government in the 
decisions it will take on this subject. As the foreign affairs minister 
announced earlier this evening, he will make sure the House is kept 
informed of the government's progress in Haiti regardless of how 
this unfolds in the next few hours or days, as the case may be.
<P>
	I thank all parliamentarians who contributed to the debate 
tonight for their interest in this very important subject. I assure the 
House on behalf of the Minister of Foreign Affairs that we will 
keep Parliament informed of our role in this matter.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> In the spirit of blurred 
vision, as it is 9.30 p.m., pursuant to an order made earlier this day, 
the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 9.43 p.m.)
<P>
