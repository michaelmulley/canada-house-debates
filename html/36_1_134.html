</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale—High Park, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, this past weekend the 30th annual Gemini awards were 
held in Toronto.  These awards honour all aspects of English 
language television production in Canada.  On behalf of this 
House I would like to congratulate all nominees and award 
winners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would especially like to recognize the CBC for its outstanding 
achievement and commitment to excellence in Canadian television. 
Of the 67 Gemini trophies awarded, a total of 41 went to CBC 
shows and an unprecedented 11 went to TVOntario. This year the 
majority of prizes for the best and most innovative Canadian 
television programs were awarded to publicly funded broadcasters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Gemini awards are a wonderful tribute to the talent that 
exists both behind and in front of the cameras. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, my congratulations to all nominees and award winners 
for their dedication to providing Canadians with excellent 
Canadian television.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, allegations of abuse against aboriginal people by their 
own councils abound.  Native people have been trying for years to 
get answers as to where money they have earned or been given has 
ended up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their councils have dismissed them and the department just 
sticks its head in the sand, unwilling to help them in blatant 
violation of its duty to these people.  While this is occurring, 
aboriginal people are living in third world conditions where 
violence, sexual abuse, substance abuse and diseases ranging from 
tuberculosis to diabetes tear away at the very fabric of their 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People of the Pacheedaht and Kwicksutaineuk bands and others are 
pleading for answers.  The minister of aboriginal affairs must 
get her head out of the sand.  She must do forensic audits on 
some of these reserves so these people can get the answers they 
deserve.  She must stop the thuggery that is taking place on some 
of the reserves.  She must do her job to help these people to 
help themselves.

the aftermath of the ice storm that hit eastern Ontario only 
eight short months ago, it is an honour to stand here today and 
congratulate the village of Merrickville which has been 
recognized as the prettiest village in all of Canada.  The 
village of Merrickville won this award through the Communities In 
Bloom program which was launched in 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This program is committed to fostering civic pride, 
environmental responsibility and beautification through community 
participation and the challenge of national competition.  I know 
how hard the people in this community had to work to get their 
village in shape for this competition.  Their community spirit 
and determination has certainly paid off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the organizing committee which consisted of Gary 
Clarke, Rhoda Drake, Joan Spencer and Doug Struthers, as well as 
the countless volunteers who supported this initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here's to Merrickville, the best bloomin' village in all of 
Canada.

on October 15, women the world over will celebrate International 
Rural Women's Day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada, women living in rural communities make a large 
contribution to the diversity and the excellence of the Canadian 
agricultural sector.  They have shown us how vital their role is 
by playing a direct role in farm operations and management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada, over 25% of farms are run by women and 30% are run by 
married couples.  Rural women play an important role in keeping 
communities going and sustaining rural life, through the long 
hours they devote to volunteer and community activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of my colleague, the Secretary of State for 
Agriculture and Agri-Food and Fisheries and Oceans, the member 
for Bellechasse—Etchemins—Montmagny—L'Islet, who is responsible for 
this file, I encourage all rural women to continue to be active 
in agriculture, and I thank them for the tremendous contribution 
they are making to the cultural, social and economic life of our 
country.

including the colourful former mayor Terry McCann. Bernadette was 
a humble and unassuming woman who went to church every day.  When 
she died, over 30 priests attended her funeral. She was a 
tireless worker with a strong commitment to her family, to her 
friends, to her God, to her church and to her community. She left 
behind a legacy of caring and compassion that remains to sustain 
us in this altered world of ours.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday the Prairie Pools reported:  “In 1997 total 
net farm income in the prairies has dropped by 35% in Alberta, 
40% in Manitoba, and 84% in Saskatchewan.  Farm cash receipts for 
the first six months of 1998 are significantly lower than last 
year”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of agriculture says that current government 
programs are sufficient to address this looming economic crisis 
on the prairies.  The minister is burying his head in a stubble 
field.  Using off-farm income figures to hide from this western 
crisis will not protect the minister for long.

needs of most western producers.  Some farmers had to withdraw 
cash from their NISA accounts this year just to buy seed to plant 
their crops.  Next year will be worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the minister going to let prairie farmers blow in the cruel 
winds caused in large part by almost three decades of 
mismanagement by Liberal governments?  Do something now.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne—Blainville, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, here 
we thought the fight for equality had been won.  We thought 
discrimination in all its forms was a thing of the past.  Men 
and women were equal before the law.  Long before that, race 
equality was established in our country.  And before that, the 
poll tax was eliminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, rich and poor, white and black, men and women, we 
thought we were at last all equal, not only before the law, but 
in the eyes of our employers.  That is, until another head of 
the hydra of inequality appeared, in the form of the so-called 
orphan clauses in collective agreements under which, in 
situations where skills, seniority and education are equal, 
children will earn less than their father. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So we will fight this latest battle too, to ensure that 
discrimination on the basis of sex, race and income is not 
followed by the latest incarnation of the monster, 
discrimination on the basis of age.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Kenora—Rainy River, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is an honour for me to rise today and recognize the 
efforts of Bishop Beardy from Muskrat Dam in my constituency.  He 
is the first aboriginal bishop in the Anglican church.  He is the 
spiritual leader of over 50 parishes scattered over 800,000 
square kilometres in northern Ontario and Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In August, Bishop Beardy and community members began the second 
Sacred Walk for Healing.  They began in Lac Seul and have today 
reached their destination of Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the sacred walk is to raise awareness of past 
abuse in First Nations communities, to foster reconciliation 
between aboriginal peoples, non-aboriginal people and the church, 
and to raise money for community based healing initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Bishop Beardy himself has said “You can't witness so much 
pain and do nothing.  This is something we all can do, everyone 
together”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope members of this House will join me in recognizing and 
applauding the contribution Bishop Beardy is making toward a more 
positive future for all Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want this House to go beyond a sense of concern.  Obviously, 
Canadians are outraged over the horrors being endured by 
civilians in Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As winter approaches, almost 275,000 ethnic Albanians are 
homeless while Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic continues to 
disregard the idle threats of NATO and the United Nations. This 
hurts the people of Kosovo and the people of Serbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The slaughter in Kosovo is finally forcing the western world to 
take bold action against Milosevic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been discussing the murder of civilians for almost a 
year, and we must now stop the killing. Instead of remaining on 
the fence, it is time for Canada to act with its NATO allies to 
stop the slaughter.

Elimination of Poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On September 24, 1997, the Prime Minister said, and I quote 
“Poverty is the factor that interferes most with a good start in 
life”.  He went on “We will invest in children, our most 
important resource”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In keeping with their tradition, the Liberals did exactly the 
opposite. 
They took billions of dollars from the pockets of low income 
families, by refusing to index the child tax benefit, income tax 
tables and GST credits.

and freedom that we enjoy today began this hunger strike.

the solicitor general is supposed to be the nation's top cop.  He

</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the solicitor general still sitting in cabinet? 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

allegations which have been made are unfounded.  I denied them. 
The person I was speaking with supported my position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. members are joining in this story when in fact there is 
no reality in it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK36"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a funny thing that a Liberal lawyer might just agree and 
corroborate with him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week the solicitor general publicly bragged to his long 
time Liberal pal on the airplane what a hot rock he had become in 
Ottawa.  Yet he bragged at the same time about the secret Airbus 
investigation and about who the fall guys might be for APEC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These petty boasts have betrayed sensitive government business. 
When will the Prime Minister demand the solicitor general's 
resignation? 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to refer the hon. member to what was said 
because she referred to Airbus in the scrum by the member for 
Palliser, the famous member we have to watch for all the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“There was absolutely no reference per se to Airbus.  I do not 
recall the solicitor general ever saying the word Airbus in the

<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a funny thing.  If a lawyer betrayed his client he would be 
disbarred.  If a doctor revealed sensitive information about a 
client he would lose his practice.  However the solicitor general 
discusses sensitive government business about Airbus or 
individuals connected with it or APEC, and what does the Prime 
Minister do?  He defends him, supports him and brags him up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could the Prime Minister defend behaviour that would have 
other Canadians disbarred, banned, fined or fired? 
<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

Palliser said the word Airbus was never used or heard by anybody 
or discussed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the best proof coming from that member.  She knows it. 
She is bringing it up, repeating it, having no respect for what

<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
until now it has been a sacred parliamentary rule that solicitors 
general do not talk about cases that are under their 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet this solicitor general felt at ease discussing Frank Moores 
and Karlheinz Schreiber who are principals in the Airbus affair, 
if not by name at least by implication.  He was comfortable 
discussing the outcome of the APEC inquiry, and he did all this 
with a fellow passenger on a public commercial airline.  That is 
a public forum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Prime Minister not see that the solicitor general has 
compromised the integrity of his position and that he must ask 
for his resignation? 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, there is absolutely no respect for the truth.  There was 
no discussion of Airbus in that discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not only the solicitor general or the lawyer; it is even 
the member for Palliser who said that the word Airbus was never 
mentioned in relation to any of this. 
<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, by 
refusing to ask the solicitor general for his resignation the 
Prime Minister is setting a dangerous precedent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It means that there is a new rule for solicitors general.  It 
means that confidential investigations under his care are fair 
game and open for public discussion and debate, and even 
prejudgment in public fora. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To restore public confidence in the position of the solicitor

Solicitor General as prejudicial to the RCMP inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Prime Minister realize that the Solicitor General's 
alibi is nothing more than a letter from a friend, who 
interpreted what he heard as a good little Liberal, and that it 
therefore does not have much substance to it?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member knows very well that an inquiry has been under 
way since Monday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All we are asking, and all the government wants—and the House of 
Commons as well, I hope—is for the commission to look at the 
matter, hear witnesses describe what occurred in Vancouver that 
November afternoon, and report to the government, which will act 
accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time, however, Parliament should let the commission do 
its job, instead of speculating about hearsay. 
<P><A NAME="LINK46"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Prime Minister would like the investigation to focus on what 
happened between the protestors and the RCMP.  But what we would 
like to know is what the Prime Minister did, and what his 
Solicitor General had to say on the plane. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Prime Minister not think that Mr. Toole's letter, his 
presence in Ottawa yesterday, his statement that he had not been 
asked to do anything further, all smack of someone following 
orders, just like the situation between the RCMP and the Prime 
Minister? 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
as I have said, there is no need for concern, because I want the 
truth to be known. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I owe no one any apologies for my favourable prejudice toward 
the RCMP.  They did an excellent job at the G-7 summit in 
Halifax.  Prior to APEC, we had visits by the President of the 
United States and the Premier of China, with no problems 
whatsoever.  For that reason, I had confidence in the RCMP in 
connection with the important meeting in Vancouver. 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, the Prime 
Minister may have faith in the RCMP, but we in Quebec know what 
the RCMP is capable of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Monday, the Solicitor General suffered a complete memory 
lapse. Yesterday, he was able to make subtle distinctions about 
what he did or did not say aboard the plane. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Prime Minister not realize that his Solicitor General's 
suddenly revived memory has no credibility, makes no sense and 
leaves a bad smell, and that he should demand his resignation?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, at 
10 a.m. yesterday, the Solicitor General rose in the House of

confirmed by the lawyer with whom he had had a conversation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To me, that is good enough. As for the notes allegedly made, are 
they accurate or not? When we are having a private conversation, 
we do not expect the people around us to eavesdrop.

discuss his business on a plane. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot blame the Prime Minister for wanting to defend his

make mistakes.  He talked about the new international centre for

we have discussed this problem.  What we want is for the

that all Canadians will know exactly what went on in Vancouver 
last November.  That would serve everyone's interests.

the solicitor general talked publicly about fall guys in the APEC

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have replied to the same question many, many times. 
The answer is that the solicitor general is a man with a great 
reputation, who has been a member of the House for five years. He 
has been an extremely diligent member.  He has said that he has 
never debated anything in relation to things that were not part 
of the public discussion at any time with anybody, and I believe 
him.  That was confirmed by the lawyer with whom he was talking, 
but not confirmed by someone who was snooping on him.  Usually a 
snooper does not get his facts right.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Mr.

sweat lodge, right about the Yankees and right about his great 
future as an ambassador. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general cannot have it both ways.  Will he now

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the Prime Minister has said that human rights is on the

the Solicitor General's conversation was a private or public one 
is not the question.  What is important is that the minister 
responsible for the RCMP has revealed details concerning an 
investigation that is under way to a citizen who is not a party 
to that investigation.  This is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That conversation, coupled with his behaviour over the past two

clear that the Solicitor General will not assume responsibility

Mr. Speaker, the answer is no.  We have analyzed the study by NAV

safety areas.  Today we have informed NAV Canada that it must 
revisit its aeronautical study and address all our safety

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>ORAL QUESTION PERIOD 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK128"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Hamilton West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
question of privilege arises from question period.  I beg the 
indulgence of the Speaker to bring forward my point because quite 
certainly it is unrehearsed and unprepared.  However I am going 
to try to make my point as succinctly as I can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has much to do with my privilege being breached in that there 
have been many times over the course of the last several weeks, 
and maybe even months, that during question period there are very 
important questions being put by the opposition.  Just as weighty 
and just as important are the answers being put forward by 
members from the government side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately during the point at which one is trying to hear a 
question or hear the answer, we are cut off by the 30 second 
clock.  Quite frankly, in a day when we are speeding through 
time—we have the one minute egg and the 30 second breakfast and 
everything else—I think this place deserves more than to have 
the Speaker moved by a time limitation.  It stops me from hearing 
the question— 
<P><A NAME="LINK129"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  As a question of privilege I would judge 
that is not a question of privilege.  However I think the hon. 
member has a point.  The House of Commons, in its wisdom, has had 
discussions.  The hon. member has another avenue by which he can 
pursue this matter.  I am sure we can give him this advice a bit 
later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was a recommendation that was made by the House leaders as 
far as time is concerned, and I have taken the recommendation to 
heart.  There are times when because of one reason or another I 
would give a little more time for a question and a little more 
time for an answer.  By and large, hon. members have been getting 
their questions in and their answers in under the 35 seconds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the hon. member does have the procedures committee.  I 
am sure it would want to hear what he has to say about that.  As 
a question of privilege I would judge it is not a question of 
privilege.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in the House on a point of order to protest 
the Chair's acceptance of the words fabricated and fabrication as 
used by the solicitor general in response to a question from the 
New Democratic Party and the use of the word fabrication directed 
in response to a member from the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw your attention, Mr. Speaker, to citation 494 at page 151 
of Beauchesne's.  Both these words are, I would suggest and in my 
submission, clearly unparliamentary and I would ask that the 
Chair ask for those words to be withdrawn. 
<P><A NAME="LINK133"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Generally speaking there is no word 
which in and of itself is unparliamentary.  It depends on the 
usage of the word and it depends on the context in which it is 
used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all respect to my colleagues, we do not use the word liar 
in the Chamber.  We would not permit one member to call another 
member a liar.  However, in the use of the word itself, if a 
member were to say “it has been said that I am a liar”, I would 
be hard pressed to stop the member from using the word about 
himself.  I do not say this facetiously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The words fabricated, hardly believable, unbelievable or 
incredible are all bordering on words that are unparliamentary. 
I would hope that words such as fabricated, fabrication and 
deliberately fabricated would not be used.  That is why I caution 
members and I ask them not to use them in the course of our 
debates.

hon. member's admonition, if I can call it that, as a gentle 
admonition to the Chair.  I will seriously consider these types 
of words when we even get close to an unparliamentary word and I 
will consider intervening more readily in the future.

Consideration of changes to the Aurora communications systems has 
not proceeded beyond the planning stage.  Changes could include 
the replacement of the Communications Management System, CMS; 
modernization of the data link capability; replacement of the HF, 
UHF, and VHF radios; acquisition of a satellite communication 
capability, and the acquisition of two additional UHF radios. 
Although planning is underway all changes to the Aurora 
communications systems are subject to approval by appropriate 
authorities.  Cost data are proprietary figures obtained in 
confidence from a number of individual industries.  It is not a 
certainty that all changes will proceed or that they will be

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from September 28 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-51, an act to amend the Criminal Code, the Controlled 
Drugs and Substances Act and the Corrections and Conditional 
Release Act, be read the second time and referred to a committee.

<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, again it is a privilege to speak to Bill C-51, an act to 
amend the Criminal Code, the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act 
and the Corrections and Conditional Release Act.  It is an 
omnibus bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say this at the outset.  When we look at the legislative 
agenda and when we look at this bill we realize the great 
potential that this bill has to deal with issues such as 
gambling, homicide, child prostitution, conditional sentences and 
organized crime.  Does this bill actually take this issue with 
both hands and try to implement constructive solutions to deal 
with these important issues?  No, it does not.  That reflects the 
ongoing problem that we have in this House.  The problems that 
are occurring in our country are at best being nibbled at around 
the edges and at worst are being ignored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We simply are not getting our hands into the meat of the issue 
and presenting constructive solutions that are out there in this 
country and around the world which we could implement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-51 deals with gambling.  Does it deal with gambling as an 
addiction?  Does it deal with the huge problems that gambling is 
wreaking on certain families?  Does it deal with the increasing 
problem of gambling as a health issue?  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the bill do?  It deals with permitting casinos on 
cruise ships to remove the prohibition on dice games.  Surely we 
have better things to do in this House of Commons than to deal 
with that issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could be dealing with constructive issues on how to help 
people who are having problems with gambling, rather than seeing 
gambling as just another tax grab, which in fact it is in many 
areas.  It is causing huge problems in many societies and some on 
aboriginal reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we dealing with violent crime?  Are we dealing with ways to 
prevent violent crime?  Are we dealing with ways to prevent 
innocent Canadians from getting hurt?  No, we nibble around the 
edges and put this pithy amendment that will ensure victims no 
longer have to die within a year for it to be called a homicide.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We certainly support that, but surely the government could have 
put forth more constructive solutions in this bill to protect 
Canadians.  Surely the government could have developed ways to 
adopt the idea of the Liberal member who put forth a private 
member's motion.  The member is from Toronto and her motion deals 
with consecutive sentencing for violent crimes rather than the 
concurrent sentencing that currently exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those convicted of violent crimes too often receive concurrent 
sentences.  What kind of message does that send to people who 
commit murder or violent offences?  It tells them that if they 
kill one person or rape one person, if they commit assault 
causing bodily harm to one person, it is the same as if they do 
it six times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government could have dealt with that.  It could have 
implemented the private member's motion but it chose not to. 
What an embarrassment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Child prostitution is a huge problem in our country. 
Prostitutes as young as 11 or 12 are being procured.  Many are 
being put on drugs as a way to force them into lives of 
prostitution.  It ruins their lives or, worse, it kills them 
through violence or through the acquisition of AIDS. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has the government done concerning child prostitution?  It 
has invoked suggestions and amendments to ensure that wiretaps 
are allowed.  Our party has been putting forward constructive 
solutions for years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we have mandatory minimum sentencing for anybody who is 
pimping children?  Why could the government not take this bill 
and put forth mandatory sentencing for people who are hooking 
children on drugs, who are pimping 11 and 12 year old girls and 
boys, who are grossly abusing these children for life?  Why could 
the government not put forth a bill to address that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage and implore the government to listen to the 
constructive suggestions that are coming not only from our side 
but from all parties.  These are constructive solutions on child 
prostitution.  I challenge the Minister of Justice, whom I know 
is very interested in this, to go out on the street.  She should 
not speak to the people on top, she should find out what is 
happening on the street from the prostitutes, the people whose 
lives are utterly ruined by this scourge.  She should go to 
Vancouver or Toronto.  She should see what is occurring on the 
street. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider conditional sentencing.  I cannot believe the 
government did not adopt the motion put forward by a government 
member who had a constructive private member's bill that dealt 
with consecutive sentencing for violent offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider organized crime.  The public would be interested 
in knowing that an individual who is sentenced can get parole 
after one-sixth of their sentence is up.

parole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  But the fact that anybody can apply and 
receive a release after serving one-sixth of their sentence is 
appalling.  What kind of message does it send to the RCMP and the 
police officers around this country when criminals can be out 
after serving one-sixth of their sentence after police put their 
lives on the line and worked hard to get the criminals arrested 
and convicted? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill ensures that people who are members of criminal 
organizations have to serve more than one-sixth of their 
sentence.  Why are people involved in organized crime, 
racketeering, prostitution, scams and murder being released after 
serving one-sixth of their sentence?  That is no way to give the 
Canadian people the confidence they require in the justice system 
in order for them to be able to say they feel safe in their 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are fully sympathetic with giving people a chance.  We are 
fully sympathetic with understanding that some people can at 
times in their lives run afoul of the law and have a lot of angst 
about what they have done.  But organized crime has little to do 
with having sympathy for a teenager who falls afoul of the law 
for a misdemeanour. 
It has little sympathy for somebody who has been abused during 
their life, who does something wrong and is convicted.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This has to do with people who commit murder.  This has to do 
with people who take money from immigrants in our country and rob 
them for the promise of protection.  This has to do with gross 
abuse of innocent civilians in our country.  Those are the people 
we need to be hitting hard.  Those are the laws that need to be 
made tougher and those are the people we need to be putting 
behind bars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill deals with some issues, but it also misses some.  The 
Reform Party is in favour of good constructive laws that protect 
Canadians from firearm violations.  We do not approve of gun 
registration for the simple reason that it is going to make our 
streets less safe.  It is taking money out of the functional arm 
of justice and putting it into something that is not going to 
make our streets more safe.  If gun registration was going to 
make our streets safer then we would support it.  But the cold 
hard facts support very clearly the notion that gun registration 
will not make Canadian streets safer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to hire 350 RCMP officers in British Columbia, but they 
will not be hired because of a lack of funds.  However, the 
government is pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into 
something that will not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government had an opportunity to deal with crime prevention. 
I know the Minister of Justice has started up a very good program 
in Edmonton dealing with crime prevention and I compliment her 
for doing that.  I think it is a move in the right direction. 
The member for Moncton—Riverview—Dieppe has been a leader in 
the national head start program, which she and her husband have 
put together, and she deserves to be complimented for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those ideas and ideas from all opposition parties have been put 
forth for some time, including Private Member's Motion 261 that I 
introduced in May, which passed unanimously in the House.  They 
need to be looked at, examined and adopted quickly, because we 
are simply not dealing with the root causes of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, it has been proved that dealing with children in 
the first eight years of life can have a dramatic, profound and 
positive effect in making sure these children stay in school 
longer.  It reduces crime by 50%.  It reduces teen pregnancy by 
60%.  There is a net saving to the social programs because fewer 
of them are on welfare.  It saves the taxpayer $30,000 per child. 
How can hon. members disagree with that?  The proof is there from 
Moncton to Hawaii to Ypsilanti, Michigan where effective programs 
have been implemented to prevent crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the government in Bill C-51 not utilize the good 
suggestions that have come from across party lines, from within 
its own caucus, and implement them in a constructive and coherent 
fashion across this country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has an enormous leadership role.  Although it is 
true that many of these programs should indeed be in the realm 
and the purview of the provinces, it is within the government's 
power to call together the first ministers of health, of justice 
and of HRD and ask them to bring to the table what programs they 
already have.  Then they could find out what does not work and 
eject those programs.  They could keep what works and integrate 
those programs into a national program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not one single province, not one premier, not one minister in 
any province has the power to do that.  It is only the ministers 
who are sitting across from us today.  Those ministers have the 
power, have the duty, have the responsibility to exert the 
leadership that has been bestowed upon them by the Canadian 
people.  They and only they have the power to call those 
ministers together and hold that meeting that will have a most 
dramatic and profound effect on the lives, health, welfare and 
future of young Canadians today.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us get on with it.  Let us not see a bill such as Bill C-51. 
Let us stick our hands into these issues and problems and 
implement solutions that have been proven beyond a shadow of a 
doubt to work and to save money. They are win-win situations 
across party lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us stop introducing politics into these issues and deal with 
the facts.  If we dealt with the facts and if we managed to have 
some semblance of debate on the facts, we would be able to 
achieve to the greatest advantage the potential of members across 
party lines in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I implore the government to look at the suggestions that are 
going to come from members in the Reform Party, that are going to 
come from members on the government side and from members of the 
other opposition parties.  Look at those constructive solutions. 
Look at those solutions based on facts and implement them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government could also deal with the horrendous situations on 
aboriginal reserves. The member for Wild Rose and the member for 
Skeena have repeatedly brought up constructive solutions to deal 
with those situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spent some time this summer working as a physician dealing 
with aboriginal people in emergencies.  They had been beaten up, 
had overdosed, had attempted suicide, had been abused or sexually 
abused.  The responsibility falls on the shoulders of the 
non-aboriginal leaders of this country and the aboriginal leaders 
in pursuing a course that in my personal view, and I am not 
speaking for the Reform Party, is leading their people absolutely 
nowhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They need to start dealing with the facts.  They need to deal 
with the horrendous situations that are occurring on the 
reserves. They need to break the cycle of an institutionalized 
welfare state that we have implemented and which continues to 
shackle the aboriginal people in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to ensure that the resources that are put forth by the 
department of Indian affairs are going where they are supposed to 
go.  Many of my colleagues and I have aboriginal reserves in our 
constituencies.  Aboriginal people have been looking for answers 
as to where the moneys have gone that they have generated and 
which have been given to them by the department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are these moneys being used for education?  Are they being used 
for substance abuse issues? Are they used for training? Are the 
moneys being used on the Pacheedaht reserve in my riding to 
repair the septic tanks that are overflowing with sewage?  The 
health department is aware of this yet nothing is done.  People 
turn a blind eye.  They stick their heads in the sand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Money is given without accountability.  Who do they abuse?  They 
abuse the aboriginal people who have no recourse because when 
they go to the department they are told to go to their councils. 
When they go to their councils, a blind eye is turned on them 
again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if many of the members on the other side 
understand the profound tragedy that is occurring and what their 
actions are doing to these people.  The answer is to perform 
forensic audits on some of these reserves, not to go on a 
witch hunt, not to find a scapegoat, but merely to find answers so 
that the available resources are going to the people so they can 
stand up on their own two feet and take care of themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister mentioned last week that her proposals and the way 
her government is pursuing this is a way to integrate and bring 
together aboriginal people.  In my province of British Columbia 
the Nisga'a deal is going to do the exact opposite.  It is going 
to be the wedge that will split aboriginal and non-aboriginal 
people apart.  Aboriginal and non-aboriginal people have to come 
together in an environment of mutual respect and tolerance so 
they can work together to build a stronger constructive society 
where everybody can reach their fullest potential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have visited reserves where people are being shot. People are 
being sexually abused.  They have no recourse.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Money that is supposed to go to them for educational purposes is 
somehow disappearing.  It is alleged that it is going into the 
hands of the council.  Does anybody look into this?  No, no one 
does.  Who pays for it?  Certainly the taxpayer, but more 
importantly the aboriginal people on those reserves who in some 
cases are being abused by absolute and utter thuggery.  Does 
anybody listen to them?  No.  Why?  Because we are being 
hamstrung by political correctness and we are afraid to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to overcome this fear, not for ourselves but for the 
aboriginal people who live in our country in conditions 
equivalent to third world conditions.  I challenge any member on 
the other side to look at this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does Bill C-51 have anything to do with dealing with the 
violence that is occurring on the reserves?  No, absolutely 
nothing.  Does it deal with the rape, the sexual abuse, the abuse 
of children and the violence that is taking place?  No, it does 
nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whose confidence do we lose?  We lose the confidence of the 
grassroots aboriginal peoples. They are looking and pleading for 
leadership.  They are crying out for help.  And what do we do? We 
toss some money over to the council, to the Assembly of First 
Nations, a political body and not necessarily a body for the 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Grassroots aboriginal people have been looking for years for 
people to champion them so they can stand on their own feet. 
They are not that interested in land claims but they do want to 
live in safety.  They want jobs.  They want to work. They want to 
keep their culture and have their language preserved.  They want 
to be the masters of their destiny.  They want what we want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why have we continued to pursue a course of separation and 
apartheid in Canada?  Why have we done this?  I ask members on 
the other side to look into their souls and find this out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know my time is over, but I hope the government members will 
work with us and all members in the House to make some 
constructive changes to justice for all people instead of 
sticking our heads in the sand and dealing with absolute pith. 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in regard to the native issues that have been going on 
around the countryside on the reserves, I have seen examples from 
being on many reserves in my day and currently visiting many 
during the time I spend in my constituency. After an election, 
people who had jobs on the reserves are arbitrarily fired the day 
after the election, obviously for having voted wrong or supported 
the wrong person.  Hydro has been pulled out from a given 
residence. These are documented cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem seems to be a lack of democratic accountability. 
That democratic accountability does not seem to be as much as 
what we have in our municipal, provincial and federal 
governments.  Those governments are not perfect in accountability 
in regard to access to information and labour laws and those 
kinds of things, but I would ask the member to comment in regard 
to that type of democratic accountability.  Is there room for 
improvement in all provinces in that regard? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that question hits at a 
very important issue which many grassroots aboriginal people are 
concerned with.  It deals not only with what is occurring now but 
what will occur in the future after land claims are settled.  It 
deals with the issue of democratic accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Vancouver Island three grassroots bands have come to me, the 
Becher Bay band, Pacheedaht band and the Kwicksutaineuk band. 
These three bands and many others have been asking their members 
of parliament to find answers for them.  The issue comes to 
accountability, not only for the way the bands are run but also 
for where the resources are going. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1555"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now many bands are run very well but many are not.  Money 
is going to band councils and it is being put into the pockets of 
band council members.  When band members ask where the money has 
gone, they receive a dismissive note or worse, they are abused. 
Some people have had their houses broken into.  Some people have 
had violence committed against them and their families when they 
ask questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When those aboriginal people go to the department of Indian 
affairs, the minister slams protected on her letters and says “I 
do not see anything wrong here.  Go to the RCMP if there is a 
problem”. The RCMP are unwilling to enter into this.  They do 
not have the resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is as my hon. friend mentioned. The grassroots 
aboriginal people are caught between a rock and hard place.  No 
one is helping them out. If the minister of Indian affairs does 
not deal with this issue quickly, she will be in trouble because 
we will not stand for it any longer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is passing strange that members from the government are not 
even attempting to stand up on these very important issues on 
justice to ask even one question.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
as I am the first member of my party to speak to this bill, I 
will speak for the 40 minutes accorded me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To talk on such a vast and interesting topic, I would need more 
than 40 minutes, but I will not invoke the Standing Orders of 
this House to seek unanimous consent to speak longer.  I will 
try to limit myself to the 40 minutes allotted me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, as you are considerate toward members, I would ask 
you to let me know when I have only five minutes left, as is the 
practice in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First off, perhaps some of my colleagues opposite or elsewhere 
in this House are wondering why the Bloc Quebecois transport 
critic is speaking to a bill concerning major amendments to the 
Criminal Code and the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and 
amendments to the Corrections and Conditional Release Act.  The 
reason is quite simple.  It is not just because I am a lawyer by 
training, but this bill contains a provision we find very 
interesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without making any assumption about our party's position at 
third reading, I will say right off that this bill can be 
improved.  We intend to make certain amendments in committee, 
which we believe will hold the government's attention and that 
of all the members of the Standing Committee on Justice and 
Human Rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me begin by discussing the general provisions of this bill, 
before getting to the one which is of particular interest to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill includes amendments to permit the operation of casinos 
on international cruise ships that are Canadian or in Canadian 
waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also amends the Criminal Code to permit dice-games conducted 
and managed by a province. I am convinced that Loto-Québec will 
be very interested in that provision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also seeks to widen the scope of the offence of 
obtaining the services of a prostitute under eighteen years old. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It amends the Criminal Code to repeal the “year and a day 
rule” 
for offences involving homicide and criminal negligence causing 
death.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill modernizes the fraud and theft provisions in respect of 
valuable minerals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also modernizes the provisions concerning the offence of 
making likenesses of bank-notes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It ensures that only officials with law enforcement duties can 
execute search warrants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It provides for the authority to remove lawfully-installed 
electronic surveillance devices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It provides sentencing measures dealing with the consideration 
of outstanding charges, the offender's ability to pay a fine and 
addressing technical matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It provides rules governing when conditional sentences run 
following the breach of a condition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It brings deceptive telemarketing offences against the 
Competition Act under the forfeiture provisions for the proceeds 
of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, it provides a number of other technical amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also provides for amendments to the Controlled Drugs 
and Substances Act that deal with aggravating factors in 
sentencing and the criminal liability of law enforcement 
officers engaged in their duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And, finally, it provides for amendments to the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act that exclude those convicted of 
organized-crime offences from eligibility for accelerated parole 
review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because Bill C-51 represents an important victory for the Bloc 
Quebecois with respect to the operation of casinos on 
international cruise ships, hence my remarks this afternoon, we 
support the bill in principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We feel, however, that the bill does not go far enough with 
respect to money laundering, particularly as it does not remove 
$1,000 bank notes from circulation.  We know that our colleague, 
the hon. member for Charlesbourg, introduced a private member's 
bill about this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party also believes that the bill will not prevent the 
distressing repetition of cases like that of Joseph Lagana, who 
was released from prison after serving only one-sixth of his 
sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, the member for Berthier—Montcalm, will have an 
opportunity to take this up later on in the Standing Committee 
on Justice and Human Rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To come back to the point that interests us, I ask the House to 
examine clause 7 of the bill, which would amend the act by 
adding the following after section 207 of the Criminal Code. 
I believe it is pertinent to read it: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>207.1 (1) Despite any of the provisions of this Part relating to 
gaming and betting, it is lawful for the owner or operator of an 
international cruise ship, or their agent, to conduct, manage or 
operate and for any person to participate in a lottery scheme 
during a voyage on an international cruise ship when all of the 
following conditions are satisfied: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>a</I>) all the people participating in the lottery scheme are 
located on the ship; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>b</I>) the lottery scheme is not linked, by any means of 
communication, with any lottery scheme, betting, pool selling or 
pool system of betting located off the ship; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>c</I>) the lottery scheme is not operated within five nautical 
miles of a Canadian port at which the ship calls or is scheduled 
to call; and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>d</I>) the ship is registered 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(i) in Canada and its entire voyage is scheduled to be outside

</I></B></P><P align=left>(B) is not scheduled to disembark any passengers at a 
Canadian port who have embarked at another Canadian port, 
without calling on at least one non-Canadian port between the two 
Canadian ports.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would start off by indicating that this clause suits the Bloc 
Quebecois for a number of reasons I shall try to explain. It is 
also supported unanimously by the greater Quebec City regional 
community.  I will have the opportunity later to refer to 
certain stakeholders who have supported certain actions by the 
Bloc Quebecois in the Quebec City region culminating in what we 
have before us now, Bill C-51. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to return to one point, and I think it would be 
appropriate to do so.  Our party, the Bloc Quebecois, had 
introduced private members' bills on behalf of the regional team 
of Bloc Quebecois MPs. 
I refer to Bill C-415, an act to amend the Criminal Code (gaming 
and betting), which I have introduced.  I think it would be 
relevant to see to what extent the government listened to what 
the Bloc Quebecois was calling for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the latest election campaign, and in the one held in 1993, 
some people wondered—and it was often our neighbours opposite, 
when we met them in all party debates—what the Bloc was doing 
there.  There were even some simple-minded plays on words to the 
effect that the Prime Minister was serving us or that the 
Progressive Conservative leader, Jean Charest, was serving us. 
It was said that the Bloc Quebecois would block the system.  A 
very intellectual remark. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had, and we still have, a role to play.  The victory we 
gained because the government listened to our voice on this 
amendment to the Criminal Code shows very clearly that members 
of the Bloc Quebecois, who represent 60% of the ridings in 
Quebec, play an important role in the defence of Quebec's 
interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, by introducing Bill C-415, I sought to amend the 
Criminal Code to make it possible for someone on an 
international cruise ship in Canadian waters to set up and 
operate a prescribed casino for the passengers on that ship 
under certain conditions.  The bill also provides that a 
passenger on such a ship may enter such a casino and engage in 
gaming and betting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not refer to the amendment to section 207.1 of the 
Criminal Code that I was proposing, but I will remind the House 
that I had proposed the casino close one hour before the ship 
called at a Canadian port. The government preferred to have the 
casino close five nautical miles before the ship called at a 
Canadian port. We have no problem there.  I will have to ask my 
friends who are pilots on the lower St. Lawrence what an hour is 
in nautical miles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will recall that in another parliament, the Bloc 
Quebecois introduced another private member's bill, which 
unfortunately died on the Order Paper with the election call on 
June 2, 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must take a few minutes to speak about the antiquated private 
members' bill procedure, inherited from the British 
parliamentary system, just as your function as speaker and ours 
as members of parliament were. There is this procedure for 
private members' bills, commonly known as private bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The procedure for selecting private members' bills to be debated 
in this House is totally archaic. This is incredible, when the 
year 2000 is almost upon us.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are on the eve of a new century, a new millennium. Yet, we 
are still using the archaic procedure consisting basically in 
picking the name of the member whose bill shall be debated out 
of a hat. You did hear correctly, Mr. Speaker, out of a hat. I 
noticed you almost fell out of your chair, but I can see you are 
sitting back comfortably now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members' names are put in a hat and bills are picked at random. 
This is a monumental aberration. I think that, on the eve of the 
new millennium, we should be able to find a different method for 
selecting private members' bills. 
By definition, a private member's bill has been drafted by a 
member of parliament democratically elected by his constituents, 
regardless of his or her political affiliation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I greatly value parliamentary work and I have respect for all my 
colleagues from both sides of the House. Every one of us has a 
legitimate right to sit here. We have all been democratically 
elected to this place. No one in Canada had a gun to their head 
when they voted. No one voted under the threat of machine guns. 
That is democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why, every opportunity I have, whether in this House or 
in committee, I ask that our fellow citizens' wish to have us 
represent them to the best of our abilities be respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not perfect. And no member can claim to have a magic wand 
and to be able to perform miracles. We do our best and have 
strong beliefs. 
I am asking our fellow members of Parliament to respect us as 
individuals. There is no ambiguity about the Bloc Quebecois' 
role: we are here to promote Quebec's sovereignty, to show that 
the federal system does not work, and to protect the interests 
of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were elected in a fair manner. Considering that 60% of the 
ridings in Quebec are represented by Bloc Quebecois members, I 
think everybody should accept the results of the democratic 
vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I want to ask you something, Mr. Speaker, 
since you are an active and well-known jurist in the region of 
Kingston and the Islands. I would like you to seriously think 
about how to improve the selection process of private members' 
bills. I am asking you to do that, and I do hope to hear from 
you on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To allow the operation of casinos on cruise ships was one of the 
issues on the electoral platform of the regional caucus of the 
Bloc Quebecois, before the June 2, 1997 election. The hon. 
member for Quebec, who is sitting here and who chairs our 
eight-member regional caucus, remembers very well that we got 
together and consulted various stakeholders and groups in the 
greater Quebec City area. We gained some experience as a 
regional caucus during the previous Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This had given us an opportunity, since 1993, to regularly meet 
with various people and groups. Proposing an amendment to the 
Criminal Code, so as to permit the operation of casinos on 
international cruise ships, was an integral part of our regional 
electoral platform. 
That is why people in the greater Quebec City area are glad that 
the Criminal Code will be amended after the various stages 
required in the House of Commons so that this irritant can be 
eliminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it would be appropriate to take a few minutes to explain 
what the particular problem was.  The configuration of the Gulf 
of St. Lawrence and the St. Lawrence River affected 
international cruise ships, most of which operate casinos, which 
are one of the activities offered on cruises, as well as a 
lucrative source of income for ship owners.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We met with ship owners like those of the Holland America 
company on the MS Veemdam when it first put in at Quebec City. 
Two years ago, in September, the MS Westerdam of the same 
company also stopped over in Quebec City. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ship owners told us that, if they could operate casinos on 
board, a lot more ships would choose the St. Lawrence-Great Lakes 
system for a stopover.  As well, ships that already come here, 
could do so more often.  This would develop many more stopovers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of these ships have American passengers. 
The people listening to us are aware that the dollar went 
through a terrible crisis this summer, while the government sat 
back and did nothing.  When it dropped as low as 61 or 62 cents, 
the Prime Minister said that this was not serious, that it would 
encourage tourists to visit the beaches of New Brunswick.  He 
was more worried about his golf game, and kept his eye on the 
ball more than on the falling dollar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Be that as it may, given the state of our dollar, we know that a 
great many American cruise ship passengers are heading for the 
splendour of the Gulf of St. Lawrence and its river and the 
Great Lakes.  Naturally, these are boats whose depth and width 
permit them to pass through the locks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ship owners told us: “If we could operate our casinos until 
an hour before we land, that would add considerably to the port 
traffic, not only at Quebec City but also at Trois-Rivières and 
Montreal, and for certain ships, as far inland as Thunder Bay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why the Liberal member for Thunder Bay, had already 
indicated to me when we sat on the Standing Committee on 
Transport that he approved of the private member's bill I had 
introduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the particular geography of the St. Lawrence, the 
limit of international waters fell more or less off Anticosti 
Island.  Those who know their geography are aware that a cruise 
ship had to close its casino when it was off Anticosti, when it 
entered Canadian waters.  The first landing was only at Quebec 
City, two days later, so there was a two-day period when the 
casino could not open. 
Passengers complained, and the St. Lawrence—Great Lakes route 
suffered considerably as a result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, I would point out that the port of Halifax 
does not experience the same problem, nor does Vancouver.  Once 
a ship has left English Bay, it is in international waters 
almost immediately. Only an hour after the ship has left port, 
passengers can start gambling again, because they are already in 
international waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We say: let us amend the Criminal Code.  Loto-Quebec, among 
others, supported the Bloc Quebecois in this regard, as did the 
Quebec ministry of tourism.  They did not see any threat to the 
operation of provincial casinos because ship passengers are a 
captive clientele. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly, when the ship docks, the ship operator must, of 
course, close down the casino. 
We have no problem with that.  That is perfectly normal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned earlier that this bill had the unanimous approval of 
the region's stakeholders.  I will name some of the 
organizations that supported the Bloc Quebecois' position in 
asking the government for an amendment to the Criminal Code to 
allow casinos to operate on cruise ships.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it would be relevant for me to quote, for your personal 
edification, a letter signed by the chairman of the Quebec Urban

believe, and who wrote to the Minister of Justice on April 20, 
1998. 
He said this: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subject: Changes to the Criminal Code—authorization of casinos 
on the St. Lawrence 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Minister: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past two years, the council of the Quebec Urban 
Community has tried on a number of occasions to make your 
predecessor aware of the importance of changing the Criminal 
Code to permit the rapid growth of the international cruise 
industry on the St. Lawrence and in eastern Canada.  I have 
appended the letters sent to him and to your colleagues in the 
federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a number of occasions, it was rumoured in the media that the 
federal government was prepared to act on this issue and that 
the proposed amendments to the Criminal Code would be up for 
debate before the House of Commons in the near future. 
Unfortunately, nothing came of it, and no progress has been made 
on this issue. Several stakeholders suggested the reason for 
this delay was the lack of consensus among those in the tourist 
industry who are closely associated with development of the 
cruise ship industry. I do not think so. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is Mr. Giguère, the president of the Quebec Urban 
Community, speaking. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the contrary, this is a booming industry, and all of eastern 
Canada is benefiting from the spinoffs generated in our regional 
and provincial economies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am therefore asking once again, Madam Minister, that the 
federal government look into this matter as soon as possible and 
take appropriate action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thank you for your attention. Sincerely, 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And it is signed “Denis Giguère, President of the Quebec Urban 
Community”. We received a copy of this letter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that tourism industry stakeholders in the greater Quebec 
City area clearly supported our position, as confirmed by the 
government in agreeing to amend the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My statement about the Quebec port authority supporting our 
approach is backed by an article published in <I>Le Soleil</I> on 
Saturday, April 25, 1998. The managing director of the port de 
Québec, Ross Gaudreault, held a press conference and the related 
article can be summed up as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec City appears to be on its way to becoming a choice port 
of call for cruise ships. A growing number of passenger liners 
berth at Quebec City earlier and earlier in the season— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This fact prompted the managing director of the port de Québec, 
Ross Gaudreault, to say: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—that the coming years should see a significant increase in the 
number of passengers stopping over in the old capital. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The article went on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When cruise ships stop over, they generate very important 
economic benefits for the City of Quebec.  This year, it is 
estimated that 45,000 passengers will visit Quebec City and will 
spend approximately $110 US each, not to mention crew members 
and the expenditures related to the ships themselves.  In 1997, 
the economies of the Province of Quebec and of Quebec City 
benefited to the tune of approximately $5.9 million. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And I will stop here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to explain why this Criminal Code amendment was so 
important for economic development.  This bill effectively 
removes an irritant, and I think that the region will now be 
able to play its leadership role unimpeded and will be 
represented at conferences.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every year in March, a major North American conference is held 
in Miami at which cruise lines decide on their destinations for 
the coming years.  The Port of Quebec spokespersons, SODES or 
the various stakeholders representing the greater Quebec City 
area will be able to tell the cruise lines and ship owners that 
the irritant of not being able to operate casinos has now been 
removed by an amendment to the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to go on too long, because I want to leave time 
for other colleagues to speak as well, but I will mention that 
we raised this issue again with the Minister of Justice in a 
letter we sent her on May 21. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 8, my colleague, the member for Québec, and I held a 
press conference attended by various regional stakeholders.  And 
on June 9, we questioned the Minister of Justice in the House as 
follows: “In order to remove this obstacle to the expansion of 
the international cruise industry for once and for all, will the 
minister agree to take action and immediately introduce the 
required Criminal Code amendments, so that cruise ships can 
operate casinos in the Gulf of St. Lawrence?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's response was a very simple one.  On June 11, she 
tabled this omnibus bill, which contained a provision that would 
allow casinos on cruise ships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask in closing: why is it important for the greater 
Quebec City region to obtain this amendment?  We are convinced 
that the government will listen to this request because it is 
something on which unanimity can be readily obtained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I found the 1996 statistics on the traffic at the port of 
Vancouver in my files.  As I have already pointed out, we know 
Vancouver does not have a problem.  As soon as the cruise ship 
leaves English Bay, within an hour it can open up its casino 
again.  From our experience on several transport committees, we 
know what a boom there has been in recent years with the Alaskan 
cruises.  When their passengers visit ports of call, they leave 
money behind in the economy, including that of greater 
Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give some figures for the number of cruise passengers 
visiting the port of Vancouver in 1992, 1993, 1994 and 1996. 
In 1992, there were 449,239 passengers; in 1994, the figure had 
gone up to 591,409, and in 1996, 701,547.  According to all the 
economic studies, they contribute a lot when they come ashore. 
Let us not forget that these are people who are rather well off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week, the <I>Vision of the Sea</I>, the biggest cruise ship in the 
world, docked at the port of Quebec.  It carries 2,400 
passengers who pay some $10,000 US for a week's cruise.  We must 
point out that these are not cruises within the reach of the 
ordinary American.  The passengers are people well enough off to 
be able to afford $10,000 US for a week's cruise.  When the 
cruise ship is in port and these passengers are wandering around 
on foot exploring the city, they each leave behind between $110 
and $150 US. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Vancouver had 701,547 such visitors in 1996, one can just 
imagine what that represents. 
I will get the numbers for 1997, but they were significantly 
higher. Unless I am mistaken, they were close to 900,000. I do 
not want to give the wrong numbers. I will get back to this if I 
have the opportunity to take part in the debate at third 
reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for the economic development of a large region, 
particularly since the Quebec City region is positioning itself 
for a new type of cruises. Indeed, the Board of Trade and 
Industry of the Metropolitan Quebec is proposing to promote 
northern luxury and ecotourist cruises. 
Quebec City would become the regional boarding port for cruises 
along the Labrador coast, and perhaps even all the way up to 
Greenland.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, this could lead to some very interesting economic 
spinoffs, once this irritant is removed and it becomes possible 
to operate casinos in international waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to have had this opportunity to address the bill. 
Members may can rest assured that we will be vigilant during the 
next stages of this legislation, and the hon. member for 
Berthier—Montcalm will be on the lookout during the discussions 
in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we do not oppose the principle underlying Bill C-51, we 
will still move amendments through our critic on justice issues, 
the hon. member for Berthier—Montcalm. We do hope the government 
will be receptive to our recommendations.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to Bill C-51, an 
act to amend the Criminal Code, the Controlled Drugs and 
Substances Act and the Corrections and Conditional Release Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First I would like to draw the attention of the House, but more 
particularly the listening public, to the fact that what we have 
before us is an omnibus bill.  An omnibus bill is the name given 
to a bill that contains many unrelated amendments.  We usually 
get omnibus bills in the context of amendments to the Criminal 
Code, but it is not only in the context of amendments to the 
Criminal Code and related acts that we get omnibus bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind the House that in the past the House has found 
particular omnibus bills to be quite offensive.  That is to say, 
offensive in terms of parliamentary procedure and offensive in 
terms of the limited opportunity that it gives to the House to 
express itself on the various matters that are contained within 
the omnibus bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most paralyzing and significant crises in Canadian 
parliamentary history happened over an omnibus bill.  It was the 
omnibus bill brought in by a Liberal government in 1982. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that case it was not an omnibus bill having to do with the 
Criminal Code, but an omnibus bill having to do with energy 
policy that prompted the bell ringing crisis in the early months 
of 1982 when the bells rang for 16 days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those members of the House who do not go back that far should 
know that the bells used to be a lot louder than they are now. 
They rang and they rang for 16 days, 24 hours a day, until that 
crisis was finally dealt with.  That was over an omnibus bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the government that, although there is not that kind of 
controversy around this omnibus bill, I still find that omnibus 
bills in and of themselves provide a great deal of difficulty for 
members of the House of Commons, particularly for the opposition 
because we are put in the position of having to vote for the 
whole bill or against the whole bill.  As is often the case with 
omnibus bills, there are aspects of the bill that we support and 
aspects of the bill that we do not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to Bill C-51, there are a number of things which we 
support, such as the provision to widen the scope of the offence 
for obtaining the services of a prostitute under 18 years old, the 
provision to repeal the year and a day rule for offences 
involving homicide and criminal negligence causing death, the 
provision to modernize the fraud and theft provisions with 
respect to valuable materials and the provision to modernize the 
provisions concerning the offence of making likenesses of bank 
notes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support provisions to ensure that only officials with law 
enforcement duties can execute search warrants, provisions having 
to do with sentencing measures dealing with the consideration of 
outstanding charges, the offender's ability to pay a fine and 
those which address technical matters.  We support the provision 
of rules governing when conditional sentences run following the 
breach of a condition and bringing deceptive telemarketing 
offences against the Competition Act under the forfeiture 
provisions for the proceeds of crime.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of these are housekeeping, modernizing, technical 
amendments, but there are a couple of elements in this bill that 
we believe are worthy of debate and contention.  I refer 
specifically to the provision that would permit the operation of 
casinos on international cruise ships that are Canadian or in 
Canadian waters and the provision to permit dice games conducted 
and managed by a province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After having listened to the hon. member from the Bloc Quebecois 
I think I understand a little bit better where this amendment 
having to do with the operation of casinos on international 
cruise ships that are Canadian or in Canadian waters comes from. 
It may well be, upon reflection, that there is an argument to be 
made for this amendment that is peculiar to the circumstances 
that Quebec City finds itself in with regard to international 
cruise ships and Canadian cruise ships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was grateful to the member for explaining the value that the 
province of Quebec and Quebec City sees in this particular 
amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I will concentrate on the provision that 
permits dice games conducted and managed by a province.  I speak 
to this because I share the concern of a lot of Canadians and 
certainly my colleagues in the New Democratic Party, and 
presumably members in other caucuses as well, that all parties, 
wherever they have been in government, whether they be federal or 
provincial, over the last 10 to 15 years have succumbed in one 
way or another or are in the process of succumbing to the 
gambling game, to a form of gambling addiction which is not just 
to be found in those individuals who are addicted to gambling, 
but is to be found in governments that are addicted to the 
revenue from gambling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a problem that crosses party lines.  I do not rise in my 
place here to pretend that any one particular political party is 
somehow exempt from criticism in this regard.  It is simply to 
register my own concern and the concern of my colleagues and, as 
I said, I would hope colleagues from other parties that as a 
country we are becoming a nation of casinos. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a casino in my own riding called Club Regent.  If someone 
had asked me 10 years ago whether I would have ever thought that 
driving between my home and my constituency office I would have 
to pass a casino every day I would have said they were crazy, 
that it would never happen.  Yet today that is the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure a lot of my constituents are happy that it is there. 
It is a good location for them.  People enjoy going there and 
there are people, many of whom I know as they are good friends, 
who seem to be able to go to the casino, not spend all that much 
money and just enjoy themselves.  They have some kind of internal 
limit on what they spend and when it is done they are gone. 
Sometimes they win, sometimes they lose, but it is not 
destructive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the fact is that for a lot of Canadians it is 
destructive.  It is destructive of their economic and personal 
lives.  I cannot help but think that in the end it is destructive 
of our collective well-being to have governments dependent in the 
way they have become on revenue from gambling, dependent so much 
so that they are always looking for opportunities to expand this 
revenue base.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Where can they build another casino?  Can they add a hotel that 
would attract more business from outside the city, outside the 
province or outside the country?  What can they do to induce more 
Canadians and more non-Canadians to come to Canada to gamble? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know about other members, but when I grew up gambling 
was something that happened in Las Vegas.  Gambling was something 
that happened in back rooms, with guys playing poker.  It was 
frowned upon.  It seemed to be something on the seedy side of 
life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces have taken this particular phenomena which was 
regarded in that way in the past and have elevated it to a major 
component of our fiscal and social life.  I think that is a 
mistake.  I think a lot of Canadians think it is a mistake.  I 
think it is a mistake whether it is done by an NDP government, a 
Liberal government, a Conservative government, a Péquistes 
government or, God forbid, a Reform government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just wanted to put that concern on the record.  It is 
certainly something that comes not just out of my own political 
tradition.  In spite of the actions of particular NDP 
governments, there was certainly a long tradition of opposition 
to gambling in the CCF and in the NDP.  I think it comes out of 
the social gospel.  It comes out of the Protestant churches.  My 
own church, the United Church of Canada, is still resolutely 
opposed to any form of gambling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we are at the point where we need to do some rethinking 
of this collective addiction to gambling, rather than expanding 
upon it, which is basically what Bill C-51 does.  Up until this 
point we have not allowed people to participate in throwing the 
dice.  We saw a bit of throwing the dice when it came to 
constitutional matters back in 1992 or whenever it was when the 
former prime minister said he was throwing the dice, but I 
digress because I am quite serious about this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think to expand the parameters of gambling in Canada at this 
time is a serious mistake.  We know that gambling 
disproportionately disadvantages the poor.  We know that in many 
ways it is a tax on the poor.  I feel that instead of looking to 
gambling for more revenues, instead of looking to a way of 
raising money that disproportionately disadvantages low income 
people, we should be looking to a real reform of our tax system 
which gives meaningful income tax breaks to Canadians of low 
income and looking at ways in which we could make those who have, 
and have much, contribute more to the general well-being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the moment we have a tax system which basically subsidizes 
those who have.  If people have enough money to put $10,000 or 
$15,000 into RRSPs, if they can max out on their RRSP limit, the 
Government of Canada is subsidizing their pensions at the same 
time as it is saying to a lot of low income Canadians that they 
are going to have to get by on less and less.  There will be no 
significant increases in CPP or OAS.  But when it comes to 
subsidizing the retirement incomes of those who are affluent 
enough to max out on their RRSPs there seems to be no limit.  I 
suppose this is some perverse fulfilment of the biblical saying 
that for those who have, much more will be added, and to those 
who have little, they will have even less.  I am paraphrasing, 
but members know the teaching I am talking about.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think we ought to see that fulfilled in the way that we 
have through the tax system we have now. So I make that point, 
but fundamentally I wanted to make the point that I think 
somewhere in the eighties we took a wrong turn. Government by 
government and province by province we conceded in the eighties, 
and the nineties, but it started in the eighties. Actually it 
started before that, in the late seventies with lotteries, but it 
progressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can argue about when it started, but the fact of the matter 
is that somewhere along the line I think we made a serious wrong 
turn.  I would hope that some day we might see the wisdom of 
seeking genuine alternatives to gambling in terms of raising 
revenue and return to a time when there was either none or a 
whole lot less government sanctioned gambling going on than there 
is now.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise in support of this bill. I too would like to 
talk about some of the issues mentioned by the member who just 
finished speaking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it interesting how much time we spend in this place 
debating justice issues and crime issues. It is particularly true 
since the emergence of the Reform Party and its attempts to 
overdramatize and frankly to frighten the Canadian public and 
people visiting this country, when Canada is by and large a safe 
place to live, a safe place to work and raise a family and a safe 
place to visit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to reassure people that our justice system, with 
some of its faults, is a fine system.  It does provide proper 
justice to criminals.  It does provide safety and security for 
families.  When there are tragedies and victims are involved, 
there is a mechanism in place that will respond to those 
tragedies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also say to visitors, to people like Stafford and Lesley Woods 
who just arrived today from Europe that their stay in Canada, 
even though it will be with me, will be reasonably safe. They 
need not worry that they have landed in a country that the Reform 
Party would have them think is fraught with criminals, with 
organized crime, with gangs running around, with rape and 
pillaging taking place. That is simply not the reality 
experienced in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was also particularly interested in the comments by the member 
from the Reform Party who said that we should somehow take the 
politics out of these debates, to paraphrase those remarks.  Yet 
in the year and a bit I have been in this place I have seen no 
one here who plays politics more with justice issues, more with 
crime and more in a tragic sense with victims of crime than 
members of the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to hear them say how they would support some 
form of safe gun legislation or gun registry, yet they have been 
opposed to what some 80% of Canadians have supported, which is a 
gun control law that does make our streets safer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week or the week before we dealt with the DNA bill which 
will provide a system of enhanced enforcement and control for 
police right across the country.  It is a bill that police chiefs 
and police associations have supported in large number. The 
police believe and know—and my colleague from Waterloo who I 
believe served on the police commission would tell us—that a 
system of registering DNA in a proper data bank will assist them 
in doing their job. 
Yet that was opposed and members of the Reform Party played 
politics on that legislation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members stand up and say that we should not be on a witch hunt, 
yet I see nothing but witch hunts in this place.  It has got to 
the point that you have to check underneath the cubicle door in 
the washroom to make sure no one is sitting there with his feet 
up and a notepad trying to catch something someone might say that 
could be raised as a point of privilege in an attempt to 
embarrass someone who might have been having a private 
conversation. It appears there is no safe place where we do not 
find members of the opposition lurking about attempting to catch 
and trick members of the government, to fabricate and come 
forward with a horrendous scandal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is scandal envy. Members opposite see what President Clinton 
is going through. They see the feeding frenzy of the media in the 
United States and the games played by members of the Republican 
Party in coming forward in the impeachment process.  They ask 
“Why can we not have that much fun?  Why not make up a scandal 
and get somebody?  We can write down some notes, put a glass up 
to the office wall to see what we might hear.  Imagine the fun we 
could have”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this is done instead of getting on with the business of 
running the country.  This is done instead of dealing with issues 
of serious economic impact, such as the Asian crisis and the 
problems our finance minister was dealing with in Washington.  We 
do not have questions about those issues. There has not been one 
question from the opposition dealing with the seriousness of the 
IMF situation, the stock markets around the world, and the Japan 
crisis.  What do we have?  Members say that we should not be 
playing politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is more than just a joke, it is quite sad.  Because in 
essence when we get a bill like this bill, which I agree is an 
omnibus bill that requires looking at a number of different 
amendments to legislation, members opposite want to play politics 
instead of dealing with the substantive issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about the gambling issue.  The member from the 
New Democratic Party had the unmitigated gall to cast aspersions 
around the country when the slippery slope of casino gambling was 
started by Premier Bob Rae in the province of Ontario and was 
exacerbated by this New Democratic Party premier.  He put the 
entire economic future of the province of Ontario into the hands 
of gambling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The casino in Windsor generates hundreds of millions of dollars 
of revenue.  Casino Rama is doing the same thing.  There is also 
the casino of casinos in Niagara Falls.  Can we close them?  Can 
we say to those communities “Sorry ladies and gentlemen, we have 
to take all the jobs away”.  The slippery slope was started by 
the New Democrats and they should at least have the courage and 
the moral fortitude to admit it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in Windsor look across the Detroit River and see a city 
of several million people about to embark on the construction and 
opening of three, count them, three mega casino projects.  What 
will those casinos do to the casino in Windsor?  It has a serious 
problem in competing with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rolling of the dice referred to in the bill that often 
colloquially is called craps is not allowed in our country 
currently. 
This bill will at least give Casino Windsor and the one in 
Niagara which are across the border from major U.S. metropolises 
that will be in the casino business, the opportunity to survive.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is our option?  It is tragic, because what has really 
happened here is that provincial governments, and Ontario being 
the mother of all provincial governments in size and in economic 
impact in this country, now rely on the revenues from gambling. 
In fact, with the cutbacks and the changes, Mike Harris has now 
closed all the charity casinos in the province of Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine that.  The little charity casinos.  Hockey 
organizations, scouting movements, volunteer groups from all 
across the country and certainly in my community in Mississauga 
relied on those charity casinos.  What damage were they doing? 
The provincial government came along and said “They are 
unregulated.  They are out of control.  The charities are not 
making enough money so we are going to embark on a process to 
build 44 new casinos in the province of Ontario”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provincial government called for proposals.  Proponents 
submitted proposals and spent millions of dollars. Then without 
any thought to the impact of having closed all the charity 
casinos, it said to the volunteers and the charities “You can no 
longer earn money from this endeavour”.  The United Way, all 
kinds of groups who rely on them are now before municipal 
councils saying “What do we do now?  Give us a bingo licence. 
Give us some lifeblood. Give us some opportunity to survive”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mike Harris and the Conservative government following in the 
footsteps of the creators of the great casino migration in the 
province of Ontario, the New Democrats, have banned the charity 
casinos and cancelled the RFP for the 44 casinos that were going 
to open.  The charities would have been able at least to apply to 
the Trillium Foundation for some of their revenue but the 
province told those charities to find some other way to survive. 
What are their options? Quite clearly they have to look inward. 
They have to look to their membership.  Only so many bake sales 
and garage sales can be held in an attempt to raise that lost 
revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is enough shame to go around at least in the province of 
Ontario on the issue of casinos.  But we now have no choice. 
Whether a member is in opposition, whether it was that member's 
party that brought this in or whether it was the government, we 
have to ensure that these establishments survive.  They have 
become huge generators of economic wealth on which the provinces 
now rely for health care, for social care and even for education 
because of the amount of money that is going into them. 
Therefore, welcome to crap city.  That is what we are dealing 
with in this country because the casino phenomenon will indeed 
expand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another part of the bill which I think the opposition has failed 
to recognize as being critical is what it will do in the area of 
domestic violence.  One of the changes in this omnibus bill deals 
with something we identified through working with the province 
which is that those who are arrested as a result of domestic 
violence often try to contact the victims.  We all know this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having been in politics for almost 20 years, I and I know many 
other people in this place deal with battered women, with 
families who have suffered through domestic violence and know 
from experience that the perpetrators, the people who have been 
charged, try to contact the victims in domestic violence cases. 
Why do they do that?  It is because they want to change the 
victim's mind.  Or maybe they get their lawyer to offer some kind 
of deal or do some kind of plea so that the woman will back off. 
Most of the time it is the woman who is suffering from this 
violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill says that cannot be done any more.  This bill says 
that they cannot contact the individual they are charged with 
battering. 
A lawyer cannot be sent as some kind of missionary to convince 
the battered or abused individual, often a wife, a girlfriend or 
a common law wife.  They can no longer interfere.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is that important?  I spent nine and a half years as a 
member of regional council and city council in the region of Peel 
and Mississauga.  We administered social services during that 
time and still do.  My wife is currently a member of that 
council.  We dealt at the ground level with the results.  We saw 
the women, in most cases women, with black eyes and broken bones 
as a result of domestic violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the tragedy of domestic violence all too often we 
see that women will back off, either through coercion, fear for 
their children or their own personal safety.  They refuse to 
proceed.  It is a scourge on society that we should not tolerate 
as parliamentarians, as city, local and regional councillors, as 
MPPs or MLAs.  We must attack domestic violence and eliminate it 
from society as much as we possibly can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Bill C-51 is worth supporting for one reason and for one 
reason only, it is this aspect of the bill.  To vote against the 
bill will mean this change will not occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask members opposite to stop playing the games I hear going on 
in this place and to look at the benefits of the bill and how it 
will assist the broad base of society.  It will improve the 
justice system in relationship to domestic violence.  It will say 
to the perpetrators, as I said before, that they cannot contact 
the victims or through some surreptitious manner have their 
lawyers do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hopefully this will help social workers and people who deal with 
the victims of domestic violence to shore them up and give them 
the courage they need to go forward so that a conviction can take 
place and we do something about ending domestic violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the only reason to support the bill.  I suggest 
there are many others.  There is the issue surrounding child 
prostitution.  As well, the bill will benefit police enforcement. 
Why?  Because it will permit police to use electronic 
surveillance to determine if a person has sought some kind of 
sexual favour from a minor.  They can use that evidence to obtain 
a conviction. It is critically important and does not exist now. 
The bill will allow that to take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite might ask for a clause that toughens the 
punishment.  The government has done that in other areas.  This 
bill like all bills cannot be a panacea for all concerns in the 
justice system.  We should not expect Bill C-51 to solve every 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one in the House on either side, in any party, condones any 
kind of sexual offence against children.  To suggest otherwise is 
playing politics.  That brings me back to a private member's bill 
that we dealt with in this place earlier in the week, Bill C-284. 
There was an attempt to play politics with the issues surrounding 
amendments to the Criminal Records Act, the CRA, that deal with 
publishing the records of those who have been convicted of some 
form of sexual offence against a minor and are pardoned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general already has the discretion to disclose 
pardon records to bona fide organizations.  Who are those 
organizations? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1705"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are numerous examples of convicted people who have been 
paroled, finished their sentence or pardoned.  I do not know of 
any who have been pardoned after being convicted of sexually 
abusing a minor, but certainly they complete their sentences and 
wind up at some point back in the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are numerous examples of names being published, of 
photographs being published and of the communities in which they 
are to live being warned that these individuals are back. However 
it has been done appropriately.  It has been done through the 
police force to ensure there is no abuse of anyone's rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is one of the greatest things about this safe country of 
Canada, the country I welcomed Stafford and Lesley Woods to, the 
country I welcomed people from all over the world to.  We are a 
safe country.  We have a parliamentary democracy that allows us 
to put in place laws that will protect women and children, in 
fact our entire society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill should be supported unanimously for many reasons, a 
couple of which I have outlined today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am very pleased to rise on behalf of the official opposition and 
on behalf of the people of Surrey Central to address the contents 
of Bill C-51.  The legislation proposes changes to the criminal 
law in the areas of gambling, homicide, child prostitution, 
conditional sentencing, organized crime, mineral claims, 
provisions regarding the use of computers in copying currency, 
and other matters too numerous to mention here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened very carefully to Liberal members.  I will dissect 
the bill to show them its anatomy. The Liberals are doing six 
things with the bill.  Let us remember that number.  I will go 
over those six things very soon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like so much legislation we have dealt with in this session 
since our return to the House in September, the government has 
chosen to do as little as possible in the bill. In Bill C-3 the 
Liberals tied the hands of law enforcement agencies by denying 
them full use of DNA identification technology.  The Liberals 
ignored victims of crime and the safety and security of Canadians 
to ensure the rights of the accused would be protected.  The 
Liberals care more about criminals than about victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week we saw Bill C-53 on fast track in the House.  The bill 
was rammed through the House at first and second reading in four 
working days.  The Liberals fail to address problems with the 
government's small business financing program.  It is another 
failure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the process of doing very little in terms of what they should 
do and could not do to improve the small business loans program, 
the Liberals ignored the recommendations of the auditor general 
and 90,000 members of the Canadian Federation of Independent 
Business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-35 is another example.  Last week the government did not 
go far enough in amending the legislation governing anti-dumping 
and anti-subsidy tools applied to imported goods.  The Liberals 
again ignored the interest of businesses and Canadian consumers 
that are downstream from an import duty or countervailing duty 
being imposed on an imported product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberals could have granted the request made by our frontline 
police officers regarding the use of DNA identification to fight 
crime.  Liberals could have helped small businesses prosper and 
create more jobs in the country.  They could have simply provided 
for downstream businesses and consumers to be considered earlier 
in the process that would affect them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bill C-51 the Liberals treat each of the six Criminal Code 
amendments in a very shallow manner.  What they are proposing in 
the bill is very weak and indeed very meek. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1710"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT39"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT39"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1710
<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The title of the bill mentions that it will amend the Criminal 
Code and the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.  Looking at the 
title, one would think this means the Liberals were to do 
something about drug related crime, drug gangs or other things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first issue the Liberals say they are addressing in Bill 
C-51 is illegal gambling.  Can we imagine the dismay of my 
constituents and I when we realized that in terms of gambling 
solutions the government is doing only one thing.  It is allowing 
international cruise ships to operate casinos while sailing in 
Canadian waters.  That is all it is proposing in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no cleaning up of numbers games, bookies, illegal 
gambling rackets or underground black market racketeers.  There 
is nothing of that sort.  Canadians do not even take cruise ships 
because they cannot afford it.  Canadians are so heavily taxed 
and our dollar is so low that they stay at home on their 
holidays.  They cannot leave this country with a 65 cent dollar. 
They can only travel as far as their 10 year old cars can take 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government is not fooling anyone.  In my 
constituency of Surrey the provincial government has approved 
slot machines and gambling and the local municipal government has 
not.  There is a contradiction between both governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bill C-51 the federal government has moved toward legalizing 
some form of gambling.  Something is wrong when various levels of 
government contradict themselves.  Would it not be nice and 
progressive if all levels of government complement each other 
rather than contradict each other?  Do the Liberals forget what 
synergy means?  Do they want to make two plus two equal three or 
five? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second effort in Bill C-51 is the homicide amendment.  It 
does away with a 19th century law which says that in order for a 
murder to be considered a homicide the death of the victim must 
take place within a year plus a day of the incident which 
allegedly caused the death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a death recently in my constituency of Surrey Central. 
Sandor Nyerges was a deaf and mute 80 year old veteran of two 
world wars.  He was attacked in a botched robbery attempt in his 
home.  This brave, strong and determined Canadian was a survivor. 
He lived in the hospital for several days before he succumbed to 
his injuries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a good thing that the Liberals are finally doing away with 
this 19th century law.  Not all victims die immediately and we 
should make room for that in our criminal law.  Why did Canadians 
have to wait for a full century for this law to be changed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third thing the government is doing with the bill is 
allowing the use of wiretapping to solve the crime of living off 
the avails of child prostitution, keeping a common bawdy house 
and using underaged prostitutes.  Also the bill makes it a crime 
to communicate with anyone for the purposes of obtaining or 
attempting to obtain the services I mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>North America has a serious drug abuse problem.  In the lower 
mainland of British Columbia this problem is well known. 
Injection drug use is on the rise and prevalent.  It is the most 
dangerous and serious of the drug use categories.  It causes 
people to become sick, reckless and desperate.  It is good that 
Bill C-51 is helping the law enforcement community to deal with 
this problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals could have gone further. They could have taken the 
opportunity to increase the penalties for those convicted of 
these offences.  However the Liberals are not getting tough on 
crime. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1715"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT40"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT40"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1715

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth thing the government is doing is changing the 
conditional sentence portion of the law.  This amendment will 
ensure that while a conditional sentence is being served, the 
clock is stopped immediately once a breach of the conditional 
sentence takes place. The clock starts ticking again once the 
breach of the conditions is dealt with and a new sentence 
commences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It used to be that a court hearing regarding the alleged breach 
of the conditional sentence had to take place within 30 days of 
the alleged breach.  Not anymore. Bill C-51 will make the 
requirement for a court hearing of a breach to be held as soon as 
practical.  This will make our law less harsh in terms of dealing 
with breaches of conditional sentences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals did not take the opportunity to prevent the 
application of conditional sentencing to violent offences.  The 
government missed another opportunity today to get tough on 
crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fifth area the bill deals with is organized crime.  No more 
can a mobster be considered for parole after serving one 
sixteenth of the sentence.  There is a big change. Canadians do 
not want anyone being released on parole after serving one 
sixteenth or even one third of the sentence they have been given 
by the court.  We do not give sentences by square root. It does 
not mean five years.  Twenty-five years means twenty-five years, 
but here we are talking one sixteenth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gangland figures are already given the full benefit of our 
generous system of day parole, full parole and statutory release. 
The Liberals are leaving Canadians with a penal system designed 
to process criminals as fast as possible. The Liberals return the 
criminals to the streets as soon as possible so that they are not 
taking up space or time in our penal institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians know the Liberals are allowing minimal if any concern 
to be given to the possibility that the offender will commit more 
crimes or more offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are more concerned about the rights of criminals 
and they are less concerned about the rights of victims and the 
safety of Canadian society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government should not be concerned about the 
rehabilitation of the criminal.  It should be concerned about the 
criminal committing further crimes. Instead, the government is 
concentrating on aspects of how early a person convicted of a 
crime can be released. Again the Liberals are not getting tough 
on crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the sixth category of changes this bill proposes, we have the 
catch-all category and the Liberals are going to do a number of 
housekeeping things. For example, Bill C-51 proposes to put a 
stop to using computers to copy currency.  That looks good but in 
this category there are other measures but my time will not 
permit me to go into them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In five of the six categories I have mentioned, the governing 
party in the House has disappointed us and let us down again. The 
Liberals are not taking concrete measures to protect Canadians, 
make our homes and streets safe and reduce crime through 
deterrence measures.  Gambling, drugs, prostitution, organized 
crime, gangs and even homicide are a sad and threatening part of 
our culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week the British Columbian attorney general stated that our 
law enforcement agencies are losing the war against organized 
crime, gangs, drugs, prostitution, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of us wish we did not have to deal with these things.  Yet 
again, we want to deal effectively with the perpetrators of these 
crimes and reduce their harmful effects on innocent victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking in terms of government and society, we can see that all 
over the world different governments approve of different things 
for their societies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some governments permit liberal use of dangerous drugs like 
heroin. In some societies prostitution is legal. Sometimes the 
results are very bad and harmful in those societies and sometimes 
not, as hard as that is to believe.  For example, in some 
societies gambling is allowed.

often where one activity is treated as a crime it is often linked 
to other vices.  In the same geographical area where gambling is 
legal they may have problems with organized crime and 
prostitution.  Through education and prevention we can improve 
the way our society handles these vices. Our government should be 
proactive and not just reactive.

motion supporting a national head start program for our youth. 
The goal was to care for each child and ensure that the needs of 
each child are met.  This would help our children to lead crime 
free, healthy and prosperous lives.

The Liberals have not done so with Bill C-51 which we are 
debating in the House.

strengthen Bill C-51 along the lines that I have been talking 
about at the committee stage and the bill's progress through this

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia—Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, most 
definitely, when we open up our morning papers and read about 
crime, of course we feel we are under attack.  When we see 
abused children and women, we say it makes no sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We live in a society where there should be no crime but we know 
very well that crime does exist—and we see far too many reports 
on it.  I will ask my hon. colleague this later, but will there 
be less crime tomorrow, or next year, just because we strengthen 
an act?  I am not sure of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do need laws, of course.  In my riding, a priest, Father 
Leblanc, gave a ride to someone and lost his life.  I will say 
no more about this, because the case will be coming before the 
courts, but a good Samaritan stops and picks someone up, 
disappears, and is later found dead after a search. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question does not address crime per se.  Everyone is against 
crime, and agrees it must be stopped. But how?  How can we 
eradicate it in a highly civilized society?  I would love to see 
crime totally eradicated, or at least gradually reduced. I 
believe this can be done through prevention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A child aged two, four or five years who is not loved already 
has great anger bottled up inside.  It grows, and becomes part 
of his very being.  At aged 12 or 14, he is teased by his 
classmates and he then gives vent to that hidden anger. If his 
teachers, his parents or his guardians do not equip him with any 
ways of overcoming it, that anger will be expressed even more 
strongly.

that so much money is put into law enforcement and not into 
prevention?  I am asking my colleague what means of prevention 
could be created to put an end to this? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I give credit to the 
hon. member for the important question he has put forward. But it 
does not mean I necessarily agree with him in what he is saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prevention is always good and prevention is better than a cure. 
We in this country are in a damage control mode as far as crime 
is concerned.  We are not in a preventive mode. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The worst part is that I am surprised at how government members 
represent their constituents when they are not listening to them. 
All Canadians are demanding that our laws be tougher so that we 
can prevent crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bills we see in this House do not have any teeth.  The Canadian 
Police Association has demanded from this government DNA 
legislation so that it can solve more crimes and prevent more 
crimes from happening. But this government has not done that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our system is such that it is a motivation for the criminals to 
commit crime.  It is not a deterrent to prevent crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a newspaper article I read that there is rationing of 
gasoline in RCMP cars in my constituency. How can we control 
crime, how can we spend money and not get anywhere?  This 
government is at fault. 
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to ask the hon. gentleman from the Reform Party how 
he can justify voting against this bill when in doing so, he is 
saying he is opposed to abolishing provisions that prevent 
prosecuting individuals for homicide or criminal negligence when 
more than a year and a day has passed.  He is opposed to making 
it easier to prosecute people who obtain services from underage 
prostitutes.  He is opposed to helping judges and police deal 
more effectively with offenders who breach a condition of a 
conditional sentence order.  He is opposed to making people 
convicted of organized crime offences ineligible for accelerated 
parole review.  By voting against this bill he is saying he is 
opposed to giving new powers to justices to order an accused who 
is detained pending a bail hearing not to communicate with any 
witness or other person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer him to issues around domestic violence.  He is opposed 
by voting against Bill C-51 to changes that will indeed help to 
eradicate domestic violence and resolve these other issues of 
grave concern to the safety of all people in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member explain why he is opposed to those 
amendments, to those changes to the Criminal Code and why he is 
voting against those aspects? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am so aggravated 
listening to the explanation by the member that it is hard to 
answer in the short time I have.  Let me ask the hon. member why 
his party is not listening to Canadians.  Why is it not listening 
to the Canadian Police Association?  Why is it not listening to 
victims?  Why is it determined only to listen to the criminals? 
Why can Liberal members not see with their own eyes prostitution, 
gambling, homicides?  Criminals are committing crimes and getting 
away with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we are not supporting this bill. This government 
does not listen to the people.  It is not producing legislation 
that will work, that will give the RCMP and our police agencies 
enough tools to fight crime on the street. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we go door knocking in campaigns we see the alarm signs on 
doors and windows. Not only are people not safe on their streets, 
they are not even safe in their own homes.  That is why they use 
alarms. I ask this member to appeal to his government to put this 
in the bill.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>SCHOLARSHIPS NAMED AFTER OLYMPIC ATHLETES 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK210">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP)</B> moved 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
consider establishing full tuition scholarships named after each 
and every Canadian Gold Medal Olympic athlete starting with the 
1998 Winter Olympics to encourage talented young Canadian 
athletes to complete their education at Canadian universities 
while continuing to excel in their particular Olympic sport and 
with the consideration of naming the first of such scholarships 
after the Sandra Schmirler Rink of Regina. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to rise in the House 
today to speak to this very important motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion was inspired by the incredible victory of the Sandra 
Schmirler rink earlier this year.  In fact it was on Sunday, 
February 5, 1998 at the Nagano Olympics, a victory that was 
watched by virtually every resident of Saskatchewan and made 
every Canadian proud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This team of Canadian women from Regina's Caledonia Curling Club 
had racked up six provincial championships and three world titles 
by the time they claimed their first ever Olympic gold medal for 
women's curling since it became a full medal sport at this year's 
winter Olympics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These women have become heroes to a new generation of young 
Canadians dreaming of representing Canada in the Olympic games, 
in particular those in winter sports.  The skip of this rink, 
Sandra Schmirler, the third, Jan Betker, the second, Joan 
McCusker, the lead, Marsha Gudereit, and the alternate, Atina 
Ford, are all Saskatchewan born individuals.  They are all 
Canadians and they excel in their sport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we should be establishing this particular scholarship 
for many good reasons and I will get into them right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it is time to consider what steps go into making 
Olympic calibre athletes in Canada and how we can promote 
excellence in athletics and academics in our country.  Canadian 
universities have long had a policy that they will not provide 
athletic scholarships in excess of $1,500 annually and not at all 
to students entering first year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the main thrust of that policy because it is intended 
to steer our university system away from some of the excesses of 
the American system in which more money and attention is 
sometimes devoted to athletic teams, especially in bigger and 
richer schools, than the academic performance of the students 
they subsidize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The big schools raise fairly large dollars from their alumni and 
draw the best athletes.  They have not always been the best 
students, but it leaves the smaller schools scrambling for 
funding for their academic programs, which is, after all, 
supposed to be their core business activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what Canadian universities have wanted to avoid. 
However, the generous U.S. scholarships are drawing some 1,800 
Canadian students annually to study south of the border.  For 
many young athletes it represents the chance of a lifetime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the NDP leader of Ontario, Howie Hampton, left Fort 
Frances, Ontario as a young boy on a hockey scholarship to go to 
an American university.  He returned years later after completing 
a law degree in Canada to practise law in his hometown, after, of 
course, making a stop in Saskatchewan to share in some of the 
experience of the New Democratic government of the late 1970s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Mr. Hampton went back to Fort Frances he coached some local 
hockey teams.  From there he was elected to Queen's Park to serve 
as attorney general and minister of natural resources, and is now 
leader of the Ontario New Democratic Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the point is that those scholarships are the chance of a 
lifetime.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has a $350 million education deficit with the United 
States in terms of foreign students and now some of the 
universities in our western Canadian provinces are trying to make 
changes to Canadian policy to stem some of the flow of our best 
athletes to American schools, because when the students go the 
alumni and parent donations follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that the federal government recently made those 
contributions tax exempt under Bill S-9 in the last parliament, 
while slashing federal funding for post-secondary education 
student aid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to share with Canadians this incredible betrayal to 
Canadian education.  The Liberal government in the last 
parliament passed Bill S-9.  It was supported by the Reform 
Party, by the Bloc and by the Conservative Party.  The NDP was 
the only party to suggest that this bill was only a bill for the 
rich and the wealthy and that it was totally unfair to our 
education system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Liberal government cut education funding in Canada by 
$2 billion a year, it is allowing Canadians to make contributions 
to U.S. universities and post-secondary institutions and take a 
tax deduction in Canada.  Now the tax system in this country is 
supporting the U.S. education system while we cut back our own 
students.  This is the Liberal, the Reform, the Tory and the Bloc 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-9 is an insidious bill.  I think the Liberals in this 
House should be absolutely ashamed of themselves.  The opposition 
parties should be ashamed of themselves for abandoning young 
people in this country for the sake of American institutions.  I 
cannot believe it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I tell people about Bill S-9 they are shocked.  We now have 
tax deductions in Canada for making contributions to U.S. 
universities and post-secondary institutions.  Some people say 
there is reciprocity.  However, the facts show that over 25,000 
Canadian students go to the U.S.  Following them are donations to 
U.S. campuses from their parents, family members and wealthy 
corporations.  But just under 5,000 U.S. students come to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a five to one ratio.  We are supporting the education 
system in the U.S. with Canadian tax dollars while we abandon our 
students, while we abandon our young people in terms of 
supporting their educational desires and needs.  It is 
incredible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My proposal is designed to create full tuition scholarships, 
paid for by the federal government out of public funds.  If we 
can afford to subsidize U.S. universities we can afford to 
subsidize Canadian athletes and Canadian institutions.  My sense 
is that this will assist young Canadian athletes and provide them 
with the proper academic qualifications they will require in the 
global economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would help Canadian universities as well.  It would keep 
some of our best athletes at home, without unduly taxing their 
own alumni fundraising efforts and without creating further 
disparities between Canadian universities such as we have 
witnessed in the U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By naming the scholarships after Canada's Olympic gold 
medalists, starting as I have suggested with the Sandra Schmirler 
rink of Regina, we would serve the dual purpose of recognizing 
their accomplishments and taking advantage of their status as 
role models to inspire the next generation of Olympic calibre 
athletes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government could finance this proposal easily, by the way, 
out of the savings it could reap in tax expenditures if it 
reversed the odious provisions of Bill S-9 to which I referred a 
few moments ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to take some time to express the concerns we hear 
every year at about this time in my Regina constituency office 
from students and their parents about the state of student aid in 
this country and about the outrageous levels of debt students are 
required to take on if they do what governments, industry and 
indeed the future of our economy demands they do, which is to 
acquire at least an undergraduate degree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Post-secondary training has never been more essential to the 
future of our country and it has never been more expensive.  The 
benefits accrue to industry, government and society as a whole, 
as well as students, but the associated costs and risks are being 
more and more assumed by only the students.  In fact many recent 
changes to student assistance on the federal side, including some 
incredibly discriminatory provisions last year prohibiting 
bankruptcies for 10 years to anyone carrying a student loan, are 
being driven by the big banks, which hypocritically lobby against 
student grants and lower tuition and then make money from the 
interest charges on student loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no wonder the banks are among the targets of next week's 
week of action planned by the Canadian Federation of Students.  I 
salute and support those efforts by the Canadian Federation of 
Students.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The big corporations are tying the hands of our young people 
because those corporations will not pay or assist in funding 
their education, which would benefit our own country, but we 
allow the Reichmanns and the Bronfmans to write off hundreds of 
millions of dollars, almost on an annual basis, against our tax 
system, and they can write it off in the regular term of one 
year.  Our students are now handcuffed.  They have to take 10 
years to pay back the loans because we have burdened them with an 
average debt of $25,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To come back to where I started with this proposal, this morning 
I reread some of the news stories about Schmirler's win last 
February and was reminded of something she said at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She was asked about being called the best-ever female curling 
team and her answer typified the Canadian ideal of sports 
personship that endeared her so much to the people in my province 
of Saskatchewan.  She said “It does not matter if I believe it 
or not.  We go out there, we play for fun and we play the best 
that we can, and we happen to play at this level.  Yes, we have 
won quite a bit, but I even know that back in Regina there are 
plenty of good teams”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“But are they the best?” she was asked. “It is a good 
combination for us and it has been right ever since the day we 
put this team together.  The personalities click and we are not 
bad curlers to boot”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Wherever they went the women talked of their families, of their 
communities and of their country.  Their win was an 
accomplishment for them.  However, it was not in boasting as an 
individual achievement, but more as an expression of the 
importance of teamwork within a supportive family and community 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sandra Schmirler and her team represented the best values of 
Saskatchewan and they still represent the best values of 
Saskatchewan.  We in Saskatchewan are very proud of our athletes 
for their values of family, of community, of hard work and of 
modesty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need more heroes like that.  This is why I am proposing a 
federally funded, full tuition scholarship program to keep young 
athletes in Canadian universities to benefit Canada.  I can think 
of no more fitting example than Sandra Schmirler and her rink to 
name the first fund after. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I happen to have a list of other gold medalists who I would like 
to see these scholarships named after.  They are:  Ross 
Rebagliati, a gold medalist in snowboarding; Catriona LeMay Doan 
from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, a gold medalist in the 500 metre 
long track speed skating event; Annie Perreault, a gold medalist 
in the 500 metre short track; Marc Gagnon, Derrick Campbell, Eric 
Bédard and François Drolet, gold medalists in the 5,000 metre 
men's relay short track; the women's curling team, as I 
mentioned, which won the gold medal; and Pierre Leuders and Dave 
MacEachern, gold medalists in the two-person bobsled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also won silver and bronze medals.  At some point I would 
like to see this kind of a scholarship program extended not just 
to the gold medal winners but to those who receive silver and 
bronze medals in the Olympic Games. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, I believe this is a very significant move which the 
government could make to assist some of the challenges that face 
our athletes in Canada and to make them Olympic calibre athletes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit that we could pay for this probably 10,000 times over on 
an annual basis if we repealed Bill S-9, which literally drains 
money from our Canadian education system and gives it to the 
Americans.  This is again a bill that was supported by the 
Liberals, the Reform Party, the Bloc and the Conservatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the more young people learn about this insidious 
legislation, which is costing them their birthright in terms of 
sufficiently funded post-secondary education, they are really 
going to make a serious decision come the next election and 
decide that maybe what they need is a government that will look 
at education from a very serious minded perspective and from a 
perspective that will be supportive for our young people because 
they are the future of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to hearing the comments of my colleagues when 
they stand to speak to this motion.  I will be happy to provide a 
five minute wrap up at the end.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I wish I could, in one sense, stand here and say to the member 
opposite that I am willing in whole or at least in part to 
support this motion because I think the intent is probably good.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate, however, when we politicize the Olympic games 
and our Olympic champions.  Who will forget the pride that all 
Canadians felt, perhaps with the exception of one or two members 
of the Bloc who caused some difficulties with regard to the 
Olympics?  I will not go into the great flag flap during this 
debate.  Who can forget?  Most of us stayed up until all hours of 
the night and morning to watch the events. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all felt a great disappointment when Canada did not come home 
with hockey medals.  However, when we look at the inclusion of 
the elite players of the National Hockey League, as exciting as 
the hockey could have been, might have been and should have been, 
the reality is that I never considered those individuals to be 
true Olympians in the same sense as the people the hon. member 
has mentioned such as Ross Rebagliati, Annie Perreault, Marc 
Gagnon and his team.  There was excitement in their success and 
that of our bobsled team. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Probably we received more television coverage this time around 
due to the time change for curling.  Some people made disparaging 
remarks about curling being an Olympic sport.  It can be a 
demanding game requiring a tremendous amount of sacrifice and 
effort on behalf of the athletes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member suggests that the first scholarship fund should be 
named after Sandra Schmirler Rink of Regina.  There is no 
question that we congratulate her and all the citizens of 
Saskatchewan.  I may be wrong—and the member can correct me if 
he so wishes—but I believe Saskatchewan might have led the 
nation in medals at the Olympics.  One of our smaller provinces 
turns out tremendously talented athletes who did— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon:</B>  And members of Parliament too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  I do not know about that.  Probably in 
the past that might have been true, thinking back to some of the 
member's predecessors like Tommy Douglas and some of the folk I 
knew quite well on a personal basis through my family 
connections.  I will not go into disparaging remarks about the 
member opposite in relation to his level of talent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I believe his heart is in the right place in trying to 
come up with a plan that would establish a scholarship fund named 
after Canadians of which we are all proud, I believe in typical 
fashion his head is in the wrong place. The reason is that New 
Democrats very seldom take into account the economic impact of 
motions they put forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I give him credit that he suggested wrongly and in a partisan 
and political manner the way in which this might be funded.  I do 
not believe he has done his homework.  If he wants to bring 
forward a debate on whether or not those credits should be 
allowed for people investing in their children's education 
wherever the education may be, perhaps that is what he should do. 
Perhaps he could hear from the families making the investment to 
support their children in attaining higher education and higher 
levels of athletic excellence in some instances south of the 
border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very often we tend to have eight months of winter and four 
months of bad skating in Canada.  There is a need at times for 
athletes to train in warmer climates.  Therefore they go south to 
train at facilities which are not available here. Unless they are 
built indoors at a tremendous cost in most instances to the local 
taxpayer, those facilities are not available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not as simple as the member opposite in the New Democratic 
Party would have it.  He bashes big corporations and American 
institutions or the government, which NDPers attempt to do on an 
ongoing basis.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada does a number of things to assist 
athletes.  During the last fiscal year under the athlete 
assistance program some 900 high performance athletes received 
financial support totalling more than $7.25 million.  The 
taxpayer is supporting elite athletes in their attempts to 
improve their success rate, to bring home the gold, the silver 
and the bronze. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we all revel in the success of our achievers who bring 
home some form of medal, is it not equally important to recognize 
those who compete, who try, who are a part of our team and 
perhaps do not succeed to the level where they bring home a 
medal? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a real danger of elitism if we are not careful in 
recognizing that our entire Olympic team should be supported. It 
should clearly be supported by all parliamentarians in all 
parties from all parts of the country.  That has not been the 
case in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has supported athletes to the tune of $7.25 
million.  Athletes receive living and training allowances, 
depending on the success and performance level, ranging from $185 
up to as much as $810 per month.  That can be a pretty major 
amount of money to assist an athlete who is training and working 
toward an education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other forms of scholarships exist which I will go into 
momentarily.  The awards under the athlete assistance program are 
practical awards.  They support the worthy.  While the highest 
individual amounts awarded go to top Olympic and world 
championship performers, the largest number of awards go to 
athletes who have the potential to excel in high performance 
sport.  That does not mean they are fortunate enough to be 
carrying a medal around their neck, but they have the potential 
to succeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I noted a story the other night which I believe was on CTV.  I 
forget the name and I apologize to the individual.  A young 
athlete was striving to make the national team as a diver.  This 
is the kind of excellence.  His parents were fundraising $12,000 
to assist him in achieving his goal of making the national team 
and eventually the Olympic team.  It is an extraordinary 
challenge for a family to undertake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are opportunities for fundraising.  In spite of the 
comments of the members from the left spectre of the New 
Democratic Party, corporate Canada supports Olympic athletes.  It 
supports young people trying to achieve greatness and trying to 
do better, whether to excel in the Olympics or to excel in sports 
in their home communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also support them through Canada's millennium scholarship 
fund which was established in the last budget.  It will award 
more than 100,000 scholarships annually to full time and part 
time students based on financial need and merit, not based on 
their ability to leap a bar, swim a course or play a particular 
game. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support assisting our athletes, but to put in place a new 
level of scholarship without any concern about the cost to the 
taxpayers is more typically irresponsible NDP rhetoric.  The 
member opposite has much to be proud of about the athletes in his 
province of Saskatchewan.  All Canadians share that pride. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member should take a look at the numbers and realize the 
government is supporting Olympic athletes and post-secondary 
education efforts on behalf of all students in Canada. As a 
result I am unfortunately unable to support the motion put 
forward by the member.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, this evening we are debating a motion put forward by the 
member for Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre.  It is a private 
member's motion which reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
consider establishing full tuition scholarships named after each 
and every Canadian gold medal Olympic athlete starting with the 
1998 Winter Olympics to encourage talented young Canadian 
athletes to complete their education at Canadian universities 
while continuing to excel in their particular Olympic sport and 
with the consideration of naming the first of such scholarships 
after the Sandra Schmirler Rink of Regina. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the House knows this is not a votable motion.  The House will 
not be making a decision on whether to move ahead on this motion. 
However, it is an idea which merits debate and consideration in 
the House.  I commend the member for bringing it forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The speech from the government member opposite made me think of 
the Rodney Dangerfield line “I don't get no respect”.  I am 
sure the member for Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre feels that way. 
I will probably say a couple of things that may not be construed 
as totally respectful, but we all have the highest respect for 
Sandra Schmirler and her rink. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know about many others in the Chamber, but I remember 
rushing home last winter many times after my office work and my 
work in the House to watch the curling finals on the Olympic 
channel.  It was a real pleasure and a real enjoyment to see 
Sandra Schmirler and the other Canadians on her rink from 
Saskatchewan be the best in the world, especially when it was the 
first time curling was part of the Olympic Games.  It was a real 
highlight for all Canadians and I think for many of us here.  The 
member's desire to recognize this achievement is certainly a very 
natural and very laudable one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member made some rather strong and gratuitous swipes at 
other parties in the House for suggesting that Canadians could 
save their money and decide to go outside the country to spend 
their education dollars.  I think the United States was the one 
the member chose to attack.  He then said later in his remarks 
that government actions would tie the hands of our young people 
with respect to their educational choices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fair to say to the member that there is some inconsistency 
here.  He does not want to tie the hands of young people in some 
ways, but he is quite happy to tie the hands of young people in 
other ways.  Rather than imprisoning our young people in Canada 
by taxation policy or public economic policy, we should simply 
make Canadian educational institutions strong, good and competent 
so that they deliver a fine standard of education.  Far from 
Canadians wanting to go outside the country for education, we 
would have people from many other countries flocking to Canada 
for the high quality of education.  I think that would be a 
better goal to achieve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that regard I agree with the member that the government has 
wounded the post-secondary education system by its slashing and 
burning of support for post-secondary education.  That is what it 
has done.  It has taken away a full $1.5 billion each and every 
year from the post-secondary education system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then it gave back a pittance, $250 million a year or about 
one-sixth of what it took away, beat its chest and asked “Is 
this not wonderful?”.  It forgot to mention that it trampled on 
provincial rights and jurisdiction in so doing because 
post-secondary education is the purview of the provinces.  By 
setting up scholarship arrangements in that jurisdiction it 
simply trampled on federal-provincial relations. 
That has sown some bitter seeds that will bear bitter fruit for 
the federal government and for federal-provincial arrangements in 
a whole lot of areas where goodwill and good relations are vital.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is extremely important that we support quality education in 
our country.  Instead of slashing dollars from that sector 
government should find some dollars to slash from some of its 
other endeavours.  It could cut some of the wasteful spending and 
duplications of spending we have pointed out many times on the 
record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the member will respond to my concern that there is a 
double standard in attacking the wish of members of parliament 
from all parties except the New Democrats to give freedom of 
choice to our students and not to tie their hands in the matter 
of educational choices but to give them good reasons to stay in 
Canada other than you have to because we will not let you spend 
your money anywhere else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be appropriate to address the idea of athletic 
scholarships as worthy of support.  There are scholarships in 
many area of endeavour like science, engineering, music and 
literature.  Most would agree that the answer to whether athletic 
scholarships are legitimate and desirable would be yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to encourage young Canadians to seek excellence in many 
diverse ways by drawing on the best that young minds and young 
bodies can achieve.  Athletic excellence is a very important 
component of human endeavour.  Athletic endeavour should 
therefore be encouraged and recognized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Athletic awards of up to $1,500 are currently available to some 
students excluding freshmen at some Canadian universities.  First 
year students are not eligible.  The idea was to have students 
demonstrate some commitment to an educational program before 
scholarships would be available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a meeting of the Canadian Interuniversity Athletic Union in June 
some universities proposed increasing the amount from $1,500 to 
$3,000 and making first year students eligible.  The motion did 
not pass at this meeting because many universities said that they 
did not have the necessary funds.  We can thank the government 
for a lot of that difficulty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The number of athletes receiving this type of assistance was 
estimated to be less than 200.  There is a lack of dollars.  I do 
not think it is because the super rich are being parsimonious 
with their support for a lot of these endeavours for helping our 
young people as the mover of the motion suggests.  There has not 
been the commitment on the part of this government to make sure 
post-secondary dollars are protected and enhanced where possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The naming of scholarships after Olympic gold medalists is an 
interesting idea.  Recognizing the achievements of our Canadian 
athletes in that way would have a lot of favour with the public. 
Our Olympic program is valued. Three Canadian cities are bidding 
to be the site of the 2010 Olympics, including my home city of 
Calgary. The decision as to what site in Canada will be 
designated as host city will be made next month.  I salute my 
city of Calgary for the vigorous bid it is putting forward to 
host the Olympics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The athletes who are looking forward to participating in the 
upcoming Olympics have the support and encouragement of all of 
us.  Sometimes we think that what we do in the House is a bit of 
a marathon. 
I think our athletes who train and work so hard for these Olympic 
games and the cities and volunteers that host them are to be 
commended.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, at the start of my presentation, I would like 
to thank the member for Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre for making it 
possible, with this motion, to finally hold a debate in this 
House on funding for competitive athletes in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion refers to study bursaries at the university level for 
top athletes. This proposal contains what I call the NDP 
illusion, in other words, the good news always has to come from 
the federal government, regardless of jurisdictions and 
responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Education is a provincial matter.  The differences between 
Quebec and other parts of Canada are very clear.  For example, 
Quebec already has a system of loans and bursaries.  Bursaries, 
which are based on financial need, are already available for 
students at both the college and the university levels.  And 
they are available to everyone in all disciplines, regardless of 
performance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bursaries proposed in the motion are lot like the millennium 
scholarships.  This is not the right sort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Still, the member has clearly put his finger on the problem, a 
situation that requires examination, but his solution, in the 
end, is not a good one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the summer, when I did my prebudget consultations, 
I met young parents, maybe 35 or 40 years old, who have young 
children who are active in high performance sports and could 
well compete nationally or internationally one day.  These 
people are facing real financial problems.  This is where we 
should look so we can assure parents of the help they need so 
they do not have to pay out themselves $2,000 or $3,000 or 
$5,000 a year for training for their child whose talents they 
want to develop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One father, a bus driver, talked to me for an hour in my office 
about all the sacrifices he has to make and juggling he has to 
do to pay for his child's sports and studies.  This includes 
skates and all sorts of equipment.  It adds up to thousands of 
dollars very quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The vision for the future has much more to do with ensuring that 
thousands of young people can reach their full athletic 
potential, take part in competitions, get the necessary support 
while they are growing, and seeing that their parents get that 
assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the pre-budget consultation, I made suggestions in that 
sense, proposing that tax credits or some other form of 
assistance be used to provide some relief to parents, given the 
financial efforts they are making to help their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very aware that parents often face a rather serious 
problem. On the one hand, there is the child's talent, while on 
the other hand, there is the question of whether the parents can 
afford to provide that support. Since we are all very proud when 
our athletes win, we should also be very proud to provide them 
with adequate training and financial support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say something to the Liberal member who said earlier 
that everyone in this House is proud of the achievements of 
Canadian athletes, except perhaps a few Bloc members. This is a 
petty attitude which does not at all reflect what happened here 
when our Olympic medallists came to meet us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think anyone went and asked Alexandre Depatie of Laval 
whether his parents were sovereignists or federalists. This is 
irrelevant when it comes to recognizing the quality of an 
athlete's performance. The important thing is to allow our 
athletes to develop their full potential and to congratulate 
them when they perform exceptionally well and make it all the 
way to the world championships.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NPD's idea to raise the issue of financing, of helping elite 
athletes is a good one. This, however, is not the best way to go 
about it, as we saw when the heritage committee held hearings on 
professional and amateur sport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hearings on professional sports attracted a lot of people. 
Many members of Parliament came because of the presence of 
National Hockey League magnates. However, when we held our 
hearings on amateur sport, the audiences were a lot smaller. 
There were many empty seats. Yet, the problem that exists is a 
very important one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could a happy medium not be found between the tax credits 
offered for boxes at professional sports events and the 
financial assistance actually available to parents whose 
children show promise but who do not have the money to pay for 
equipment and travel so their kids can develop their potential? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the only level of competition where there is a 
problem.  Earlier, the Liberal member mentioned federal 
government programs to support outstanding athletes when they 
were selected for national teams. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in my riding came to tell me that they had been selected 
to attend the World Cup in Germany, but were offered funding 
covering only 20% or 30% of the expenses they would actually 
incur. 
I saw folks who were unable to attend the World Cup because they 
did not have the money it took. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it has been decided that someone has the skills and the 
ability to attend such an event, the funding should be adequate. 
There is perhaps nothing wrong with asking the athlete to 
contribute a portion, but it should be along the lines of 80-20, 
that is 80% funded by the government and 20% by the individual, 
by the student, not the reverse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a bit insulting, when it comes right down to it.  If your 
country has decided that you are talented enough to compete 
internationally and has selected you to represent it at these 
competitions, but you have a month, or a month and a half, to 
come up with $3,000, $4,000, $5,000 or $10,000 to pay for your 
trip, there is something wrong.  These problems should be worked 
out in the next budget so that funding can be as fair as 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It hits home even more when put in perspective.  For example, if 
the City of Quebec is selected as the site of the 2010 Games, 
now is when the athletes who will take part in those games are 
starting their training.  Children who are now six, eight, ten 
years old will be 20 or 25 in 2010 and they will be the ones 
performing.  I hope that Quebec will be able to have a team 
then, like all the other nations. 
This way, we will be able to say how proud we are of our young 
athletes' performance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a detail missing in this proposal. It may sound 
technical, but it is nonetheless relevant. This motion refers to 
universities. Assistance could be directed not only to 
university students but also to college students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, we have vocational and professional colleges, 
commonly known as cegeps, where technicians are trained, 
individuals who will be available for employment when their 
training is completed. Their fields of study include computer 
science, wildlife management, animal health, biology and all 
kinds of other sectors.  They can enter the labour force 
immediately upon graduation. Why would these students, and those 
in vocational training, not be eligible for this kind of 
program? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not help students training to become joiners or carpenters 
who also have athletic abilities to perform as athletes while at 
the same time being able to pursue their education in adequate 
conditions? I think this would be a good way to show that we 
value manual and technical work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not suggesting the member's intent was to exclude these 
people. I just see in this debate a great opportunity to examine 
all aspects of the question and to raise all important issues.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ultimately, and here lies the member's motion's greatest merit, 
the government will have to do something to help young athletes 
in Quebec and Canada who are taking part in international 
competitions. Care must be taken to change the current 
situation, where many young people give up, not because they 
cannot or will not compete, but because they do not have the 
financial support they need. In that sense, we must applaud the 
member's initiative in putting this issue forward.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure for me to address Bill 374, a bill that would 
effectively establish and name scholarships after Olympic gold 
medalists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Establishing scholarships for students would obviously be a huge 
benefit to all those considering attending university.  Today's 
university students are struggling to cope with high tuition 
costs and excessive debt.  The average university student 
graduating from university owes more than $25,000 and many 
students have been forced into bankruptcy. This is totally 
outrageous. Even before these students find their first real job 
they are straddled with a huge mortgage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal answer to this problem was to create the millennium 
fund which is more of a monument to the current Prime Minister 
than a positive initiative.  Only 7% of Canadian students will 
actually benefit from this fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite this bleak outlook students continue to pursue a 
university or college education because they realize it is their 
best opportunity at finding a decent job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious our students require immediate assistance. They 
are mortgaging their futures without the hope of finding a decent 
job.  Youth unemployment is at a staggering 15% nationwide and 
with the economic climate as it is today their hopes of finding a 
job are dwindling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reducing taxes would help stimulate greater economic growth, 
thereby providing greater employment opportunities for our youth. 
The government could further assist the economy by returning the 
EI premium surplus to workers and owners alike, where it 
rightfully belongs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill would be beneficial to those students who are 
presently in university or who are contemplating entering in the 
near future.  However, these scholarships would also serve other 
very important purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naming scholarships after Olympic gold medalists would be a 
wonderful way to pay tribute to those athletes who brought home 
Olympic glory.  These athletes' hard work and dedication to their 
particular sport could serve as a reminder to our students of 
whatever accomplishments they set their minds to they could 
accomplish.  Whether students are interested in sports or not 
these Olympic champions could serve as role models for our 
students.  They epitomize the meaning of commitment. I am not 
necessarily talking only about commitment in sports.  I am also 
talking about commitment needed to succeed in academics, business 
and in life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Establishing and naming scholarships after Olympic gold 
medalists would also help bring recognition to our Canadian 
Olympic program. It would help remind all Canadians of the 
outstanding accomplishments of our athletes in international 
competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's Olympic program needs visibility to encourage greater 
financial participation from the private sector.  Our Olympic 
program is suffering from a serious lack of funding.  Our 
athletes cannot focus their full attention on training because of 
a lack of training allowances.  Our Canadian athletes need 
greater support if they are to achieve world class results and at 
present the government is not willing to provide the necessary 
funding for them to achieve this goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only a few weeks ago one of Canada's bobsledders was forced to 
emigrate to the United States to try to make the U.S. team.  The 
U.S. financially supports its athletes so they can concentrate on 
becoming the best they can be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada still has much to be proud of in our Olympic athletes. 
Despite their financial limitations our athletes still manage to 
dazzle the world with a number of memorable performances that 
have resulted in Olympic gold.

instill a sense of pride in ourselves that we as Canadians have 
not experienced since.

perhaps it is time Canadians began basking in our own history, in 
our own accomplishments.  Canadians should be proud of who we are 
and what we have accomplished as a united country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After all, let us not forget that we are still considered the

would serve a number of purposes I have previously mentioned.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the comments made by members tonight with 
respect to this motion.  I thank the member for Churchill for 
seconding this motion.  I thank as well the member for South 
Shore from the Progressive Conservative Party who supports this 
motion.  That is a very important thing to do at this moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I assure the member for Calgary—Nose Hill from the Reform Party 
that this bill is not a double standard.  It does provide an 
additional amount of support for our young people for their 
education.  She says that if we repealed Bill S-9 it would tie 
the hands of young people.  This will not tie the hands of young 
people.  It will provide them with all kinds of opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are 25,000 Canadian young people attending American 
universities and other institutions which is 500% more than the 
number of Americans attending our institutions. That was the case 
before Bill S-9, which provided tax deductions for making 
contributions to U.S. universities, was implemented in the House. 
I disagree with the member on that.  It is something she should 
look a little closer at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the Liberal Party, the member for Ottawa—Vanier 
mentioned that he thinks this is a good idea.  I appreciate that. 
However, the member for Mississauga West who read the response 
from the government side did not read the motion.  He is still 
fighting the 1995 Ontario provincial election.  That was the 
indication I had from his remarks.  They were quite provocative. 
He was speaking for his government and basically it missed the 
point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not surprising that he attacked the New Democratic Party. 
He attacked athletes.  He attacked young people.  He attacked the 
unemployed.  He is playing politics.  He thinks this motion is 
something that is not worthy of consideration by this House.  As 
a matter of fact, what is more political is that he and his 
government have cut back education, in particular post-secondary 
funding for education, to such an extent that there is a looming 
crisis in education for young people in terms of their 
opportunity to access it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to buy some political capital the government institutes 
a new program called the millennium fund which may over a number 
of years provide additional scholarships for 6% or 7% of the 
eligible students. It excludes 93% or 94% of all students who may 
require some additional funding. The government in my view has 
intruded in the provincial scene with respect to the millennium 
fund scholarship program initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc made a correct observation when the member indicated 
that we have not included in the motion funding for cégeps or 
technical schools.  That is a good idea that could be 
incorporated in this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank members for participating in the debate.  I appreciate 
their viewpoints.  Although the motion is not universally 
embraced, I would ask for unanimous consent to allow this motion 
to be votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Does the House give its consent that 
this motion be made votable?

have the motion referred to committee for further study?

<A NAME="LINK221">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House take note of the dire humanitarian situation 
confronting the people of Kosovo and the government's intention 
to take measures in co-operation with the international community 
to resolve the conflict, promote a political settlement for 
Kosovo and facilitate the provision of humanitarian assistance to 
refugees. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, let me express my thanks to members of 
the House for granting the opportunity for this special debate on 
the situation in Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a difficult and troubling time as we watch a tragedy 
unfold in that part of the world.  It is one in which I believe 
Canadians are deeply engaged in seeing how we can try to find a 
solution.  The immediate issue we face of course is the imminent 
danger to the life and well-being of tens of thousands of people 
in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Yugoslav government has a long history of its involvement. 
It is important to point out that in the late 1980s, 1989 to be 
exact, it withdrew the autonomous status that Kosovo had enjoyed 
with the former Yugoslavia.  This gave rise to an insurgent 
movement and after nearly a decade of political repression, it 
has resulted in open fighting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can understand and perhaps could even have accepted the 
Yugoslav government's need to preserve its own internal security 
and to defend its borders from outside, which it says is the 
roots of its campaign of mass military action that it launched 
last February and March.  But it is clear and obvious to anyone 
who looks at what is taking place that the Yugoslav government 
has gone way beyond anything that can be justified in terms of 
those set objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The brutal tactics of the Yugoslav authorities in countering 
the Kosovo Liberation Army have included shelling civilian 
populations, burning homes and crops, and the execution of 
innocent civilians. A couple of quite tragic examples will 
suffice to make the point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just one week ago diplomatic observers visited the village of 
Gladno Selo, which means hungry village in our language. 
Virtually every house in that village had been destroyed.  No 
furniture or possessions remained anywhere.  It was flattened to 
the ground.  There was no trace of any of the inhabitants of that 
village. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the same day villagers in the Vranic area said that an 
indiscriminate Yugoslav offensive had started a few days earlier 
with artillery and then infantry backed by mechanized weapon 
vehicles.  Twenty thousand villagers were reportedly driven from 
their homes into the mountains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next day the military informed the villagers that it was 
safe to return.  As their convoy began to work its way back to 
the village, police, army and others stopped, attacked, searched 
and looted the convoy.  The charred remains of 150 vehicles were 
later observed along the road to Vranic. Clearly, many people 
paid the price with their lives. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very clear.  Canada and the communities must reject 
terrorism as a means of obtaining independence for Kosovo.  We 
have stated clearly that the solution for Kosovo is independence 
within Yugoslavia.  No peace is possible in the Balkans if the 
borders can be changed by force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We invested a lot to prevent that in Bosnia.  No one in Canada 
and in the international community supports the use of violence 
to achieve political ends.

<A HREF="#LINKT55"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have even less tolerance for the actions of the Government of 
Yugoslavia, which controls the military, paramilitary and police 
forces, which in turn are using the government's artillery, 
tanks and planes to subdue its own people. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are times when we have to look at the rules that guide us. 
There are precedents, conventions, covenants, agreements, 
documents and treaties, but oftentimes those have to be weighed 
against the sheer weight of humanity and the suffering that goes 
along with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, in this case we have the making of a major humanitarian 
disaster.  Aid agencies report that close to 300,000 people have 
been displaced as a result of the actions of militarists in 
Yugoslavia and Kosovo. Thirty thousand have become refugees in 
surrounding countries. The remainder are displaced persons within 
the republic of Yugoslavia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know that in that part of the world winter is soon 
approaching.  It is just a matter of days before the snow arrives 
and upward of 50,000 people are living without any form of 
shelter. I do not think we can afford to wait until they are 
frozen on the hillsides to resolve to do something, to draw the 
line on the actions of the government that has made them flee in 
the first place and put them in this untenable situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say that from the outset Canada has attempted to 
mobilize and energize international action.  Last summer we 
underwent a quite substantial diplomatic campaign in capitals 
around the world to try to get the United Nations Security 
Council engaged directly in this issue, with some degree of 
success.  It was through those urgings that the security council, 
which had lain dormant on this issue for a long period time, 
began to meet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wrote directly to Russian foreign minister Primakov 
reminding him that as a permanent member of the council and a 
privileged partner with the Belgrade government, Russia had a 
special role to play in putting effective pressure on Milosevic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As many members will recall, when we had the meetings of the G-8 
summit in London and Birmingham last spring, there had been a 
direct commitment by the Russian government to intercede with 
Milosevic, to ask for the kind of response on the humanitarian 
basis that was required.  As I said, they have that special 
access. We have made a particular effort to try to have the 
Russians live up to that kind of commitment and to use whatever 
special offices they may occupy with the Belgrade people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have also just recently repeated the same message to the new 
foreign minister, Ivanov, just before he travelled to Belgrade 
this weekend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to report that we also sent our special envoy 
to Belgrade and to Kosovo over this past weekend to begin to 
undertake direct Canadian representations within that area 
itself, but not with a great deal of success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think these actions are clearly reflective of the combined 
actions of many other countries that have been introducing 
envoys, making representations and trying to get a peaceful, 
political reconciliation or resolution to this dispute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In September the security council adopted a resolution that 
demanded that Yugoslav forces cease attacking civilians and 
withdraw forces that were being used to oppress their population, 
that they should begin meaningful dialogue and negotiations with 
political leaders in Kosovo with a view to achieving a political 
settlement, that the Kosovars themselves, the KLA, refrain from 
violence and also come to the negotiation table, and that there 
be clear commitments to allow for the delivery of humanitarian 
assistance and freedom of movement for international observers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, there has been an opportunity for 
organizations like the OSCE and others to send missions in. Again 
Canada has participated in observer missions within Kosovo in an 
attempt to provide an international presence and an opportunity 
to monitor these areas.

<A HREF="#LINKT56"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States government has made a variety of efforts, 
including one that is still ongoing with its special envoy to 
again try to come to grips with the Yugoslav government and the 
Kosovars to say that there are ways and means of resolving this 
and the international community is behind them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that up to this point the Belgrade government has 
simply been playing a cat and mouse game with the rest of the 
world and has been toying with the lives of its own citizens.  It 
has claimed that the Kosovo crisis is purely an internal affair, 
that there is no violation of human rights, and that it is simply 
responding to terrorist attacks.  This is after close to 15,000 
Kosovar refugees have already crossed the border into Albania. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When NATO ministers agreed to prepare a wide range of 
contingency plans to prevent a spillover into the neighbourhoods 
of Macedonia, President Milosevic again promised that mediation 
and peaceful activities would ensue.  He had promised President 
Yeltsin in a widely publicized meeting that he would implement a 
plan of action so a group of observers could come to Belgrade to 
start talking about the return of the international community to 
the OSCE.  He agreed to set up centres where displaced persons 
could seek help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, just to show the calumny that takes place, within two 
weeks of making that commitment, the Yugoslav army intensified 
shelling and pursued actions which pushed more people out of 
their homes and their villages.  Police routinely denied any kind 
of access for international observers.  Over the summer the tempo 
of aggression toward its own people had increased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Belgrade authorities had clearly decided two things.  First, 
to uproot as many Kosovars as possible, torching their homes, 
destroying their livelihoods.  The price of supporting the 
insurgents would become too great. It was an act of terrorism. 
Those the army and the police could not convince, the winter 
would. Second is very much the point of tonight's debate.  It was 
clear they did not believe the international community would act 
so decisively to prevent this from happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at this record of attempts and efforts to try to 
come to grips with the situation and the duplicitous responses 
from the government itself, we can see how those conclusions 
could be reached.  The question is what are the choices and 
options before us.  That is the point of the debate tonight and 
why we welcome the participation of members of parliament who are 
speaking on behalf of their constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To focus that debate I turn back to resolution 1199 which was 
adopted in September and the demands that were made.  At the same 
time those demands were clearly articulated, NATO, which is the 
only international organization that has the capacity to mobilize 
any form of international action in the area, also began to 
prepare plans for air intervention and to implement and look at 
the contingencies for those plans. As NATO countries identified 
their contributions, Belgrade again in its cat and mouse game 
began to moderate its behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Resolution 1199 has clearly called upon the Yugoslav authorities 
to meet a series of conditions.  As the secretary general said in 
his report which was tabled on Monday, those conditions have not 
been met. He reported that there still continues to be violations 
of human rights, that there still continues to be transgressions 
against humanitarian principles and standards, and that any 
compliance is clearly far from complete.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the security council continues to wrestle with its 
problems in trying to come to grips with this issue it is also 
important that the broader international community of which we 
are also members begin to look at how it can exert maximum 
pressure and follow through on the declarations that have been 
made.  It is clear that the Belgrade authorities are not of a 
mind to negotiate willingly.  They must feel the full weight and 
pressure of the international community to bring them to the 
table and find a solution.  NATO is an important part of this 
effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have urged NATO colleagues from the outset to look at the 
broadest possible range of contingencies they can take to promote 
a resolution with particular emphasis on having a proportionate 
response using the right modulated measure to suit the condition. 
NATO has prepared a number of actions to show Milosevic that he 
has gone too far and must change his ways. These plans include 
air strikes aimed at the capacity of the Yugoslav army and police 
to drive people from their homes and to try to use that in a 
selective way to show they cannot use these forces as a form of 
intimidation and terror against their own population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I emphasize that NATO is also looking at ways in which it can 
create a more secure environment for displaced persons to return 
to their homes.  As the NATO meetings continue to the end of this 
week we will continue to emphasize the importance of developing 
those plans and actions that can ensure proper treatment of the 
displaced persons and the access to humanitarian assistance.  It 
is also clear that NATO must be ready to act.  It is also clear 
that Canada must be able to contribute to its readiness to act. 
It is also clear that such actions do not come easy.  They are 
difficult and they must be wrestled with.  That is why it is very 
important that we use this opportunity to consult with the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was at United Nations last week for several days, meeting with 
the secretary-general and I spoke to members of the security 
council, a body by which we hope some time tomorrow we will be 
accepted.  In the meantime we can only make our representations. 
I expressed that it is preferable that the security council use 
its article VII mandate to give clear direction.  It ought to do 
that but there is also another reality that one or two permanent 
members of the security council who hold the veto power have said 
they will refuse to give such a mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a tough dilemma.  I still expect that tomorrow or the 
day after there will be further attempts to have the security 
council come to resolution but if not and the veto is exercised 
or the security council itself does not take action, does that 
mean that we stop and give up and allow the humanitarian tragedy 
to unfold?  That is a dilemma we have to face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to give every assurance that we have made every effort on 
the phones, in the corridors and in the various embassies around 
the world the last several days doing everything we possibly can 
to find a way of ensuring these actions take place within the 
right context and the right frame.  We still have to face the 
terrible tragedy that we may have to decide that without that 
clear mandate there is enough legitimacy in resolution 1199 
already passed and the clear statement by the secretary-general 
that has not been complied with that we would have to contemplate 
other actions and other measures. These would be considered at 
NATO council meetings at the end of this week. 
It is one of those tough choices that have to be made by all of 
us in this setting. However, under these circumstances we must be 
reminded of the saying that all it takes for evil to triumph is 
that the good do nothing.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have a 
number of questions for the minister.  I will try to be brief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize how difficult the situation is. I guess the question a 
lot of people are asking is what are we going to bomb if we bomb 
something. That is a question we need to ask.  We also need to 
know what happens after that.  What are the contingency plans? 
What are we going to do to help those 270,000 homeless people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a real concern about the expansion, things like 
the predicament Russia is in and the impending decision it might 
make.  What will be the reaction the minister would foresee to 
action by NATO after it has vetoed a potential UN involvement? I 
could of course also ask about Turkey, Greece and all the other 
countries but let us just zero in on Russia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing Canadians want to know is the level of 
involvement the minister foresees for Canada.  What are we 
actually going to do?  We hear about the independent 
Kosovo.  That is what Kosovans want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the minister clarify that he is not looking at that sort 
of thing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I said in my opening 
remarks, there has been a quite active series of examinations by 
the NATO council, the strategic command within NATO and the 
military forces of a series of contingency phases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think it would be very appropriate for me to outline 
what the steps would be until the decisions are taken.  I can 
assure the member that one of the clear options would be to use a 
form of air strikes.  Where the targets would be and so on I am 
not at liberty to discuss.  We would hope the clear will and 
determination that could be shown to use those would mean that 
they would not have to be used.  There is some suggestion that in 
the past, as we know in Bosnia, when the question of air strikes 
came up Milosevic did come to the table.  That is the kind of 
equation we are dealing with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as our relation with Russia, again it is not easy.  The 
Russians have made very clear statements.  They were in Belgrade 
just this last weekend. There will be meetings tomorrow in London 
of the contact group.  I was in touch with certain foreign 
ministers today to talk about that. 
We would hope that those discussions would lead to discussion 
with the Russian foreign minister which I hope would lead to a 
more active and positive contribution in the security council 
itself and the support of a resolution in the security council. 
I cannot say that I am wildly optimistic about that and the time 
grows short.

talked about the NATO expansion there was an agreement to have 
this joint council that brings NATO and Russia together.  I 
believe there is a meeting planned on Friday before we go into 
the weekend discussions at the NATO council level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the commitment at the present time, Canada has six CF-18s 
in the theatre stationed in Italy. They have been part of the 
contingency planning at this point.  It is probably more proper 
to raise the question with the Minister of Defence who will be 
here later this evening, but at this point there are no further 
commitments on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is one of the areas we have been emphasizing during the 
discussions both at the UN and at NATO that we also see the need 
for some form of provision for security within Kosovo from the 
point of view of humanitarian assistance and for assurances of 
protection of displaced persons.  These people are afraid.  They 
are not going to come back to their villages. They are going to 
freeze.  They think when they come back they are going to be hit, 
and that is the difficulty we face. I have to say to the member 
for Red Deer that is part of the contingency plan as well.

likely to exercise its veto and why it would do so? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second question concerns the work done by the minister's 
personal representative. 
I think the minister made a very good choice in calling on James 
Wright, an official with his department, who is very well liked. 
I have had the opportunity of working with him on a mission to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and I understand that he has met Yugoslav 
government officials as well as representatives of the Kosovars. 
I would like to know what the minister's personal 
representative had to report and what was the outcome of the 
discussions he referred to earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third and last, I would like to know what the minister thinks of 
a statement made at the start of the week, I think, by someone 
described as arcane and a notorious warlord, who said, and I 
quote— 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“We shall not kneel before NATO missiles.  We shall not allow 
ourselves to become enslaved to NATO or any other foreign power”. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the minister concerned about such statements?  Does he think 
that military intervention under the NATO or UN banner could 
lead to a dangerous war for the people of Kosovo and the 
Yugoslavs? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for the questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer to the first is that reports are that China has also 
indicated that it would exercise a veto.  But I think that again 
depends on the resolution itself.  As I said, there is still some 
time to play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member knows, because he and I talked about it at 
length, based on this question of the balance between 
non-ingérence that is classic under article 2 of the United 
Nations charter versus the broader humanitarian issue, I will not 
give a full description at this time but that is one of the major 
transition issues that we are facing today.  How far can the 
international community go to its international organizations to 
hold nations accountable to humanitarian standards? 
That really is the issue which is at stake at this point in time.

<A HREF="#LINKT60"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly agree with the hon. member's assessment that Mr. 
Wright is by far the best and most appropriate person, which is 
the reason he was there.  I have not received written reports, 
but we have had telephone conversations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was able to get access to Belgrade authorities and was able 
to deal directly with the Kosovar civilian people, not the armed 
rebels. But he did not have a great deal of success.  They do not 
seem to be willing to change what is going on at this point in 
time.  But we never know.  We were there.  We were making the 
case.  It was heard and listened to and we can only hope that the 
cumulative effect of that will perhaps have some influence over 
the next day or two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the statement that was read, it is somewhat of a 
threatening statement.  It is not unusual.  I am not surprised by 
it.  We certainly heard similar kinds of statements when we 
wrestled with the problems in Bosnia.  I do not think it will 
result in a wider conflict.  In fact I still have very much hope 
that by having debates such as this, by showing that there is 
some will that is going to be exercised, we may be able to find a 
political solution by the end of the week.  But it has to be 
accompanied, clearly, not simply by the minuet that has been 
going on; it has to be accompanied by a much clearer sense of 
direction and it must be made clear that we are prepared to use 
the necessary measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I conclude I want to assure members that we have already, 
as a concern related to Canadians within Yugoslavia, given 
warning notices to dependants and the non-essential staff at our 
embassy.  They have been given notice to leave.  We will likely 
maintain a small skeleton staff at the embassy for the duration. 
<P><A NAME="LINK224"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, certainly it 
is my pleasure to speak to this issue.  I guess it is the sort of 
thing that one wishes they did not have to talk to in this 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to go back to when I first came to this parliament.  I 
think the very first week we were here we were discussing Bosnia. 
That was one of the first issues on the table.  At that point we 
again had a take note debate and again we were dealing with the 
issue of how to deal with this sort of situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious that we do need to deal with it.  There are 
275,000 people suffering, both of Albanian and Serbian 
background.  There are 50,000 or more homeless people.  All of us 
are touched by that.  We all watch television, and we all believe 
that we must respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think the question is that we need to respond, that we 
need to do something.  However, there are a lot of questions that 
we need to address, that we need to bring forward. Therefore, 
this evening I will try to ask some of these questions.  Some of 
them are not answerable, but I still think Canadians expect us to 
discuss them in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is symptomatic of the age in which we live, the post-cold war 
period, that we have a lot of these problem areas which require 
action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree with much of what the minister says.  That is the case 
on issues such as this.  Certainly we have to support the fact 
that we may require NATO action because people like Slobodan 
Milosevic seem to understand only one thing and that is the big 
hammer over the head.  It is unfortunate that people like that 
exist, but there are many of them in many parts of this world 
that we have to deal with.  We obviously support that sort of 
NATO response or the ultimate probability that that response will 
be required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as well read the report of Kofi Annan this week.  We read 
about the 6,000 to 7,000 buildings which have been destroyed.  We 
saw villages totally damaged, being shelled, and people living in 
fear of returning to their homes. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1905"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I look at those pictures on television I cannot help but 
think back to travelling through some of those valleys in Bosnia 
where there was mile after mile, kilometre after kilometre, of 
bombed out villages.  There was nobody there.  The only thing we 
could see were the graves in the ditches as we drove along in the 
bus. There was total silence.  I have never experienced war. 
There were not even birds flying in the air.  It was totally dead 
silence.  There were nothing but graves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That brought it home very quickly.  We could not step off the 
roadside.  We could not drive our vehicle off the road.  We were 
told to only stand on what looked like old pavement because there 
were mines everywhere.  There were mines in the corn fields. Cobs 
of corn had plastic explosives in them.  When someone picked that 
cob of corn they would loose an arm or a leg.  They would be 
maimed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most serious thing I saw was in a schoolyard.  The children 
had all gone into the school.  I visited with those children. 
They wrote to me about what it was like to live in a war zone.  I 
have 12 pages of 10 and 11 year old kids telling me what it was 
like and what their future would be like.  What I saw in the 
schoolyard were Coke tins.  They looked like full Coke tins 
sitting on the table.  I said to the translator “Those are Coke 
tins.  The kids are going to love those”.  He said “Let me grab 
a big stick”.  He grabbed a big stick and pushed the Coke tin 
off the table.  There was a loud boom and the table disappeared. 
There was a mine underneath that Coke tin.  Some little kid was 
going to grab that Coke tin when they came out from class.  That 
would be retaliation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we are talking about.  That is the kind of 
environment that we as Canadians cannot imagine exists anywhere 
in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious why we need to get involved.  The humanitarian 
factor is so obvious, but the problems are many.  We saw the guy 
on television carrying the limp body of his young child.  That 
wells up something in all of us and says that we must respond to 
this kind of terror. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well the minister mentioned the problem of the United 
Nations.  This is a problem that we are going to have to deal 
with.  This problem is not just in Kosovo.  We can go back and 
talk about Rwanda.  We can talk about Nigeria.  We can talk about 
Bosnia.  The inability of the United Nations to respond is 
becoming a more serious problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I travelled to India and Pakistan this summer.  The inability to 
respond to the problem in that area is something that the world 
has to deal with.  We need to deal with the Kashmir problem.  I 
have said, and I will say it again, that Canada has an important 
role to play.  We can show some leadership.  I call it diplomatic 
leadership.  I call it mediation.  We could become the mediators 
of the world.  I use some of these examples and I would even 
carry it as far Kosovo.  We have a reputation which would allow 
us to be there and do things that the Americans cannot do, the 
Russians cannot do, the French cannot do and the British cannot 
do.  No one can do it but a country like Canada which is a middle 
power.  We are in the G-7.  We belong to NATO.  We belong to all 
kinds of things.  We would be respected in playing that role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am frustrated, as I am sure the minister is.  I grabbed from 
my notes a note of March 23, 1998 when I talked to our caucus 
about Kosovo.  I could grab other ones.  I said that there has to 
be action.  People are being killed.  Women and children are 
being killed.  We are now in October and we are still talking. We 
have done nothing.  That is extremely frustrating for all of us. 
We have to end it.  We have to find a better way of dealing with 
these kinds of situations.  I wish I had all the answers and 
could say “Mr. Minister, this is what we have to do and it will 
all work”.  I can give him some suggestions, but I do not know 
that they will answer all of the problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have difficulty with take note debates.  I repeat this and I 
will say it every time we have one of these debates. 
I think the better way would be to have the House invite someone 
to give us a complete briefing.  It would be for all members of 
parliament and it would be done in a non-partisan fashion.  We 
should bring in the best experts we have in this country, and we 
have a number of them.  Let them tell us all about this issue so 
that we as Canadians understand the issue much better. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1910"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we could let two speakers or four from the government and 
two from the opposition, whatever the formula, give the position 
of their respective party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we could have an honest vote, based not on partisan 
politics.  This is not partisan stuff.  We are talking about 
lives.  We are talking about people.  Then we could vote on what 
we should do.  We could come to a consensus.  I think foreign 
affairs lends itself to that and we would be respected.  We would 
feel better in ourselves.  Many feel they should speak on these 
issues but do not necessarily have the background, understanding 
or information to do it.  I would put forward that suggestion as 
being a better way than the take note debate we are having here 
tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the problem of being so slow to respond is probably more 
frustrating than anything else about this issue.  I would like us 
to address that.  When we deal with someone like Slobodan 
Milosevic or Saddam Hussein, or whoever we want to put in this 
category, we know what kind of person we are dealing with and, 
therefore, we should be able to build a response to these kinds 
of people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want to know a number of things.  They want to know 
what we will bomb if we have to bomb something.  They want to be 
assured that we are not just going to create more victims. They 
are concerned about the nature of the police force, the nature of 
the Serbian clean-up and the ethnic cleansing.  Can we really go 
in and bomb unless it is decided that we are going for Belgrade 
and we are really going to teach this guy a lesson?  He would 
understand that all right, but is that really the solution that 
we should be talking about?  How far do we go?  We should talk 
about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the dangers for Canadians?  We should talk about that 
too.  We understand that in Serbia there is a really good radar 
system.  There are missiles, there are rockets and there is a 
defence system set up there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Canadians are at risk we should know that ahead of time.  I 
know it is fine to say military is always at risk, but I think 
the levels of risk could certainly be discussed more fully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we considering using ground troops?  We know ground troops 
would be the way to make it work.  In Bosnia it works because 
there are people with big guns and they use a big stick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing I learned from talking to people there was that the 
hatred is still there and they are waiting.  They are waiting 
because that big gun will go away some day and when it does they 
will kill their neighbour who killed their grandmother, their 
grandfather or their child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These kids can talk about what happened in 1942.  They are 10 
years old.  They can relate what happened in 1536 when the 
Ottoman Turks came.  My goodness, they are living 500 years of 
history and it is affecting them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer would be to get on the ground and come up with a 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we always have to ask about U.S. dedication to this 
whole issue.  That is a question that we all need to know because 
I do not know that any of us could be there without that big U.S. 
stick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to know and we need to be assured by our defence 
minister about the readiness of our troops and equipment.  We are 
proud of them.  Those of us who have travelled in war zones, when 
we see the Canadian flag on the troop carrier, it makes us darned 
proud.  But we have to be sure that they are equipped to handle 
this sort of thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, besides saying that we need a long term plan, we should 
be a part of the contact group.  I think we have earned our 
stripes.  We have been there from the beginning.  I cannot see 
how we cannot force ourselves, more aggressively, to become a 
part of that contact group. 
Our future involvement should partly depend on our having a say 
about what our troops do.

<A HREF="#LINKT63"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about a long term plan we need to involve the 
European Union.  We need to ask what it is prepared to commit in 
its backyard.  I know the difficulties in asking that question. I 
posed it to Germans and French and have received opposite 
stories.  They need to face up to that as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need schools.  We need infrastructure.  We need planned 
society for 30 years or 40 years if we are to fix that part of 
the world.  Who has the commitment and the money?  Only on a big, 
collective issue can we do it.  Then we could be proud and say 
that we have done something for that country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concept of regional instability troubles us all.  We are 
concerned about Russia economically, from a nuclear standpoint 
and from a stability standpoint in Europe and the rest of the 
world.  We are concerned about Macedonia and Albania and a 
potential flare-up.  We are also concerned about Greece and 
Turkey, two NATO partners that may come into conflict in terms of 
this decision.  We need to ask those questions and need to be 
sure we have looked at them before we get too far into any kind 
of military action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish I could say tonight that I have the solution, that this 
is what the minister should be doing and if we were government we 
would do it.  However, this is not situation we are looking at. 
We are looking at a situation where Canadians need to understand 
our involvement.  We need to get that information out through 
members of parliament of all parties.  We need to answer their 
questions.  We need to address the issues.  Then we can say we 
have done what we are here to do in terms of an issue like this 
one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the minister thinks seriously about a different approach 
to take note debates.  If it does not work we can always come 
back to this method.  If we could just give it a try we would 
have better informed members of parliament, better informed 
Canadians, and more pride in the actions we take to help people 
of the world in serious crises such has the one in Kosovo.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have a question for my colleague, the member for Red Deer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since we are not in a position to evaluate the costs of any 
intervention by Canada or the form such intervention would take, 
would he like to see this issue debated again in the House or by 
the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we had what I would consider 
to be a fairly successful debate in committee regarding the Haiti 
situation.  Experts came before us and resolutions were put 
forward. I see the chairman nodding on the other side.  He would 
agree that it worked quite well.  It was extensive.  We had a 
chance to ask a lot of questions and we had a chance to debate. 
The problem was that it was only members of the committee.  It 
did not get out to Canadians the way it would if we used the full 
House for something as important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It needs more debate.  We need to get the information out.  This 
take note debate will not do it. I am firmly convinced of that, 
even though our briefings will help solve some of the problems. 
<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have taken into account the comments of the hon. 
member. 
I will defer to my friend from Vancouver soon. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1920"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not consider this debate to be necessarily the only 
opportunity we will have as parliamentarians to deal with the 
issue.  We wanted a take note debate now because we will be 
facing, particularly this coming weekend, decisions at the NATO 
council and at the United Nations.  It is important to get the 
views of parliamentarians before we actually move forward with 
those and have to make a decision as government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know there is a break next week, but I would certainly 
undertake to members of the House to work with the critics and 
the House leaders to organize some system, whether through the 
committee or whatever, to maintain a degree of information and 
briefing and so on.  We can work out the techniques for that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
might I address the hon. member for Red Deer and ask him whether 
I am correct in assuming that his party would authorize the use of 
armed force involving Canadian forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If so, would he relate that to existing security council 
resolutions which are territorialized rather precisely, or would 
he base it on more general chapter 7, article 51 provisions?  In 
particular, what is his feeling on the use of aerial power?  How 
would he relate that to the protocols additional to the Geneva 
protocols of 1977? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as we have always done in 
take note debates, we would support the ultimate decision to use 
military force if dealing with someone like Mr. Milosevic.  That 
is the only thing he understands.  We also believe that these 
questions should be asked and answered.  That is what Canadians 
want to know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overall our party and Canadians support our involvement in 
international situations.  Obviously, though, we are responding 
to a humanitarian need.  It is very troubling that the veto will 
be used.  We may end up fulfilling NATO action as opposed to UN 
action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is troubling because I believe it greatly weakens the 
position of the United Nations.  It means that more and more 
people will challenge its authority.  Going outside the UN does 
nothing but hurt that organization and could ultimately lead to 
its demise. 
<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to mention a couple of things for the member for Red 
Deer and the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both the minister and the opposition critic used personal 
examples of the ongoing horror in Kosovo.  That in itself is 
justification to take decisive action.  The problem many 
Canadians and I are having understanding is what the decisive 
action will be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Vancouver Quadra asked whether we would support 
air strikes.  I would support air strikes.  I would support quite 
a bit if I knew for sure what the objective was.  The difficulty 
is that we want to stop the horror and the suffering, but I am 
puzzled what we will consider a victory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can call up air strikes, one of those surgical things we can 
do which do not get our hands too dirty.  We want to solve it. We 
do not want to get our guys in harm's way but we will want to 
blow up a few fuel dumps and stuff.  The difficulty is what we 
will consider a victory once we start the process.  What is the 
political and military objective when we start the process? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I think of committing the Canadian Armed Forces to the 
process, I would like to know what we will accomplish, what is 
the end goal.  I want to stop the suffering.  I want peace.  I 
want all those good things it is easy to be in favour of.  The 
difficulty I am having is what we will consider a victory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Kosovo has been not annihilated but mostly annihilated.  What 
will get people back into their areas?  What will get the 
refugees to come back?  What assurances, what political stability 
do we hope to offer in the long term? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1925"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What military assurances can we give those people?  We could 
take out all the fuel dumps we could find and take out the heavy 
military stuff, the stuff that can be taken out with aircraft, 
but we cannot protect them from the presence on the ground of a 
bunch of Milosevic's animals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people will not go back.  They need the assurance of a long 
term of 30 years or 40 years, a generation or two of stability. 
Although this is a take note debate and I understand we are 
limited in what we can do, I still remain puzzled about what we 
hope to achieve in the long run both politically and militarily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because we want to do something we will send in the jets.  I 
think that is what will happen.  Dammit, we want to do something, 
but what will we offer the people of Kosovo that says when we are 
finished this is what they will have?  I have not seen it yet. I 
do not know what it is.  There is no simple answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will we do this with F-18s?  Will we strike and make a 
statement?  Milosevic will pull back a bit and say that it is 
still his because we cannot do the military and political things 
required to keep him out of there in the long term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is basically what I wanted to say comment-wise.  However, 
what are will we do that is more than the emphatic and heart-felt 
desire to take decisive action?  What will we offer the people of 
Kosovo that will give them assurance that pinpoint bombing and 
then a withdrawal will make any difference in their lives? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the long term plan?  What is the vision?  If it is just 
to bomb and strafe a few regions to make our point, I am not sure 
what commitment we can make.  Other than I wish it would stop 
over there, I do not know what commitment we can make that will 
make any difference in the long run. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is discouraging for me because we all want to take that 
decisive action.  I am afraid we will take action that in the 
long run the people of Kosovo will say thanks for the bombing but 
still have no homes, no future, no stability, no political 
structure, and no civil society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for Red Deer deserves 
some time to reply.  He will have about 30 seconds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think the frustration is 
obvious.  The minister has expressed that.  I think all of us 
would express it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I were answering that question I would say that the bombing 
will bring Milosevic to the table because he understands a plank 
over the head.  Then the real problem starts because there has to 
be a long term plan to provide the people with a solution.  I 
would start with education, hospitals and infrastructure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could ask about dollars and who will do that.  Then the 
diplomatic work starts to get everybody involved in solving the 
problem.  Do we have the will?  Do we have the money?  Those are 
the questions. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp:</B> Mr. Speaker, may I 
make a request?  I know that the Minister of Foreign Affairs has 
to leave, but I would like to make a comment that might perhaps 
give him an opportunity to answer a question. Could I have the 
unanimous consent of the House for that purpose? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Our difficulty is that the House 
agreed not to have people seeking unanimous consent during this 
debate.  That is the order under which we are operating. That is 
why the Chair is being put in a rather difficult position here, 
and there will be other requests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member now has the floor.  He can make a speech and the 
minister may want to question him or make a comment on it later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the House want to hear the minister say something further 
in response to a question? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Graham:</B>  Ask for unanimous consent.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
think my colleague's concern is interesting.  The minister 
replied that he could not give the House specific details of the 
form of military intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A question that I think is much more important and that merits 
perhaps an answer or at least a comment from the minister is the 
following:  If President Milosevic gives assurances, how good 
would they have to be for the idea of military intervention to 
be dropped?  I put the question because Mr. Milosevic has given 
such assurances in the past, to Russia in particular, without 
following through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I have an idea: the Minister may answer, 
but it will be included in the time allowed the hon. member for 
Beauharnois—Salaberry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Foreign Affairs has the floor. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will not eat into the 
hon. member's time but let me say first that resolution 1199 
passed by the security council does set out very specific 
conditions that we would want the Belgrade authorities to meet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beyond that I think it is important to look at the text of the 
secretary-general's report which also indicates that in order to 
have this occur there would have to be a more active form of 
international presence.  I think that answers the previous 
questions regarding how to get some form of guarantee, some 
assurances, particularly to the displaced people, that they can 
come back.  That would have to be part of any discussions and 
negotiations at the table.  There is that combination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not trying to be vague. I think these comments are very 
helpful. There is still security council activity potentially 
tomorrow, Thursday. There will certainly be NATO meetings 
beginning on Thursday, Friday and likely Saturday. These types of 
comments will inform us as we make representation in terms of 
formulating the ultimate plan that will be decided at the NATO 
council.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, thank 
you for your flexibility this evening, which has enabled us to 
obtain from a minister the answer to what, in my opinion, is a 
very important question, one that is at the heart of the debate 
that will go on for some days.  It will, without a doubt, be of 
interest to the Kosovars, the Yugoslavs and the entire 
international community, which is seeking a solution to this 
armed conflict, a conflict which has already left so many 
Kosovars dead or in exile. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to begin by indicating our party's agreement with 
the proposals by the Reform Party.  It is not often that we both 
agree, but where foreign affairs are concerned, we do sometimes 
support some of their initiatives, as we did for instance last 
spring when the hon. member for Red Deer introduced his motion 
on  debates on peacekeeping operations and the role parliament 
ought to play in this. 
We indicated our agreement that parliament, this House in 
particular, ought to have a greater presence, be more active. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposal by the hon. member for Red Deer is interesting in 
that it is intended to be instructive.  It seeks to get the 
members of this House more interested in foreign affairs and to 
ensure that MPs are aware of the issues behind major conflicts 
and therefore better equipped to make informed decisions on 
action the government wishes to make on behalf of this country 
aimed at keeping, or in some cases restoring, international 
peace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois supports the motion before the House this 
evening.  It supports an initiative aimed at putting an end to 
the cycle of violence that has really occurred in Kosovo, in the 
federal republic of Yugoslavia.

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As early as last March, the Bloc Quebecois drew the attention of 
this House to the urgent need to act before the situation in 
that region of the Balkans deteriorated. The conflict has been 
degenerating since March, forcing us today to have an eleventh 
hour debate as the international community prepares for more 
aggressive action to pressure President Slobodan Milosevic into 
honouring his country's commitments under the UN charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada announced that it would impose sanctions, but the 
sanctions that were eventually imposed in the spring and summer 
were quite modest, as the hon. member for Vancouver Quadra and 
then parliamentary secretary admitted. He even said that these 
measures were perhaps too modest to deal effectively with the 
problems at hand. Six months later, we must recognize that the 
sanctions imposed by Canada and other countries were not 
successful, and the situation is much worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the kind of soft diplomacy exemplified by these 
sanctions gave attackers plenty of time to consolidate their 
positions, while their victims, who are confronted to this 
situation on a daily basis, are forced into exile as part of a 
mass exodus. The member for Red Deer mentioned that in excess of 
250,000 Kosovars have fled their villages and communes and 
sought refuge outside their country. 
They also took refuge in European countries that are neither 
immediate neighbours nor states likely to provide a safe haven 
for the victims of the terror imposed by Slobodan Milosevic and 
his troops in Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Economic sanctions are only effective if there is a real 
political will to demand that the actions of a foreign 
government which violate human rights be immediately stopped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The brutal acts of violence and the repression of the Kosovo 
people by Serbian security forces are now well documented. They 
have been known for a long time, in fact for too long. These 
acts of violence and this repression justify a response on the 
part of the international community, but it must act in a 
consistent and coherent manner. But, first and foremost, the 
international community must act before it is too late. 
Canada must act jointly with other countries, including those 
that are part of the contact group that the member for Red Deer 
would like Canada to join—it is not for lack of trying on our 
part, but this select club simply does not want to invite Canada 
to join. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada must work in partnership with the countries that are 
members of the contact group, and with the other members of the 
UN security council, to act quickly and decisively, so that a 
clear and unequivocal message is sent to Mr. Milosevic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The numerous calls for negotiation made this summer by the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs and his officials have remained 
unanswered. These appeals have been fruitless. 
This is why we must now use a different approach. 
We must now resort to means other than diplomatic and economic 
sanctions, because these too have been ineffective.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not that there has been no Security Council intervention, 
for on March 31, 1998 it adopted resolution 60, and more 
recently, on September 23, resolution 1199, to which the 
minister has referred several times in his speech.  Intervention 
by the Security Council, which has obviously had only limited, 
if any, effects, now must be more energetic and more significant 
than ever before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time for the Security Council to act for reasons that are 
essentially humanitarian in nature. 
It is time to act, because too many people have been forced into 
exile, because too many people may be slaughtered.  Many have 
already been the victims of massacres, but many more Kosovars 
have been driven out of their communes, out of their towns by 
the killings, rapes, inhuman and degrading treatment, and 
torture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too many fear what is going on in their homeland, and 
have vivid memories of what went on in Sarajevo, only a few 
kilometres from the capital of the Republic.  Too many women and 
children, too many young and old people, have chosen exile 
because winter is approaching and their harvests have been 
destroyed by this filthy war, a war which has laid waste to 
village after village, commune after commune, a war which will 
leave famine in its wake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the people of Kosovo are turning to the international 
community, to the Security Council itself, for the only ray of 
hope they have left. 
The message the international community must send to the 
Yugoslav Republic and its president must be a clear one: 
civilian populations must not be abandoned.  Efforts must be 
made to ensure that they are spared further misery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Above all, the international community must act out of concern 
for these populations.  Its actions must be consistent.  The 
international community must intervene in Kosovo, in the 
Yugoslav Federal Republic, to ensure that its people have some 
chance of a better life.  Not only must it engage in 
humanitarian efforts, but now it must go beyond them to 
contemplate armed retaliation, military action, until peace is 
restored to this region of the Balkans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The international community has had to intervene in this region 
and is still involved in Bosnia, especially in Sarajevo, in 
certain areas where the Bosnians, the Serbs and the Croats were 
killing each other and where a threat remains to the lives of 
all these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time, however, the international community and Canada 
were slow to take real action against this constant threat to 
peace and security by, yet again, Slobodan Milosevic and his 
Yugoslav government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also tried at the time to impose sanctions and to promote a 
return to diplomacy and dialogue.  We hoped these measures would 
succeed, measures that we thought Slobodan Milosevic would act 
on.  We were forced into military intervention only in the face 
of the parties' refusal to negotiate a lasting ceasefire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We considered the problem at the time with blinkers on, 
intimating that the problem was in Sarajevo and should be 
settled for Sarajevo, where the conflict was better known, more 
dramatic, receiving more media attention and more symbolic.  Few 
countries intervening in Bosnia thought that the problem could 
surface in Kosovo. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1945"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So today, we must consider our intervention in much broader 
terms to prevent this conflict, once peace is returned to 
Kosovo, from moving on to Macedonia, as it well might.  Kosovo 
refugees are already on Macedonian territory.  Refugees could 
find themselves in neighbouring regions as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current situation therefore calls for consistent action, a 
strong humanitarian commitment by UN member countries and by the 
members of the Security Council and the General Assembly and of 
NATO, which could implement the provisions of the Security 
Council.  Consistent action is called for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must act quickly in concert with our international allies. 
I understand the dilemma the Minister of Foreign Affairs 
described. Obviously, the UN Security Council could be prevented 
from taking action under chapter VII, if Russia and China were 
to use their veto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a major dilemma, because action taken by the 
international community, through a group of countries or through 
NATO, may be construed as illegal under international law. The 
member for Vancouver Quadra is perfectly aware of the illegal 
situation the international community would put itself in by 
acting without the council's approval. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But what the minister is telling us is that the international 
community, that a group of countries, that NATO may act 
illegally, because military action is justified in this case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a motion before us, a motion that may be too modest, too 
timid. 
There is no mention, in this motion, of the use of armed forces 
or of Canadian participation through NATO. It only refers to the 
humanitarian situation facing an increasing number of men, women 
and children, the well-being of whom we must be concerned with, 
even though Ottawa is thousands of kilometres away from Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is asking that we take notice of this terrible 
situation. It is indeed time Parliament took notice of this 
situation. The government has announced its intention to take 
measures. But what measures? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform Party members were right to point out that we do not have 
here, this evening, concrete indications on the measures that 
Canada favours, or wants to favour, in the debates that will 
take place at the Security Council, the NATO council and in 
other forums where this issue will be discussed over the next 
few hours or days. We are told that these measures seek a 
diplomatic solution to the problem. This is fine, but what 
specific measures? What would be Kosovo's status within or 
outside the Yugoslav Republic? We should consider any solution 
that respects the wishes of the Kosovo people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this seems pretty weak. The motion does not go far enough. 
It should have been worded in stronger terms, because the daily 
tragedy of these populations deserves stronger wording. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by saying that this is a matter of justice. I am 
going to quote someone, not George Washington—whom the minister 
likes to quote, as he did yesterday during a debate on a piece 
of legislation—but Blaise Pascal, a philosopher whom some of 
you know and like. Pascal said: “Justice without strength is 
powerless. Strength without justice is tyrannical. Therefore, 
both justice and strength must be present and, to that end, we 
must make sure that what is just is also strong”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this particular case, justice and strength must be combined 
to end the tragedy suffered by the people of Kosovo. We must put 
an end to their tragedy.

will take advantage of the legal expertise of the hon. member 
for Beauharnois—Salaberry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The possibility was mentioned of a NATO-led intervention.  The 
hon. member is well aware that NATO is a regional association 
governed by the UN charter, that it is limited by charter imposed 
conditions regarding the use of armed force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He will certainly recall that, during the Korean War, the 
well-known resolution 377(V) passed by the General Assembly was 
used to compensate for the gaps in international public law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member think that there is a new category of 
humanitarian intervention distinct from the charter, or are 
specific security council resolutions necessary before Canadian 
troops can be sent in? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is well aware that the resolutions passed for Bosnia apply to 
a very specific area.  What way is there around this legal 
impasse?  Does he have any useful suggestions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is also certainly aware that the protocols, additional to the 
Geneva protocol of 1977, set very tight restrictions on the 
use of air strikes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the House wants to hear about 
international law tonight.  How very interesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier tonight, the member for Vancouver Quadra had a test 
question for the member for Red Deer, a very difficult one too. 
The member for Red Deer gave a very political answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will try to reply to the question using the knowledge we 
share, which we want to see benefit the House, moreover.  There 
is some value to having expertise and to being willing to share 
it with one's colleagues during debates such as this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is difficult under current international law to claim that 
force can be used under chapter 7 without the formal approval of 
the Security Council. 
The use of force was possible during the Gulf crisis because the 
Security Council authorized certain states to use force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just a few months ago, we debated in this House the potential 
use of force against Iraq. Members will remember that, on 
several occasions, I asked the government if it thought that 
Canada and other states had the authority to use force against 
Iraq. That question remained unanswered. I know that legal 
opinions were provided on the subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I think it is difficult to claim, under international law as 
it currently stands, that the use of force, even in this case, 
would be consistent with the charter without prior authorization 
of the Security Council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, are we seeing a customary rule emerge from a 
practice whereby the states will be able to invoke a breach of 
the peace to justify an intervention? I think that circumventing 
the charter by invoking a customary rule that would allow states 
to intervene in a case like this may be a way to solve the 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Article 51 may be the only legal basis that could be used to 
justify an intervention in this case, even though it would 
require a very liberal interpretation of that article. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beyond all that and even as an internationalist, I think we must 
weigh the good and the bad in this type of situation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If we think that an armed intervention is necessary to protect 
the most fundamental of human rights, if the international 
community agrees that such an intervention is legitimate, and if 
the international public is in favour of this intervention, then 
it is surely justified. Such intervention will free many people 
from the terror inflicted upon them by individuals who, one day, 
will hopefully have to appear before an international criminal 
tribunal and be held accountable for their war crimes and their 
crimes against humanity before the international community.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
cannot quote Pascal or Washington, but the quote I have dug up is 
one by the Greek philosopher Pindar who said “the test of any 
man lies in action”.  Versions of this have been regurgitated 
over time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have the answer for the question I have for the member 
but I would like to have his comment on it.  Why is it that 
problems in central Europe receive, necessarily, a very high 
priority at the United Nations but often other equally horrendous 
human rights abuses in other parts of the world do not seem to 
grab the United Nations by the throat to say that it is a 
compelling problem that has to be solved today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One example I can think of is what is going on in Algeria. 
According to Amnesty International thousands of people have been 
massacred in rural areas, and there is not a blink and no 
resolution.  It is a human rights abuse on a grand scale and no 
one says anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the southern part of Sudan there are Christians and tribal 
communities that are being actively ethnic cleansed by a Muslim 
government in this case.  It is persecuting people systematically 
and no one blinks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are problems in Angola.  We certainly know about the 
problems in Rwanda and they are entering into more problems in 
Rwanda, hopefully not as bad as they had.  There are hundreds of 
thousands of refugees from Somalia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is systematic and systemic abuses in a large part of the 
world, a lot in Africa, and the United Nations just does not 
consider these to be the crisis that it does Kosovo.  It is a 
crisis in Kosovo and that is why we are here.  We all agree about 
that. However, I wonder why this is and I wonder if the member 
has thought about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regardless of whether it is the Geneva convention, section 77 or 
security council resolutions or whatever technical things, why is 
it there are so many other areas of the world that the western 
world remains quiet about but the problem in Kosovo is seizing 
the world?  I have some ideas on why this is happening but I was 
wondering if the member had any ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is a tragedy that the United Nations and those of us 
who are concerned about human rights abuses do not treat all 
human rights abuses as a problem for all of us.  Martin Luther 
King was right when he coined the phrase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is a very good 
question, and a very difficult one to answer.  Maybe the simplest 
answer would be that there are double standards in the 
international community.  There are too many double standards 
when it comes to human rights and the ways in which the United 
Nations and other international organizations intervene when 
there are conflicts.  That is the simplest answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The more complex answer would be that when human rights abuses 
bring a real threat to peace and security, that is when there is 
a drive toward involving the security council and other organs of 
the United Nations.

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is when it happens.  Because there was a severe threat of 
international peace and security in Bosnia there was an intervention 
of the international community and there still is.  There was 
also a threat of international peace and security in Somalia, in 
Africa.  The member also mentioned Sudan and Algeria.  When there 
was a very important threat to peace and security in Somalia 
there was an intervention of the UN. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe because of that the problem of the intervention of the UN 
in Somalia was created, especially in the eyes of the Americans. 
That is why there is a very cautious attitude to intervene in 
Africa.  That is very unwise.  Africa is a lost continent.  It is 
continent that is sacrificed nowadays.  I do not think it should 
be.  We should not accuse the United Nations of that.  We should 
never forget that the United Nations is composed of member 
states. Those states allow or disallow the intervention of the 
security council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the more complex answer.  It does not justify double 
standards.  Once double standards are lifted we will live in a 
better international community.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I begin by expressing 
my appreciation to the Minister of Foreign Affairs for giving the 
House this opportunity to debate this very important motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues and I in the New Democratic Party support the 
motion. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for Beauharnois—Salaberry said, we were hoping that 
it would go further, that it would be stronger, that justice and 
strength, two fundamental principles, would have been expressed 
more clearly in this motion.  Nevertheless, we support the 
motion. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was last week that this House unanimously spoke with one 
voice following the terrible atrocities that were brought to 
light by Human Rights Watch, the massacre of 18 innocent 
civilians in a forest in the Drenica region.  Other members have 
spoken of this earlier.  The House spoke with one voice urging 
the Government of Yugoslavia, Milosevic and the parties involved 
to put down arms immediately and start negotiating a solution 
with the help of international organizations like the United 
Nations and the OSCE. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was last week as well, a few days afterward, that Human 
Rights Watch issued a report that documented the terrible 
violations of international law showing that the Serbian special 
police and the Yugoslav army units have executed civilians, 
systematically destroyed civilian property and attacked 
humanitarian aid workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The director said it has been clear for seven months that the 
government is conducting a brutal war against civilians in 
Kosovo.  These are war crimes.  These are crimes against humanity 
and yet the Government of Yugoslavia and Milosevic refuse to 
co-operate with the international tribunal investigating it. They 
have gone further and have restricted the work of domestic and 
foreign journalists seeking to report on these terrible 
atrocities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These atrocities can also strike home. The hon. member for 
Churchill spoke with family members in a community that she has 
the honour of representing who have family in Kosovo who were 
terribly injured.  This strikes home to her and to each of us at 
a very profoundly human level.

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has gone on for far too long.  We have heard the same 
threats, the same promises of action in the case of Kosovo that 
we heard in the case of Bosnia, and there the international 
community failed terribly.  It took three years, 200,000 people 
who died and too many warnings before finally when spurred by the 
terrible mortar attack by the Serbs on a crowded marketplace in 
Sarajevo in August 1995 the west took action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tragically that action was not taken by the United Nations.  One 
of the great dilemmas and tragedies of the situation in Kosovo is 
that we cannot rely on the United Nations in these circumstances 
to definitely respond to this humanitarian crisis.  We cannot 
assume the security council will adopt a resolution that will 
authorize the kind of firm military response that clearly is 
warranted and was likely warranted some time ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw the effects of Serb aggression in Bosnia and now we see 
them in Kosovo.  I witnessed them when I visited Vukovar.  I 
witnessed the Serb aggression on Croatia and its people.  I will 
never forget walking through the ruins of a church in Vukovar and 
picking up a small piece of wood, the remains of a small wooden 
cross. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The community of nations has to say that the occurrence of this 
kind of atrocity is not acceptable.  The United Nations' own high 
commissioner for refugees has estimated that over 280,000 people 
have been displaced by the fighting since March.  This is mostly 
within Kosovo.  Some 50,000 have not found shelter yet.  Many 
others are living in very difficult conditions.  Over 700 have 
died.  And with winter fast approaching there is a very real 
danger of a humanitarian disaster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the Government of Canada to respond to that disaster, to 
step up donor funding for reconstruction and winter emergency 
plans in Kosovo and to provide financial assistance to 
Montenegro, to Albania and the former Yugoslav republic of 
Macedonia hosting many of the refugees and which desperately need 
support as winter fast approaches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would prefer a resolution of the United Nations security 
council.  We would hope the OSCE, the regional security body in 
that region, would be able to come to a consensus, but we cannot 
allow the veto power of Russia and possibly China, the consensus 
rule of the OSCE to prevent the kind of action that very likely 
must be taken, the kind of military action that must be taken to 
save human lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be under no illusions about the possible risk to 
Canadians.  Canada has six CF-18 aircraft on the ground in 
Aviano, Italy, 130 Canadian pilots and ground crew.  They are 
courageous men and women who will be directly affected by the 
decision our government makes.  I am sure that every member of 
this House wishes those men and women well at this very difficult 
time.  I am sure we all recognize that when we talk about the 
possibility of military action, it is our sons and daughters who 
may very well be on the front lines, who may be fired on by those 
ground to air missiles that the Serbs have threatened to use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a humanitarian disaster. I believe that as Canadians we 
have an obligation not to stand by but to act. 
The member for Fraser Valley has spoken at the same time, and 
rightly so I believe, of the fact that there is certainly a great 
deal of selectivity in the international response.  Of course we 
are profoundly concerned about the situation in Kosovo and we 
must recognize that air strikes alone fall far short of what 
would be a thoughtful and appropriate response. If there is not a 
presence on the ground, that could exacerbate the situation and 
make it even more difficult.

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must remember as well that in whatever military action that 
may be undertaken innocent people's lives must not be put at 
risk, whether Yugoslavians, Kosovars or anybody else, but we made 
the mistake globally of waiting too long in Bosnia and we cannot 
afford to make that mistake in Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The world though has stood by, as the member for Fraser Valley 
said, in cases of other humanitarian disasters; the genocide in 
East Timor, a third of the population, 200,000 people, murdered 
by the Suharto regime. Where is the international outcry on that? 
Where is Canada's voice on that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been ten resolutions at the United Nations on East 
Timor and Canada shamefully has either abstained or voted against 
every one.  So the member for Fraser Valley is right.  There is a 
double standard, whether in East Timor, the situation with the 
Kurds, in Turkey, northern Iraq, Colombia, Sudan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, my colleagues and I in the New Democratic Party support 
this motion. We desperately hope that Milosevic will come to his 
senses, pull back, respect the rights of the people of Kosovo to 
determine their own future, hopefully have the kind of autonomy 
they had previously, but to respect their rights to 
self-determination, and that we can avert the continued horrors, 
because already too many people have died, that would in many 
respects be totally unacceptable not just to Canadians but to all 
civilized people should the global community not respond, not 
just with words but with action.  La justice et la force. 
<P><A NAME="LINK234"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, there exists a strong possibility after hearing the 
addresses already in the House that there will be a political 
consensus.  It may be an all-party political consensus within the 
House.  I wonder if he could help us over the next stage and 
comment on the suggestions by the member for 
Beauharnois—Salaberry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a new concept of humanitarian intervention which is 
separate, its origins different, from classic intervention.  It 
is still subject to some limitations. The OSCE is like NATO, a 
regional security organization and cannot exceed charter 
conditions and limitations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member believe either through customary 
international law or through the general assembly that we might 
find an adequate base for Canadian armed intervention if that 
would arise and also take us over the aerial bombardment issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe in the war in the gulf he had some difficulties with 
the compatibility with some of the operations.  Can he help us to 
this next step? Customary law can gallop at the present time. 
There has been the phrase used, instant customary law.  A number 
of quick precedents can help make new norms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the hon. member help us here?  I think there is a good 
possibility of a political all-party consensus emerging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. 
member for Vancouver Quadra is correct. Certainly as we listen to 
the debate tonight it appears there is an emerging political 
consensus around the desirability of hopefully the United Nations 
with a resolution; if not the United Nations, then certainly the 
OSCE as the regional body under article VII. 
Failing that—and I think the member asks a very important 
question—is there another basis in international law for 
military intervention? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2015"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly international law is an evolving body of law.  There is 
a clear and demonstrable threat to human life on the massive 
scale that we have witnessed already in Kosovo.  This is not an 
anticipatory action, as the member is well aware.  This is an 
action in response to brutal war crimes against humanity. Those 
crimes are well described in international law.  If the community 
of nations in taking action does not exceed what is required to 
respond to those well documented war crimes against humanity are, 
I would hope that international law would recognize the justice 
of that intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important at the same time that the intervention not be 
excessive.  It is important that it be based on humanitarian law 
principles and that there be support and follow up.  It is not 
acceptable to drop bombs, to conduct air strikes, and then what 
happens next?  If there is no support for the Kosovars on the 
ground, there could be massive retaliation by the Serb military, 
a situation of complete anarchy could prevail, and it could be 
counterproductive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the international legal basis for action, had the 
world waited for a new concept of international law in the case 
of Bosnia as it did in Rwanda to the shame of the international 
community, I can only imagine the kind of carnage that would have 
continued to take place.  If international law does not provide 
that base at this point, certainly it may be time to establish 
that precedent. 
<P><A NAME="LINK235"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to share this opportunity to speak with the hon. member 
for Burnaby—Douglas.  I guess I am as pleased as one can be to 
speak to a topic of this nature.  We all know it is a very 
serious topic.  It is a very sad event.  It is something that 
most of us would rather not be discussing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before the House reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House take note of the dire humanitarian situation 
confronting the people of Kosovo and the government's intention 
to take measures in co-operation with the international community 
to resolve the conflict, promote a political settlement for 
Kosovo and facilitate the provision of humanitarian assistance to 
refugees. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been indicated by my hon. colleague, the NDP supports the 
motion.  Interestingly enough it was just a few days ago that our 
federal council approved a resolution which read as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas the Serbian armed forces are continuing to attack the 
people of Kosovo, killing, injuring and driving away hundreds and 
thousands of civilians in their attempt at ethnic cleansing of 
the area; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And whereas massacres have been conducted by the Serbian 
authorities in Kosovo and that these massacres have been 
documented and confirmed by diplomats and journalists; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And whereas all diplomatic attempts by European and North 
American governments have achieved nothing to stop these 
massacres and ethnic cleaning, 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore be it resolved that the federal NDP in condemning the 
massacre of innocent civilians of Kosovo demands the federal 
Liberal government in Ottawa to use its influence in NATO and the 
United Nations to call for intervention to halt the killings and 
ethnic cleansing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Be it further resolved that the federal NDP affirms and 
recognizes the right of self-determination for the people of 
Kosovo to decide their own political future without the fear of 
oppression and the military presence of the Serbian armed forces. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it very rewarding to see tonight that the motion the 
government brought forward takes into consideration the concerns 
expressed by the grassroots people who attended our council. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2020"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reality it shows that the issue we are dealing with is not a 
partisan issue.  It is an issue that cuts across all parties.  It 
is a humanitarian issue.  It is one that should be of concern to 
all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reinforce the point that I believe was made by the hon. Reform 
member who spoke earlier.  He talked about the fact that this was 
a take note debate and that it might well have served us better 
if we had a gathering where we could have been informed as a body 
about what was really happening and obtained the appropriate 
information so that as we debated the issue we would be more 
informed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say with all due respect that since I started the political 
business far too often I have found—and I am sure there may be 
others who have found the same thing—that we as members are 
rushing from one topic to the next.  We are dealing with all 
kinds of things that are coming at a very fast and furious pace. 
Quite often people are speaking on subjects in the House and 
using notes they made at the last minute.  They do not have all 
the information at hand they would like to have to deal with the 
matters appropriately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One might say this is the nature of the business, that this is 
the kind of life we are living today, that it is a very fast 
paced life and we have to be able to deal with it.  Perhaps that 
is one of the problems with the world today.  We are moving fast. 
Perhaps that is why we are seeing so much unrest and so many 
humanitarian problems in all parts of the world.  We do not take 
the time to slow down and deal with issues appropriately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That aside, this is a humanitarian issue.  We read statements 
about the suffering that has taken place.  One news article 
contained these words “the television pictures are bad.  A 
toddler lying dead, pacifier still hanging from her purple 
snowsuit.  The corpse of a man set on fire while tied to a tree. 
The crumpled body of another cut down by machine gunfire from a 
passing car”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And then it went on to talk about 200 villages in Kosovo that 
had been destroyed.  An estimated 250,000 people were homeless. 
Thousands had died as Serb forces rooted the Kosovo liberation 
army.  It talked about winter coming on and the prospects for 
mass starvation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These things are very disturbing to us.  Perhaps years ago we 
would not have seen or heard these things, but today we sit in 
our homes and see those images in our living rooms as we watch 
television, as our young people and our children watch 
television.  We can see the dire consequences of man's inhumanity 
toward man. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a serious problem.  We know there is a long history 
between the two factions fighting in the area.  When we look at 
it and we hear talk about ethnic cleansing, the wiping out of a 
certain group of people, we have to come back to the basics of 
what we as a human race are doing to one another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Serbian armed forces are continuing to attack, injure and 
kill people.  Another news article talked about a family that was 
massacred.  We read about the corpses of five women and two 
children, ages 5 and 7, lying in a narrow gully near a makeshift 
tent where villagers said the family had sought refuge from the 
shelling.  All the victims had been shot in the head at close 
range, apparently while attempting to flee the attack.  The 
bodies of several of the victims displayed clear evidence of 
mutilation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We read about a woman aged 28 who was two months pregnant 
according to family members.  Her belly had been cut open.  We 
read about an older man, 65, who was found in a makeshift tent. 
His throat had been cut open and part of his brain had been 
removed and placed next to him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hard to believe in this day and age in the 21st century we 
could be talking about such atrocities.  Yet these things are 
happening. We all agree quite readily that action must be taken 
to stop these things.  Ideally we would all like to see the 
action being other than military action, because we know that 
military action in itself creates problems.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister mentioned earlier that many meetings had been 
attempted to try to bring about a peaceful solution.  There has 
been consideration of the matter by the United Nations and by 
various officials trying to bring about a peaceful end.  These 
have been to no avail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When push comes to shove we have to look seriously at how to 
make it stop.  Also, as was mentioned by an hon. member, we have 
to be mindful that if we make a decision to move toward military 
aid we are looking at our own men and women going into a very 
dangerous situation.  We must be assured that our men and women 
are adequately prepared with proper equipment as well as properly 
equipped emotionally and otherwise.  There are many other things 
to consider as we look at the total picture and this very serious 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Questions have been raised around how such things can happen, 
why there are double standards, why we can allow atrocities in 
one area and not deal with them, yet look at them in another area 
and deal with them.  Ultimately it comes down to the 
responsibility of each and every one of us as individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United Nations is comprised of individuals.  The security 
council is comprised of individuals.  In reality, it comes down 
to what each and every one of us as individuals feels in our 
hearts in terms of how we deal with our fellow human beings and 
whether we allow these atrocities to exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am reminded of a story from a well known book about man who 
was travelling from one village to another.  He fell among 
thieves, was beaten, was stripped of his clothes, was robbed and 
left lying by the side of the road for dead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along came a very highly educated person who looked, crossed 
over and walked by on the other side.  Then along came a 
religious leader.  I am sure we have lots of religious leaders 
and lots of highly educated people in our society.  Along came a 
religious leader who also looked, crossed over and walked by on 
the other side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we are told that along came a man, a Samaritan, one of the 
people who was despised in that day and age by others.  He was 
perhaps an outcast.  He looked at the person lying in need.  He 
went to him, bound his wounds, put him on his own beast, took him 
to town, left him at an inn and said “Here is the money to look 
after him.  When I come back, if you have spent more I will repay 
you”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the kind of concern that we as individuals— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I am afraid I have to 
interrupt the hon. member.  His time has expired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson:</B> Madam 
Speaker, I listened with great care to the very thoughtful 
comments of the member for Halifax West.  I wonder if I might 
hear his concluding comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle:</B>  Madam Speaker, I will conclude very 
quickly.  The kind of concern we must show for each other as we 
sit around a security table, as we sit at the United Nations, as 
we in the House debate this very important issue, must be the 
kind of concern shown by the man who looked after the person in 
need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is up to each and every one of us to do that if we are to 
build a better world for our children and our children's 
children. 
<P><A NAME="LINK236"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price (Compton—Stanstead, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
this debate concerns a very serious matter, one of life and 
death.  It merits the attention of all members and all Canadians. 
I notice that there are no ministers in the House, no one to 
listen to my party's views.  That is totally unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has asked the House to take note of the 
situation.  During the take note debate in February concerning 
sending Canadian troops to Iraq to what might very well have been 
a dangerous situation I said that it was the weakest 
parliamentary engagement a government could undertake.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government refuses to place a substantive question before 
the House when it concerns defence matters.  The government 
refuses to let members vote to support or condemn its policy when 
it concerns defence matters.  It is clear that the government is 
ashamed of its policy when it comes to defence matters, and 
should it be any wonder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister likes to tell Canadians that he has consulted 
the House of Commons.  But Canadians know that the Prime Minister 
will not let the House vote on this issue, just as he has not let 
the House vote on every other military issue.  He refuses to put 
his policy to a vote, a fundamental characteristic of democracy. 
In doing so, the Prime Minister weakens his case when he tells 
other nations how they should behave. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue before us is the Yugoslavian province of Kosovo. 
Slobodan Milosevic is the Serbian leader of Yugoslavia and the 
evidence suggests that he has ordered the slaughter of thousands 
of ethnic Albanians.  This is not new evidence.  The west has 
known publicly about these atrocities at least since February. 
Now 200 villages in Kosovo have been destroyed and more than 
250,000 people have become refugees.  Thousands have been killed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The west has failed to act, and Canada under this government has 
done nothing to urge the United Nations or NATO to take action 
sooner.  Only now when the President of the United States and the 
Prime Minister of Britain decide it is time to take action will 
the government move.  That is not leadership.  But then Canadians 
have not come to expect leadership from this government.  From 
this government they have come to expect excuses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bosnia the European Union looked foolish.  In Bosnia the 
United Nations failed.  Only when NATO took action, belated 
action admittedly, did Milosevic respond.  That action was late, 
but it was tough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 air strikes led to the Dayton accords, a fragile 
settlement that is being monitored by 1,300 Canadian troops to 
this day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Kofi Annan, the UN secretary general, came out with a statement 
that condones military action.  While the west has been late, it 
is important this action be taken now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As some of us have learned, this century's greatest lesson is 
that if an aggressor is appeased, their appetite only grows. 
Although leadership on this issue has been lacking, NATO must act 
now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But it is not a straightforward issue. Kosovo is a province 
inside Yugoslavia.  Yugoslavia is ruled by Milosevic.  Should we 
be in favour of Kosovo independence at this juncture?  This is a 
classic case of how not to deal with ethnic minorities, but it is 
certainly a difficult dilemma between self-determination and not 
breaking up countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If only it could be as simple as pointing to Canada as a beacon 
of how two distinct peoples can live together with occasional 
debate and heartache, but mostly a great love and respect for 
each other. If only Milosevic listened to reason the way the 
people of Quebec and the people of Alberta listen to reason, the 
Balkans would be a lot safer place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But Mr. Milosevic is not a reasonable man.  By all accounts he 
is a murderous tyrant who must be dealt with and must be dealt 
with harshly.  NATO has proven that it is the only credible force 
that can act at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government talks about taking measures.  If these measures 
do not include helping our NATO allies who will be using force, 
then my party will have to disagree with the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has six CF-18s based at Aviano Air Force Base in Italy. 
They must be used.  There is no reason that I am aware of that 
Canada could not fly air cover for this mission.  If there are 
reasons why they cannot be used, the minister has to tell the 
House right now.  But there are risks and the government must do 
all that it can to prepare Canadians for these risks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the CF-18s will be flying over hostile territory. 
Milosevic has no small force.  He has four brigades and will 
attempt to shoot down any NATO planes. 
This is a risk, but a risk that Canada must take.

<A HREF="#LINKT79"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, Milosevic has threatened retaliation against NATO troops 
anywhere, and that includes Bosnia.  As I mentioned earlier, 
Canada has 1,300 troops in Bosnia.  I visited them last spring 
and they are certainly up to the task but there will be danger. 
They will be threatened and that is a danger. The government must 
tell the Canadian public about this danger. The Canadian public 
must know that Canadians will be part of this operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, after this bombing, it may be necessary to put troops on 
the ground.  U.S. Secretary of Defence Cohen said yesterday in 
Washington that might indeed be necessary.  He said that if it is 
done, it will only be European troops.  Canada needs to know if 
that has been agreed to and exactly what role Canada will be 
playing after the initial bombings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other factors.  There is the Russian factor.  As the 
House knows, the Russians are related ethnically and religiously 
to the Serbs.  They have told us that they are against NATO 
bombing.  That is unfortunate, but unfortunately NATO will have 
to go ahead without their approval.  Hopefully they will get on 
side once the urgency of the matter is made clear to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another factor that I must make reference to and that 
is the Clinton factor.  The president is weakened because he is 
under investigation in a legitimate legal inquiry under the U.S. 
constitution.  At this time, in my party's opinion, it is 
important for our NATO allies to show solidarity more than ever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While U.S. leadership is essential, if Canada is assertive and 
plays its role as it should, the world will know that NATO 
continues to be history's finest example of collective security. 
And while the situation in Kosovo is certainly a humanitarian 
crisis, it is also a military situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bosnia showed that NATO was the only credible force Milosevic 
will respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time the foreign minister, who has no understanding of 
the world, is talking about Canada leading the way in calling for 
total nuclear disarmament, a policy that would have Canada 
expelled from NATO.  Now is the time for this government, this 
minister of defence to be serious about Canada and the world and 
live up to its good name. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada must play a role of responsibility.  It must understand 
that NATO is the one structure that can make a difference and it 
must take action with our allies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party will stand behind this government if this government 
stands behind its soldiers. 
<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, before I begin my remarks I would like 
to inform the House that I just returned from Greenwood, Nova 
Scotia from a memorial service for the victims of the tragic 
helicopter crash last Friday that took six lives.  I know all 
members, both present and not, would join me in expressing 
sympathy to the families of these brave Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sad events of last Friday serve to remind us of the 
contribution that is made by the men and women of the Canadian 
forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are times when international peace and security and 
respect for human rights are a threat and where action must be 
taken.  Canada has always considered these issues worthy of its 
concern. On occasion the Canadian forces have been called upon to 
be the instruments of our resolve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we face one of those moments today.  What is occurring 
in Kosovo represents a serious threat to international peace and 
stability and it undermines our most basic belief in the 
principle of human rights. For these reasons, I join with my 
colleague, the Minister of Foreign Affairs who spoke earlier, in 
endorsing Canadian participation in operations with our NATO 
allies, if such action is deemed necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian participation with our allies in Kosovo is in every way 
consistent with our traditional approach to international 
security threats and the protection of human rights. 
We have always been ready to join the international community in 
opposing threats to stability and to peace.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons, we are one of the founding members of 
NATO.  The men and women in the Canadian armed forces have been 
involved in NATO peacetime operations for over 50 years. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been engaged from day one.  If the alliance to which we 
belong becomes involved in an operation to promote peace and 
stability and restore human rights, Canada should play its part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This willingness to stand up and be counted reaches all the way 
back to the early days of Canadian statehood.  We went to Europe 
in 1914 to help return peace to that continent.  We returned in 
1939 to do so again.  In the early years of the cold war Canadian 
forces went to Korea to preserve the peace.  They did it for the 
same reasons that we twice fought in Europe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some six years after, Prime Minister Pearson gave the world a 
simple yet powerful idea, military forces of the international 
community should be used to maintain the peace between 
conflicting parties.  As history shows, the idea caught on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With few exceptions, the United Nations peacekeeping missions 
almost always involve the men and women of the Canadian forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For Canada, two of the fundamental tenets of our foreign and 
defence policies are rooted in the concept introduced by Mr. 
Pearson.  First, the promotion of international peace and 
stability is of paramount importance to Canada.  Second, the 
promotion of this stability is best undertaken collectively 
because it clearly demonstrates the will of the international 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these reasons Canada may be required from time to time to 
commit its military resources to protect deeply held Canadian 
interests and values, and our record of doing so speaks for 
itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must remember that Prime Minister Pearson's concept of 
peacekeeping was not limited to only providing troops when the 
fighting had stopped.  He clearly understood that military forces 
sometimes have to be employed not merely to monitor peace, but to 
create the conditions in which peace can be re-established. This 
decade alone has given us several examples of just such 
circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bosnia NATO has had to use selective force to bring about the 
conditions for peace and stability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait the international community 
had to employ its military resources again.  We were there with 
our allies.  We recently returned to the gulf to pressure Iraq to 
comply with the United Nations weapons inspections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case UN Secretary General Kofi Annan went to Iraq to try 
to secure the compliance of Saddam Hussein by diplomatic means. 
He was successful in doing so, but in his words from Baghdad at 
the end of the session, and they are worth reflecting on, he said 
“you can do a lot more with diplomacy when it is backed up with 
firmness and force”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has been an active player in the troubled region of the 
Balkans since 1991 when war broke out.  We participated first in 
the European Community monitoring mission and then with UNPROFOR 
from 1992 to 1995.  Over the years, thousands of members of the 
Canadian forces have made Canada's presence felt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada remains in Bosnia under SFOR as part of our longstanding 
commitment to security in this region.  Currently we have almost 
1,300 Canadian personnel in Bosnia-Hercegovina.  They are 
supported by a contingent of six CF-18s located in Aviano, Italy, 
whose role is to help enforce no-fly zones over Bosnia, and to 
participate in NATO led flight operations intended to demonstrate 
our resolve with respect to Kosovo.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last SFOR renewal debate held in the House, member after 
member stood up and agreed that Canada should do its part to 
preserve the peace brought about as a result of NATO's 
intervention in Bosnia.  We agreed that our work was not done in 
this important region of the world.  That was a good thing 
because our interest in Europe's stability is not merely 
altruistic.  Let us not forget that over 100,000 members who 
served in Canada's forces are buried in European soil.  They are 
the reminder of the importance we place on peace and stability in 
Europe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For several months in Kosovo we faced the problems of ethnic 
violence, ethnic cleansing and the displacement of thousands and 
thousands of refugees.  The cold blooded murder of innocent 
civilians has again confronted us in recent days.  The heavy hand 
of the Yugoslav authorities in dealing with the Kosovars is 
unacceptable.  We also deplore the abuses of the Kosovo 
liberation army, the UCK, and Kosovar Albanians must be pressured 
to participate in negotiations in good faith. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, diplomatic pressure may not be enough.  Earlier this 
year NATO aircraft were deployed to demonstrate our resolve in 
this matter.  We did this with the notion of diplomacy backed by 
force.  Canada augmented its longstanding contribution of troops 
to this European region by deploying six CF-18 aircraft. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Forces have the capability and the readiness to 
participate in NATO led operations should they be deemed 
necessary.  Our contribution to operations in the former 
Yugoslavia, our recent deployment into the Central African 
Republic and our recent deployment to the gulf clearly 
demonstrate that they are ready and they are capable. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally, Canada would prefer a diplomatic solution. 
Traditionally, we always appeal to reason and we have tried to 
restore peace without using force, without even the threat of 
using it. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not our tradition to retreat in the face of intransigence. 
Our freedom and our regard for the dignity of human beings of all 
ethnic and religious backgrounds mean little if we will not stand 
up for these principles when they are violated.  If necessary, 
Canada must be ready to act with our NATO allies. 
<P><A NAME="LINK238"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price (Compton—Stanstead, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
the minister says we will be ready but if there are NATO air 
strikes will we be actively participating?  If so, are we 
preparing our troops on the ground in other parts of Bosnia for 
the retaliation that will probably happen? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would have been nice before this debate had we had an 
all-party briefing to prepare us a little more.  That is what 
happened the last time and it would have appreciated if we could 
have had the same type of thing this time.  I hope we can expect 
that there will be briefings along the way as this file 
progresses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton:</B>  Madam Speaker, in terms of an 
all-party briefing, I remind the hon. member that events have 
moved very rapidly.  There has been every effort made.  My 
colleague, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, has spent a 
considerable amount of time trying to bring a diplomatic 
resolution to this matter.   He has recently been to the United 
Nations to try to bring that about.  That has been uppermost in 
this government's mind.  Every effort has been made to bring 
about a diplomatic resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time is now running out.  Winter is approaching.  There are 
people who have been displaced.  There are refugees who risk 
starvation, who risk freezing to death this coming winter.  So we 
have had to move very quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the issues involved here and the difficulties in getting 
security council support for further action if necessary had been 
part of the daily media coverage. 
I think we have a pretty good idea of what the issues are here. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2050"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT83"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT83"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 2050

<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This take note debate provides every opportunity to hear 
different opinions on our involvement and the precedent setting 
issues that could be involved here if there is no further 
resolution of the security council and if NATO makes the 
determination to take further action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If NATO decides to take further action, we have military assets 
in the area that could be made available subject to a decision of 
this government.  We are trying to get the input before we make 
the decision which is why we are here tonight.  We have six CF-18 
aircraft and a Hercules air refuelling aircraft that would be 
provided.  We have had discussions accordingly with the supreme 
allied commander in Europe with respect to that. Upon a final 
decision by this government and upon a final decision by the NATO 
those assets and the personnel involved would be made available 
as part of an operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said quite clearly in my remarks, if our NATO allies are 
going to go in there, if action has to be taken, if we cannot 
come to a diplomatic resolution, Canada expects to be there with 
its allies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as troops on the ground are concerned, that matter is 
under active consideration.  It would most likely be necessary 
but it has not yet been finalized.  The military authorities of 
NATO are examining the possibilities, the size, where the 
operations might take place on the ground.  I expect we will be 
asked to participate in that as well but that is still in the 
preliminary planning stage.  At this point two activation 
warnings have been given by NATO.  Both relate to the possibility 
of a limited air option, a limited air strike.  The other is a 
phased air campaign.  If the first one does not work then there 
is the possibility of an ever accelerating air campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reiterate our hope that a diplomatic resolution can be found 
but we know the history in terms of Mr. Milosevic with respect to 
Bosnia.  We know that air strikes worked there to bring him to 
the table.  As the hon. member indicated a few moments ago, that 
led to the Dayton accord.  If we have to use these means to bring 
him to the table then, subject to the decision of this government 
and the decision of NATO, those resources would be made available 
to do so. 
<P><A NAME="LINK239"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I begin by thanking the Minister of National Defence and 
the Minister of Foreign Affairs for their comments this evening. 
For the record I support the positions they have stated.  I 
support the use of military intervention. As the minister stated 
and as somebody said earlier, the only thing Mr. Milosevic 
understands is being clubbed over the head. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will add a few comments and some concerns.  I understand it is 
very difficult to get the permission of the UN security council. 
As we know, there are some vetoes likely to be used by Russia and 
China.  They may proceed under a current security council 
resolution or they may end up proceeding under NATO but we will 
have to let that take its course.  I support Canada's involvement 
there and the use of Canada's military.  We have a role to play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Someone's first question might be why should Canada be there. We 
have to state from the outset that we have seen the slaughter of 
thousands and thousands of innocent individuals.  We have seen 
something in the magnitude of 250,000 to 300,000 people driven 
from their homes.  We have seen entire communities burned. This 
is clearly not acceptable to a civilized nation such as ours.  I 
believe we have a duty to intervene. 
I do not know if words can describe how bad it is over there.  I 
came back from the Canada-Europe parliamentary meetings in 
Strasbourg.  This was an emergency debate over there.  I had an 
opportunity to speak to many of my colleagues from the European 
Community.  They also expressed exactly what I have stated in 
this House. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2055"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the feeling I had after speaking to some of these 
people.  I will read a few sentences from an article written by 
Gwynne Dyer on October 4 of this year, very current.  It will set 
the tone.  I cannot go very far into it because it becomes 
unacceptable to read it in the House: “They stripped one woman 
and cut off her ears, nose and fingers, said a farmer who watched 
from a hiding as the Serbian police massacred 18 members of the 
family ranging from 18 months to 95 years old”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could not go on reading because it gets worse and worse.  It 
makes my stomach turn to realize that this is what is happening 
over there, that Mr. Milosevic has ordered his officials to carry 
out these types of tasks. They burned out entire villages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard the foreign affairs critic for the official 
opposition talk about his observations driving down the roads and 
seeing grave after grave and entire villages burnt out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe Canada has a duty to participate.  This type of ethnic 
cleansing is equal to what we have seen and heard of the 
Holocaust in World War II.  It is not acceptable.  I think Mr. 
Milosevic has had ample opportunity to comply with current UN 
security resolutions and he has elected not to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have the same optimism and I may be mischaracterizing 
the minister of defence when he says our goal is for a peaceful 
resolution.  I honestly believe he does wish we could achieve 
that.  However, I do not think that is possible with this man we 
are dealing with.  He may even agree with that.  I think Canada 
and the rest of the world have been more than patient with Mr. 
Milosevic and we now must act as the slaughter of innocent people 
by the thousands is clearly not acceptable anywhere in the world 
now or at any other time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us assume we are going to proceed. I support that whether it 
is under NATO or whether we get a UN security agreement or we 
have to proceed under an existing one.  What happens next?  We 
know there are hundreds of thousands of these families and people 
who have been driven to the hills.  As the minister has correctly 
stated, winter is fast approaching; 300,000 people left 
shelterless and homeless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we also have to be prepared as a nation to make a 
commitment, whether it is the UN or NATO.  That has to be 
followed up after.  Yes, the air strikes have to happen.  I am 
not even so sure that we want to bring Milosevic back to the 
table or we just want to find some place where we can put him. I 
am not sure whether we can reason with a man like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess the point I am emphasizing is that we as a nation have 
to make a long term commitment to ensure that what actions we 
carry out now are not temporary, that there is an overall plan, a 
goal we have to achieve.  It is a very difficult situation.  The 
Serbs are not prepared to give up the province of Kosovo for all 
kinds of reasons.  Yet it is 90% Albanian. 
I think we are there for the long haul and hopefully part of a UN 
force that will be present to ensure the safety of these 
individuals.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Hopefully this region could become a republic separate from 
Serbia.  That may be argued against by some of my colleagues.  We 
have had a very interesting debate.  Some of them do not think 
that is achievable, that in the long term it could not become an 
independent republic but would have to remain a part of Serbia, 
with autonomy, as it did prior to 1990. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are fascinating debates when we look at all the details. 
However, at the end of the day I would like to offer my 
encouragement to both ministers who were present tonight.  I hope 
there will be a long term commitment on the part of Canada.  I am 
very pleased to be a part of this debate and to see that 
everybody is focused on the crisis in Kosovo and looking toward a 
solution in the near future. 
<P><A NAME="LINK240"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the 
government's motion tonight is timely, appropriate and sound. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each member who has spoken before me has supported the motion of 
the foreign affairs minister in his call to resolve the conflict, 
promote a political settlement for Kosovo and facilitate the 
provision of humanitarian assistance to refugees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Kosovo we face a very complex situation for historic and 
symbolic reasons.  It was here I learned that in 1389 the Serbs 
fought their battle of the Kosovo polie; namely, the field of 
Kosovo battle against the Turks.  It was in Kosovo that the 
church of Serbia was born.  It is here we find the symbolic 
values the Serbs attribute to Kosovo, to their religious ground, 
virtually their holy land or the equivalent of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, against this background it must also be said that 
although the Serbs pretend to be civilized members of the world 
community, they have failed miserably to prove themselves.  For 
weeks and months now we have witnessed a situation to which we 
cannot remain indifferent despite the distances and the ocean 
between Europe and us.  The suffering is immense, the atrocities 
unbearable and the crimes unforgivable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of the human species we must resolve this conflict 
and find ways to resolve it soon.  We must push for a political 
settlement.  We must provide humanitarian assistance to the 
300,000 displaced people and the 30,000 refugees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several speakers have referred to a NATO intervention.  I hope 
we will not be so naive as to believe that NATO air attacks will 
solve the problem.  They will only strengthen the already rigid 
and unbearable position taken by the Serbs.  Instead, NATO ground 
forces to protect the entire civilian population would represent 
the first necessary step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that context let us have no elusion.  The presence of troops 
to protect the population may be required for years.  Kosovo 
could turn out to be another Cypress and the presence of troops, 
be they NATO or the United Nations, may be necessary for many 
decades to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Council of Europe, where this parliament has, through the 
Canada-Europe Parliamentary Association, observer status, 
produced a political report prepared by Andras Bargony of 
Hungary.  It is entitled “Crisis in Kosovo and the situation in 
the federal Republic of Yugoslavia”.  The recommendations of the 
report, adopted two weeks ago by the Assembly of the Council of 
Europe, include the following elements considered as essential by 
European parliamentarians in reaching a lasting peaceful solution 
to the crisis. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2105"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT86"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT86"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 2105

<A HREF="#LINKT85"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first element is to guarantee the security of all people 
living in Kosovo, to be achieved through the withdrawal of the 
Serbian security forces, the disarmament of armed groups of 
ethnic Albanians and the deployment of an international peace 
force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second is to give a new political status to Kosovo based on 
a high level of autonomy within the Yugoslav federation, based on 
the prerogatives the province enjoyed according to the 1974 
constitution of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, 
adapted of course to the new situation and, where necessary, 
enlarged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thirdly, such status would include the highest possible form of 
self-government for Kosovo in lawmaking, the executive, the 
judiciary, public order, economy, education and culture with 
respect to the rights of Serbs and other minorities living in 
Kosovo, and finally the direct participation of Kosovo 
representatives in federal institutions and also through the 
adoption of democratic reforms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth element is to give international guarantees, ensuring 
respect for the future agreement and preventing any attempts to 
return to the status quo or to secede. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final element is to introduce democratic reforms implemented 
through the federal Republic of Yugoslavia, guaranteeing full 
compliance with the Council of Europe standards concerning the 
functioning of a democratic political system, the rule of law and 
the protection of human rights and the rights of national 
minorities, notably in Kosovo, in Vojvodina and in Sanjak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that these are very sensible proposals made by 
the Council of Europe, by the assembly and by our European 
colleagues.  The assembly also considered that in the absence of 
a clear and unequivocal position of the international community 
the political and military pressure exerted on the two sides to 
engage in negotiations would remain largely unaffected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, it would seem that a clear and unequivocal position 
of the international community is urgently needed.  The future 
status of Kosovo must be placed at the top of the international 
agenda.  That is quite clear now.  The participation of all 
interested parties, governments and relevant international bodies 
is essential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that everyone will agree tonight that we must not fail 
the people of Kosovo.  We must prove that the international 
community can intervene in the name of humanity.  It is high time 
that we do so.

House are peacefully discussing international problems, as we 
speak freely, in peace, in confidence, in the respect of our 
institutions and in the safety of our own homes, in another part 
of the world people are dying, being martyred and abused, 
watching their children being raped and their families being 
separated, without a flicker of hope that this conflict will be 
quickly settled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In another part of the world, people want autonomy so they may 
be their own leaders and control their own institutions. 
A bloodthirsty president, who does not share their opinions, is 
making them suffer and depriving them of their dignity.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, we are wondering what we could or should do to help the 
people of Kosovo, these Albanian-speaking people who are being 
victimized. Last winter, serious situations were experienced in 
some parts of Canada and Quebec, which warranted a humanitarian 
operation. The people who had to leave their homes temporarily 
and relocate away from their familiar surroundings were finding 
themselves in need of assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back then, if we had known of any means of stopping the wind, 
the rain, the storm and the ice, all the people of Quebec and of 
Canada would have agreed that that means ought to be used to 
halt the force of nature, whose effects become devastating when 
spread over a period of days or weeks.  All would have agreed 
that everything should be done to spare a few children and 
families a disagreeable situation lasting a few weeks, one which 
did not endanger their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we spared no effort in trying to limit the ravages of nature 
in our own country, how could we not agree today that the 
Government of Canada should take the necessary action to help 
people who are 100, 1,000 times worse off than we were? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our floods and our ice storm pale in comparison with what is now 
going on in Yugoslavia, in Kosovo.  It is not just the lives of 
these particular people that will be marked, but the lives of 
several generations to come.  We have the means of helping to 
resolve this situation quickly.  Perhaps we have even delayed 
too long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is moving that action be taken because it is 
clear that diplomatic efforts have failed.  But while our 
diplomats were talking, people were being driven out of their 
villages and homes.  They were being forced to take refuge in 
the mountains and the forests, sometimes without their children. 
Sometimes, it was the children who had to flee, who sought 
shelter because they no longer had any parents.  Some of these 
fleeing children were even missing limbs.  They were orphans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we could experience, even for half a day, the horrors of 
being victims of domination, we would not need a full evening's 
debate in the House of Commons to decide that Quebeckers and 
Canadians are in agreement on going to the assistance of a 
population that is the victim of a cold-blooded adversary once 
again, one who has not yet been made to heed the voice of 
reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I myself would not subscribe to the policy of an eye for an eye, 
a tooth for a tooth, but what we are dealing with here is not 
attacking someone we do not like, but preventing an attacker 
from continuing his inhumane actions against defenceless 
populations.

<A HREF="#LINKT87"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea is to give these helpless people the means to protect 
themselves against a ruthless aggressor. It is not a case of “an 
eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth”, but a matter of 
self-defence. It is a case of protecting oneself against an 
invader that will simply not listen to reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the pressure exerted by the international community was not 
enough to make Mr. Milosevic realize that his action is 
condemned almost everywhere in the world, except for a few 
countries that have not clearly expressed their disapproval. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada must not hesitate. We must offer our modest contribution. 
We are not, of course, as powerful as the United States, but we 
are a country whose military capability and humanitarian 
intervention forces are well developed and can enable us to 
fulfil our role in the world, our obligations to other 
countries, and our commitment to provide humanitarian 
assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must now do for others what we would like others to do for us 
in one, five, ten or twenty years should the Canadian or Quebec 
people be attacked by dictators of that type, who might decide 
to rule over people who decided some day to have their own 
government and institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everything has been taken from these people, including their 
institutions, their right to practice a religion, their 
universities, their newspapers, their radio stations, their 
means of expression, their means of being themselves. 
Such is the justification of the bloodthirsty dictator who wants 
to subdue these people. This is why he is pursuing these people 
into their homes, and even into their bedrooms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a barbaric act. It is an unacceptable action which 
Canada must not condone. I am convinced our country must take 
the necessary measures advocated in today's motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure all Canadians and Quebeckers will agree that our 
officials should act so as to put an end to this massacre and 
restore peace in Kosovo. 
<P><A NAME="LINK242"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is an honour for me 
to rise in this House today in support of Canada's participation 
in a possible NATO operation in Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many excellent reasons for Canada to participate in 
such an operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, like the rest of the international 
community, Canada is very concerned about the climate of 
violence and human rights violation that continue to prevail in 
Kosovo. We have been appalled by the recent massacre of 14 
civilians. We are holding the Yugoslav leadership and President 
Milosevic in particular, directly responsible for the current 
situation in Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Yugoslav republic's failure to co-operate with the 
International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia 
constitutes a serious breach of its international obligations. 
The number of displaced persons, that is those brutally forced 
out of their homes, has already exceeded 280,000.

<A HREF="#LINKT88"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our country, with its long and proud tradition of promoting 
respect for human life and human dignity throughout the world, 
cannot remain indifferent to such abuses, such atrocities.  The 
time has come for action in Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, as loyal members of NATO, we feel we are duty-bound to 
continue to unreservedly support the efforts of our allies and 
the international community to prevent a catastrophe in this 
region that has suffered so much already. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, such participation would be in keeping with our 
commitment to the principle of collective security. 
It would be in line with our foreign and defence policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, this participation would constitute a logical extension 
of our prior commitments in the Balkans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, since 1991 we have been involved in the efforts by the 
international community to put an end to the violence and the 
taking of innocent lives, and to restore peace to this region, 
within either the UN or NATO.  Since the signature of the Dayton 
agreement, we have been playing a vital role in the measures 
taken by NATO in restoring stability to Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time, we have six CF-18s stationed at Aviano, 
Italy, where they are backing up the ground element of the 
Bosnia stabilization force. 
These aircraft take part in the effort to enforce NATO's no-fly 
zone over these territories and in a NATO partnership for peace 
exercises in this region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Resolution 1199 passed by the United Nations security council on 
September 23 shows how seriously the world community takes this 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada calls upon the warring parties to fulfil their 
obligations under this resolution and especially, pursuant to 
the ceasefire agreement, to take measures to bring the 
humanitarian crisis to an end and to come to a peaceful 
solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>NATO is developing plans for various possible operations in 
Kosovo. 
It has started to take stock of all the resources its member 
states could provide if it was decided to launch a military 
operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the alliance have yet to decide if they are going to 
take military action in Kosovo. However, should NATO decide in 
favour of military action, Canada should take part in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two main reasons why I wholeheartedly support Canada's 
participation in possible NATO action in Kosovo. First, I have 
personally been witness to the horrors hidden behind the 
antiseptic term “ethnic cleansing”. Also, I was able to see with 
my own eyes the positive impact of the presence of Canadian 
troops in Bosnia and the remarkable work done by our forces 
through NATO's stabilization force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the chair of the Standing Committee on National Defence and 
Veterans Affairs, I had, last November, the honour of heading a 
delegation of eight members of the defence and foreign affairs 
committees visiting Bosnia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw how Canada helped implement policies to establish peace 
in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Peace was maintained through our 
military involvement in the stabilization force under NATO. 
We visited reconstruction projects carried out with the help of 
Canadian NGOs and the Canadian armed forces.

<A HREF="#LINKT89"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to digress a moment to remind my colleagues that 
Canada's participation in the region continues.  In fact, since 
March, Canada has contributed $430,000 to UNICEF emergency 
measures, $435,000 to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and 
$400,000 to the Red Cross for aid to refugees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During our fact-finding trip in November of last year, we 
witnessed democratization initiatives being undertaken with the 
co-operation of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and 
Development, the international police group and many more 
organizations. Judging from all we have seen there, we have 
concluded that considerable progress had been made in Bosnia 
since the Dayton accord. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been proud to hear and see for ourselves that Canada has 
played a major role in the military and civilian aspects of the 
peace accord, and members of our group unanimously concluded 
that Canada should continue to take part in this international 
initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all the places we visited, we felt a deep emotion and pride 
when we heard people tell use repeatedly how important our 
presence was. 
They also asked us to thank Canadians for their contribution and 
their efforts to help them rebuild their country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During that November trip, my colleagues and I saw for ourselves 
the horrible destruction brought about by ethnic cleansing. 
Ruins could be seen throughout the countryside. In every village 
we visited, we could see houses that had been destroyed by 
bombardments during the war and other houses that had been 
destroyed to make it impossible for their occupants to return 
home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we first arrived in Bosnia, one of our first briefing 
sessions dealt with the use of land mines as a means of ethnic 
cleansing. We were told to stay on the paved portion of the 
roads and to avoid walking in the grass around the villages. 
We were told that, for years, the fields had not been planted 
with crops but with mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were told that in Bosnia there were still probably a million 
mines left.  Brief though our visit was, we were horrified by 
this constant, invisible and insidious threat.  We could not 
imagine how the local people had, for years, been able to live 
in such an atmosphere, knowing that death or mutilation awaited 
them or their children at every turn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is difficult to describe the horror of such an experience, 
difficult to understand the hatred that drives neighbours who, 
the day before, were friends to kill each other, difficult to 
understand the extent of the violence of which humanity is 
capable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore urge my colleagues to approve Canada's participation 
in any NATO action in Kosovo.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure today to speak in this debate on 
Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been here before.  When I was first elected in 1993 I 
remember a debate in the House on the same conflict.  What the 
intervening five years have proven is that we have learned 
nothing. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2130"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT90"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While over the last nine months Albanians in Kosovo have been 
slaughtered, murdered, mutilated and raped, we in the 
international community have wrung our hands, pointed fingers and 
done nothing. This has happened time and time again. The last 
five years have proven that we have learned no lessons 
whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to Kosovo, in 1989 Slobodan Milosevic came to power 
with a promise to rid Kosovo of its 93% ethnic Albanian 
population.  This was a promise he made and true to his word he 
has been engaging in the process of ethnic and cultural genocide 
of the people there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First he started to close down the schools, then he threw 
Albanians out of jobs.  What are they supposed to do?  They 
started the Kosovo Liberation Army to try to defend their people. 
They were successful initially but they have been losing quite 
badly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we speak, 250,000 innocent civilians have been displaced and 
50,000 innocent Albanian people from Kosovo are in the forests 
freezing, starving and sick.  Some have been subjected to some of 
the worst atrocities any of us could possibly imagine.  And we 
still sit on our hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is remarkable that as we stand here today trying to decide 
what we are going to do, for months people have been slaughtered. 
We have only one option in the face of a despot like Milosevic. 
That is to bomb.  He understands one thing and one thing only and 
that unfortunately is force.  I am certain that is not what his 
people want but he, a man of shrewd political and ruthless means, 
wants to do that.  He will understand nothing but force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have tried diplomatic initiatives time and time again and 
they have been completely fruitless.  He has played games with 
us.  He has teased us with the hope that he will negotiate rather 
than fight, but this is only temporary and he goes back and 
continues the onslaught.  No more. There are some solutions that 
would solve the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One, Milosevic has been given the ultimatum.  We know from 
Secretary General Annan that he is not withdrawing his troops and 
we must bomb.  We must bomb hard military targets, hard military 
Serbian targets within Kosovo and move into greater Serbia if 
necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two, we have to ensure that in the future, after that is done, 
there will be a continued reinforcement of the blockade around 
Serbia.  Right now it is a joke.  The Russians and the Greeks are 
providing arms and cash, and military hardware to the Serbs, 
thereby fueling this problem.  The Russians want a foot in the 
Balkans. That blockade has to be strengthened if we are going to 
meet success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three, the legitimate concerns of the Serbian people have to be 
met.  Kosovo is to the Serbs what Jerusalem is to the Jews.  The 
Field of Black Birds is a very important symbol for them. 
Unfortunately it is a negative symbol for them but it is an 
important one and one that must be respected. It is a shrine for 
the Serbian people. They must be allowed free and unfettered 
access to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not support an independent country called Kosovo.  If we 
were to support the pre-1989 situation when Kosovo was an 
autonomous state, then I think we would find a reasonable 
compromise which would enable the Albanians in Kosovo to live 
peacefully and would enable the Serbs and the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia to have free access to those shrines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we do this, a compromise can be made.  However, the 
compromise is being made much more difficult by the actions of 
President Milosevic.  Through his genocidal actions he is 
polarizing communities and laying the seeds of future violent 
ethnic discontent for years to come. Unfortunately this tragic 
situation will bubble up again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard some discussions today about intervention.  It has 
been proven over the last several decades that the world has been 
unable or unwilling to deal with conflicts when they occur and 
only get involved after a huge loss of lives has taken place. 
From Rwanda to Chechnya, to Cambodia, to the Sudan and to others, 
the world has sat on its hands while innocent civilians have been 
slaughtered.

<A HREF="#LINKT91"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why international law respects, acknowledges and 
supports intervention by outside powers within the borders of a 
country if gross human rights abuses are taking place.  The 
reason it supports that is that although we support the integrity 
of a nation state, international law respects the integrity and 
safety of people over and above the nation state. In other words, 
a despot cannot abuse people and expect to go away unscathed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We collectively have a responsibility to protect people not only 
on humanitarian grounds but also for very pragmatic reasons. What 
happens in a conflict half a world away winds up on our own 
doorstep through increasing demands on our defence budgets, aid 
budgets and our social programs domestically as people migrate 
away from an ethnic conflict and wind up as refugees on our 
shores. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>International law respects and supports intervention.  The proof 
in the pudding is when we look at who pays the price. Civilians 
pay the price.  It was not always that way.  In World War I 85% 
of the casualties were soldiers. Wars took place between nation 
states.  In World War II 60% were soldiers. Today 85% of the 
penalties that are paid in blood, in death and in rape are paid 
for by innocent unarmed men, women and children.  The civilian 
population pays the price in conflicts that are by and large 
ethnic conflicts within the boundaries of a country.  They 
generally are not wars between nation states. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need political will.  We need a spine, we need guts and we 
need courage. I and my colleagues do not want to stand here five 
years from now on a debate about another group of people who have 
been murdered and slaughtered while we sat around waiting for 
somebody to go first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada with its enormous diplomatic ability and international 
respect can work with other nation states to pull them together. 
I introduced a private members' motion last year asking the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs to bring together like-minded nations 
to have a common foreign policy in certain areas and particularly 
the area of conflict prevention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very happy to see that the Minister of Foreign Affairs 
signed a treaty with Norway.  We need to expand this treaty with 
other like-minded nations such as New Zealand, Australia, South 
Africa, Sweden, Finland and Costa Rica for starters. There are 
others.  We should bring them together maybe in Ottawa to discuss 
a common foreign policy for certain areas.  We should have a 
common focus in a certain part of our foreign policy that deals 
with one thing, conflict prevention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Early intervention by identifying the precursors to conflict and 
having the tools to address them are essential.  We should first 
start with non-military means and then work up to military means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was disappointed earlier today.  I introduced a private 
members' motion asking the House of Commons to call on the United 
Nations to indict Slobodan Milosevic for war crimes and to allow 
the UNHCR and NGOs free and unfettered access to the refugees in 
and around Kosovo.  I was deeply saddened that the House did not 
give unanimous consent. I hope the government will take heed of 
that motion and adopt it as soon as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad we had this debate.  We must remember that in the 
future we cannot allow this genocide in Kosovo or in other 
country to continue.  We must work early and preventatively 
because the lives of hundreds of thousands of innocent men, women 
and children are at stake. 
<P><A NAME="LINK244"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre—Rosedale, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member for 
Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca for his positive contribution to the 
debate and his usual insightful observations about the situation 
we have to talk about tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been listening to the debate tonight and, if I may say, I 
have been impressed with the change in the attitude of the Reform 
Party.  In earlier debates we had on Bosnia and other issues 
there was a great deal of reticence about the engagement of 
Canada. 
I now notice that the party of which the member is a prominent 
member is much more active in recognizing the engagement of 
Canada in the world and our necessity to participate.

<A HREF="#LINKT92"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened carefully to the words of the member of parliament 
for Red Deer who represents the member's party as its foreign 
affairs spokesman.  I noticed perhaps a slight nuance between the 
member who just spoke and the member for Red Deer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I felt that the member for Red Deer was saying that if we act 
without the sanction of the United Nations Security Council, 
which as the foreign minister clearly indicated is probably 
unlikely because of the position both of Russia and possibly of 
China, that will cause a great deal of problems for us and for 
the United Nations in the long run. The member himself was much 
more aggressive in saying that we must act and we must act now if 
we are to answer to the humanitarian requirements of this 
terrible situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can he help us with his view as to how he believes this will 
impact on the relationship between Canada and the United Nations 
and other countries in the region if NATO moves in a somewhat 
more ambiguous area than one that would be given the comfort of a 
cover of a firm security council resolution? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank my hon. 
colleague and friend from the government, the talented chairman 
of the House standing committee on foreign affairs.  His question 
is an excellent one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He points to the first thing that I think we all desire, which 
is support from the United Nations.  We have a larger commitment 
here and a larger rationale for involvement:  the humanitarian 
reasons that many members in the House articulated earlier today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like to have the UN involved, but if it is not 
involved, NATO certainly has the power and the ability to do 
that.  The justification comes within the confines of 
international law which supports intervention in environments 
where gross human rights abuses are clearly taking place and in 
this case where genocide is occurring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think NATO has a responsibility.  Although as the hon. member 
mentioned it is slightly out of its purview, NATO is largely 
responsible for a good segment of the security of Europe. If the 
situation in Kosovo expands, the expanding conflict would involve 
Montenegro, Greece, Russia and other nation states in the 
surrounding area.  All those nation states could be involved in 
the larger conflagration.  If that happened, the world simply 
could not turn a blind eye. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the larger scheme of things, in an effort to prevent more 
bloodshed and in an effort to save more lives, while NATO would 
like to have the UN's tacit involvement, it should go ahead 
regardless because I think a larger principle is involved. It 
would add a lot more credibility to the United Nations in its 
ability to act early to intervene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to Bosnia, we were far too late in intervening. As 
a result, 250,000 people were killed and the countryside was laid 
to waste for generations to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is any lesson to be learned from recent history, we 
should look at Bosnia and see the abysmal failure of NATO.  If it 
moves a little further along within the confines of international 
law to act where it is appropriate, then I think it will be 
justified in the long term not only within the nation states that 
participate but also history will take a favourable view to the 
intervention. 
<P><A NAME="LINK245"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre—Rosedale, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this important 
debate this evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to recognize the tremendous unanimity of views 
in the House tonight, faced as we are and watching as we do the 
tremendous destruction and the devastation of the livelihood of 
innocent people who live in Kosovo.  We have now been watching 
this for more than a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The humanitarian situation in Kosovo is disastrous with hundreds 
of thousands of displaced people and refugees, some of whom lack 
basic shelter and basic necessity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the most shocking is that many of the problems are the 
direct result of the due actions of the Yugoslav government which 
itself is charged with the basic responsibility of its own 
people, its own citizens in that area. 
It is clear we are watching the war of a government on its own 
citizens, determined to drive them into the country, determined 
to drive them into the ground.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation of violence and oppression is creating a 
humanitarian situation of enormous proportions.  Some 290,000 
people have been displaced as a result of the conflict in Kosovo. 
I come from a city of 3.5 million people.  If we had 300,000 
people displaced in the city of Toronto, imagine how we would 
cope with that tremendous problem.  We are having problems coping 
with homelessness, with disease and with other issues within our 
own communities now.  How would we cope with the enormity of that 
disaster? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those who go back to the Quebec ice storm, think of what it 
would be in terms of humanitarian tragedy if the people the ice 
storm struck had nowhere to go, nowhere to return, and were going 
back to bombed houses, totally destroyed places.  This is the 
type of life that the people in Kosovo are living at the behest 
of their own government.  This is the terrifying aspect.  Winter 
approaches.  Some 50,000 people, children and elderly, are 
without shelter and afraid to return to the remains of their 
homes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We watch the situation on television.  We read about it in the 
newspapers but we have little firsthand experience.  This evening 
in the House we heard from the Reform member for Red Deer.  He 
spoke of when he travelled to Bosnia.  I can echo that.  We have 
some experience with it, as does the Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of National Defence.  We travelled to Bosnia.  We have 
been there.  We have seen devastation in those areas.  The same 
is now taking place in Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a difference between what is taking place in Kosovo 
today and what is taking place in Bosnia today.  That difference 
is the fact that in Bosnia some years ago NATO chose to act.  We 
acted with efficiency.  We finally were pushed into the situation 
where we had to do something.  We did it.  Today, while we have 
to live with the tremendous situation the member for Red Deer 
described, to some extent we are seeing a situation where peace, 
security and civil society are returning.  Farmers can till their 
fields.  Children can play.  Birds can sing again.  There is a 
chance for life, which does not exist in Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is there that difference?  The difference is, as the 
minister pointed out in his opening statement, the Yugoslav 
authorities have a plan to terrorize their own population.  That 
plan is succeeding for one reason and one reason only.  It is 
that there is no credible threat from the international community 
that will stop them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Stopping them with resolutions was proven in the Bosnia 
situation not to be successful.  Words are good in parliaments. 
They are a part of our work.  However words will not deal with 
Slobodan Milosevic.  We learned that in Bosnia.  He will only be 
stopped by actions.  That was our experience.  There is no reason 
it would not apply here as it applied in Bosnia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The need to act is clear.  All members in the House that I heard 
speak tonight have echoed that.  How to act, however, is less 
clear.  There will be debate and there will be reasonable 
discussions about how we should act.  We know, as the member from 
Esquimalt and many others have pointed out, that NATO has the 
capacity to act.  The question we must ask ourselves is a 
reasonable one.  What is the legal authority by which NATO will 
act?  If we act without legal authority that is an issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the privilege of attending the debates of the Organization 
for Security and Co-operation in Europe, in Copenhagen this 
summer.  We debated a resolution on Kosovo.  A strong debate took 
place between those of us who wanted to ensure there would be a 
capacity to act and those who were more determined that whatever 
action would be taken would be taken under legal authority.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eventually the OSCE adopted a resolution which provided that 
military measures should be taken in Kosovo with the explicit 
endorsement of a relevant UN security council resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I opposed that aspect of the resolution when it came up in the 
OSCE assembly.  I would oppose the same approach we are taking 
tonight.  The foreign minister addressed the reason in his 
remarks.  If we depend upon a clear security council resolution 
with Russian and Chinese approval, there is a serious chance it 
just will not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Red Deer put that in context tonight.  We have to 
look at that as members of parliament who believe in a world 
society which is governed more and more by the rule of law.  The 
very humanitarian principles we seek to apply tonight are those 
that create the sense of the world law to which we want to adhere 
if we are to have a rule of law we can all live within. It would 
be similar to the rule of law those of us in the House adhere to, 
wish to adhere to, and wish to build in a world community in the 
same way we have in our wonderful Canadian society.  We must be 
aware of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the security council resolution is important and may put 
the UN authority in jeopardy if we act without it, we have to 
face the fact that if we allow the UN security council issue to 
prevent us from acting the UN will lose its authority in the 
world.  It will be eroded to such a point that it will become 
irrelevant for all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe my view echoes that of most members who have spoken 
tonight.  We must prepare to act.  It must be a preparation that 
is credible and determined.  It is only this credible and 
determined action and the ability to deliver it that will provide 
the Yugoslav authorities with a reason to back down.  Only that 
will bring them to the table.  Only that will force them to act. 
If not, we will see this situation drag on.  We will see problems 
develop in the region that will be worse than those if we do not 
act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I met with the Macedonian ambassador today.  He told me not to 
be hasty in this matter.  He said that they would be ineffective 
if precipitous NATO action was taken.  I asked him what would 
happen if this situation were to drag on for another year, what 
would happen to the communities and societies living on the 
border of this untenable situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the situation will be.  It will drag on for years. 
We will not see 200,000 refugees; we will see 400,000 refugees. 
Inevitably people will be dragged into the situation.  If we do 
not act now, the worst thing that will happen is that we will 
have to act a year from now when thousands of lives will have 
been lost and the situation will be much worse.  It is always 
that way.  We are forced to act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must deal with Russia's reaction, with Turkey and with 
Greece.  All of this is true.  The risk of not acting is worse 
than the threat of acting.  We must act if we are to preserve the 
moral authority of our situation in a world where we must 
preserve humanitarian rights in the face of the determination of 
states to deny rights to their own citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read a little history as I prepared for my speech tonight. 
Count Bismarck who subsequently became Prince Bismarck, the 
chancellor of the German Empire as it was then, said in 1890 “If 
there is another war in Europe it will come out of some damned 
silly thing in the Balkans”.  This is not a damned silly thing 
we are talking about tonight.  This is a human tragedy.  We are 
on the threshold of the 21st century and nothing has changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We owe it to ourselves to act as parliamentarians and as 
citizens of the world to make a change.  Let us pledge in the 
House tonight that we will act together to make a change.  Let us 
pledge that we will keep the spirit of the House tonight in which 
all members are saying that we must act.  Let us encourage our 
government to be positive, to act and to end the humanitarian 
tragedy that we are facing.  If we do not act today we will act 
in the future and it will be worse.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I value the comments of the hon. member for Toronto 
Centre—Rosedale.  They are always highly intelligent and highly 
constructive.  I would like to pose a few questions and some 
challenges to him as chairman of the Standing Committee on 
Foreign Affairs because he wields significant power on the other 
side in the area of foreign affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As he correctly and eloquently said, the problem has been 
inaction.  Since 1890 until now we have seen inaction in the face 
of gross human rights abuses.  There are solutions.  The 
solutions require changing the way in which we think of conflict 
and changing the way in which we deal with conflict.  Essentially 
it boils down to conflict prevention and how we identify the 
precursors to conflict and the actions necessary to deal with 
those conflicts.  I suggest we start out with non-military 
intervention, particularly economic intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the hon. member, in his capacity as chairman of the 
committee of foreign affairs, submit to the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs the following? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we should convene like-minded nations in Ottawa to 
develop a concerted, united effort to deal with conflict 
prevention in whichever forum we happen to be in, be it the 
United Nations, OSCE, OAU, OAS or whatever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will he work behind the scenes to support the private member's 
motion I put forth on that idea and Motion No. 477 that I put 
forth today to have our country present to the United Nations a 
proposal to indict Slobodan Milosevic for crimes against humanity 
and to ensure that refugees in the region around Kosovo will have 
free access to representatives of the United Nations High 
Commission for Refugees and other humanitarian NGOs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Graham:</B>  Madam Speaker, as usual, the member for 
Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca has a way of being able to put the 
challenge right on the table. I cannot pick up that challenge in 
every respect, but I can certainly say that I will take the 
issues he has referred to, to the steering committee of the 
foreign affairs committee, particularly a recommendation for the 
indictment of Mr. Milosevic.  His party is represented 
excellently by the member for Red Deer and the member himself is 
an associate member of our committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the opportunity on the weekend to meet with Madam Arbour, 
our representative in Brussels.  She is doing a wonderful job as 
a Canadian representative on the War Crimes Tribunal.  We will 
raise that issue with her.  We have seen Canadians rally together 
around such issues.  We saw the tremendous support for Canada 
from other nations on the land mines issue.  There is an 
opportunity to bring like-minded countries together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the member will give credit to the foreign affairs 
minister who has been very active on these files.  Our foreign 
affairs minister is not a quiet person.  He is an activist as we 
know from the land mines debate.  I can be confident that he is 
doing everything to deal with the situation and to bring 
like-minded states together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary is in the House tonight and will be 
speaking to the motion.  He is also active on this file and is 
trying to deal with like-minded nations.  I am sure that he will 
be able to speak to this issue when he rises shortly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our committee we will do our best to respond to all the 
suggestions of the member, largely because this is an issue which 
is bringing us together.  We can work together in an all party 
way to try to resolve a humanitarian issue.  Canadians can bring 
a special quality to bear on this debate on the world stage.  I 
thank the member for his questions. 
<P><A NAME="LINK247"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, in listening to the 
exchanges that have taken place tonight, it is an honour to be 
part of this debate. 
Sometimes when we face crises and are able to put aside the 
partisan differences in the House it rises to a new level.  It is 
a privilege to participate in this brief time.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the things I will say will perhaps be a repetition of 
what has already been said tonight, but I believe they are worth 
saying and emphasizing.  Since March of this year the security 
forces of the federal republic of Yugoslavia have been waging a 
brutal campaign of violence and repetition against the civilian 
population of Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Yugoslav government has argued consistently that its 
actions have been directed solely against the armed Albanian 
separatists of Kosovo, the security forces have undertaken a 
consistent strategy of destroying villages, burning and looting 
homes and directly targeting innocent civilians.  Numerous 
reports, including those made by the Canadian team working in the 
Kosovo diplomatic observer mission, have documented the abuses of 
the security forces.  It is obvious that grave breaches of 
international humanitarian law, human rights standards and the 
law of armed conflict have taken place.  While the world 
recognizes a sovereign state's right to defend itself against 
armed insurrection, the actions of the Yugoslav government in 
Kosovo have clearly gone far beyond the pale of acceptable 
behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These atrocious actions have ramifications which are being felt 
far beyond Kosovo in a region which has been torn by war and 
fractured by leaders who have shamelessly played on people's 
fears.  In inciting conflict the actions of the Yugoslav 
government are again victimizing the weak and moving the Balkans 
away from advancement and integration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The displacement of Kosovo Albanian civilians and the 
polarization of communities which has resulted from the conflict 
has direct implications not only for Serbia and Montenegro but 
for the neighbouring countries of Albania, the former Yugoslav 
republic of Macedonia and Bosnia as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consequences of this conflict are reverberating through 
southern Europe.  The international community is simply not 
prepared to stand by and allow the government of Milosevic to 
carry out this campaign of violence and oppression which is 
rapidly leading to a humanitarian crises of terrible proportions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As winter fast approaches some 50,000 people including children 
and the elderly are either without shelter or are afraid to 
return to what remains of their homes.  Unless the Yugoslav 
government completely withdraws its security forces from their 
field deployments and begins at once substantive dialogue on 
broad autonomy for Kosovo these people will begin to perish and 
what is now a humanitarian crisis will quickly become a 
catastrophe.  Despite numerous warnings and several opportunities 
to cease the campaign of violence, President Milosevic continues 
to defy the will of the international community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The claims that his security forces have ceased their operations 
in Kosovo are too little and they are much too late.  The 
military and police forces which have been responsible for the 
intentional deaths of civilians, the destruction of homes and 
property and the deliberate creation of a humanitarian crisis 
have for the most part yet to leave Kosovo and remain capable of 
returning to their destructive tasks at almost a moment's notice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than respecting international humanitarian law and human 
rights agreements by withdrawing the security forces which have 
been used to repress civilians, President Milosevic has instead 
allowed his forces to conclude their offensive and displace 
thousands of people before offering any sign of compliance with 
the demands of the international community.

<A HREF="#LINKT97"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet again President Milosevic has done the bare minimum in an 
effort to forestall the action against him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>President Milosevic and the Yugoslav government have had ample 
opportunity to end and to prevent this conflict, or at the very 
least to attenuate its effects.  Instead, a policy of heavy 
handed tactics has been pursued which has served only to 
aggravate the humanitarian situation and to further polarize the 
communities in Kosovo, making a settlement all the more difficult 
to achieve. As a result of this deliberate decision to shun 
accommodation and pursue violence, President Milosevic must now 
shoulder the blame for the situation which confronts the world in 
Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the outbreak of hostilities NATO has been fully engaged in 
support of the international community's efforts to bring an end 
to this terrible conflict.  The alliance has consistently 
demonstrated to the Yugoslav government and to president 
Milosevic that it is prepared to act in a decisive way.  As an 
important guarantor of stability in Europe, NATO cannot stand by 
and allow this humanitarian crisis to unfold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The international community is in clear agreement that the 
Yugoslav government must not be allowed to continue its policy of 
intentionally creating a humanitarian crisis among its own 
people.  NATO is ready to act to support the will of the 
international community by assuring that this policy stops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has played an important role in the Balkans in recent 
years.  After several years of peacekeeping, as part of United 
Nations forces in Bosnia, we continue now as an alliance member 
of the NATO led stabilization force.  To make significant 
contribution to peace there, the international community 
recognizes that NATO has proven vital not only in bringing about 
peace in Bosnia but in helping to preserve that peace and moving 
the country closer to stability and normality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several months have passed since the fighting began in Kosovo. 
President Milosevic has made and subsequently broken numerous 
promises to stop fighting and begin serious negotiations.  The 
time for inaction and wringing of hands has run out.  NATO must 
now act.  It must act to bring an end to the violence, to 
demonstrate that a peaceful negotiated settlement must be found 
and to ensure that the thousands of displaced persons can be 
accessed by humanitarian organizations and eventually return to 
their homes.  Canada stands ready to play its role in these 
important efforts. 
<P><A NAME="LINK248"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
wonder whether the parliamentary secretary could give us the 
benefit of his views as to the role of the security council, 
following the rather cogent and learned intervention by the 
member for Rosedale who seemed to place great importance on the 
security council's playing a role in Kosovo and overcoming the 
difficulties it faces internally with respect to the possibility 
that Russia would impose a veto on any resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
that question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know, Canada has always preferred that the security 
council pass the resolution that would determine what the world 
would do with the situation in Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are deeply disappointed that if such a resolution were 
attempted to be passed Russia would object and possibly China 
would object.  Therefore we find ourselves in a situation where 
our preferred situation is not going to work.  The humanitarian 
crisis is there nonetheless.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Winter is setting in and things are get worse actually by the 
hour in Kosovo.  Therefore Canada stands ready to act with NATO. 
<P><A NAME="LINK249"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre—Rosedale, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to follow that up with the parliamentary 
secretary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall when the minister was speaking the parliamentary 
secretary was here as well.  He pointed out that the secretary 
general's report in respect of the situation in Kosovo had 
clearly indicated that the conditions which security council 
mandated for an improvement in the situation in Kosovo have not 
been lived up to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the parliamentary secretary agree with me that if perhaps 
there is not a formal resolution at least it is clear that within 
the United Nations situation itself there is a clear opportunity 
for NATO and Canada to say we must take advantage of this 
situation and deal with it and that the secretary-general, by his 
findings, has indicated that the situation for an imperative 
intervention is there?  Would that be a fair way of putting it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the report of the 
secretary-general actually shows that the world is appalled by 
this situation.  When he came back to report that Mr. Milosevic 
had not undertaken to comply with the security council resolution 
it stands to reason that while NATO may be the one that has to 
take action, essentially the whole world will be in support of 
this action. 
<P><A NAME="LINK250"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Aileen Carroll (Barrie—Simcoe—Bradford, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the United Nations secretary-general has released a 
report in which he lays the lion's share of the blame for the 
current humanitarian crisis in the province of Kosovo squarely on 
the shoulders of the Yugoslav authorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The humanitarian situation in Kosovo is disastrous, with 
hundreds of thousands of displaced people and refugees, some of 
whom lack shelter and basic necessities.  What is most shocking 
is that many of these problems are due to the actions of the 
Yugoslav government against its own citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular, the report points to a clear policy of the 
Yugoslav authorities intentionally driving civilians from their 
own homes and in many cases from their own countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We call on Yugoslavia and on President Milosevic as head of 
state with the ability to act with decisive authority to meet 
their obligations under international law and to lead the way 
toward a just solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hold President Milosevic and all Yugoslav authorities fully 
accountable for the actions of their security forces and urge 
them to co-operate with the international criminal tribunal for 
the former Yugoslavia in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The actions of the security forces are exactly what fuels 
extremism and violence in the Albanian Kosovor population.  The 
Yugoslav government should instead show leadership by creating 
the conditions for meaningful dialogue on a political solution 
and by fully addressing the humanitarian crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This can be achieved only by calling an immediate end to the 
offensive and repressive activities of the police as well as the 
military and by offering gestures of good faith to the Albanians 
of Kosovo such as a commitment to offer real, meaningful autonomy 
for Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, we strongly urge the Albanian Kosovars to 
return to their earlier policy of peaceful engagement, to pursue 
their legitimate goals within the borders of the federal Republic 
of Yugoslavia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While Canadians understand the frustration and anger the 
Kosovars feel, especially in light of the scant regard the 
Yugoslavian authorities have paid to legitimate Kosovar 
grievances, violence is not the means to a viable solution to the 
problems Kosovo and the rest of the region face.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has long supported the diplomatic efforts being pursued 
to bring about a peaceful resolution to this region.  The 
Organization for Security and Co-operation has been trying to 
play a constructive role in Yugoslavia but has been continually 
rebuffed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>United States Ambassador Hill is continuing his efforts to 
broker an autonomy agreement.  The international community is 
working very hard to find a solution, but we need the 
co-operation of the combatants to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Problems in Kosovo have recently developed into a major 
humanitarian crisis in which civilians are the main victims.  But 
this crisis has not occurred in a void.  Its current phase is 
intimately linked to the factors and to the individuals which 
created the conditions for the violent dissolution of the former 
socialist federal Republic of Yugoslavia and war in Slovenia, 
Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina, with thousands of lives being 
lost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Irresponsible politicians in the Balkans have for years set 
neighbour against neighbour with one key goal, the maintenance of 
power at any cost, and that cost is borne by their people.  The 
suffering of their citizens, whether ethnic Albanians, Serbs or 
others, is rarely uppermost in these leaders' minds.  Ethnic ties 
are betrayed at a whim when it serves the interests of such 
politicians.  But they find playing off people's fears to be the 
most convenient and effective tactic.  It is a tactic to which 
they frequently resort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians find such behaviour reprehensible.  One's ethnicity 
makes little difference if one is hungry, cold, terrified and in 
extreme physical danger.  Innocent victims are innocent victims, 
regardless of religion, language or ethnicity.  Simply put, there 
is no such thing as collective guilt where individuals are held 
responsible for the crimes, real or perceived, of their ethnic 
kin.  Recognizing this is key to any lasting solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has played a constructive role in all the countries of 
the former Yugoslavia since we first sent peacekeepers there at 
the beginning of this decade.  We have paid high costs, most 
notably in terms of the 16 soldiers who lost their lives in the 
region.  Other Canadians have tried through non-governmental 
organizations or international agencies to help the people of the 
western Balkans find their own peaceful, sustainable answers to 
these many challenges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian taxpayers have been generous in helping the peace 
process bring tangible benefits to ordinary people.  We, in turn, 
have benefited enormously through immigration from the former 
Yugoslavia which provides a bridge between our countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have no agenda to damage anyone's legitimate interests in 
that region.  But we do have an obligation to make our voices 
heard when we see tens of thousands of suffering people whose 
human rights have been callously disregarded and who have in many 
cases lost all that they hold dear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When international humanitarian law and international human 
rights standards are cast aside in the name of fighting and armed 
insurgency in a manner opposed to the letter and spirit of 
international law we must not be oblivious to the implications 
this has for all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of this House must therefore condemn in the strongest 
terms the philosophy which lies behind the actions of all the 
combatants who commit atrocities against civilians in Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regardless of who commits such actions, the Serbian forces or 
the Kosovar insurgents, such actions will never lead to a just 
and peaceful resolution for the inhabitants of Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all deeply concerned with the plight of the displaced 
persons within Kosovo and of Kosovo refugees fleeing into 
Albania, Macedonia, Bosnia and Hercegovina.  Canada has 
contributed to the efforts of the UN, the UN children's fund and 
the Red Cross, and Canada will continue to do its part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A stable solution reflecting the best interests of all ethnic 
groups in Kosovo is what is needed.  There is only one source for 
justice, reconciliation and a lasting peace.  While Canada and 
our partners in the international community do not seek to impose 
our own solutions, we cannot be neutral to the suffering being 
experienced and to the threat to international peace and security 
that is posed by this current crisis.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre—Rosedale, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to thank the member for 
Barrie—Simcoe—Bradford for her very thoughtful and sensitive 
appreciation of the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think she has introduced into the debate tonight an element 
that we really have not heard from a lot of other members, which 
is the need for reconciliation, because, as we know, violence 
begets violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While it is clear that the United Nations has indicated that the 
majority of responsibility lies with the Yugoslav government 
since it has the force of power, there is another party in that 
conflict, the Kosovo Liberation Army. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The KLA, while in no way bearing the same level of 
responsibility, has a responsibility, which is to return to the 
bargaining table and ensure that civil peace is restored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one seeks to destroy a state or a society violence comes 
with it.  It is a lesson in this country that we have to bear in 
mind ourselves.  This is a lesson for all societies and I think 
the member brought that to our attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member feel there is some way that Canadians can help 
the Kosovo Liberation Army and Kosovars themselves to understand 
the way in which they could live in an autonomous region within a 
federal state, the way we have managed to achieve in our own 
society, where we deal with these problems in a peaceful, civil 
way?  Is there something we should be urging our government to 
do, whether it is through CIDA or another organization, to take 
to these countries a lesson from Canada, a lesson from our own 
federal experience which will enable them to do exactly what the 
member suggested?  A peaceful reconciliation is ultimately 
required on both sides if we are going to achieve a resolution of 
this terrible humanitarian problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Aileen Carroll:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the insight 
shared by the hon. member for Toronto Centre—Rosedale.  Indeed, 
he underlines very well the dilemma. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have moved beyond their history in some regards.  We 
have not carried the baggage of some of the European countries 
and, as such, we have been freer to take risks and, by so doing, 
have created a federalism that is indeed one of tolerance and one 
that grows and overcomes the dilemmas which we face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has a reputation internationally.  At one time we 
referred to it as a middle power, and former Prime Minister 
Pearson exemplified greatly what roles a middle power could play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think today we still have enormous credibility in the 
international community.  We must be peace brokers.  We must 
exemplify tolerance in our own history when we attempt to hold it 
out as an example to as troubled a region of the world as the 
Balkans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But indeed both sides must come forward through CIDA and through 
international organizations, through our parliamentary 
associations and the opportunity which they provide for us to 
stand witness to exactly what we believe and what we act on every 
day.  I think we can reach out.  I do not mean in any way to 
sound naive.  The history is long.  The hatreds appear to be even 
longer, but I think they can be remedied by what we bring to the 
table.  But we must be willing to go to the table as well and to 
take the risks. 
<P><A NAME="LINK252"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough—Rouge River, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we have had a debate this evening that addresses a very 
serious international problem recognized by our government, by 
the United Nations, by NATO and, doubtless, by many other 
countries around the world. 
We have heard tonight ample evidence of the brutality and 
suffering in the province of Kosovo.  We have heard that there 
are some 200,000 to 300,000 people who are homeless and being 
brutalized by a campaign of terror initiated by Serb forces in 
that province.  The terror is intended to bring about the 
submission of the people, in response to an insurgency or an 
alleged insurgency, calculated to bring about independence. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2225"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT101"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That poses, potentially, a dilemma for many countries.  We do 
not in this country condone armed insurgencies.  We continually 
and constantly commend to the rest of the world peaceful ways of 
governance and evolution of governance.  While we regret the 
appearance of arms in Kosovo, the greater evil now is not the 
original appearance of the armed attempt to produce independence, 
but the reign of terror now brought by the police response.  That 
reign of terror includes murder.  It is not just murder, it is 
murder with a message. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen this message before.  We have debated this type of 
murder before.  It is murder which leaves a message.  It includes 
the mutilation of the victims and it is intended to bring about 
so much fear that it will numb the will, the initiative, of the 
victims and the victim group.  We have seen this in months gone 
by in Bosnia and in Croatia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those of us who had an opportunity to be in the Balkans 
after the break-up of the former Yugoslav Republic, we have seen 
the villages utterly destroyed and burned.  What were apparently 
happy settlements are settlements no more.  The people are gone. 
Some are dead.  They have certainly dispersed.  It is a very sad 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I need only mention Rwanda as another reference point for all of 
us, where regrettably the world was not able to act soon enough. 
I do not think any of us wants to let that type of scenario 
happen again when we have the ability to respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tonight it would appear that most members of parliament who have 
spoken have supported an international effort to respond to the 
evils that have been outlined.  It appears that all of the 
parties support an international action to respond to these evils 
and our government appears ready to act internationally in an 
attempt to end the evils described and to bring about an improved 
situation for the victims and hopefully an improved political 
solution for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the areas that has puzzled me as a layman looking at 
international relations for some time now is this business of 
gamesmanship theory.  When we sit down with an opponent to 
negotiate we must in the beginning decide whether or not the 
opponent is telling the truth or is lying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that all of our international organizations have 
operated without any gamesmanship theory.  They have simply 
assumed that the party on the other side of the table is telling 
the truth.  We have seen a number of occasions on which it is 
painfully obvious that the party on the other side of the table 
is not telling the truth.

<A HREF="#LINKT102"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If one were to simply operate one's life in gamesmanship theory 
without any reference to morality, without any reference to life 
and death, I could hypothetically here say why not lie on the 
international scene, why not cheat, why not kill. The objective 
is to reach our goal, to attain our goal.  As long as we get 
there, it does not matter how.  I have seen this and as a 
legislator I do not have a solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very frustrating to see our international institutions 
victimized by countries, interest groups that simply play 
gamesman theory with more than one tactic.  I think we are 
getting better at dealing with deceit.  It is sometimes difficult 
to call our opponent deceitful when negotiating with them. With 
the inability of our institutions and people who in good faith 
operate to be able to do this, we lose innocent lives in the 
process.  We lose valuable time and that is a great tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have a solution.  In the matter of Kosovo, because we 
have previous experience going back not too many months with the 
parties involved here, we are more able to tell it like it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope we get better at telling it like it is, calling a liar a 
liar and I hope we get quicker at doing it.  The quicker we can 
reach these conclusions, the better we can respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United Nations is a large, sometimes unwieldy body but 
sometimes it is all we have on this planet bringing us together. 
If there is a veto gridlock there which has been referred to here 
tonight, it is quite possible that the UN may not be in a 
position to authorize a specific response to the Kosovo 
situation.  We are then fortunate in having NATO.  NATO is 
prepared with indirect authority from the United Nations to do it 
and Canada is a player in NATO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last Sunday I was at an exhibition of Islamic arts and science 
in the Scarborough area of Toronto.  A man came up to me quite 
unannounced. I did not even get his name.  He said please do 
something about Kosovo, you must do something. He was a man who 
obviously had some personal experience in connection with the 
Balkans.  That was my read on the situation. I do not doubt his 
sincerity in his exhortation to me.  He was a new Canadian but a 
real Canadian and I do not doubt the need for our Canadian 
government to act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not, as a member of parliament, let him or the rest of my 
constituents down.  I will not turn my back on the victimized 
people of Kosovo and I support the initiative of this country to 
intervene, to cause the Serb government to cease its evil and 
inhumane operations in Kosovo and to allow humanitarian aid to 
get to the homeless in Kosovo. I hope this initiative will happen 
within hours. 
<P><A NAME="LINK253"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have a question pertaining to the statement presented by Trent 
Lott, the United States Senate majority leader, when Clinton's 
administration briefed Congress on what the Americans were going 
to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He basically said that he was shaken by the presentation made by 
Clinton's administration, that there was no real plan and that 
there was no plan B. 
I wonder if the member for Scarborough—Rouge River would be 
concerned about that statement given that we are supporting the 
Americans and on the other side of the coin we are bit players in 
the whole scheme of things.  If there is no plan on that side, 
where does Canada fit into the big scheme of things?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the question is a good one. 
On a hearsay basis it suggests there may not be a plan B in the 
event that the likely operation to cause the Serbian forces to 
take note and to withdraw is not successful.  As I understand 
from our minister and from my reading on the subject, in this 
case the purpose of the initiative is to exact a toll, a cost, a 
price from the military forces doing their evil deeds in Kosovo 
and to continue to exact a cost from those military and police 
forces until they are prepared to negotiate in good faith without 
deceit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot imagine that any of the military operations intended 
here or contemplated would proceed without a backup and a 
contingency plan for whatever operation was contemplated.  The 
initial phases would probably involve hardware and low risk to 
military personnel on the operational side.  However, we are 
dealing with a complex international situation.  I have not been 
briefed.  There may be members of this House who will be briefed 
before Canadian forces are operational.  My experience in 
watching these things is that our forces are very professional, 
the NATO forces are very professional and neither the Canadians 
nor the British nor the Americans nor the French nor any of the 
other participating countries are going to place their forces in 
a situation where there is not appropriate backup. 
<P><A NAME="LINK254"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Aileen Carroll (Barrie—Simcoe—Bradford, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will comment and conclude with a question to my 
colleague regarding the willingness to take a risk and to act 
even when all the results cannot be within our control.  Many of 
us have concerns, as I mentioned on Monday in an S. O. 31, about 
the attendant risks of a military intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall as a young child in 1958 watching the tanks roll into 
Budapest and asking my father if we were going to help.  I do not 
remember his answer because I do not think he had one.  As a 
graduate student in 1968 I watched again as the tanks went into 
Prague and Dubcek.  So many hopes and aspirations were stopped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fear the inertia that is a component of all that and perhaps 
the inertia in Europe today.  In discussions with some of our 
colleagues from Europe I was told it was complicated. Indeed it 
is and there are risks when we take action but I fear having to 
watch on television the same scenes in Kosovo that we saw in 1958 
and 1968.  I believe my colleague would agree with me and I ask 
him if it is a risk we must take at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I agree that we have to take 
the risk.  If we are going to engage ourselves militarily we have 
to be prepared to make sure there is containment militarily. 
There is a reasonable prospect that objective can be met.  In 
terms of other risks on the ground after the intervention, the 
people we are dealing with appear to operate exclusively on 
military gamesmanship theories.

<A HREF="#LINKT104"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying they are a one trick pony but we have not seen 
any other tactical rationale.  If we have a NATO operation 
intended to address specifically the one trick pony this is how 
we do it, psychology.  The hope, notwithstanding that there is 
risk as the hon. member points out, is that will be sufficient to 
bring about an end game on the Serb military operations simply 
because that is the mode they are dealing with which is military 
might.  Hopefully the Serbian military is not capable of going 
much beyond where it is now when faced with sufficient military 
force. 
<P><A NAME="LINK255"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure for me rise tonight to be part of this very 
important debate. I lend my qualified support for the 
international action to end the suffering in this region of 
Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has a very undeniable obligation to its allies, NATO 
allies in particular.  We also have a proud history of 
international engagement and involvement in supporting our allies 
as well as those who may be in regions of severe conflict and 
suffering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the alliance decides to take military action I do not believe 
Canada can step aside.  We certainly have a moral obligation to 
take action against ethnic cleansing.  There has unfortunately 
been quite a history in that region of such terrifying conflict 
and Canada has always played a role, sometimes a minor role but 
we have been there.  We have that moral obligation to take action 
against the systematic murder and torture of innocent civilians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that the international community must not 
stand idly by while Serbian forces commit flagrant human rights 
atrocities against Kosovars.  Ultimately we must support our 
allies.  Canada cannot shirk its responsibility in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, quite frankly there are some serious questions 
concerning possible military action which give us cause for 
serious concern.  We have a duty to ask these questions because 
we have an obligation to the Canadian troops whose lives will be 
put on the line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the questions.  Have all diplomatic efforts to resolve 
the crisis failed?  What are the dangers and possible 
implications of military action?  Is there true multinational 
support for this mission?  Is there a workable plan for military 
action?  What precisely is Canada's role to be?  Is the role 
realistic in terms of Canada's military capability?  Who will 
command the Canadian troops? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now go through these questions and maybe put a little of 
meat to them.  Have diplomatic efforts failed?  We will see but 
the answer to date appears to be yes, they have.  The Serbs have 
dragged their feet in agreeing to all the terms of UN security 
council resolution 1199 passed on September 23.  History has 
certainly shown that the threat of massive military action has 
frequently been the very thing that brings aggressors to the 
bargaining table. I think we can all hope this will be a similar 
case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, at the same time, we cannot be certain the Serbs will 
comply.  Serbia has a deep historic attachment, however misguided 
it may be, to the Kosovo territory.  It was in Kosovo that the 
Serbs lost their independence to the Turks in 1389. Given their 
attachment to Kosovo, the Serbs may not roll over if they just 
face a few pinprick air strikes. 
The sobering fact is that they may well be in for a long and 
possibly difficult struggle.

<A HREF="#LINKT105"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the second question, there are obviously deep 
concerns that fighting in Kosovo could escalate into the 
neighbouring countries.  Kosovo is a pivotal territory and it has 
always been seen as a linchpin for both stability and instability 
in the Balkans.  NATO must make every effort to ensure that war 
does not spread beyond the borders of Yugoslavia to engulf 
neighbouring states. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must be prepared for the fact that the Serbs may make an 
effort to escalate the war.  In other words, we should be looking 
at the worst case scenario.  Perhaps they will attack NATO 
troops, including Canadians serving in Bosnia.  NATO has to be 
prepared for that eventuality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer to the third question appears to be clear.  The very 
fact that this will be a NATO sanctioned operation implies that 
it will have multinational support.  Nevertheless, on October 5 
the European Union's Council of Ministers failed to agree to use 
rapid force in Kosovo.  Obviously some concerns remain among the 
European members of the alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there a workable plan for military action?  I believe that 
this is absolutely the most fundamental question which remains 
largely unanswered and the reason I put the question to the 
government side, specifically to the member for 
Scarborough—Rouge River.  Granted, the member may not have been 
briefed on that.  Maybe there is a plan, but Canadians should 
know.  We are possibly sending Canadian troops into an area of 
conflict.  Why should Canadians not know exactly what is going to 
happen? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>United States senate majority leader Trent Lott stated that he 
was shaken after the Clinton administration briefed Congress on 
its plans last week.  He said “There is no real plan on how to 
carry this out” and “There is no plan <I>B</I> if that should go 
wrong”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the plan, if any, entail only air strikes or does it 
include ground troops?  If ground troops are required, then we 
had better brace ourselves for a much larger number of 
casualties.  Would ground troops be necessary as part of a 
subsequent peace enforcement operation?  How long would they be 
there? Will the UN Security Council approve the action? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the six to ten Canadian CF-18s already stationed at Aviano 
are to be involved, are they the same aircraft which were 
recently upgraded to carry precision guided munitions, or are 
they a mixture of upgraded and non-upgraded aircraft?  Are they 
compatible with the system that is in force right now under the 
Americans and the British?  Our planes are moving back and forth. 
Are all of them upgraded to the point where they can fit into 
the program that is already there? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A myriad of questions remain unanswered.  Does the government 
know the answer to any of these questions?  I have not heard much 
debate in that regard.  The debate has been more philosophical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Preparation is essential.  Has the government asked NATO what 
will be required?  It is impossible to address the question of 
whether or not our military has the capability of doing this job 
given that we do not know the job they are going to be doing.  If 
ground troops are sent in, how will they get there? How many 
ground troops can we send?  The Canadian army is already 
stretched to the limit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the claim made in the government's 1994 white paper on 
defence, we cannot send a combat capable brigade overseas.  All 
we can send is a smaller battalion group force.  Even that would 
be a severe strain on our capabilities given the present task. 
What equipment do they have? 
I could give a list of what equipment we do not have, but what 
equipment do we have to send over there that will support our 
troops?

</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of questions remain unanswered, but in conclusion we 
must ultimately support the alliance and support our troops once 
committed.  We must however be clear and realistic about Canada's 
role.  That should be spelled out in the House and spelled out to 
the people of Canada.

practical implications of the mission.  We must support our

Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had the opportunity of travelling together in Bosnia and 
looking at these issues.  He is very knowledgeable but perhaps he 
will permit me if I say to him that it looks to me as if he is 
trying to have the best of both worlds in this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He says that he lends qualified support to the action of 
participating, but then sets out a series of conditions which 
enables him to say if there is a problem “See, I told you so. 
Yes, let us do it but here are the problems and if it does not 
work out the way we would like it to, we will be able to stand up 
and say we told you so”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the member has more depth to him than that.  I have 
watched him and I would like his answer to my question.  I 
appreciate all the questions he raised are appropriate questions 
for us to ask, particularly concerning escalation in neighbouring 
regions, the true nature of what we will have and Canada's 
facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have looked at what we have at the base at Aviano. We all 
recognize that our facilities are stretched to the limit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have asked a great deal of our troops.  Some of us have had 
an opportunity to see the professional qualities that they have 
developed in Bosnia and the tremendous professionalism they 
exhibit in the way in which they operate around the world. 
Whether it is in Haiti or Bosnia or the many other jurisdictions, 
we know what wonderful performers they are.  We cannot ask too 
much of them.  All of that is true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member knows that NATO has been looking at this situation 
for over six months.  He knows how NATO operates.  He knows that 
NATO has some of the most professional people, Americans, 
British, French, the top people in the world.  They have been 
looking at this for six months. Does he not believe that the NATO 
planners are looking at the questions that he is asking in the 
House tonight?  Does he not believe that the NATO planners have 
the capacity to resolve those issues? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he not believe that what we need in the House tonight is a 
commitment to act and act forcefully if we are going to resolve 
the questions in the area.  At the same time does he not believe 
that we need to have confidence that the NATO planners, our NATO 
colleagues and our own troops are able to address the logistical 
questions which he asked in the House tonight? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member poses a good 
question but there is a political side as well as a practical 
side to the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The practical side is whether we are in a position to go into an 
area of possible conflict with our troops protected with the best 
equipment available and under the best command.  Are we also able 
to rotate the troops over time if that conflict rolls on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the political side there is a hesitancy on the part of the 
European Community which has already hesitated about rapid force 
strikes into Kosovo.  Why?  Does it not want to get into the 
fray? The American public is getting very tired of having that 
expense and American troops in the Balkan area.  There is no 
question that debate is raging on in a very substantive way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the political side it is not very clear exactly what is going 
to happen. Certainly we can debate the issue philosophically but 
we must also consider the practical side and not blindly jump 
into something without going in a very specific direction and 
knowing what our limitations are.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
think Canadians are great people.  They have the kindest hearts 
on this planet, despite the fact that they are paying high taxes 
which is not their fault. Unfortunately from time to time, they 
have been getting some ineffective governments ruling this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has the habit of not appropriately addressing 
various issues, whether it be taxes, the economy, a justice 
issue, unity, and so on.  The government has done it again today. 
The hon. member for Calgary North has given some examples of how 
we are jumping without knowing where we are jumping to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This take note debate is not an appropriate way of dealing with 
the important and the sad situation in Kosovo, but this is the 
only option given by the Liberal government to members of 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue at hand is very important.  It is a non-partisan 
issue.  The crisis in Kosovo is at a climax.  I hope the Liberal 
government will show some leadership.  The government will 
probably come up with a strong, elaborate strategy to deal with 
the peace initiatives.  We will be dealing with these peace 
initiatives in the future as well, unfortunately.  We expect that 
the government will come up with some strategy to educate 
Canadians, to let them know what we are doing, why we are doing 
it and where we are going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Kosovo has a population of about 2.2 million. Ninety-three per 
cent of the population is ethnic Albanian.  Most of the others 
are ethnic Serbs.  During the communist rule in Yugoslavia, 
Kosovo had the status of an autonomous province within the 
Republic of Serbia.  This status was abolished by Mr. Milosevic 
in 1989. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Kosovo region has a historical significance to Serbia.  The 
Serbs lost a battle to the Turks in Kosovo in 1389, losing their 
national independence. In 1989 Serb President Milosevic launched 
his national campaign while celebrating the 600th anniversary of 
this defeat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since last spring Serb forces of the Yugoslav army have 
constantly attacked and terrorized the ethnic Albanian 
population.  The Kosovo Liberation Army has fought against the 
repression and lost ground over the summer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The civilian population in Kosovo is in a desperate situation. A 
quarter of a million Kosovo Albanians have been forced from their 
homes and their homes have been raided and burned by Yugoslavian 
government troops.  Fifty thousand people are without adequate 
shelter and are unlikely to survive the upcoming winter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition foreign affairs critic, the hon. member 
for Red Deer, visited Kosovo.  He talked to terrorized children 
in various schools. He listened to their horror stories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The farms, the fields and the residential areas are infested 
with mines.  Some mines are very cleverly designed to 
specifically kill children.  Some mines look like attractive toys 
and pop cans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Serb armed presence remains a significant force in that 
area.  The disproportionate use of force is designed to terrorize 
and subjugate the population.  A collective punishment is given 
to teach them that the price of supporting Kosovo Albanian 
paramilitary units is too high.  We must respond to this terror. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are debating a motion to co-operate with NATO forces in the 
military action they intend to take.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There could be two plans.  Plan A should be a diplomatic 
initiative.  I wanted to ask a question of the member opposite 
earlier as to whether he could highlight the diplomatic 
initiatives the government has taken to address the situation. 
The government should have been aggressively pursuing initiatives 
long ago at least when we saw signs of this problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that we know plan A has failed, even though the government 
did not pursue it aggressively, we can go to plan B and plan B is 
military action.  I understand why we have to do that.  There are 
people who say we should; there are people who say that we should 
not take military action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps I can tell a story about a donkey that was sick.  The 
farmer who owned the donkey was giving it medicine that was very 
bitter.  The farmer's son was helping him by holding the donkey 
by the ears.  They were forcing the medicine into the donkey's 
nostrils because they wanted to cure it, but the donkey thought 
that they were pulling his ears. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to do that; we have to pull the ears.  When diplomacy 
fails we have to take military action.  This bitter medicine is 
the only medicine that will work in this situation.  Before we 
prescribe this bitter medicine, my constituents, and all 
Canadians for that matter, need answers to the many questions 
they are asking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are asking why we are choosing a military situation over a 
diplomatic situation.  What are the actions the government has 
taken?  What other possible solutions could we pursue?  What are 
the possibilities of finding a long term solution?  How are we 
dealing with the hatred in the minds of ethnic people?  How much 
involvement are we asking from the European Community or the 
other affected and related countries to deal with this issue in 
their backyard? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want to know whether we are creating more victims by 
bombing that area.  They want to know how far we will go, how 
much is the cost, who is paying the costs, and what share we will 
pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the government assess the degree of risk before committing 
the men and women of the Canadian defence forces?  Do they have 
enough equipment and facilities?  What strategy do we have to 
deal with the regional security situation?  I will be looking 
forward to those answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Repeatedly there have been serious situations in the world like 
in Rwanda, Nigeria, Bosnia, Haiti, Iraq, and the list goes on. 
Unfortunately this situation will happen again. I am sorry for 
the inability of the United Nations to respond in a timely 
fashion.  We have to show leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Britain, France, Russia and the United States of America, which 
is kept busy by Monica, cannot do that.  We are in a strong 
position as a nation to be mediators in the world.  We belong to 
NATO.  We belong to the security council.  We are a member of the 
G-8 countries.  We have sent many peacekeeping missions around 
the world.  I ask the foreign minister to look into the 
possibilities of peacemaking missions, rather than peacekeeping 
missions in the long run. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give an analogy.  When a domestic pressure cooker is 
heated, steam is produced.  To contain that stream we put weight 
on the pressure cooker.  We try to put military pressure to 
contain the steam, but have we ever taken an action to remove the 
heat from under the pressure cooker?  Have we ever involved an 
issue by solving the problem before it happens? Unfortunately the 
government has not has taken any action. 
The government lacks a pro-active role.  It is just reactive.  It 
does very little to prevent conflicts in the world.  The 
government needs to have a broader agenda for peacekeeping and 
peacemaking issues.  The humanitarian crisis is the consequence 
of what is fundamentally a political problem.  We try to resolve 
the political problem by our foreign aid and by various other 
issues like military solutions.

for the sake of the suffering of the innocent people in Kosovo. I 
look forward to the government showing— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member's 
time has expired. 
<P><A NAME="LINK258"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke—Lakeshore, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is with sadness that I join in this debate.  It is 
also with sadness that I have watched over the last while the 
images on our television screens depicting what is happening in 
Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should we as Canadians be involved?  I think tonight many 
speakers addressed that question.  I heard many say that it was 
time for us to act, that it was our duty to offer support and 
that it was our duty to avert further misery and bloodshed.  We 
need the resources available to participate in whatever action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard other speakers refer to the fact that we have been 
and we are in a state of readiness where we can act.  We have the 
CF-18 aircraft in Aviano right now.  We need to work with speed 
because winter is approaching.  We cannot allow more innocent 
civilians to suffer the atrocities we see nightly on our 
television screen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a few comments I want to add because I know many of my 
constituents in Etobicoke—Lakeshore come from that part of the 
world.  Many of them are watching nightly what they seem to think 
is the inertia and the inability of the international community 
to respond.  They are saddened and want us as Canadians and as 
the Canadian government to act swiftly, to act with care to make 
sure our resources are not barred so that we can get humanitarian 
help directly to the people who need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These barbarous actions have ramifications that are felt beyond 
Kosovo.  The displacement of Kosovar and Albanian civilians and 
the polarization of communities which has resulted from this 
conflict have direct implications not only for Serbia and 
Montenegro but for the neighbouring countries of Albania, the 
former Yugoslav, the republic of Macedonia and Bosnia.  The 
consequences of this conflict are reverberating throughout 
southern Europe.  My constituents who come from that part of the 
world know what happens to families and individuals when that 
reverberation throughout Europe is felt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The campaign of violence and oppression that is ongoing right 
now, that humanitarian crisis that is before us, calls for our 
assistance.  What can we do as Canadians?  Are we to just stand 
here and speak in this debate?  Is this doing something?  Is this 
really my effort to ensure that there is some alleviation of the 
pain and suffering?  I think it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that the federal republic of Yugoslavia, and in 
particular President Milosevic as head of the state with the 
ability to act with decisive authority, know that I and others 
are standing here tonight calling on him to meet his obligations 
under international law and to lead the way to a just solution to 
the conflict.

</I></B></P><P align=left>To use disproportionate force against civilians will ultimately 
prove counterproductive in resisting armed separatist forces. 
The actions of the security forces are exactly what fuels 
extremism and violence among the population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have other places in the world where we have seen the results 
of such action.  The Yugoslav government must know that we have 
said tonight that it must create the conditions necessary for a 
dialogue to a political solution and must fully address this 
crisis.  It must know that we have said here tonight that we are 
calling for an immediate end to the offensive and repressive 
activities of the police and the military, and that we have also 
said here tonight that withdrawing its forces is the thing that 
should be done immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>President Milosevic and all Yugoslav authorities are responsible 
for the actions of their security forces.  They must know that 
the international community stands in horror at the events that 
are taking place right now in their country, under their command. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also crucial that they allow human rights managers in 
Kosovo to continue their important work.  We have to commend 
those individuals who would want to go in, those individuals who 
have been on diplomatic missions over these past months, 
including the work that we are doing as Canadians.  The 
individuals who are part of those diplomatic missions, who are 
part of the human rights missions, must be allowed to do their 
work and inform the international community of what is happening 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for stability in Europe that this human rights 
mission be allowed to continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United Nations and the international community has expressed 
concern and outrage.  It seems to me that is not enough.  Two UN 
security council resolutions have been adopted calling for this 
conflict to end and for the flight of the displaced to be 
addressed.  Who is listening?  It is certainly not those with the 
arms who are using force against the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has used every means at its disposal to bring about a 
peaceful resolution of the conflict through diplomatic means.  In 
various international fora and in several places we have, with 
numerous friends and allies, tried to resolve the crisis. Despite 
numerous appeals, despite talks, despite the plight of 
individuals being put before those in power, the situation 
continues to worsen.  We see it daily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are on the verge of a new century.  There was a time when 
there was a glimmer and a window of hope that there would be 
peace in this world.  There was a time when we saw a tunnel where 
we thought there was some light, that there would be peace and 
that leaders and the people who were in the positions of making 
decisions would make the kind of decisions for their people that 
would see this world at peace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whatever needs to be done at this point in time, I am urging 
that Canada stand with the rest of the international community, 
with NATO and with others, to ensure that we do what is necessary 
to bring the horrible and horrendous daily slaughtering of people 
that we see on our screens to an end.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I listened to the hon. member very carefully.  We are talking 
about a humanitarian issue here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very important issue but there is another issue attached 
to this, that if we are planning to take any military action or 
if we are committing our military support to NATO, that means we 
are committing men and women of the Canadian forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question arises here of whether we are well equipped. Are 
our brave men and women well equipped with the materials they 
need? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to know from the member how much it will cost 
us.  For how long are we going to commit our military forces? 
What are the long term plans?  Can the member throw some light on 
that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jean Augustine:</B>  Mr. Speaker, when I stood I did not 
stand as an accountant, not as someone who is looking at the 
bottom line.  I spoke because, as most Canadians, we are moved by 
the slaughter of human beings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think Canada has a responsibility to stand and be counted, not 
in terms of dollars, not in terms of what it will cost us 
economically.  I think there is a moral situation here.  That 
decision has to be one whereby we join with others. We use 
whatever resources we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the minister of defence spoke earlier I think I heard him 
say the number of aircraft we have, the men and women we have in 
that part of the world at this point and our capability at this 
point.  I do not think Canada will be marching off on its 
own but that Canada will be playing a role, supportive and 
otherwise, to ensure a quick resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not an accounting job here.  It is not looking for the 
bottom line but it is looking at human beings who are caught in a 
very horrendous situation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
in Montreal tonight but I wanted to come back even at this late 
hour—and excuse me for keeping you here so late—to add my 
voice to the debate on this motion that is so important from a 
humanitarian standpoint, a motion that unites us all in this 
House and makes us set all partisan considerations aside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Few of us, if any, have experienced racial and ethnic conflicts, 
armed conflicts where a majority uses instruments of war to 
torture, mutilate, kill and drive from their homes members of a 
minority whose only fault is to belong to a different ethnic 
group or to have different religious beliefs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For us who have the very special privilege of living in a 
peaceful country, it is extremely difficult to understand how a 
majority can use such barbarity to impose its views on an 
innocent minority. We cannot understand how racial, ethnic and 
religious conflicts can plunge humanity into such darkness. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is extremely hard for us to understand how human beings can 
use all their powers, whatever these be, to destroy other human 
beings in the name of race, colour or creed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would have thought that the lessons of World War II which are 
still fresh in our minds would have taught us that six million 
people and more lived the most terrible atrocities, the most 
degrading and inhuman treatment, including death by the most 
violent means, just because one majority decided that one 
minority was not worthy of living in its midst.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet in spite of the lessons of World War II, in spite of the 
lessons of the Holocaust, one ethnic conflict today seems to give 
way to another, killing in its wake tens of thousands of people 
all over the world.  Lives are lost in the name of racial or 
religious purity or racial or religious superiority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday it was Northern Ireland.  Yesterday it was Bosnia. 
Yesterday it was Somalia.  Yesterday it was Afghanistan. 
Yesterday it was Chechnya.  Today it is Kosovo.  Tomorrow, so 
help the Lord, it may not be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we justify that one and three quarter million of the two 
million people of Kosovo should be evicted from their homes, 
should be killed, should be brutalized at the hands of Yugoslavia 
and its president Slobodan Milosevic because they are of 
different racial origins? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>President Milosevic would use arms and death and eviction from 
their homes of the ethnic Albanians who are yearning for 
self-rule to impose his dictatorship just as he did in Bosnia, 
disregarding their human right to live, their fundamental freedom 
as human beings to exist as we all do with a quality of life, 
with a right not only to live but certainly with the essential 
right to survive as human beings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope we do not make this into a partisan issue.  I heard some 
talk about lack of leadership being exercised and I think it is 
important to underline what our foreign minister has done.  He is 
a man of peace.  He is a man who has fought extremely hard 
against armaments and for the installation of peace in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is worth mentioning what has been done.  Canada lobbied in 
New York and in the capitals of the security council members this 
summer for decisive council action.  The foreign minister wrote 
to then Russian foreign minister Primakov in August, reminding 
him that as permanent member of the council and as a privileged 
partner of the Belgrade government Russia had a special role to 
play in putting effective pressure on President Milosevic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He repeated this message to Foreign Minister Ivanov just before 
he travelled to Belgrade over the past weekend.  This week we 
sent an envoy to underline to the leadership in Belgrade and 
Kosovo to stop the violence, to negotiate a solution and 
facilitate humanitarian relief for innocent victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's actions have actually reflected other efforts 
taken by the international community.  In March and September the 
UN security council adopted resolutions that demanded that first 
of all Yugoslav forces cease attacking civilians and withdraw 
their forces that are used to oppress civilians, and that they 
begin meaningful negotiation with Kosovar political leaders with a 
view to achieving a political settlement that would lead to a 
significant measure of autonomy for Kosovo within the Yugoslav 
federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Prime Minister took part in the G-8 meeting in 
Birmingham, he impressed on the other leaders, including 
President Yeltsin, the need for concerted action in Kosovo. In 
June Russia with its special influence the Belgrade regime 
brought in President Milosevic to Moscow where President Yeltsin 
repeated the profound concerns of the international community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it seems as though President Milosevic has decided to 
act on his own regardless of world opinion, regardless of the 
human lives he sacrifices willy-nilly whenever he wants to impose 
his will by force of arms.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now faced with the terrible dilemma of having to use 
planes and instruments of warfare to instil peace. It is the 
irony of our world today.  But if it must be, it must be because 
the plan eventually is to bring President Milosevic to the 
negotiation table so we can negotiate and instil peace.  The 
people in Kosovo deserve to live as we deserve to live.  They 
deserve to live not only in the condition they are in today but 
to live in peace. They deserve to live in their homes, to create 
their own homeland if this is their wish as a majority.  This 
right must be fundamentally recognized as it has been recognized 
in the UN declaration of human rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why all of us from the five political parties on every 
side of this House have united to support this motion.  I support 
the work of our foreign minister for effective action that will 
bring peace and hope to the people of Kosovo and also to the 
other people of the world who are suffering.  For those in 
central Africa or anywhere else in the world, let peace begin. We 
need it so badly.  We need peace because first of all we are all 
human beings regardless of race, colour or creed.

their support of our allies on the Kosovo issue in terms of 
military support.

humanitarian issue we have to show support?  What plan does the 
government have to prevent this type of conflict in the world? 
What role is his government willing to play to show some 
leadership so that we can know how to handle such a situation in 
the future in a better, more efficient manner? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln:</B>  Mr. Speaker, Canada is one country 
among many in the world today.  We are certainly not the most 
powerful country of all.  Thank goodness we have established a 
role which is some sort of leadership role as peacemakers or 
peace brokers.  That goes back to the time of Prime Minister 
Pearson.  This tradition has been maintained all along. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government and previous governments of all stripes have 
tried to work closely within the framework of the United Nations 
to bring peace around the world.  I remind the member that in all 
areas where conflict has arisen, Canada has played a leading 
role.  The other day I heard the president of the Irish republic 
tell us what a huge role Canada has played and what a huge role 
General de Chastelain played as co-chairman of the peace 
agreement. He is today in charge of the commission in Northern 
Ireland and is playing a vital role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How has Canada helped?  The other day President Mandela told us 
how Canada has been instrumental in changing the state of things 
in South Africa.  Perhaps Canada was helping in its own way to 
avoid racial conflict and bloodshed there.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Today what we are trying to do is bid for a seat on the United 
Nations Security Council.  Tomorrow there will be a vote in the 
United Nations.  We have proposed several solutions to reform the 
security council so there will be more interaction between the 
five permanent members and the other members of the security 
council, of which we hope to be one again, so that we can 
exercise direct influence on matters of peace.  We have 
participated in peacekeeping all over the world, as recently as 
the terrible Bosnian war, where again we played a significant 
role in bringing about peace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are trying to do today is to work in co-operation with 
the United Nations and with the NATO membership.  If we must bear 
force of arms to put pressure on president Milosevic to come to 
the table and negotiate, our foreign minister, our Prime Minister 
and our government will again play a crucial role as peacemakers. 
We have credibility in the world and we will continue to exercise 
our influence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  There being no 
further members rising, this debate is concluded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pursuant to order made earlier this day, this House stands 
adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 
24(1).
