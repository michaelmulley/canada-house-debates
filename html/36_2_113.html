</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Canadian 
Alliance)</B> moved for leave to introduce Bill C-489, an act to 
amend the Access to Information Act (cabinet confidences). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, in June 1999 the government used the 
provision for total exclusion of cabinet confidences under 
section 69 of the Access to Information Act to keep 172 pages of 
gun registry budget information a state secret. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In September the government used the cabinet confidences 
exclusion again to hide from the public a 115 page report on the 
economic impact of the gun registry.  That was enough for me and 
I knew the law had to be changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this bill is to make certain amendments to the 
act as recommended by the information commissioner in his 1996 
report, The Access to Information Act and the Cabinet 
Confidences:  A Discussion of New Approaches.  The information 
commissioner was kind enough to recommend changes to an earlier 
draft of this bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill makes cabinet confidences mandatory exemptions as 
opposed to exclusions.  This results in the withholding of 
information and documents that are considered cabinet confidences 
being subject to the independent review under the act, rather 
than the entire act being inapplicable to them.  The bill also 
excludes from the exemption documents that refer to but do not 
reveal the substance of cabinet confidences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among other safeguards, this bill would require that requests 
for cabinet confidences be handled only by officers who have 
received the appropriate security clearance.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure today to rise in the House and present over 600 
signatures from my community of Dartmouth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Dartmouth are concerned that the Liberals have 
ignored the top priority of Canadians in the 2000 budget by 
giving only 2% for health care, and that the federal government 
is now only paying 13.5% of the health care costs leading to 
shortages of nurses, hospital beds and emergency spaces in our 
hospitals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Dartmouth want to see an immediate injection of 
federal money back into our health care system bringing it up to 
25% of funding immediately, and also, to implement home care 
programs and a national program for prescription drugs.  They 
want to stop for profit hospitals and federal funding restored 
for health care.

Standing Order 36, I am tabling in the House today a petition 
signed by 5,400 constituents in the riding of Charlevoix. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that the proposed change to the limits of the economic 
region for employment insurance purposes in the federal riding 
of Charlevoix would have dreadful consequences for the affected 
population, and that this proposal does not follow the 
employment insurance regulations on the homogeneity of the work 
market and the bordering regions, 
the petitioners call on the Parliament to maintain the status 
quo, so that the riding of Charlevoix can still be part of the 
former administrative region of northern Quebec.

have the privilege to present two petitions.

petitioners are from Beauport, Quebec City, Sainte-Émilie, 
Saint-Émile, Sainte-Foy, Charlesbourg, Saint-Lambert and 
Victoriaville. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since Canadians consumers cannot take action and protect 
themselves against increases in gasoline prices, the petitioners 
are calling on parliament to pass a resolution to stop world oil 
cartels in order to bring down excessive prices of crude oil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second petition is from the region of Fleurimont, 
Sherbrooke, Lac-Racine, Saint-Denis-de-Brompton, Saint-Pamphile and 
Saint-Marcel. 
The petitioners call on the House of Commons to find a solution 
and to pass a resolution to stop world oil cartels in order to 
bring down excessive prices of crude oil to counter the 
predatory pricing of gasoline in Quebec and in Canada.

concerned about the state of our health care system and the lack 
of action on the part of the Liberal government to address the 
crisis that has now befallen our universal public health care 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sentiments of the petitioners were given some validity 
yesterday with the results of the byelection in Alberta where 
voters overwhelmingly said yes to the NDP and no to bill 11.  The 
petitions that I table today say the same thing, that we should 
stop the cutbacks to health care, stand up against bill 11, save 
the Canadian public health care system, and stop the slide toward 
a two tier American style health care system in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to present this petition urging the House of Commons to 
take a stand in order to bring an end to the dizzying increases 
in the price of gasoline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report on Radio-Canada, last night, proves without any doubt 
that the major refineries in Canada are abusing their monopoly 
position.

surrounding area. 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères—Les-Patriotes, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 36, I am pleased to submit the 
following petition, signed by 381 citizens from Quebec, in 
particular from the riding of Verchères—Les-Patriotes, which I 
have the honour and the pleasure to represent in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners point out first that it is impossible for 
consumers to protect themselves against the dizzying increases 
in the price of gasoline at the pump. They also point out that 
they are a captive clientele for oil products, since no 
alternative source of energy is presently available at a 
reasonable price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the petitioners urge parliament, as a first step, to 
pass a resolution to put an end to the actions of world 
petroleum cartels and, as a consequence, bring down the 
excessive prices of gasoline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the petitioners ask parliament to invest sufficient 
money in research on alternative sources of energy, so that 
consumers will no be longer dependent on oil as their main 
source of energy.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the same 
vein, I would like to table a petition signed by hundreds of 
Quebecers asking that Parliament take action in order to counter 
excessive gas pricing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among other things, those Quebecers ask that adequate funding be 
allocated to research into alternative energy sources so that, 
in the near future, Canadians are no longer forced to turn to 
oil as a main energy source.

people in Brandon, Manitoba, and a few folks in Weyburn, 
Saskatchewan.  They ask the House to abolish the unelected 
Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They say that the Senate is undemocratic, unelected, not 
accountable, costs Canadian taxpayers around $50 million per 
year, and undermines the authority of members of parliament. 
Therefore they ask us to begin the process of abolishing the 
Senate.  Of course that is supported by my friend, the Liberal 
member from New Brunswick.

the government realize that the Bloc Quebecois is opposed to 
Bill C-18. This bill will increase the maximum penalty for 
impaired driving causing death from 14 years to life 
imprisonment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois feels that the 14 year sentence currently 
provided under the Criminal Code is adequate and reflects the 
seriousness of the offence. 
We are simply proposing to delete clause 2 of this bill, which 
changes the penalty for that crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-18 gives us an opportunity to reflect on the 
appropriateness of a jail sentence. In doing so, we must first 
ask ourselves about the needs of the victim, of the offender and 
of the community once a crime has been committed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Victims need to express what they went through and to receive 
compensation for the harm caused to them. They also need to have 
their rights upheld. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Offenders, on the other hand, need to understand their actions 
and to take responsibility for them. They should be given the 
opportunity to explain their action to the victim and also to 
change their behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The community also has needs that must be met. Those needs are 
more abstract, but they are just as important. 
The community wants to be protected from crimes. Sometimes, a 
token bid of restitution is necessary to repair the harm caused 
to the community. Doing community work is a good example of a 
measure that makes up for the prejudice caused by the offender 
to the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are these needs met by imposing a jail sentence? I am tempted to 
say that they are not entirely met under the existing system and 
that they are sometimes not met at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main reason for this situation is that the system pays more 
attention to the fact that a criminal act is perceived as a 
violation of a law, rather than as an action that causes a 
prejudice to the victim and to the community. 
Within this view of criminal justice we are seeking to punish 
the offender instead of trying to remedy the harm he has done to 
the victim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The preferred way of punishing criminals these days seems to be 
imprisonment.  We are stuck in our present approach for 
determining sentences and the reason we are is that we have no 
other means for responding to the needs of the community, the 
victim and the perpetrator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois does not see any way in which increasing to 
life imprisonment the 14 year sentence for impaired driving 
causing death can meet the needs of the community, the victim 
and the perpetrator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The message the Bloc Quebecois is attempting to deliver here is 
not that imprisonment must never be used. 
We know that, under certain circumstances, there is no other 
solution but imprisonment to meet the needs of victims and the 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The criminal code provides a maximum sentence of 14 
years for impaired driving causing death, and we do not feel 
that increasing this to a life sentence will do anything more 
than punish for the sake of punishment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we have said on a number of occasions, the rate of 
imprisonment in Canada is the highest of all democratic 
countries in the west, with the exception of the United States. 
It has, moreover, been proven that not only do incarceration 
rates and sentence lengths do nothing to improve the rate of 
recidivism and the crime rate in general, but they sometimes 
have the opposite effect, and make it worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, we continue to incarcerate people and the federal 
prison population is increasing at a rate that points to a 50% 
rise within the next 10 years.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The adult correctional system cost some $2 billion in 1992. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It cost about $52,000 a year to keep one offender in prison, 
whereas it would have cost $10,000 to supervise an offender in 
the community.  Where are we going with Bill C-18? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is not addressing the problems coherently and is 
proposing a simplistic solution to the scourge of impaired 
driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to conclude with an example to illustrate my 
remarks.  I refer to the case of Kevin Hollinsky of Windsor, 
Ontario. The events of which date back to 1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This young man went with friends, as many adolescents will do, 
to a bar in downtown Windsor.  On his way back, at the wheel of 
his 1985 Firebird, he and his friends tried to catch the 
attention of a group of girls in another car.  Kevin Hollinsky 
was driving too fast and lost control of his car in a dangerous 
curve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consequences of these acrobatics were disastrous.  Two of 
Kevin's friends died in the accident, two others were injured. 
Kevin himself was not hurt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He pleaded guilty to two counts of dangerous driving causing 
death.  For dissuasion purposes, the crown prosecutor sought a 
sentence of 8 to 14 months imprisonment, in order to teach a 
lesson to other young drivers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Local police who worked on the case felt that a very clear 
message needed to be sent that impaired driving causing death 
would carry a jail sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Kevin did not go to jail.  This was because of the 
extraordinary actions of the parents of the two boys who were 
killed and a courageous and innovative judge, who dared to hand 
down a community service sentence instead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is what was decided.  With the co-operation of the Windsor 
police, a program was set up whereby Kevin would visit schools 
with what remained of his car to speak to students about the 
events of that tragic evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Kevin Hollinsky was sentenced to 750 hours of community service 
and met with 8,300 students in the course of this innovative 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For anyone doubtful about the effectiveness of this sentence, I 
should mention that, during the summer following Kevin's 
presentations, no secondary school students were involved in any 
serious or fatal car collisions in the counties of Windsor or 
Essex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A secondary school principal told the police that he was sure 
that this initiative would save lives.  During his 30-year career 
as a teacher, he had never heard a talk that had such a 
powerful impact on students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Admittedly the dissuasive effect would not have been the same if 
young Kevin had been given a jail sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This case was appealed by the crown prosecutor.  Let us not 
forget that the appeal courts have established that a jail 
sentence is appropriate in almost all cases of death resulting 
from a highway accident caused by gross negligence. 
In November 1995, after deliberating half an hour, three appeal 
court judges confirmed the initial sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many people who have committed a serious crime for 
which jail is not necessary and could even be ineffective for 
the offender and for the real needs of the community.  That is 
why the Bloc Quebecois is vigorously opposed to Bill C-18 and is 
proposing that clause 2 simply be dropped from the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all members of the House to reflect on the consequences 
of tougher sentences for impaired driving offences.  I hope that 
the example I have given will convince them to support the Bloc 
Quebecois amendment.

I wonder if I could ask for the indulgence of the House to revert

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Justice 
and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to speak to Bill C-18. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us today is in part the product of the work done 
by the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing committee tabled its report “Toward Eliminating 
Impaired Driving” on May 25, 1999, one year ago.  The committee 
appended to that report a draft bill that the government followed 
very closely when it introduced Bill C-82 on June 7, 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time of introduction, Bill C-82 included a provision that 
would have increased the maximum penalty for impaired driving 
causing death from 14 years imprisonment to life imprisonment. 
This provision was removed from Bill C-82 and then placed in Bill 
C-87.  As amended, Bill C-82 passed and came into force on July 
1, 1999.  Bill C-87 died on the order paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In October 1999 during this current session, the government 
tabled its response to the committee report on impaired driving. 
The government response indicated the intention to reintroduce 
the provision found in Bill C-87 that would increase the maximum 
penalty for impaired driving causing death to life imprisonment. 
In December 1999 the government introduced Bill C-18 which 
includes the provision relating to impaired driving causing 
death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Raising the maximum penalty for impaired driving causing death 
will indicate that this crime is viewed with the same seriousness 
as manslaughter or criminal negligence causing death, which also 
carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.  I remind the House 
that the maximum penalty is reserved for the worst offender and 
the worst set of circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier this year the Supreme Court of Canada handed down a 
unanimous decision in the Proulx appeal.  In the course of its 
reasons the court noted that: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—dangerous driving and impaired driving may be offences for 
which harsh penalties plausibly provide general deterrence. 
These crimes are often committed by otherwise law-abiding 
persons, with good employment records and families.  Arguably, 
such persons are the ones most likely to be deterred by the 
threat of severe penalties. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the extent that penalties deter, the amendment would help in 
the battle against impaired driving.  The increased penalty would 
also be valuable for its denunciation of impaired driving causing 
death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-18 also includes, as promised in the government response 
to the committee's report, a provision that was recommended by 
the committee but not included in the draft bill.  This provision 
would amend section 256 of the criminal code by adding drugs as a 
basis to seek a warrant to obtain a blood sample. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This section currently allows a peace officer to apply for a 
warrant to obtain a blood sample from a driver based on alcohol 
consumption in certain circumstances.  The peace officer must 
reasonably believe that the driver, within the previous four 
hours, was involved as a result of the consumption of alcohol in 
an accident resulting in injury or death.  Also, it must be the 
opinion of a qualified medical practitioner that the driver is 
unable to consent to the taking of a blood sample and that taking 
the sample would not endanger the life or health of the person. 
It is anticipated that situations where police will seek a 
warrant for a blood sample based upon drug consumption will be 
relatively few and that these would involve illegal drugs or the 
abuse of legal drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the impaired driving causing death provision and with the 
blood sample provision, the government will have acted upon each 
of the recommendations for a specific criminal code amendment 
contained in the standing committee's report “Toward Eliminating 
Impaired Driving”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-18 includes two other amendments.  It would change the 
French version of the definition of a motor vehicle to indicate 
that these are vehicles moved otherwise than by muscular power. 
The English version does not have this problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, Bill C-18 would delete the offence of driving while 
prohibited from the list of indictable offences that are within 
the absolute jurisdiction of a provincial court judge under 
section 553 of the criminal code.  Bill C-82 of the previous 
session raised the maximum penalty for driving while prohibited 
from two years imprisonment to five years imprisonment.  The 
charter of rights requires that an accused be given the right to 
a jury trial for an offence that carries a maximum penalty of 
five years imprisonment or more.  The amendment in Bill C-18 will 
bring section 553 into compliance with the charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased that we have seen progress over the past dozen 
years in reducing the fatalities involving impaired driving. 
However, there is yet much distance on the road that lies ahead 
of us on our journey to eliminate impaired driving. Legislation 
alone will not eliminate impaired driving.  I think we can agree 
that continued efforts by governments, public and private 
organizations, and families and individuals are required to 
eliminate impaired driving.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, 
Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to rise in 
support of Bill C-18.  It should be clear that the Canadian 
Alliance has been supportive of this process from the very 
beginning going back to Bill C-82 as well as Bill C-18. These 
government bills came about because of a supply day motion 
introduced by the then Reform Party, the official opposition of 
Canada, back in 1998.  Of course we support it and we commend the 
government for finally getting to the stage where we have the 
complete package together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to speak for just a moment in opposition to the motion 
put forward by the Bloc.  Through the different stages of this 
bill, including report stage, we have seen that the Bloc members 
basically have a different attitude toward those people in our 
society who would drink and drive. We firmly believe that this 
must be regarded by the Criminal Code of Canada and by parliament 
as a criminal offence because that is clearly what it is.  It is 
not simply a social ill as the Bloc would have us believe; it is 
a serious criminal offence.  Approximately 1,500 deaths a year in 
Canada and in excess of 80,000 injuries are a direct result of 
irresponsible unthinking people who would choose to drive their 
vehicles while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.  I am 
happy the drug aspect has been introduced into taking of blood 
samples and the process that is involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-18 and clause 2, which the Bloc seeks to have removed, is 
not about the Kevin Hollinskys of this world and the Bloc member 
knows it.  She knows that all through the committee stage we 
clearly discussed that the extension of the maximum sentence to 
give the judges more latitude was designed specifically to be 
used in the case where there are serious and aggravating factors 
involved in the offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not talking about the Kevin Hollinskys of the world, but 
about hard core offenders who have shown by their actions that 
they care nothing about the safety of society.  They care nothing 
about the laws of the country.  They care nothing about 
responsibility and on occasion after occasion have gotten into 
their automobiles while they were impaired, caused an accident 
and been arrested.  If it was not the ultimate accident which 
resulted in the death of someone, they injured someone.  While 
being under suspension and under the influence, they go out 
driving again, get caught and get some other sentence.  Then they 
get out and are caught again driving while under suspension.  We 
are talking about the incorrigible offenders. That was made very 
clear during all the discussions we had on Bill C-18. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about the incorrigible offenders who simply 
refuse to listen to the law.  As a result, they make themselves a 
menace and a danger to society by their actions.  They get behind 
the wheel of an automobile and pose a serious threat to everyone 
else on the roads.  When they kill somebody, it is because they 
have not taken the responsibility.  They have not recognized the 
law.  They have not recognized the danger they have put the rest 
of society in.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are clearly the type of person that for the sake of the 
safety of society and even for the sake of the safety of their 
own lives, should be sent to prison at the judge's discretion for 
a maximum life term.  It removes them from the highways.  It 
removes their irresponsible acts from the highways.  It removes 
their menace from our highways.  It protects society.  That is 
what we are trying to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We strongly oppose the Bloc amendment. First of all, it is 
presented in the wrong vein.  It is presented using an example 
such as Kevin Hollinsky which is clearly not the intent of Bill 
C-18 or clause 2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We enthusiastically support Bill C-18.  We commend the 
government for dealing with this.  Mr. Speaker, you cannot 
imagine how it tears my heart to commend the government on a 
government bill but it is deserved.  I am sure the government 
will return that praise to our party for introducing it in the 
first place as a supply day motion.  We support the bill and hope 
for its quick passage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would like to ask the unanimous consent of the 
House, to delete the coming into force section of the bill in 
clause 5 which reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This act comes into force on a day to be fixed by order of the 
governor in council. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask for the unanimous consent to delete this so 
as to allow the bill to take effect immediately upon royal 
assent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Does the hon. member have the 
unanimous consent of the House to propose this amendment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  No. 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise 
in the House today to discuss the concern that is on the minds of 
every Canadian when it comes to safety on our roads and highways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I start my preamble today, I would like to give a warm 
welcome to all those veterans and legion members who descended 
upon Halifax for the 38th Dominion convention. They had a 
wonderful parade on Sunday in the pouring rain.  It was great to 
see Haligonians come out in pride to say thank you to the 
veterans and to the legion members for the continuing great work 
they do on behalf of our elderly veterans across the country. We 
are going to give a special tip of the salt and pepper cap to all 
those people across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, I am wearing my tall ships pin today.  I invite all 
members of parliament, their staff, anyone in the viewing 
audience and in Ottawa to come on down to Halifax between July 19 
and 24 to witness the greatest gathering of tall ships in the 
history of our country, a great mariner nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back to the subject at hand, when it comes to impaired driving, 
I do not think there is one Canadian or one parliamentarian who 
would not agree that this is something that we should not even be 
discussing in the new millennium.  Impaired driving is a scourge 
and a curse in our society.  Through proper education and 
enforcement hopefully we can reduce it or eradicate it 
completely.  However, it does absolutely no good to put in all 
the toughest regulations possible if there is not proper 
enforcement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many communities in my riding never see a police officer for 
days.  I am sure it is the same right across the country in the 
rural parts of the nation.  The cuts to the RCMP and to 
provincial and municipal police forces have really put our roads 
in jeopardy not only in terms of impaired drivers but unsafe 
drivers right across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are going to eradicate this problem and save lives, we 
must encourage the federal government and all provincial 
governments to reinvest in our law enforcement officers so they 
can have not only the proper safety checks on the road, 
roadblocks and everything else at New Year's and on special 
holidays but throughout the year. 
Spot checks are a great way of deterring the general public from 
drinking and driving.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another problem is the lack of public transportation.  There is 
absolutely no excuse for someone to drink and drive.  Absolutely 
no excuse at all.  In many cases an individual may have a bit too 
much to drink and because there is no access to public 
transportation, or quick access to it, that may encourage the 
individual, albeit not rightly of course, to think that because 
they cannot get a ride home and a cab is too expensive they will 
chance it and drive.  We have to take that type of thinking away 
from the people who patron our taverns, bars and lounges, or who 
drink in their homes or their neighbours' homes.  We have to 
encourage them to use public transportation or hire a cab if they 
are going to have a few drinks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to give credit to the Brewers' Association of Canada. 
Over the last few years it has been very proactive in encouraging 
its customers who drink spirits, wines and beers to drink 
responsibly.  Kudos go to that association for taking the lead 
approach in that regard, but there is much more it could do.  It 
could start by putting voluntary labelling on bottles.  Or, if it 
refuses to do that voluntarily, it could become mandatory that 
labelling be put on beer bottles, liquor bottles and so on to 
encourage people not to drink and drive.  That is my personal 
point of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have quite graphic advertising planned for cigarettes and I 
believe we should have the same on liquor bottles.  I do not 
necessarily mean pictures, but a warning saying “Please do not 
drink and drive”.  That would go a long way in encouraging 
people to understand that when they drink, getting into a vehicle 
is the worst thing they could possibly do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>MADD, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, is a wonderful association 
which reaches across this country.  It deserves all kinds of 
kudos.  I would go so far as to say that the individuals involved 
with MADD deserve the Order of Canada for all the great work they 
do in bringing this issue to the attention of all members of 
parliament and all legislatures across Canada.  This organization 
brings awareness to this very terrible aspect of our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Statistically it is true that impaired driving charges have 
decreased through proper education and through efforts of 
organizations like MADD and the Brewers' Association of Canada. 
Those organizations encourage and educate all people in our 
society to not drink and drive.  However, it still happens and 
there are many more things we could do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our enforcement people need adequate resources.  We have heard 
enough excuses about budgetary cuts.  If someone dies because of 
budgetary cuts, why the hell were those cuts made in the first 
place?  There is a cause and effect to budgetary restraints and 
cuts.  I am not saying we should operate on deficits for the sake 
of operating on deficits, but if essential services like policing 
are cut in Canada that will have an effect on road safety.  We 
have many concerns about home invasion in rural communities.  We 
also have problems with carjackings, drugs coming into Canada 
through our ports, poor morale in the RCMP and the municipal and 
provincial police forces, which are a direct cause of the cuts 
these departments have had to face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of the police officers I have met love to do what they do. 
They love to serve their country in their capacity as law 
enforcement officers.  Unfortunately, the support they receive 
from the federal and provincial governments is not adequate. 
That has to change.  I believe if we can change the thinking of 
all governments at all levels and work co-operatively together 
with law enforcement agencies we could reduce drunk driving.  It 
is difficult to control 31 million people and their individual 
behaviour, but we could reduce drinking and driving even more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is most unfortunate that the member for Prince 
George—Bulkley Valley was unable to get unanimous consent to 
have this legislation passed quickly.  As the House knows, we 
will be rising possibly this Friday or next week.  I would 
encourage this government and all members of parliament to put 
aside their political differences and move to quickly pass this 
bill.  It would be the right thing to do.  We must do everything 
we can to protect our children, our families and anybody visiting 
Canada who travels on our highways and byways, regardless of 
which political party we belong to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage all members of parliament to support this initiative 
and to do it quickly so that we can protect lives on our streets 
in Canada.

the debate, which everyone is aware focuses on a motion that is 
now before the House to essentially remove a subsection of the 
criminal code, which is before us within Bill C-18.  The proposed 
subsection arrived back here, and I would suggest it is arguably 
the most important part of much needed and anticipated 
legislation pertaining to impaired driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed subsection would replace subsection 255(3) of the 
criminal code with the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(3) Every one who commits an offence under paragraph 253(a) and 
thereby causes the death of any other person is guilty of an 
indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for life. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is very much aimed at the emphasis and putting forward 
parity in the criminal code with respect to individuals who 
embark on this type of reckless behaviour that results in threats 
to life and limb.  We have seen repeatedly the carnage on the 
highways that is the end result of impaired driving.  This is a 
criminal code change that would address that particular problem 
in a direct way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative Party of Canada was very encouraged when the 
government and all other opposition parties, with the exception 
of the Bloc, finally came around to support Bill C-18. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that last year there was capitulation on the part of 
other parties when the government agreed to take this proposed 
subsection out at the urging of the Bloc Quebecois.  Members of 
our party were very tough with this particular item and insisted 
that it remain, and we did receive personal assurances from the 
Minister of Justice that this bill would be reintroduced as a 
stand-alone.  I want to acknowledge and commend the minister for 
following through on her word.  Sadly, we have not seen her 
ability to deliver Bill C-3, the new youth criminal justice act, 
with the same level of efficiency, or timeliness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-82 was the original bill from which this proposed 
subsection was deleted.  It was because our party was insistent 
on it being reintroduced that we see it here today.  After that 
long period of delay, it is encouraging.  The timing, of course, 
is very important.  With the summer months now upon us, 
graduations coming up, with more and more people on the highways 
headed to cottages and to the shore, impaired driving sadly is a 
threat to all individuals on the highways.  This bill would send 
a proper message of deterrence, both general and specific 
deterrence, for those who are foolhardy enough to embark on 
impaired driving and jeopardize other's lives in a very serious 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All members of the committee will recall, and I certainly 
recall, working closely with members of Mothers Against Drunk 
Driving, who have been very much in support of changes to toughen 
up our legislation pertaining to impaired driving, and this 
subsection in particular was one upon which they were insistent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The life imprisonment provision does send the message of 
deterrence that we seek to send.  I want to personally thank 
members of MADD for their consistent support for legislative 
change, and this bill in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to acknowledge the contribution of all members of 
the justice committee for enabling this legislation to make 
it through the committee, and to do so quickly.  Now that we have 
the amendment at report stage, although I know the Bloc Quebecois 
may be opposed to this provision, I do commend and acknowledge 
its commitment to exercising its right to oppose and to its 
participation in the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the report stage will not be delayed any further, 
particularly with respect to this important legislation, with the 
timetable we have and the likelihood that parliament will wrap up 
this week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke earlier of the summer vacations that our now upon us. 
There are many families and individuals across the country who 
will be on the roads, and needlessly impaired drivers could cause 
fatalities and absolute horrific carnage to individual lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hard-core drinkers who continue to embark on this exercise 
of drinking and driving, getting behind the wheel and endangering 
Canadian lives, is exactly the type of individual who this bill 
addresses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The message that drinking and driving will not be tolerated in 
that form and fashion is one that we wish to send from this place 
forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From day one the Conservative Party stressed this as a 
priority.  The government has acknowledged that by bringing it 
forward today. 
It is high time that we put emphasis on the protection of human 
lives and the needless tragedies and loss of life that we see on 
the roads and highways throughout the country.  They are a 
testament to the need and to the void that existed prior to this 
bill coming into effect.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the original debate of Bill C-82 we were very worried 
when other parties softened their position with respect to the 
life imprisonment aspect of the bill.  This was done, many will 
recall, in exchange for speedy passage through the House, but now 
we have come full circle and we are seeing the inclusion of this 
important provision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is now before us in a separate form, but it very much 
complements and works with the previous legislative changes that 
took place in the last session.  This will improve the bill and 
will give police further powers and the courts the further 
ability to mete out sentences that are more indicative and more 
reflective of the serious type of negligent behaviour that is 
encompassed by impaired drivers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 was another important bill that we would have liked to 
have seen come through, as I mentioned earlier, but that has not 
happened.  However, we do embrace this bill and support it 
wholeheartedly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative Party has been adamant all along that the 
provision of life imprisonment be reinstated and that judges be 
allowed greater leeway, greater discretion to reflect public 
outrage and public sentiment about the seriousness of taking 
another's life through an automotive accident where alcohol is 
involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tragically, many people have experienced an impaired driving 
accident.  There are few Canadians who have not been touched by 
the tragedy of an impaired driving accident.  Careless actions 
and careless behaviour of drivers when it involves alcohol have 
to be treated with the same type of response that we see in other 
actions that are reflected in the criminal code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Criminal offences involving drunk drivers declined by 23% 
between 1994 and 1997, but we do know that there are staggering 
numbers who are not caught and continue to drive under the 
influence.  It is hoped that through the efforts of all present 
we will have this legislation before the Canadian people.  It 
will benefit all in the country and send a message of deterrence 
that is so important in changing and refocusing the attitudes 
toward this criminal behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is very much a part of this exercise.  Putting forward a 
more vehement message of deterrence, emphasizing that this is 
behaviour that will not be tolerated, emphasizing that this is 
the type of behaviour that will warrant serious criminal 
sanctions up to life imprisonment, will help to send that message 
out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If and when Bill C-18 passes, the Liberal government should not 
rest on its laurels, for certainly it and all governments should 
continue their fight against impaired driving.  Many suggest that 
we should be lowering alcohol levels even further, some to a zero 
tolerance level.  There was lengthy discussion of other ways to 
approach the problem of impaired driving, so the fight is not 
over and there is more to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ontario and Alberta are two provinces that have been at the 
forefront in bringing forward legislative changes and putting in 
place provincial statutes to address this problem.  Provincial 
statistics show that more than 300 people were killed in drunk 
driving related accidents in the year 1997.  In Ontario there is 
a legislative initiative that if caught three times for impaired 
driving a lifetime suspension will follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that fines have been increased.  Judges now have the 
ability to impose sanctions with respect to the use of driver 
interlock systems, which is an innovative technical advance that 
will allow a person convicted of impaired driving to continue 
driving if they comply and take full responsibility for the cost 
of installation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time for the government to follow the lead of some of the 
provinces that are moving in that direction.  Innocent victims 
who are killed as a result of thoughtlessness and selfishness on 
the part of impaired drivers have to be addressed in a serious 
way. The federal government has an opportunity to send the 
message that drinking and driving will not be tolerated.  Bill 
C-18 is a step in that direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislative initiative, as I said, complements legislation 
that was brought in in the last session, legislation that 
expanded the window of time that police have to take samples up 
to three hours.  The legislation also strictly enforced the .08 
blood alcohol concentration level and made effective amendments 
to help police in the performance of their duties.  Surveys 
indicate that it takes police officers on average two hours and 
48 minutes to process criminal code charges involving impaired 
driving.  Therefore, there is a greater need for a streamlined 
approach to the way in which impaired drivers are handled by the 
police. 
Physical sobriety tests and passive alcohol sensors will also 
help the police in their important task.

<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, we know there is a need to fill another gaping hole in 
the criminal code as it pertains to impairment by drugs, which is 
not as easy to detect as alcohol.  The province of British 
Columbia has taken very innovative steps in training police 
officers to be able to recognize the impairment symptoms brought 
about by the use of drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Police do their very best, and I commend all officers and those 
involved in the criminal justice system, but they are often 
frustrated by the fact that technicalities result in cases being 
thrown out of court on many occasions.  Police are still denied 
the right to demand an automatic breath or blood sample from 
those involved in accidents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just wanted to indicate that there is more that can be done. I 
believe education plays a big part in that.  Part of this debate 
will hopefully educate the public in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament has put aside its partisan attitudes on this level. 
We are glad to see this legislation come in.  Graduations are 
coming up and we hope that all students will embark on a very 
safe, alcohol free graduation.

<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Raymond Chan (for the Minister of Foreign Affairs, 
Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-19, an act respecting genocide, crimes 
against humanity and war crimes and to implement the Rome Statute 
of the International Criminal Court, and to make consequential 
amendments to other acts, be read the third time and passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, on December 10, 1999, Human Rights Day, 
our Minister of Foreign Affairs tabled Bill C-19, the crimes 
against humanity and war crimes act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation will implement in Canada the Rome statute of 
the international criminal court and strengthen the foundation 
for criminal prosecutions in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is now in its final stages.  I would like to take this 
opportunity to recognize the very important work done by members 
of the standing committee and the many witnesses who contributed 
to the examination of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-19 brings Canadian law into line with the Rome statute 
which was adopted by delegates of the Rome Diplomatic Conference 
in July 1998.  Once 60 countries have ratified this treaty, a 
permanent international criminal court will be created in the 
Hague which will try individuals accused of committing the most 
heinous crimes known to humanity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are already 97 countries which are signatories to the 
statute, 12 of which have already ratified.  The 12 ratifications 
represent a doubling in number since the introduction of this 
bill in the House. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1105"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT13"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT13"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1105

<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This progress is excellent, and It is especially encouraging to 
note that the most recent country to ratify was France, which did 
so last Friday.  France's ratification is of particular 
significance as its government was initially quite opposed to the 
international criminal court.  This demonstrates the momentum 
that is occurring worldwide for this initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of the court is a revolutionary progression in the 
struggle for universal peace.  Many individual Canadians have 
fought diligently at every step to ensure that the ICC would 
become a reality.  In particular, I would like to highlight the 
contribution made by Ambassador Philippe Kirsch who chaired the 
negotiations in Rome and was assisted by a committed team of 
Canadian officials.  They have demonstrated tremendous leadership 
in bringing the nations of the world together on an extremely 
complex issue.  In this same spirit, many other Canadians have 
acted as leaders at the non-governmental level to ensure that 
every individual in the global community is able to live in an 
environment of peace and security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opportunity for Canadians to be leaders in ensuring that the 
international criminal court is made a reality has not, however, 
ended.  Rather, Canadians must remain vigilant and demonstrate 
resolve in our efforts to make the ICC a success at every stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the moment, we as parliamentarians must play our part in the 
implementation of the Rome statute.  The importance of Canada 
ratifying the Rome statute cannot be overstated.  A common theme 
that echoes throughout parliamentary committee hearings came from 
NGO representatives who stressed that it was of importance not 
only to Canadians but to the global community that Canada ratify 
the Rome statute as soon as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two reasons why Amnesty International, Human Rights 
Watch, Rights and Democracy, Women's Caucus for Gender Justice 
and other esteemed organizations continuously stressed the need 
for Canada to quickly act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first reason is that most countries prefer to follow rather 
than lead.  Many countries are hesitant to ratify the statute 
because many countries that normally take the lead on such issues 
have themselves not yet ratified.  Our ratification of the 
statute will place Canada in its familiar role of leadership in 
the national arena.  We must demonstrate this leadership as 
atrocities continue to be committed throughout the world.  It is 
incumbent that we exert every effort to bring the ICC into being 
as soon as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The human rights NGOs also stated that it was imperative that 
Canada ratify the statute because the proposed crimes against 
humanity and war crimes act is the first comprehensive 
implementing legislation to be developed by any country.  The 
Canadian legislation has been heralded by NGOs as model 
legislation that will be studied and borrowed from by other 
countries throughout the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to focus for a moment on the committee stage 
which, under the direction of the hon. member for Toronto 
Centre—Rosedale, the chair of the Standing Committee on Foreign 
Affairs and International Trade, was thorough and comprehensive. 
The enlightened debate that took place at the committee meetings 
between parliamentarians and witnesses representing a wide 
variety of interests, has ensured that Bill C-19 is well crafted 
and that it meets the needs of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many amendments have been made to Bill C-19 as a result of the 
suggestions that were put forward by NGOs and committee members. 
I would now like to highlight some of these amendments. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1110"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT14"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT14"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1110

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The crimes against humanity and war crimes act has been amended 
to ensure that Canada will be able to fully prosecute individuals 
who commit mass murder, rape, torture or any other similar 
heinous crimes against humanity.  The customary international law 
definitions of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes 
will now be recognized inside Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's ability to assert universal jurisdiction for these 
crimes has also been streamlined and simplified.  Now, as long as 
the person accused of the crime is found in Canada, they will 
fall under our jurisdiction, regardless of when or where the 
crime took place.  This change ensures that those who have 
committed or who commit in the future the most egregious crimes 
will not find a safe haven in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to ensure that one issue raised by some NGOs 
at committee stage is fully clarified.  Much trouble has been 
caused by the words direct and indirect which appear in the Rome 
statute but not in the corresponding article in the Geneva 
Conventions section on transfers of population. I want to 
reassure the House that the preparatory commission in New York 
has resolved the problem, agreeable to all, by adding a footnote 
which essentially reaffirms that the provision has the same 
effect as the corresponding offence in the Geneva Conventions, 
ratified by Canada and implemented by parliament twice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fundamental importance of the ICC is that it will ensure 
that individuals who persist in committing shocking violations 
against the global community will be held accountable for their 
actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is sad that humanity can make so many advances in knowledge, 
in the sciences, in technology and in so many other areas, yet 
peace has always eluded the world.  The world has never known a 
period when war did not rage somewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 20th century in fact, despite our progress, has been the 
bloodiest century known to humanity.  The violence that we have 
known this century has been so unparalleled that the word 
genocide itself had to be created to denote the level of violence 
that had previously been unknown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this century we have seen far too many peoples targeted and 
murdered en masse simply because of who they were.  All too often 
those who perpetrated the violence have escaped justice.  The ICC 
will ensure that the Stalins, the Hitlers and the Pol Pots of the 
world will never again be able to act with such impunity.  The 
ICC will be the permanent, independent institution which will 
serve humanity blindly and ensure that the 21st century will be 
one in which universal accountability is demanded and protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The international community must show resolve in continuing to 
push countries to ratify the Rome statute.  The situation in 
Sierra Leone is an unfortunate illustration of the immediate need 
for the ICC.  It is also useful as serving as an example of how 
the ICC will serve the interests of Canadians in doing our part 
in promoting the values which we hold dear to our hearts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Foreign Affairs has done tremendous work in the 
promotion of human security.  Human security puts the needs of 
people first, and the situation in Sierra Leone illustrates how 
the ICC can promote the rights of individuals throughout the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Foreign Affairs has been making great efforts to 
promote awareness on the issue of war affected children.  Many of 
us have seen the images of small children wielding weapons that 
were bigger than they were.  Children as young as nine in some 
conflicts are routinely drugged and sent out as cannon fodder to 
benefit and protect cowardly warlords.

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To take advantage of children in this manner is beyond 
unconscionable.  It is outrageous and it cannot be tolerated by 
individuals who consider themselves to be civilized.  The ICC, 
once established, will provide the global community with the 
mechanism to go after the individuals who turn children into 
killers by providing within the Rome statute that it is a crime 
against humanity to employ children in warfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly the image of children brandishing guns is not the most 
horrific to emerge from Sierra Leone.  Instead it is the image of 
children as well as those of countless men and women who have had 
their limbs hacked off that is more enduring.  It is perhaps this 
image of small children with stumps where their hands once were 
that best exemplifies why the world needs a permanent court to 
hold the individuals who perpetrate these acts accountable before 
the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ICC will ensure that the climate of impunity that has been 
tolerated for centuries will be replaced by a culture of 
accountability.  The court's creation will send a strong signal 
to all corners of the world that the international community will 
no longer stand idly by while innocent persons are massacred. 
Criminals will no longer be able to stand behind borders safe 
from prosecution.  They will instead answer for their crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act and the ICC will also ensure that those who aid in 
committing these crimes or who profit from these crimes will have 
to likewise answer for their actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation in Sierra Leone, for example, has been financed by 
the trade in diamonds.  Without the trade in diamonds there would 
be no guns.  Canadian diamond companies have acted responsibly in 
Sierra Leone.  Yet there are companies from other countries 
operating in Sierra Leone that have provided the people who hack 
off children's hands with the money to commit these crimes. 
Legislation such as this act will help ensure that these 
companies, like the perpetrators themselves, will be held 
accountable for their actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important that it be made clear the ICC will be a 
neutral, non-politicized court whose prosecutors and judges will 
meet the highest professional standards and will be elected by an 
assembly of state parties.  It is worth citing the excellent work 
done by Madam Louise Arbour who served as the chief prosecutor on 
the international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. 
Madam Arbour, who now serves Canadians as a supreme court 
justice, demonstrated the level of professionalism, integrity and 
commitment to justice that we can expect to see from those who 
will perform similar functions for the international criminal 
court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have long demonstrated the intellectual and moral 
courage to play a leadership role in promoting peace and security 
for all of humanity.  I praise those Canadians who have 
ceaselessly contributed to ensuring that the rule of law is 
extended throughout the world to all persons irrespective of who 
they are.  I hope we as parliamentarians, as representatives of 
the Canadian people, can continue to demonstrate the commitment 
of Canadians to ensuring that mass murderers, rapists, those who 
mutilate children and all war criminals will never again escape 
justice.

Mr. Speaker, I listened to the statement by the secretary of

Alliance as the official opposition chief critic for foreign 
affairs to deliver our final answer to the government's proposed 
Bill C-19 that will fulfil Canada's obligations in the

In my 40 minute speech in early April I highlighted our position.

ensuring that criminals, those monsters who have blood on their

that justice is served.  This is a very important justice issue. 
Criminals must be brought to account.

trip to China helped the committee to proceed with the bill's 
amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance and many of the witnesses appearing before 
the committee hearings on Bill C-19 went to great lengths to hold 
the flashlight for the Liberals in order to help them do a good 
job.  It is unfortunate that the government's treatment of the 
bill cannot be helped.  The Prime Minister and Minister of 
Foreign Affairs have proceeded with this legislation in a 
perfunctory manner.  By that I mean there are many outstanding 
issues in the international community concerning the 
international criminal code.  The Liberals know this but still 
they have gone ahead with this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill was substantially amended by the foreign affairs 
committee.  Even so, many unanswered questions remain concerning 
the effects of Canada fulfilling our obligations under the ICC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The international community is currently negotiating many of 
these concerns as we speak.  In their haste the Liberals have 
placed the cart before the horse by having parliament pass 
legislation before definitions, procedures and other details have 
been decided.  All Canadians want the interests of the victims of 
these crimes to be addressed and justice to be done with respect 
to heinous crimes that too often go unpunished.  This is a step 
in the right direction, the creating of an international judicial 
system which declares that no one including the heads of state is 
above the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An amendment of the Canadian Alliance was put forward at 
committee to make sure that the Liberals would include 
prosecuting heads of state.  That was not clear in the original 
bill, Bill C-19, that was introduced before the committee 
hearings.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The ICC rules of procedure and evidence, including the 
definition of terms such as aggression, conditions of 
imprisonment, judicial protocol and many others need to be 
clearly defined.  In addition we are concerned about the 
proliferation of the United Nations bureaucracy when temporary ad 
hoc human rights tribunals such as the international tribunals 
for Bosnia and Rwanda will suffice to deal with these crimes on a 
case by case basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The advantage of an ad hoc tribunal is that it can be dismantled 
when its work is done and no permanent bureaucracy is created. 
Until the international community reaches agreement on these 
kinds of ICC related details we believe this is a superior 
option. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance supports the principles and the idea 
behind the Rome statute providing the means for prosecution of 
war crimes.  The Rome statute is a document that initiates the 
ICC.  Canada's ratification of the Rome statute is the genesis of 
Bill C-19.  Our ratification of the Rome statute is not due until 
December 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are certain questions which still remain unanswered.  Why 
has the government insisted on passing the bill this week when 
the House is recessing?  Why not wait until the important 
meetings concerning the ICC have been held by the international 
community when we will have more information available to decide 
on?  Why not wait until the definitions and rules of the ICC have 
been decided by the international community?   When we know the 
rules of the game it will be easier to play the game, but when 
the rules of the game have not been decided how can we think of 
going into the field and playing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday the United Nations began three weeks of meetings 
concerning the ICC, but today the House will have finished debate 
on this matter.  The matter will be closed after today.  This is 
a travesty of democracy.  Bill C-19 requires Canadians to support 
something that is still under negotiation by the international 
community.  It is premature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government is extremely negligent in failing to seek 
approval for Canada's position from parliament.  Instead 
parliament is being treated as a rubber stamp for negotiations 
carried out with input from unelected lobby groups but with no 
input from elected representatives of Canadians.  Canadians are 
forced to watch from the sidelines as the Liberals sign and 
implement yet another international agreement.  We have seen this 
pattern too often.  It was quite evident when we went to the 
Kyoto, Rio, Cairo and Beijing conventions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are used to going to conventions without doing 
their homework and in the back seat of the bus writing the 
policy, the terms and the conditions of their position.  Then 
they present us with a fait accompli.  This is a disgrace to 
Canada's democratic institutions and the spirit of openness and 
accountability which Canadians deserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation remains unfinished business.  Whether or not the 
government passes it, it will remain unfinished business. I 
wonder sometimes if the Prime Minister is forcing his own 
political agenda on Canadians and our international allies.  Is 
he causing the premature passage of this bill so that he is free 
to call an election in the fall without worrying whether Canada 
has ratified the creation of the ICC by December 1? 
That would be irresponsible and negligent.  It is a very 
important bill, a very important treaty and we need to scrutinize 
it carefully.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Witness after witness who appeared before the foreign affairs 
committee on this bill warned the Liberals that they should not 
be passing such an important bill with such serious ramifications 
for the free world unless it was foolproof and ironclad.  This 
bill is full of holes and it is largely undefined.  Everyone 
knows that this is not a secret. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee heard witness after witness testify to a litany of 
problems with the bill, yet the Prime Minister is forcing the 
country to take the risks of passing legislation that may see our 
own Canadian forces personnel prosecuted and punished because the 
government passed legislation before it knew what the law was 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I do not believe that.  I feel that we will be here 
next September until probably December, and that is when this 
work should have been done.  This bill needed to wait until at 
least September in order for elected representatives in the House 
to take into consideration the most recent possible developments 
in the international negotiations concerning the ICC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If necessary, the new Canadian Alliance government would have 
passed this bill before the December deadline.  In fact, I would 
recommend that an alliance government would repeal Bill C-19 so 
that the work that needs to be done actually gets done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ramifications of the bill are not going to disappear for 
some time.  There is work to be done once the decisions 
concerning procedures, evidence and the definitions are finalized 
by the international community.  That is when this bill should 
come before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance delivered 20 amendments to the bill at 
committee stage.  I would like to highlight a few of those 
amendments so that members of the House, as well as viewers, can 
see it from our perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We proposed an amendment calling for the Rome statute to be 
appended to the bill.  That is the practice parliament followed 
with the Geneva Convention on the Laws of War and Protocols I and 
II to the conventions.  That is also the practice parliament 
followed with the North American Free Trade Agreement.  Why does 
it not want to do that in this case? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also proposed to amend the interpretation clause of the bill 
by adding a clause declaring “notwithstanding anything this act, 
Canada's national sovereignty is to be protected”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In another amendment, we proposed adding two lines ensuring 
“international law is not to be permitted to supersede Canadian 
law”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments were needed because it was not even clear in 
the bill that Canada's sovereignty would be protected and that 
Canadian law would remain supreme. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance also received numerous representations 
from Canadians who maintained that it violated the rule of law to 
create retroactivity.  This would have the effect of convicting 
an individual in an uncontested manner.  We proposed an amendment 
that said “nothing in this act should cause Canadian courts to 
treat crimes allegedly committed outside of Canada 
retroactively”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We tried to help the government with its bill.  We proposed 
adding the contents of subsection 21(2) of the criminal code to 
the bill.  This useful section of the criminal code should be 
Bill C-19. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1135"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsection 21(2) reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where two or more persons form an intention in common to carry 
out an unlawful purpose and to assist each other therein and any 
one of them, in carrying out the common purpose, commits an 
offence, each of them who knew or ought to have known that the 
commission of the offence would be a probable consequence of 
carrying out the common purpose is a party to that offence. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the committee's discussions with the lawyers we were assured 
that the Criminal Code of Canada would be applied if need be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill had two definitions of war crimes and crimes against 
humanity:  one definition, if the crimes are committed in Canada; 
and the other, if the crimes are committed abroad.  We proposed 
one definition: no matter where the crimes are committed.  How 
can we have two definitions of crime whether it is committed in 
Canada or abroad?  It is a matter of common sense.  The 
government had its own amendment which took care of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another amendment ensured that the accused had to intend 
inhumanity and know that the act was inhumane without using the 
word inhumane.  The bill needs to state what the mental element 
is for the crimes.  There is such a statement in the Rome 
statute, article 30.  The problem Cory J. posed in Finta said 
that an accused had to intend inhumanity, that the trial judge 
was right in saying that the accused must know that his act was 
inhumane, is not addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Justice Cory in the case of R v Finta said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that the (war crimes) section was passed to bring to 
trial those who inflicted death and cruel suffering in a knowing, 
pre-meditated, calculated way.  The essential quality of a war 
crime or a crime against humanity is that the accused must be 
aware of or wilfully blind to the fact that he or she is 
inflicting untold misery on his victims.  The requisite mental 
element of a war crime or a crime against humanity should be 
based on a subjective test. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance proposed another amendment making it clear 
that non-state actors and heads of state can be prosecuted for 
genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.  This is not 
clear in the bill.  We proposed an amendment to add the contents 
of section 21(2) of the criminal code to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current criminal code provision 7(3.77) was not to be found 
in the bill.  We called for it to be included, but I will not go 
into the details. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We proposed many other amendments.  The Canadian Alliance forced 
these issues to be dealt with by the government.  We proposed an 
amendment preventing pardon without trial.  We proposed an 
amendment that would exclude the defence of superior orders. 
This could not be done as it was already provided for under 
Canadian law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also proposed an amendment that would have the effect of 
establishing that the judge should decide whether the order was 
manifestly unlawful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we proposed another amendment obliging the government 
to table documents concerning the negotiations taking place to 
decide rules of evidence and certain definitions for the ICC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surprisingly, Liberal backbenchers also offered amendments to 
Bill C-19.  Everyone tried to fix this bill but it is still 
broken.  It could have been divided into two:  One bill for the 
ICC and the other for the codification of the crimes.  This would 
have helped.  It at least was going in the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is full of holes and may threaten our national 
security.  The United States of America is adopting strong 
legislation to deal with suspected war criminals and perpetrators 
of these crimes.  This may cause suspected criminals to use 
Canada as their hideout.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are concerned that these suspects will try to join with 
organized crime and people smuggler brethren already in Canada. 
Those undesirables are already here because of the Liberal 
government's lax money laundering and illicit drug laws, and its 
flawed and broken immigration and refugee system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the time the international community has completed work on 
the ICC, the Liberals will have long forgotten about it.  The 
Liberals will think they have washed their hands of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the report stage last Friday, the House was forced to 
consider nine amendments from the Bloc Quebecois, which was a 
waste of the government's time.  The Liberals were surprised to 
see those amendments.  The submission of the amendments was a 
denial of the work by the foreign affairs committee.  By the time 
the report stage arrived, everyone knew that as many changes as 
possible were completed.  There was no more work to be done on 
Bill C-19 and its state of incompletion could not be corrected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until more developments take place in terms of the international 
community's work on the bill, where negotiations are taking 
place, everyone knows that the government has moved as far it is 
going to move.  That was about three hours of wasted time at 
report stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, on behalf of right thinking Canadians who believe 
in getting the job done, doing a good job and doing things right, 
I will work to save taxpayers' money.  I will not waste any more 
of the House's time on this bill because the taxpayers are paying 
for this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian public expected the government to do a good job in 
satisfying Canadian obligations under an international criminal 
court.  They trusted this government to properly enact the crimes 
against humanity, genocide and other war crimes, but it has not 
done that.  It has again disappointed Canadians, like so many 
other badly managed federal government responsibilities, such as 
tax relief, criminal justice, youth criminal justice system, 
health care, HRDC, gas prices, brain drain, and the list goes on. 
This is work that has not been done or done badly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance supports Canada withholding our full 
acceptance until parliament has ratified the rules of procedure 
and evidence for the ICC.  These rules will not be ready for some 
months.  The government should have waited before proceeding with 
Bill C-19. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian negotiators met with the foreign affairs committee 
approximately one week before their departure to Rome.  Upon 
cross-examination at committee, the officials said that they did 
not know what the details of the agreement might be.  They did 
not know what it might cost.  They did not think that any major 
offending countries would sign it.  They did not think the 
Americans would sign it.  They could not answer questions about 
the make-up of the court at that time.  Above all, they would 
sign the agreement without knowing all these things.  This is 
what has happened.  It is not new.  They have done it again and 
again, and that is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance will hold the Liberals responsible by 
voting against Bill C-19.  It is too bad.  I hope there will be 
an election soon.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to rise here this morning to speak to third reading of Bill C-19. 
The full title of this bill is an act respecting genocide, 
crimes against humanity and war crimes and to implement the Rome 
Statute of the International Criminal Court, and to make 
consequential amendments to other acts. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1145"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The short title of this bill is Crimes Against Humanity Act.  I 
was looking for the bill's title at report stage, because I 
wanted to point out the spirit of the committee's deliberations. 
It transcended partisan divisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would therefore point out that thanks to a Bloc Quebecois 
amendment, the short title reads Crimes Against Humanity and War 
Crimes Act.  It is our understanding that genocide is a crime 
against humanity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although we would have liked the bill to be even more 
progressive and to give Canadian courts broader international 
jurisdiction, we will vote for it with enthusiasm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is the stone Canada is adding to the international 
edifice that will be the international criminal court once 60 
countries have ratified the statute of Rome.  What point have we 
reached today?  I believe that 12 countries have ratified it so 
far.  So we need another 48 to make the 60. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Government of 
Canada and senior public servants, who worked with international 
officials to draft the statute of Rome first and then Bill C-19, 
were in a hurry, just like the NGOs that came before us to say 
how it was urgent for Canada to pass this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite this context, we wanted the committee to work as 
responsibly as possible.  I have to say that it did and that we 
reached an honourable conclusion, even though it is not quite as 
we would like it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is therefore adding its stone. 
As soon as the bill is passed by the Senate, Canada will become 
the 13th, 14th or 15th signatory. I must point out that we are 
still far from having 60 countries. All those who support this 
initiative are hoping that it will not take years, as is the 
case with some conventions, before getting the required number 
of countries for the Rome Statute to reach its full potential 
with the establishment of the International Criminal Court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-19 does not only seek to have this international court in 
place some day, with the powers provided under the Rome Statute. 
It also means that, until then, Canada will have the authority 
to try criminals who committed crimes under the definition 
provided in the Rome statute, not the letter but the spirit of 
that statute.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>After consultation—and we agreed with that proposal—we ensured 
that the definitions would be exactly the same for the 
implementation of the Rome statute and for trying criminals in 
Canada under the criminal code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read these definitions because they give the exact 
measure of what the Canadian courts will deal with when they 
have the mandate to do so, and what the international criminal 
court will tackle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These definitions are as follows: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“crime against humanity” means murder, extermination, 
enslavement, deportation, imprisonment, torture, sexual 
violence, persecution or any other inhumane act or omission that 
is committed against any civilian population or any identifiable 
group and that, at the time and in the place of its commission, 
constitutes a crime against humanity according to customary 
international law or conventional international law or by virtue 
of its being criminal according to the general principles of law 
recognized by the community of nations, whether or not it 
constitutes a contravention of the law in force at the time and 
in the place of its commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“war crime” means an act...committed during an armed conflict 
that, at the time and in the place of its commission, 
constitutes a war crime according to customary international law 
or conventional international law applicable to armed conflicts, 
whether of not it constitutes a contravention of the law in 
force at the time and in the place of its commission. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A country could not use the argument that a person accused and 
prosecuted under the applicable conventional international law 
had the right to say “But that is not the law of my country”. 
This is why there is international law and an international 
criminal court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the definitions given in the bill we read the following: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“genocide” means an act or omission committed with intent to 
destroy, in whole or in part, an identifiable group of persons, 
as such, that, at the time and in the place of its commission, 
constitutes genocide according to customary international law or 
conventional international law or by virtue of its being 
criminal according to the general principles of law recognized 
by the community of nations, whether or not it constitutes a 
contravention of the law in force at the time and in the place 
of its commission. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For Canada, implementation of the Rome Statute marks the 
beginning of the realization of a dream.  That dream is one of 
justice that cannot be less than international, because it is a 
justice that cannot be blocked by the rank, the power or the 
wealth of those who it is felt must be prosecuted under 
customary international law by this International Criminal 
Court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Rome Statute marks the realization of a dream. 
The definitive realization of that dream will be ratification of 
the Rome Statute, or almost so, for there are still some 
obstacles to that realization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until now, the acts or omissions 
covered by the three definitions were viewed, with amazement, 
horror or sometimes admiration, within the country concerned or 
elsewhere, as the expression of a relationship of power within 
humankind, whose cruelty seems to know no limits.  Consequently, 
the only thing that could be used against that force was another 
force, either the force of numbers, in the case of democracy, or 
the force of arms against another country, and this would mean 
war.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This marks a turning point in world history, a desire to break 
with relationships of force alone, both within and between 
countries.  Obstacles lie ahead however.  The Rome statute must 
be ratified by 60 countries, and we hope that we will have those 
signatures soon. But there will be other obstacles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally, the court does not have jurisdiction over non-member 
countries, although, through the UN Security Council, the 
court's investigator is empowered to investigate anywhere at all 
and to lay charges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But there will understandably be wrestling matches with a number 
of countries. 
We know that we have not reached the end of the road yet.  But 
at least we have the emergence of a tool that could, to a 
certain degree, ensure that justice is done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our troubles are not over yet, however, because once a highly 
placed criminal is brought before the criminal court, evidence 
and witnesses will still have to be produced. The case of the 
international court established for Rwanda shows only too 
clearly how difficult it is, when charges are laid against the 
leader of a country or a member of a victorious organization, to 
come up with witnesses, because they might find themselves in 
situations beyond the control of the court or of other countries 
should they return to their own country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is all I will say for now about the many obstacles we face. 
I am not going to dwell either on the scepticism some feel about 
this court, and who have said “Will the existence of this court 
not cause dictators to do all they can to remain in power as 
long as possible or to create some pretence of justice or an 
international court in their own countries?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will avoid this scepticism in order to point out just how 
much, like other major international movements in support of 
human rights, which have enabled the international community to 
create mechanisms that, unfortunately, often go unheeded, 
because they are not used enough or because it is tempting, in 
certain circumstances, to forget or ignore them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, this great desire for international justice will begin 
to take shape in each of the member countries and, we hope, in 
every country, with a little pressure.

than great and that the trends we are seeing now in the former 
Soviet Union, in many African countries and even in South 
America, and in other major countries as well, cause us some 
concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note—I am not making a direct link between the two, although 
sometimes I wonder—that the United States' desire to be exempt 
from the application of decisions by the international criminal 
court does not please many countries. 
The fact that the United States did not want any criminal to be 
tried without Security Council concurrence, which means a veto 
by the U.S. and other countries, did not please democrats and 
those wishing to see justice throughout the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, Bill C-19 is but the first step in a lengthy 
process, which must be built not only on justice but also on 
democracy.  This will be a lengthy process, because democracy 
cannot take root in countries where hunger is rampant and there 
is governmental corruption because it is so easy to be corrupt. 
I know many share my concern about this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-19 is also going to transform the landscape of Canadian 
justice in a way. 
In future, the courts will no longer be unable to follow up on 
their jurisdiction, as some felt had occurred in the Finta case. 
From now on, Canada and Canadian courts will be able to 
prosecute criminals accused of crimes against humanity, genocide 
or war crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we find regrettable is that the accused will have to either 
be Canadians or have perpetrated their crimes against Canadians. 
This universal jurisdiction Canada assumes is not, therefore, 
the broader universal jurisdiction which we would have liked to 
have seen and which other countries, such as Belgium, and Spain, 
have assumed.  This is regretful.  We do, however, take note 
that the witnesses before the committee have said that Canada 
could, at a later date, extend that jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While there is general support for the bill, we felt it would be 
appropriate to submit these amendments, not to delay the 
proceedings, but to say before the House and to put it on record 
that there is still work to be done. It may be that, at some 
future stage, surely because of the pressure by NGOs—certain 
events may occur—that position will become mandatory for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until then, I have another regret, namely the fact that the 
whole Rome Statute is not included in a schedule to the bill, to 
the act. Why? Because if the Rome Statute had been included in a 
schedule to the act, it would have been easy for all those 
involved in Quebec and in Canada to provide training on the 
International Criminal Court.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, we are told that it is easy to find this statute on 
the Internet. That is true, but I hope that we are not about to 
be told “No need to give you a hard copy of the bill, you can 
access it on the Internet”. If it is desirable to have the bill 
on paper, it is also desirable to have the Rome Statute in a 
schedule to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also regret that the Rome Statute was not submitted to the 
House of Commons, and we say that of every treaty or convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just came out of a committee meeting on globalization. 
Witnesses told us that one of the great dangers facing us right 
now in the process of globalization is the lapse of democracy. 
This lapse concerns not just parliament and parliamentarians, but 
also means that the executive branches of countries will 
increasingly find themselves exercising responsibilities far 
broader than those they had when there were not as many 
international agreements affecting our daily existence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is true of trade agreements, which affect individual 
citizens and provincial jurisdictions in particular, but it is 
also true of citizens in their dealings with the Government of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to pay tribute to the efforts of the member for 
Beauharnois—Salaberry, who introduced a private member's bill 
designed to ensure that treaties are submitted to the House of 
Commons. I say to him that the Bloc Quebecois will continue this 
battle for the democratization of parliament in the Standing 
Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I hope that the vote will be unanimous.  I am 
certain that there is strong support for this bill in Quebec, to 
the extent that people are aware of its existence, and I would 
like to see that support deepen.  The momentum created by the 
first signatories must help take us quickly up to, and hopefully 
past, the magic number of 60 countries, and still we must not 
expect miracles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With international crime increasing in tandem with 
globalization, and the gap between rich and poor and between rich 
and poor countries growing wider, neither democracy, peace or 
justice are better served in the world as we know it today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The work done on Bill C-19 on the international criminal court 
is part of a much larger effort which is vital if we are ever to 
hope that all human beings, regardless of their country of birth, 
their age or status, may enjoy well-being, security, justice and 
the fundamental right to make democratic decisions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would first like to congratulate the hon. member for Mercier on 
her excellent speech on Bill C-19.  I am not going to reiterate 
her criticisms, but I do agree with her suggestions for 
improving the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an important bill.  It is an important step forward in 
the international criminal court file.  On behalf of my 
colleagues in the NDP, I say once again that we support this 
bill at third reading.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to again highlight the important role that was played by 
the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade 
in improving and strengthening this legislation, Bill C-19.  I 
want to signal the contribution of a number of members of that 
committee who worked in a truly non-partisan spirit, in 
particular, the member for Mount Royal, the member for 
Beauharnois—Salaberry, the member for Vancouver Quadra, the 
member for Mercier and others who made a good bill a better bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly as we now debate this legislation at third reading, on 
behalf of my colleagues in the federal New Democratic Party who 
have long supported the international criminal court, we welcome 
the adoption of this bill at third reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Mercier appealed to the House to support this 
bill unanimously, but unfortunately we heard a speech from the 
Reform Party representative, the member for Surrey Central, that 
was quite frankly shocking.  Basically he said that if his party 
were ever to form a government, one of its first acts would be to 
repeal Bill C-19.  It would repeal the bill that sets up an 
international criminal court.  It would repeal a bill which says 
that the community of nations wants to ensure that those who are 
responsible for war crimes, for crimes against humanity, for 
genocide must be brought to justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could not believe my ears when I heard that member speaking 
for the so-called Canadian Alliance, supposedly a new party, with 
that kind of destructive approach to human rights globally. 
“Tear up the bill,” he said.  “Forget the international court 
of human rights being ratified by this parliament.  We in the 
Reform Party, we in the Canadian Alliance do not believe in this 
bill”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fervently hope that the people of this country in the next 
election will send a clear and powerful message to that party, a 
message that this kind of intolerance, this kind of contempt for 
fundamental human rights has no place in a decent and civilized 
society and members of that party will be turfed out of this 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to touch on a couple of concerns with respect to the 
issue of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.  I 
want to note first of all how profoundly important it is that the 
resources be in place to properly investigate these crimes and 
allegations of these crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier this year I was in East Timor.  I had the opportunity 
while there to meet with United Nations representatives who were 
investigating the absolutely appalling atrocities that took place 
particularly in the aftermath of the referendum on a free East 
Timor.  They were pleading with the global community to do far 
more to bring in forensic experts to ensure that indeed we are in 
a position to investigate and bring to justice those who were 
responsible for these crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very proud of the fact that there were a number of 
Canadians, in fact Canadians were leading the investigative 
effort into these terrible crimes that took place.  A number of 
Canadian doctors and others have played a significant role. 
Frankly, CIDA should be doing far more to support this kind of 
forensic investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We note as well the recent decision of the court of appeal in 
Chile to ensure that former President Pinochet is stripped of his 
immunity and brought to justice.  There again we welcome this 
development in the international community, the recognition that 
those like Pinochet who are responsible for such terrible 
atrocities must be brought to justice.  We hope that the supreme 
court in Chile will uphold that historic and landmark decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time we must recognize that in other jurisdictions, 
including Sierra Leone, Rwanda and elsewhere, justice remains to 
be done and far more must be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned East Timor.  I want to recount the story I heard 
from a woman who witnessed with her own eyes the brutal murder of 
three Catholic priests in Suai, a village in the southern part of 
East Timor. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1215"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The woman was present when thugs, paramilitaries supporting the 
Indonesian government, murdered in cold blood a Catholic priest 
who many Canadians got to know and love when he spent some time 
here in Windsor and elsewhere recently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The woman was able to clearly identify the perpetrator of this 
crime.  The tragedy of this situation is that the perpetrator of 
the crime is in a camp in West Timor with complete impunity.  No 
steps whatsoever have been taken by the Indonesian government to 
bring him to justice.  When we speak of war crimes and crimes 
against humanity surely we must recognize that this is not 
acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to touch on two other areas.  First, as I noted in the 
debate at second reading in the context of the discussion on war 
crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide, the global 
community must recognize that the impact of years of sanctions on 
the people of Iraq has been nothing short of genocidal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>UNICEF has documented the death of over half a million children. 
The infrastructure in that country has been destroyed.  The 
bombing continues today.  Innocent civilians are being killed. 
The impact of depleted uranium particularly in the south remains 
devastating.  In the context of this debate I want once again to 
appeal to the Government of Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask our government to respond positively to the 
unanimous report by the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs 
and International Trade calling for the immediate lifting of 
economic sanctions against Iraq. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The foreign affairs committee held hearings on this issue.  We 
heard compelling and moving evidence about the impact of the 
sanctions on the people of Iraq.  I visited that country in 
January of this year along with a delegation from a group called 
Voices of Conscience.  I met with former UN humanitarian 
co-ordinator, Hans Van Sponeck.  I met with Dennis Halliday, his 
predecessor.  All of them are pleading with the community of 
nations, with the United Nations, with our government, with 
Canada, to recognize the appalling and inhumane impact of these 
sanctions on innocent human people.  Saddam Hussein is not being 
touched by these sanctions but innocent lives are being lost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing committee on foreign affairs issued a strong and 
unanimous report calling for the de-linking of economic and 
military sanctions.  Yet to date we have had no response 
whatsoever from the foreign minister or from the Government of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal today to the Government of Canada to respond before the 
House rises positively to that report, to listen to the voices of 
Canadians from coast to coast to coast who are demanding that our 
government stand up and be counted in the security council and 
call for an end to these genocidal and inhumane sanctions.  I 
appeal to our government to respond to that strong, positive and 
unanimous report of the foreign affairs committee at the earliest 
possible time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final issue I want to touch on in the context of this debate 
on war crimes and crimes against humanity is the issue of alleged 
war crimes committed by NATO forces during Operation Allied Force 
last spring in Kosovo and Serbia, the bombing that took place 
there.  Along with all people who value humanity we strongly 
condemn the attacks on ethnic Albanians that were taking place 
there.  We urge the community of nations to work together 
collectively to put a stop to that brutal inhumanity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was shocked and appalled to learn recently that our government 
had decided to extend one of our highest military honours to the 
United States Supreme Commander in Kosovo, U.S. General Wesley 
Clark. 
General Clark was granted by the governor general Canada's 
meritorious service cross because he “exhibited the highest 
standard of professional dedication in Operation Allied Force”.

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This award should never have been granted.  I want to be very 
clear.  This is not in any way a criticism of Her Excellency 
Governor General Adrienne Clarkson because she has no option. All 
honours including the Order of Canada and bravery decorations are 
awarded by the governor general on the advice of duly constituted 
committees.  There is a military advisory committee which 
recommended to the chief of defence staff that General Clark 
receive this recognition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Far from recognizing the military valour of General Clark, we 
should pay attention to the very eloquent report issued this week 
by Amnesty International on NATO and the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia under the heading “Collateral Damage or Unlawful 
Killings?  Violations of the Laws of War by NATO during Operation 
Allied Force”.  This is a devastating indictment of the conduct 
of NATO under Supreme Commander Wesley Clark during the bombing 
campaign in Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I personally walked through the rubble of the Chinese embassy in 
Belgrade, one of the mistakes of those who could not properly 
read a map and killed innocent human beings in the Chinese 
embassy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I walked through the rubble of the Serbian radio-television 
headquarters building as well.  It was not a mistake.  That 
building was deliberately targeted by NATO.  Sixteen innocent 
people, make-up artists, technicians and journalists, were 
murdered in cold blood in that building. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Amnesty International points out, NATO has legal obligations 
under international laws of war to minimize civilian casualties. 
In the particular instance of this direct attack on the 
headquarters of Serbian state radio and television, in the view 
of Amnesty International it did indeed constitute a war crime.  I 
agree that on the face of it that is exactly what it constituted. 
As well the Amnesty International report went on to document 
other attacks such as the attack on the Grdelica railroad bridge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A passenger train was carrying civilians travelling from one 
place to another.  It was not a military target by any stretch of 
the imagination, but that passenger train was hit by a NATO bomb. 
NATO said it was a mistake, that it was aiming for the bridge. 
Surely the question is:  If indeed that was a mistake and it hit 
that passenger train initially by mistake, why did it then turn 
around and fire a second time?  That was deliberate, and the 
ultimate author, supreme commander of that attack, is being 
honoured by Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the bombing in broad daylight of a bridge in 
Varvarin? A little girl, nine years old, cycling on her bicycle 
was murdered in cold blood because of the violation of the rules 
of war contained in the Geneva convention of 1949, as updated by 
the protocol of 1977.  NATO showed contempt for its obligations 
to minimize civilian casualties both through negligence and by 
deliberately attacking.  If the bridge in Varvarin was a 
legitimate military target, why was it bombed in the middle of 
the day when people were going to the market?  There is no 
acceptable answer to that question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many other examples of the incompetence of this 
campaign.  NATO bragged about how many tanks, armoured personnel 
carriers, pieces of artillery and so on it had taken out. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1225"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT29"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT29"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1225

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It turns out that after the bombing campaign ended and the 
Yugoslav armed forces withdrew from Kosovo they took out massive 
quantities of military supplies.  <I>Newsweek</I> reported last 
month that pentagon officials had suppressed a U.S. air force 
report that found that the number of Serb targets verified 
destroyed was a tiny fraction of those claimed by NATO.  U.S. air 
force investigators who spent weeks in Kosovo found that NATO 
aircraft had destroyed a grand total of 14 tanks, 18 armoured 
personnel carriers and 20 artillery pieces. That is a pretty 
incompetent campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another example I want to give of this campaign which 
is being honoured.  That is the bombing of army barracks on May 
21 at Kosare in western Kosovo, very close to the Albanian 
border.  These army barracks contained KLA fighters.  Seven of 
them were killed and twenty-five were injured.  The KLA had 
captured these army barracks several weeks before NATO attacked 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We might say that maybe NATO did not know that the Yugoslav army 
was not there and that it had been captured by the KLA, but in 
fact the KLA had a very active presence in that area.  A number 
of journalists reported before that facility was bombed that the 
KLA had captured it.  Reporters and television crews had visited 
the very barracks that were bombed by NATO under KLA escort. They 
were escorted by the KLA to those barracks.  NATO said it did not 
know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What an incompetent campaign, and we are honouring those who are 
responsible not only for this incompetence but for the death 
through negligence and through deliberate attacks on hundreds of 
innocent civilians.  This is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am calling today, as I have called previously, on the 
government and on the Minister of National Defence to recognize 
this outrage and to revoke this honour to U.S. General Wesley 
Clark.  Instead, we should be conducting a full inquiry into the 
NATO campaign including the role that the Canadian armed forces 
played in it.  I was assured by General Hénault that Canadians 
were not involved in any of the incidents to which I have 
referred, but Canadians have a right to know precisely what role 
was played by our armed forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Amnesty International has suggested it is essential that NATO 
establish a body to investigate these very serious allegations 
and to ensure that the victims of these violations and their 
families receive compensation.  The victims of those who were 
murdered at the Chinese embassy have been compensated.  The 
family of that little 9 year old girl who was killed on the 
bridge at Varvarin and many other civilians have not been 
compensated to this day.  There has been no investigation 
whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the context of this debate on war crimes, on crimes against 
humanity and on genocide, I want to say on behalf of my 
colleagues in the New Democratic Party that we support this bill 
as an important step forward.  Yes, it can be strengthened.  Yes, 
it can be improved.  I hope we will have that opportunity.  I am 
pleased that Canada is one of the countries that has led this 
long campaign to establish the international criminal court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to pay tribute not only to the leadership that was shown 
by Ambassador Philippe Kirsch but the many NGOs as well that have 
worked long and hard to make this a reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope we will work collectively as a community of nations for a 
planet on which there are no more war crimes, no more crimes 
against humanity and no more genocide.  I hope there will be a 
rapid reaction force created to head off these things and that 
collectively we can work for a planet in which there is respect 
for the human rights of all our citizens; in which there is 
justice, dignity for all citizens; and in which the crimes of 
war, genocide and crimes against humanity will never happen 
again.  I hope those who are responsible for those that have 
occurred will be brought to justice.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He is an experienced member, but today he surprised me.  He made 
two comments which were not only inappropriate but they 
misrepresented my position in my speech.  Perhaps it was an 
oversight on his part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, in my speech I said that the Canadian Alliance, myself 
included, would strongly want those monsters who have blood on 
their hands, those who have committed crimes against humanity, 
war crimes and genocide, brought to justice.  They should be held 
accountable.  I said it very clearly.  Does that make me 
intolerant?  I do not think so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member gave the impression that I and my party are 
intolerant.  I would like the hon. member to look into it again 
and tell me what part of my speech today or on April 6 when I 
gave a 40 minute speech on this issue showed me to be intolerant. 
Judging from his experience and his wisdom, I guess he 
misunderstood that.  I would ask him to make it clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second thing he mentioned was that the Canadian Alliance 
party does not believe in this legislation.  That again is wrong. 
We strongly support the intent of the bill but we do not want a 
half finished job.  We want it done properly so that those 
criminals, those monsters who have blood on their hands, are 
brought to justice and held accountable for their crimes. We do 
not want the government to rush the legislation through the 
House. The international community is still negotiating and 
finalizing the procedures and definitions of the terms mentioned 
in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that the hon. member is confused or did not understand. 
I would ask him to stand again and make it clear.  If by any 
chance he made a mistake, let him retract his comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me be very clear. 
I heard the hon. member when he stood in his place.  I have 
travelled with the hon. member.  I have worked on the foreign 
affairs committee with the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the hon. member chose his words carefully.  He can 
rise in his place and correct me if I misunderstood but I believe 
the hon. member said that a Canadian Alliance government would 
scrap Bill C-19, that it would repeal Bill C-19.  That is exactly 
what the hon. member stood in his place and said. That is an 
astonishing statement.  He is the official critic for the 
Canadian Alliance, for the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the former critic in the House today.  Maybe he has a 
different position.  I hope there will be enough time for the 
former critic to rise in his place and say, “No, Mr. Speaker, 
with great respect I disagree with the member for Surrey Central. 
I would not repeal Bill C-19”.  But that is what the member 
said.  The member said that a Canadian Alliance government would 
throw out Bill C-19, that it would scrap Bill C-19, that it would 
repeal Bill C-19. He did not say, “We would want to amend Bill 
C-19.  We would want to strengthen Bill C-19.  It is a good 
foundation”.  No, in fact he said, “We would repeal Bill 
C-19”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to the member for Red Deer.  Perhaps he wants to revise 
the position of the Canadian Alliance.  I see him consulting with 
the critic now.  I appeal to the member for Red Deer to rise in 
his place and, with great respect to the member for Surrey 
Central, make it clear that the member is not going to repeal 
Bill C-19.  Have a change of heart.  Show some respect for the 
many NGOs who have spoken with one voice on this issue, those who 
have worked so long and so hard, the World Federalists of Canada, 
the Coalition for the International Criminal Court, and so many 
others who are appalled at the possibility that those members 
would actually repeal, scrap and wipe out this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those members say they are committed to bringing war criminals 
to justice.  How can they say that when according to their own 
spokesperson they would get rid of this bill?

member.  I am rather shocked that he would choose to bring in 
partisan politics to something as serious as this when we are 
talking about war criminals.  He seems to think that he holds all 
the cards when it comes to compassion and understanding people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was in Kosovo and Macedonia last year as well.  A grandfather 
told me they had killed his oldest grandson, then his youngest 
one, and then they had killed the middle one.  He asked, 
“Mister, how can you ever forgive those people?  How can you 
tell me to not hate anymore?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That touched me and I will remember that forever, just as much

kind of crimes against humanity.  For him to stand and condemn a

rather untenable in this House, particularly from someone with 
the kind of experience he has.  I am sure he has compassion but 
we also have compassion for those people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is, how do we get at these kinds of people?  There 
are good guys and bad guys.  The problem is that all the good 
guys agree to sign everything and form all kinds of agreements 
and all kinds of get-togethers where they can talk about what we 
should do and talk and talk.  The real problem is how to deliver. 
How do we get the bad guys to sign on?  How do we get after 
them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How will the member get the bad guys?  We can list so many.  We 
can go to Sudan and Iraq.  We can go to all kinds of places.  How 
does he get those bad guys to sign on to what we good guys know 
should happen and want to happen? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as what the other member said, he has tried to put 
forward amendments.  He has tried to make the bill better.  The 
government is set on ramming the bill through in a hurry. Well, 
it just will not work.  That is why we are opposed to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have worked with 
the member on the foreign affairs committee. Would he just affirm 
very clearly for the people who are watching this debate, who are 
concerned about this issue, the statement that was made by the 
official critic for his party, that a Canadian Alliance 
government would repeal Bill C-19?  Is that the official position 
of his party, yes or no? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am afraid the time for questions 
and comments has expired.  Of course, as the hon. member for 
Burnaby—Douglas knows, the questions are on his speech, not on 
that of the hon. member for Red Deer who may yet speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I would seek the consent of the House to enable the hon. 
member to answer the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent to extend 
the time for questions or comments? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  No.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand (Richmond—Arthabaska, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
might have been interesting to hear another version from the 
Reform Party.  Since this party's inception, it has changed its 
position on a number of things as it evolved in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like most of the parties here, we wanted unanimous support to be 
given Bill C-19.  Unfortunately, the Reform Party has decided 
otherwise.  Before I move on to my speech, I would like to 
express my condemnation of the socio-juridic-politico stupidity of 
the Reform's argument on Bill C-19. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like my colleague for Burnaby—Douglas, I too hope that people 
will once again realize the true stripes of the Reform Party and 
will act accordingly when they vote in the election of this fall 
or next spring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With modern communications, it has become impossible for the 
rest of the planet not to know what atrocities are going on in a 
country during wartime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The international community has had a moral obligation to join 
forces and to refuse to tolerate such reprehensible acts as the 
Nazi concentration camps, and genocide in Rwanda, the former 
Yugoslavia, Sierra Leone and Sudan.  It has become clear that 
universal standards are required for the protection of the most 
vulnerable populations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although there is much still to be done in order to ensure world 
peace and security for all peoples, adoption of the Rome Statute 
in July 1998, which created the International Criminal Court, 
represents a giant step toward the establishment of an effective 
international justice system to combat the worst atrocities 
known to man and to punish the perpetrators.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is all a matter of political will, as we can see very clearly 
in this case.  For the first time, the international community 
has decided to act, not in keeping with the interests of one or 
another of its members, the security council in particular, but 
in the interests of human rights, by refusing to turn a blind 
eye to the most serious crimes recognized by international law, 
namely genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we has said on a number of occasions, the Progressive 
Conservative Party supports and strongly approves of Bill C-19. 
Incidentally, I would like once again—who knows, perhaps for the 
last time—to congratulate the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the 
members of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade, who all worked together on this initiative, 
without getting into partisan politics, with the exception 
perhaps of the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we mentioned on several occasions, Bill C-19 seeks to 
implement Canada's obligations under the Rome Statute which, as 
I said earlier, was adopted on July 17, 1998 by the United 
Nations Diplomatic Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the 
Establishment of an International Criminal Court, the ICC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this bill, Canada displays leadership and clearly shows to 
the international community that it will not be a haven for war 
criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The International Criminal Court will be the first international 
authority empowered to investigate the most serious of crimes 
under international law. These include genocide, crimes against 
humanity and war crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was unacceptable that war criminals could quietly live out 
their lives as if nothing had happened, even though they had 
taken part in indescribable atrocities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just this past weekend, the United Nations said that women are 
often the first victims of conflicts. Sanam Anderlini, from the 
British group International Alert, said that “women's bodies 
have become the new battlefield”. Indeed, as we saw in Bosnia, 
Sierra Leone and Rwanda, 80% of the refugees and displaced 
people during wars are women and children. Many of these women 
were raped and abducted. 
They went through forced pregnancies.  They were treated like 
sexual or domestic slaves the world over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These crimes are not recent.  However, they have gone unpunished 
because they took place in the context of war and because of the 
failure to act of the international community, which preferred to 
turn a blind eye. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad that these crimes will no longer be tolerated, that 
they will be considered crimes against humanity, and that, 
through Bill C-19, Canada is taking the first steps towards 
making this a reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One point I wish to come back to is the defence that someone was 
acting under a superior's orders.  We have heard from people who 
seemed hesitant about these provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us remember the defence in the Finta decision, in which 
Finta's lawyer quite rightly argued that, under the provisions of 
the criminal code of the time, members of military or police 
forces could use following a superior's orders as a defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In times of war, most crimes are committed either because a 
superior has issued an order, or has looked the other way.  Is 
the deed any less reprehensible?  Is the crime any less terrible? 
No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, this kind of defence will no longer be possible, except of 
course in accordance with international law.  These provisions 
were necessary and show politicians' determination to act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another feature of the bill is its retroactivity. 
In this connection, a number of people also expressed some 
misgivings.  Nevertheless, I congratulate the minister and the 
committee on their work.  In most cases, the actions in question 
took place during the second world war, or during conflicts 
prior to the signature of the Rome Statute.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must be realistic, however. Since most of the facts date back 
more than 50 years, it is becoming increasingly difficult to 
find those who perpetrated war crimes or crimes against 
humanity, particularly under the Nazi regime. 
As well, problems have arisen in the past when Department of 
Justice officials tried to find witnesses in order to justify 
extradition of a suspect.  Without retroactivity, the bill would 
not have made much sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The International Criminal Court complements our existing 
courts; it does not replace them.  The presumption of innocence 
still applies.  It is, however, important to take into 
consideration the customary rules of international law.  It is 
normal, since it is not internal law but international criminal 
law we are addressing today.  There is an essential distinction 
we must understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the complexity of its objective, Bill C-19 prohibits 
anyone from possessing any property or any proceeds of property 
knowing it was obtained as the result of the perpetration of the 
proposed new crimes. 
This is a good provision, because Canada and the Progressive 
Conservative Party both support the principle that no one must 
profit from any type of crime, war crimes in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, if the government wants war criminals to be found 
guilty, certain other pieces of legislation also need amending. 
The changes proposed for the Citizenship Act and the Extradition 
Act, for example, will facilitate prosecution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 33 of Bill C-19 is aimed at amending the Citizenship Act 
so that a person under investigation by the Minister of Justice, 
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police or the Canadian Security 
Intelligence Service for an offence under any of the crimes set 
out in Bill C-19 may not be granted citizenship or administered 
the oath of citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to Bill C-19, Canada will now be obliged to hand over 
individuals sought by the international criminal court for 
genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes.  Under section 
48 of the Extradition Act, a person who is the subject of a 
request for surrender by the court may not claim immunity from 
arrest or surrender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could say more on the need for this legislation, but I will 
conclude by saying that the victims of war have been through 
terrible trials.  With Bill C-19, Canada is taking a stand by 
saying that no war criminal is welcome on its soil.  This 
position has the support of Canadians and the Progressive 
Conservative Party.  We will not tolerate Canada's being a haven 
for war criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-19 is important.  All the members of the committee did an 
exceptional job and I would like to congratulate them.  I hope 
that the Canadian Alliance members will think twice about this. 
Right now, over 12 countries—and France too, today—are passing 
legislation enabling the Rome statute to be implemented.  It 
will take the support of 60 countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the Canadian Alliance critic saying that we had to wait. 
If everyone waits, nothing will get done.  Already the 
international community has waited too long to act.  Nothing is 
perfect, but the fact of acting immediately with Bill C-19 could 
at least perhaps prevent or certainly send a signal that the 
international community is ready and will be even more so in the 
future to deal with these most heinous crimes.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I will be sharing my time with my colleague and friend, who is a 
distinguished jurist in his own right, the hon. member for Mount 
Royal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In speaking in the third reading debate to the crimes against 
humanity and war crimes act, I will take note of a fact, which I 
think is rather exceptional, that the debates in the Standing 
Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade were 
exhaustive and at a very high level of technical competence. 
It reminded me of what the late president of old World Court, 
Manley Hudson, called an academy of jurists.  In that sense, 
although it is still possible to offer projects of amendments, I 
hope that some of the parties will accept what I am doing, simply 
make points of clarification in the debate which courts can take 
note of as part of the travaux préparatoires in their future 
interpretations.

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My first point is that the bill is enacting into Canadian law 
the provisions of an international treaty.  As a matter of law, 
of Canadian constitutional law, it suffices for Canada to be 
bound by an international convention that we sign and that we 
ratify by executive act.  In fact we gave this opinion to the 
foreign minister when I was parliamentary secretary a little 
earlier on the land mines treaty, because we wanted to send the 
symbolic message of the treaty coming to legal conclusion within 
a year of opening for signature.  We could ratify without the 
enacting legislation and be legally bound.  The practice since 
the privy council decision in the labour convention case in 1937 
has been to recognize that since a legislative power to implement 
may be split sometimes between provinces and the federal 
government, it makes good sense to await provincial action.  I 
mention that, nevertheless, because that is the position in law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In implementing the treaty the Canadian government creates new 
jurisdictional bases and also new substantive bases of criminal 
liability or delinquencies within Canadian law.  I would like 
to add this point because it does relate to some of the 
amendments I think suggested by the Bloc and by the New 
Democratic Party.  It does not per se displace customary 
international law.  I would suggest that except to the extent 
that customary international law may be in direct conflict with 
Canadian constitutional law or legislation enacted thereunder, it is 
in force and is a supplement to the treaty.  There may be 
jurisdictional and other difficulties in implementing, but it is 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would simply refer to your notice, the judgment 
of the World Court in Nicaragua v United States, 
rendered by 15 votes to 1, in which the court refused to accept 
that the adoption of the United Nations charter had pre-empted 
all of international law, that it was all under the charter and 
nothing else.  It said that was not so.  Customary international 
law still prevails and the court based its judgment in Nicaragua 
v United States on customary international law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A third point arises after the Rome treaty becomes law.  It 
comes into force in international law when it is ratified by the 
60 states stipulated as necessary to enact it.  I raise the 
question:  Does it bind non-signatory, non-ratifying states?  I 
would here suggest the five permanent members of the security 
council.  I am delighted to learn that the French government has 
decided to ratify this treaty.  That is a breach in the 
opposition of the five permanent members of the security council 
that we had in Rome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Monsieur Richard, the French minister of defence who was here 
several months ago, discussed this very earnestly with some of us 
and I became convinced that France would come through and I hope 
it will be an example to other permanent members:  Russia, Great 
Britain, China and the United States, not least.  There was the 
then 
heretical opinion by the brilliant Polish judge, Manfred Lachs, 
the most interesting judge in the post-war world court, in the 
North Sea Continental Shelf case, a dissenting opinion, but he did 
say that treaties by the universality of their reach and perhaps 
also the number of countries adhering to them could become 
binding on non-signatory, non-ratifying states because they are 
part of general international law.  That was an heretical opinion 
30 years ago when that decision was given.  It is no longer 
heretical.  It has become a more or less general part of law 
opinio iuris.  Not everybody accepts it, but I cite it simply as an 
indication to the other remaining hold-outs who are permanent 
members of the security council.  In the Latin phrase quod licet 
Jovie, licet bovi; what is permitted to Jove on high should be 
permitted to the humble oxen below.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not make sense for countries to push the jurisdiction 
of the ad hoc tribunal for Yugoslavia if they are not themselves 
prepared to say “We will be bound by the Rome treaty”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An issue has arisen here as to the applicability of ordinary 
Canadian criminal law in ordinary Canadian courts.  It is the 
General Pinochet factor.  It is the most interesting, exciting 
and unexpected development in international law in the last year 
or two.  The House of Lords in its judicial committee, normally 
known as a very conservative tribunal, took two big steps forward 
in asserting jurisdiction over General Pinochet.  The home 
secretary made the political decision and took one and a half 
steps backward, but it is still there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Canadian law any Canadian judge, in theory, subject of 
course always to the possibility of appeal, could find 
jurisdiction over a citizen of a foreign state, including even 
friendly foreign states and allies, if he or she so wished and 
felt there was an adequate base in Canadian law.  The General 
Pinochet factor remains a wild card in international law, but it 
is interesting how much it has involved ordinary citizens, 
ordinary people and non-governmental associations in the 
international lawmaking process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am simply saying that the Rome treaty is a comprehensive and 
well thought out approach to universalizing jurisdiction over the 
most severe sort of crimes, crimes against humanity.  It follows 
in the principle that was established in the first aerial piracy 
conventions and the first moves to control terrorism, of the hue 
and cry.  That there is no safe place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not expect the General Pinochet factor to be paramount in 
Canadian practice or even perhaps to occur, but it might be worth 
reminding people who have crimes on their conscience that if they 
want to take a holiday abroad or consult for medical treatment 
abroad, it is not really “Do not go to Great Britain”, but 
perhaps also “Do not go to Canada”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will note a last and general point because it emerged during 
the debate in the standing committee on foreign affairs and was 
the subject of thoughtful evidence by members of our permanent 
foreign ministry staff.  It is a matter of law, and I note it and 
will read it into the record.  The testimony led before the 
standing committee was quite directly that Canadian military 
personnel did not participate in those aerial missions which have 
been the focus of much public attention and debate in connection 
with Kosovo.  But, and these are the affirmative points, Canada 
accepted the jurisdiction of the UN international tribunal for 
the former Yugoslavia over Canadian forces throughout the 
conflict.  Also, in regard to every Canadian mission flown, a 
Canadian forces legal officer examined the target assigned with a 
view to ensuring its lawfulness under Canadian law and also 
international law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a good example of respect for international law and a 
recognition that in policy decisions it is good to have the 
international law adviser at one's side.   We know that during 
the Cuban missile crisis President Kennedy had his legal adviser, 
the very great, recently deceased, Professor Abe Chayes of the 
Harvard Law School, at his side.  The action taken, among many 
options, was to choose that action which was compatible with 
international law, and it was effective.  It is a good principle 
to note:  keep the legal adviser at hand.  We can do what is 
politically the right thing, but we can also do it compatibly 
with international law. 
<P><A NAME="LINK70"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has made some very good comments, 
which I have listened to carefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the hon. member.  Since the definition and 
procedures and evidence rules are not very clear in the bill, nor 
are they spelled out, why does the government want to rush? 
Why did it not want to wait until the right procedures, rules of 
evidence and the definitions were place?   We understand that 
there needs to be 60 members to ratify.  So far only 8 or 10 
members have signed to ratify.  We still have some time.  In the 
absence of the clarity, the definitions and the procedures, the 
government should not have rushed this through.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, this is a very important bill.  We normally point out 
difficulties in the international community when we have to 
distinguish the bad guy from good guys.  All the good guys will 
sign the international treaty but the bad guys will not.  How 
would the hon. member propose we hold the bad guys accountable 
and ensure they sign the treaty? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the point I have been 
making is that with the progressive development of international 
law under the United Nations charter, it is a step in 
international law, initially sponsored by Judge Lachs and that 
very interesting dissenting opinion in 1968, that non-signatories 
to an international treaty can be legally bound by the treaty 
either, to use an analogy, because the treaty becomes, by virtue 
of the number of states signing it, part of customary 
international law, or because the sheer number indicates it is 
part of the general principles of law recognized by nations under 
article 38(1)(d) of the World Court statute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are saying here is, beware.  The mere fact that a 
country does not sign, does not mean that it can escape 
responsibility.  I do expect that with the progressive 
development of international law, further steps may be taken to 
extend jurisdiction through the Security Council or elsewhere 
over non-signatory states where the gravity of the offence 
suggests it.  However, at the moment we are working with friendly 
persuasion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we spoke several months ago to the French minister, Mr. 
Richard, a most interesting and thoughtful gentleman, we made the 
case for France signing and ratifying the treaty, and it has done 
it.  We are hoping we can persuade other countries, the other 
four members of the Security Council, to feel the same. It makes 
good sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We asked United States senators in Washington several weeks ago 
why they did not sign, because they are the strong force behind 
the war crimes tribunal on Yugoslavia, but it really does not 
make much sense for them to say they are taking themselves out of 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is very proud of its forces and has full confidence in 
them.  We say that we will accept their subjection to the war 
crimes tribunal on the former Yugoslavia,  That was an act of 
faith, but it has not gone wrong.  I am satisfied that the 
Canadian forces acted in full conformity with international law 
in their part in the Kosovo action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B> Mr. Speaker, I did not get the answer 
to my first question.  Why was there such a rush to ram this bill 
through parliament, particularly when it is quite likely that the 
House will be recessing before the weekend?  Why could we not 
have waited until September or October when the international 
negotiations, the definitions, the procedures and the rules of 
evidence will be laid down and the rules of the game will be 
clear.  Why did the government not wait until the rules of the 
game were clear and then draft a perfectly excellent bill that 
all parties could support? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone is supporting the intent of the bill.  Even the 
Canadian Alliance supports the intent of the bill but we do not 
want to leave the bill half cooked.  We want to make sure it is 
well done.  I would like to know why there was such a hurry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know the hon. member 
has fought a long time to get full respect for committees and the 
plenary powers they have in the elaboration and drafting of 
bills. I would simply repeat that on this particular section the 
amount of time given to this particular bill in the standing 
committee was extraordinary. 
It was an example to all other committees.  It involved 10, 12, 
14 and 16 hours of point by point elaboration.  May I say that in 
my capacity as president for the next two years of the Institut 
de droit international, it was a superb performance and a great 
credit to the quality of our committees.  We have four 
international lawyers in parliament and I am told that is 400% 
greater than the British parliament, the United States congress 
or others.  I signal the contribution of others in the committee. 
The committee did a remarkable job. I do not think there is any 
rush.  Some may even have said that we spent too much time.

Quadra for suggesting that he would split his time with me, but I 
wish to speak in my own right and take the full 20 minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise to speak to Bill C-19, the crimes against humanity and 
war crimes act, at a historic moment of remembrance and reminder, 
of witness and warning, on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the 
codification by the United Nations General Assembly in 1950 of 
the Nuremberg principles which are symbol and substance, source 
and inspiration of the revolution in international human rights 
law in general and international humanitarian law in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the Nuremberg principles codified for the first time, the 
Grundnorm principle that individuals, including heads of state, 
are criminally responsible for the commission of war crimes and 
crimes against humanity.  Nor can individuals plead acts of state 
or superior orders as exculpatory grounds for their criminality. 
For these Nuremberg crimes were deemed to be crimes against 
humankind itself.  Those who commit them are hostis humanis 
generis, the enemies of humankind, while the rights violated 
would include every right protected in the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights, the Magna Carta of humankind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not surprising then, given the continuing and pervasive 
state of international atrocity and criminality since judgment at 
Nuremberg, and the impunity accompanying it, that the idea and 
inspiration for establishing an international criminal court has 
remained on the international agenda with greater or less 
visibility since judgment at Nuremberg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it took the globalized horror of the killing fields of 
the nineties, the horror of Bosnia, the agony of Rwanda, the 
brutalized women and children of Sierra Leone and Sudan, the 
emergence of the unthinkable, ethnic cleansing, and the 
unspeakable, genocide, as paridigmatic forms of armed conflict in 
the nineties, to give the idea of an international criminal court 
the moral compellability and sense of urgency that it warrants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The establishment of an international criminal court was an idea 
whose time had come, indeed, was long overdue.  What 
distinguishes the international criminal court from the ad hoc 
tribunals is that the ICC is the first permanent international 
tribunal with a global jurisdiction to try individuals for 
criminal violations of international humanitarian law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike the International Court of Justice, whose contentious 
jurisdiction is restricted to states, the ICC will have juridical 
authority to indict individuals from any global killing field, 
and unlike the ad hoc character of the Yugoslavian and Rwandan 
war crimes tribunals, the jurisdiction of the ICC will not be 
chronologically or geographically limited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-19 is designed to implement in Canada the statute for an 
ICC, to provide a Canadian legislative foundation for the 
prosecution of war criminals so as to ensure that Canada will not 
become a haven for war criminals past or present, and to serve as 
an international model for Nuremberg legacy legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, I will first describe briefly the purposive 
character of the ICC and why it is of such moral and juridical 
compellability and urgency at this time.  Second, I will outline 
the principles underlying Bill C-19.  For reasons of time, I will 
limit myself to identifying rather than elaborating upon the 
respective purposes and principles of the ICC and Bill C-19. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will turn now to the purposive character of the ICC, which may 
be summarized as follows. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1310"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT38"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT38"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1310
<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Principle number one is to institutionalize and internationalize 
the Nuremberg legacy.  In a word, there will be no safe havens 
for these hostis humanis generis, the enemies of humankind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Principle number two is to end the culture of impunity.  Despite 
the Nuremberg and Tokyo principles and precedents, impunity has 
been the national and international practice.  The ICC will 
presage a culture of accountability as an antidote to a culture 
of impunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Principle number three is to deter international crimes and 
protect international peace and security.  An ICC will not only 
deter prospective war criminals and génocidaires from killing 
their own citizens, let alone nationals from other countries, but 
it will facilitate and protect peacekeeping as well as the 
protection of international peace and security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Principle number four is to counter the failure of national 
systems.  In an ideal world, international crimes should be dealt 
with by national authorities of the state in which they were 
committed.  In the real world, however, governments are often 
unwilling, even unable, to call their own citizens to account, as 
exemplified by the Yugoslavian and Rwandan experiences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Principle number five is to remedy the limitations of such ad hoc 
tribunals.  In a word, these ad hoc tribunals, such as in the 
former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, are no substitute for a permanent 
international tribunal.  Politically, the selective establishment 
of such tribunals by the Security Council gives rise to 
allegations or apprehensions of political bias.  Juridically, it 
is jurisprudential authority that is more situation specific than 
internationally specific. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Principle number six is to provide enforcement mechanisms.  In a 
word, the ICC is necessary to overcome one of the main failings 
of international criminal law:  the lack of a permanent, 
institutionalized enforcement system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Principle number seven is to provide an alternative to military 
sanctions.  There is presently no permanent, non-military or 
coercive juridical mechanism to hold individual perpetrators 
accountable.  In such circumstances, the international 
community's only recourse is to impose sanctions, embargoes or to 
use military force.  However, these are blunt instruments that 
may harm innocent civilians, as in Iraq, more than affect 
perpetrators.  By focusing the rule of law more precisely on 
individual violators, international law would become more just 
and more effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Principle number eight is to afford redress for victims and 
their families, if not affected populations as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Principle number nine is to provide a counter to any historical 
revisionism after the fact and a means for truth, healing and 
reconciliation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Principle number ten is to serve as an international justice 
model, as a standard-bearer in the implementation of 
international norms both domestically and internationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will turn now to the basic principles underlying Bill C-19 
itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first principle is the individual criminal responsibility. 
This legislation is organized around the foundational Nuremberg 
principle, as set forth in the judgment of the Nuremberg tribunal 
itself, and I quote, that “crimes against international law are 
committed by men, not by abstract entities, and only by punishing 
the individuals who commit such crimes can international law be 
enforced”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second principle is the domestication of ICC crimes. Bill 
C-19 will create offences based on the Rome statute of genocide, 
crimes against humanity and war crimes that would apply to such 
international criminal conduct if committed in Canada, while 
similar offences would be created with respect to international 
criminal conduct committed outside Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third principle is the principle of command and superior 
responsibility.  The bill includes offences of breach of 
responsibility by military commanders and other superiors.  In a 
word, failure of a military commander or superior to exercise 
control over persons under their authority which results in the 
subordinates committing genocide, a crime against humanity or war 
crimes, could result in the criminal responsibility of the 
military commanders or superiors if they failed to take measures 
to repress the crime or to submit the matter to the competent 
authorities for investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Principle number four is that of state responsibility for 
international crimes.  States are under an obligation to 
prosecute, or to extradite for purposes of prosecution, any 
individuals present in their territory who are accused of 
international crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity or war 
crimes. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1315"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT39"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT39"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1315
<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Principle number five is that of universal jurisdiction.   As 
the perpetrators of such international crimes are indeed defined 
as the enemies of humankind, Canada now has the legislative basis 
to prosecute the perpetrators of such crimes from whatever 
source, if they are found in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Principle number six is that of complementarity, a principle of 
particular importance.  In a word the ICC is designed to 
complement, not replace, national courts.  It will therefore 
exercise jurisdiction where national courts are unwilling or 
unable to bring perpetrators to justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Principle number seven is that of offences against the ICC. Bill 
C-19 includes offences to protect the integrity of legal 
processes under the international criminal court and to protect 
judges and officials of the ICC as well as witnesses.  In 
particular, it includes offences of obstructing justice, 
obstructing officials, bribery of judges and officials, perjury, 
fabricating or giving contradictory evidence, and intimidation of 
officials or witnesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come now to principle number eight, the principle of 
protection against gender violence.  The ICC statute includes 
explicit provisions for crimes of sexual and gender violence, 
identifying as crimes against humanity and war crimes, conduct 
that is directed specifically against women, such as “rape, 
sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, enforced pregnancy, 
enforced sterilization, or any other form of sexual violence of 
comparable violence”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Principle number nine is that of the protection of children in 
armed conflict.  The Rome statute also includes as a war crime 
the conscripting or enlisting of children under the age of 15 
into national armed forces or using them to actively participate 
in hostilities in international armed conflict.  This is a 
principle central to Canada's human security agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Principle number 10 is the aiding and abetting principle. 
Persons who aid and abet, counsel, or otherwise assist in the 
commission of an offence are considered to be parties to that 
offence.  The bill has also been amended to close any loopholes with 
respect to the inclusion of attempts, conspiracies and being an 
accessory after the fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Principle number 11 is with respect to the forced transfer of 
civilian populations into an occupied territory.  The prohibition 
against forced transfer of a civilian population into an occupied 
territory by an occupying power will adhere to the intent and 
scope of the offence as set forth in the Geneva Conventions Act 
of 1949, as per the footnote to the ICC, and to protect against the 
politicization of this offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to principle number 12, Bill C-19, unlike as 
some have said, does cover non-state actors.  The bill provides 
criminal liability for “persons” which, pursuant to section 2 
of the criminal code, includes legal entities such as 
corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Principle number 13 is that of reparations.  Victims will be 
entitled to reparations including restitution, compensation and 
rehabilitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Principle number 14 is a particularly important one, the 
principle of non-immunity, the Pinochet principle and beyond. In 
a word a person who is the subject of a request for surrender by 
the ICC, pursuant to clauses 48 and 70 of the bill, will not be 
able to claim immunity under common law or statute from arrest or 
extradition under the Extradition Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, a person who is the subject of a domestic prosecution, 
including a head of state or senior official, will not be able to 
claim immunity from prosecution under common law or statute, as 
set forth in clause 3 of the bill.  The principle of non-immunity 
in section 27 of the ICC statute coupled with article 98 in that 
statute, may arguably be said to have been incorporated by 
reference in the domestication in Bill C-19 of the ICC statute 
itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Principle number 15 is that of due process.  The ICC statute 
incorporates the highest international standards of the right to 
fair trial and due process, while Canadian law is further 
buttressed by due process guarantees as set forth in the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms and related jurisprudence. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1320"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Principle number 16 is that of the superior orders defence. The 
scope of the superior orders defence has been clarified in the 
bill.  Consistent with the Rome statute, persons accused of 
genocide, crimes against humanity, or other manifestly unlawful 
acts would not—I repeat, would not—be able to raise this 
defence. Further, and to address any adverse fallout from the 
Finta decision, a person would not be able to base a defence on 
hate propaganda against an identifiable group as grounds for 
defence against international crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last principle is principle number 17, that of state 
co-operation.  State parties such as Canada are obliged to 
co-operate fully with the ICC, a principle anchored in our own 
mutual legal assistance and related legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, Bill C-19 is comprehensive, historic, indeed 
watershed legislation by any national or international standard. 
It is an expression and an example of the best witness testimony 
of representative human rights NGOs who appeared before the 
committee, as well as the expertise of the legal advisors and the 
members of all parties on the foreign affairs committee, such as 
the expertise of the hon. member for Beauharnois—Salaberry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation, as I indicated at the outset, is being enacted 
at a historic moment of remembrance and reminder on the eve of 
the 50th anniversary of the codification by the United Nations 
General Assembly of the Nuremberg principles in 1950. This 
legislation may be said to be the contemporary embodiment of an 
expanded, refined, updated set of Nuremberg principles for the 
new millennium.  It will place Canada at the forefront of the 
international justice movement and give juridical validation to 
the anguished plea of victims and survivors from the Holocaust to 
the present day killing fields of “never again”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a wake-up call and a warning to tyrants everywhere.  There 
will be no safe havens, no base or sanctuary for the enemies of 
humankind.  It is now incumbent upon Canada to take the lead in 
securing the necessary ratifications to bring the international 
criminal court treaty into effect and to ensure the dream and the 
efficacy of our own domestic landmark legislation.

<P><A NAME="LINK75"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (for the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage)</B> moved that Bill C-27, an act respecting the national 
parks of Canada, be now read the third time and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK76"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as we begin the debate at 
third reading stage of Bill C-27, I would once again like to 
thank my colleagues from the Standing Committee on Canadian 
Heritage for their work on this bill, an act respecting the 
national parks of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debates on this bill were marked by a spirit of co-operation 
that helped strengthen and improve it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to review the main features of Bill C-27 and 
mention the amendments made by the standing committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first point concerns ecological integrity. The panel on the 
ecological integrity of Canada's national parks clearly 
indicated that “we must firmly and unequivocally establish that 
ecological integrity is the core value of Parks Canada's 
mandate”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chair of the panel and other witnesses, including the 
Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society and the Canadian Nature 
Federation, reaffirmed that position before the standing 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-27 was strengthened in a number of ways: by including a 
definition of ecological integrity based on the panel's report; 
by making ecological integrity the top priority, not only as 
regards the zoning of parks and their use by visitors, but also 
all the aspects of their management; by specifying that 
management plans must include a long term ecological vision, a 
set of ecological integrity objectives and indicators and 
provisions for resource protection and restoration, zoning, 
visitor use, public awareness and performance evaluation; and, 
finally, by requiring that, within one year following the 
tabling of a new or amended management plan for a park, a 
wilderness area be designated. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point was the establishment of new parks.  With this 
legislation seven new national parks and one new national park 
reserve will be formally established.  As well, Middle Island 
will be added to the Point Pelee National Park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The procedure for establishing new parks and park reserves has 
been streamlined by providing for an order in council process. It 
will take less time to formally establish new parks once park 
establishment agreements have been signed. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The examination in parliament of proposals on new protected 
spaces will be maintained, and an amendment to the act will 
still be needed to withdraw lands from a park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In view of concerns about the new process for the establishment 
of parks, Bill C-27 has been amended as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For every proposal on a new park or park reserve tabled in 
Parliament, there will be a report detailing the consultations 
held and any agreement on the establishment of the park, so that 
Parliament will be able to assess the amount of support the park 
or park reserve is getting. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the citizens' committee of Havre-Saint-Pierre and 
Longue-Pointe-de-Mingan, and of the hunting and fishing association 
have appeared before the standing committee to ask that their 
traditional rights be recognized in the Mingan archipelago 
national park reserve. The committee has seen fit to add this 
reserve to the list of parks where the traditional harvesting of 
resources will be allowed.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next point is controlling commercial development in park 
communities.  There are seven communities contained in national 
parks, all in western Canada: Banff, Lake Louise, Field, Jasper, 
Waterton Lakes, Waskesiu and Wasagaming.  I apologize if I am 
mispronouncing any of these names and further names that will 
come in my text.  These communities have been the focus of 
extensive commercial, residential and visitor pressures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Banff-Bow Valley study of 1996 made many recommendations to 
protect the ecological integrity of Banff National Park and to 
strengthen controls over commercial development and human use in 
parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new act takes steps to control commercial developments in 
park communities.  Community plans will be tabled in parliament. 
The legislation makes provision to set the boundaries of the 
communities, the boundaries of commercial zones, and to cap the 
maximum square footage of commercial developments.  These 
elements of the community plans will be placed in the schedule of 
the act and can only be changed by an act of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concerns were raised by park community representatives during 
the hearings on Bill C-27 and the standing committee has 
responded.  Regarding concerns with respect to termination of 
leases, the bill has been amended to state that the Expropriation 
Act applies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Community plan has been defined to mean a land use plan for a 
park community.  This new definition serves two purposes.  First, 
it ensures that there will be no confusion between the use of the 
term community plan in this legislation and how that term is used 
in Alberta legislation.  Second, it signals to park community 
residents that there is no impediment to their undertaking their 
own planning for social, educational, health and related needs of 
the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The section on public consultation now makes explicit reference 
to representatives of park communities and requires that the 
minister consult on land use planning and development in such 
park communities. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next point has to do with the protection of wildlife and 
other park resources.  Bill C-27 contains increased penalties for 
poaching.  The maximum fine for poaching protected species has 
been increased to $50,000.  The maximum jail sentence for 
poaching has been increased from six months to five years.  The 
offence of trafficking has been introduced to deal with the 
increasing trend towards removing large quantities of animal or 
other resources, such as fossils and rare plants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Amendments to the bill further strengthen wildlife protection by 
increasing fines for poaching or trafficking involving protected 
species to $250,000, which is consistent with recent legislative 
proposals concerning threatened species, and by increasing fines 
and penalties for failure to clean up environmental damage from 
$2,000 to $50,000, including a clause which doubles the fines in 
the case of repeat offences. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next point is working with first nations.  The Government of 
Canada, as we all know, is committed to working with first 
nations as set out in the “Gathering Strength” document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-27 reflects this commitment in a number of ways.  Five 
national parks are being established through agreements with 
first nations.  I repeat my previous apology on mispronunciation. 
These are Aulavik, Wapusk, Auyuittuq, Sirmilik and Quttinirpaaq. 
Second, provision is made for use of parklands and the use or 
removal of flora and other objects by aboriginal people for 
spiritual and traditional ceremonial purposes.  Provisions are 
made in the bill to remove lands from Wood Buffalo and Wapusk to 
accommodate treaty land entitlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing committee heard from representatives of the 
Assembly of First Nations, the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs and 
the Keeseekoowenin Band.  They had two primary concerns that they 
wished to see dealt with in the legislation:  first, respect for 
aboriginal and treaty rights and, second, consultation with 
aboriginal peoples.

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing committee introduced amendments to Bill C-27 in 
response to these concerns.  These include a non-derogation 
clause with regard to aboriginal and treaty rights; strengthening 
the commitment to consult with aboriginal organizations and 
bodies established under land claim agreements on policy, park 
establishment, management planning and regulations; including 
aboriginal organizations and bodies established under land claim 
agreements in the minister's agreement making authority; and 
provision to remove lands from Riding Mountain National Park for 
the purposes of settling the claim of the Keeseekoowenin Band. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the throne speech included a promise from the 
government to extend our system of national parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997, the government undertook to create a commission of 
experts to look into the ecological integrity of Canada's 
national parks.  This commission has now tabled its report and 
the Minister of Canadian Heritage has announced an action plan. A 
key feature of this plan is to place ecological integrity at the 
heart of legislation and policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-27 respects these undertakings and will become a heritage 
for future generations of Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK77"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise to debate Bill C-27, an act 
respecting the national parks of Canada, at third reading.  Let 
me begin by saying that Canadians respect and love their national 
parks.  That is why they return to visit them year in and year 
out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first parks act of 1930 states that parks are hereby 
dedicated to the people of Canada for their benefit, education 
and enjoyment.  Such parks shall be maintained and made use of as 
to leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations. 
Today's definition of use has not changed as we find it in 
subclause 4(1) of Bill C-27. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians agree that the ecological integrity of our national 
parks needs to be preserved and protected for future generations. 
The Canadian Alliance agrees with the panel on ecological 
integrity that ecological integrity is the first priority and 
that efforts need to be made to manage, conserve and restore 
ecological integrity to our parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not agree with the notion of promoting restoration as a 
single objective.  This approach to the concept of restoration is 
too open ended.  To what time lines will restoration be returned? 
This is like the crimes against humanity debate when we are 
talking about 20th century crimes against humanity or whether we 
take it back to the age of the caveman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree with the panel that people have a place in the parks. 
There certainly needs to be a balance.  Another important point 
highlighted by the panel is that decisions made by the parks must 
be based on sound science, not just opinions of special interest 
groups or park officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian Alliance agrees with the principle of limited growth. 
That is not the argument.  The argument is about the lack of 
transparency, honesty and good will in the consultation process 
which has gone on for too long.  There is a lack of trust in 
Parks Canada officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to make some positive comments about the rank and file 
Parks Canada employees.  As public servants we need to thank them 
for their dedication to their work in our national parks.  Parks 
Canada has many roles to fulfil beyond national parks.  It is 
also responsible for historic sites.  At this time let me thank 
the minister for supporting the designation of William Barker, 
VC, as a Canadian war hero. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other jobs of Parks Canada are the marine conservation areas, 
federal historic buildings, historic railway stations, heritage 
river systems, federal archaeology and the grave sites of former 
prime ministers.  I thank both the minister and the parliamentary 
secretary for supporting one of the Canadian Alliance's 
amendments which would mandate recognition of traditional supply 
water from a park when an agreement has been negotiated.  I also 
thank the Parks Canada Agency and Tom Lee for their help in the 
acceptance of our amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to address some of the outstanding park issues that 
the bill does not properly address.  The most important issue is 
about mandating consultation.  Mandated consultation would 
improve the democratic process and develop a level of trust that 
does not currently exist today between the park tenants and the 
park administration.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last two years I have done some extensive workshops 
with park residents to try to find out for myself what the issues 
were throughout the western parks.  I have provided members of 
the heritage committee and the clerk the results of these 
workshops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consistently I have found that there tended to be a lack of 
trust between park officials and park users.  Even when public 
consultation occurs public input was ignored.  Time and time 
again it was pointed out that decisions made by park officials 
did not address the local needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was repeatedly stated that Parks Canada should get out of the 
business of municipal governance and that it should be looking 
after parks, not town sites, where there is no expertise.  Even 
publicly elected advisory committees are frustrated with Parks 
Canada on how it ignores advice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even when the consultation process was exercised it was not 
transparent, honest or accountable.  Many park users found the 
consultation process difficult to understand.  Another criticism 
was the lack of accountability in the way parks spent the money 
collected from the tenants through leases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of leases must be resolved so that it will be 
equitable to both parties through negotiation, not top down 
without any input.  How could Parks Canada justify lease 
increases up to 10 times their current value without giving the 
property owner due process?  It is in essence taxation without 
representation.  If due process is not respected, what is the 
difference between Bill C-70 and Bill C-27? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is needed is a comprehensive approach inviting both 
commercial and recreational tenant representation from all the 
parks to sit down at the table with park officials and resolve 
this contentious issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My findings were echoed by many of the witnesses coming before 
the heritage committee.  Canadian Alliance made many amendments 
to address the issues of access and accountability which were 
defeated.  Two amendments put forth by the Canadian Alliance were 
based on the principles of health and safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first one is to mandate keeping open air strips located in 
all national parks for the purpose of public safety.  COPA 
representing the general aviation sector in Canada has asked for 
this change for too many years.  I believe that saving one life 
is worth putting this into the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point is to mandate that all park wardens have all 
the resources to do their jobs without jeopardizing their health 
and safety.  Whose lives will be jeopardized if this change is 
not made by Parks Canada?  This is also long overdue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another direction which Canadian Alliance wanted to take was the 
recognition of local government bodies throughout this act.  We 
believe that this would have been an inclusive approach to begin 
the recognition of municipal governments in Canada, a view 
supported by the Federation of Canadian Municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me close by saying that Bill C-27 had the potential to make 
the system more accountable.  It would not have required a major 
overhaul.  With a few more amendments the bill would ensure that 
the democratic process would be respected by all parties.  The 
Canadian Alliance will not be supporting the bill as presented at 
third reading.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are at 
third reading of Bill C-27, on national parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be understood that the first objective of the bill is to 
ensure maintenance and restoration of the integrity of federal 
parks. Of course, everybody understands that these very 
important objectives cannot be reached only with one statute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the maintenance and restoration of the ecological 
integrity of parks depend much more on the attitude of the Parks 
Canada Agency, its management and staff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, Bill C-27 is a first element and a legislative framework 
that will allow the necessary culture to emerge and to develop 
fully within the Parks Canada Agency. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1345"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, that was one of the major recommendations of the 
commission, which recently reviewed those issues recently and 
which emphasized the need to make this change of culture and to 
prioritize the maintenance and restoration of the ecological 
integrity of parks. This bill could achieve that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill states that, in the performance of his duties, the 
minister must consult the people and the authorities in the 
areas concerned. 
This is an indispensable element that is essential if the agency 
is to carry out its mandate. Indeed, in all the parks, there are 
aboriginal communities which, in certain cases, cannot be 
neglected in the everyday planning of the agency in the exercise 
of its mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill provides, in my opinion, sufficient and efficient 
consultation of the communities and organizations concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, if this bill seems entirely acceptable on the 
whole, it does contain a clause that does not concern federal 
parks, but concerns historic sites. We do not know why this 
short clause, on historic sites, is in the bill, which is 
otherwise well structured. In fact, when we read this clause, we 
realize that it is quite badly written. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggested to the House, at report stage, that this clause be 
removed from the bill. But the House did not see fit to accept 
my suggestion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This clause presents a serious problem for municipalities and 
provinces where there are potential historic sites. Indeed, this 
clause provides that the agency may acquire such historic 
properties and declare them historic sites without having to 
consult in any way the provincial or municipal governments 
concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This aspect is out of tune with the rest of the bill, which 
clearly affirms that there must be consultations between the 
department, agency officials and, finally, the minister and the 
people or organizations concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this clause, there is no mention of any obligation on the 
part of the minister to take counsel together or to consult with 
the provinces or the local governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find this strange and even frightening. That is why, on the 
one hand, I suggest that the provincial legislatures ensure that 
any real estate transaction that would result in the transfer of 
an historical site to the federal government be submitted, for 
approval, to the provincial minister concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, I humbly and respectfully suggest that the 
government review this clause and that it reword it more 
rigorously and, above all, in a manner that would be more 
respectful of the provinces and municipalities, regarding the 
preservation and the enhancement of the historical sites affected 
by this clause of the bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, let me say that Bill C-27 will really allow us to 
focus on the preservation and the restoration of the ecological 
integrity of federal parks. In that perspective, the Bloc 
Quebecois endorses the goals of this bill and will obviously 
support it at third reading. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK79"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise today to speak to Bill C-27. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a national park in my riding.  It is one of the most 
beautiful spots in the world, Waterton Lakes National Park.  I 
spent some time up there talking to the people in the park.  I 
have been able to meet with the superintendents, present and 
past, to discuss issues.  I recently attended a Waterton Lakes 
leaseholders meeting to hear what some of their concerns are and 
certainly some of the comments made by the member for 
Dauphin—Swan River were reflected in the comments I heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to compliment the member for Dauphin—Swan River 
for sticking with this bill.  He has worked hard on it.  He 
brought forward some very good amendments and actually had one 
accepted by the government, which in this day and age is 
sometimes a strange happening.  I congratulate him.  It is an 
issue that goes back to before his life as the mayor of Dauphin. 
I also want to thank him for his tour of the western national 
parks.  He went to Waterton and met with people and held a really 
good grassroots consultation process to enable him to develop the 
position he has taken and the position he has helped our party to 
take.  That is exactly what needs to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the problems we see with the bill is that a mandated 
consultation process needs to be in place.  People who live in 
these parks have a right to consult directly with Parks Canada. 
They are a little nervous about the way it is structured right 
now, to be quite frank.  They feel that the minister and the 
governor in council have far too many powers.  There is a little 
mistrust by the people who live and work in the parks of the 
government and Parks Canada.  That grassroots consultation 
process would be very important for the bill to be received 
properly and to work properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People have worked with me and kept me informed of what is 
happening at Waterton Lakes National Park.  In particular, Jason 
Bruns was one of the first people who talked to me after I was 
elected.  He is an outdoorsman, he is a fisherman, he enjoys the 
park and any time he sees an issue that he thinks I need to be 
aware of he certainly brings it to my attention.  I appreciate 
that.  A few weeks ago, on the long weekend in May, when I was in 
Waterton for the leaseholders meeting, I met with him and he 
toured me around to show me some of the things that he would like 
to see changed, and we talked about some of the issues that he 
has.  He is an avid lover of the park.  He enjoys the outdoors 
and he feels that certainly protecting the ecological integrity 
of our parks is important.  However, the people who are best able 
to do that are the people who are close to our parks.  It is 
important that the government and the minister consult with the 
people who use and live in these parks.  They have the best idea 
of how to preserve them and keep them for future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the amendments that was brought forward was to deal with 
wardens, how they carry out their jobs and the fact that they 
should be allowed to carry firearms to protect themselves and to 
do their jobs properly.  That was defeated.  That is unfortunate 
because we feel that would give them a certain degree of security 
in the process they go through to carry out their duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But to get back to the leaseholders, there is a process in place 
now whereby the leases in the parks, particularly in Waterton, 
which I am most familiar with, are reviewed only once every 10 
years. 
At the present time the leaseholders are facing a huge increase 
in lease amounts.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We feel that the ability to consult with the government on a 
more regular basis and with the department would have helped 
alleviate some of this.  It is important that the process be in 
place to give people a chance to bring their ideas forward to be 
acted on by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Dauphin—Swan River alluded to some of the unique 
situations that exist in the parks.  They are not all the same. I 
have had letters from people in Jasper asking why they cannot be 
treated the same as the people in Waterton and why they cannot be 
treated the same as the people in Banff.  Each one is different. 
Banff has its own town council that runs the affairs there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we realize that there is this difference 
and that the minister takes the time to consult and not to paint 
everybody with the same brush under the same rules, because every 
place is unique and different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Trans-Canada Highway runs through Banff National Park.  That 
creates a whole issue of separate concerns to do with wildlife. 
The amount of money collected at the Banff gate helps to run the 
entire national park system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would like to reiterate that the people who use 
the parks, the people who live in the parks, the people who have 
businesses in the parks and certainly the visitors who come from 
all over the world to enjoy our national parks all need a voice 
in the implementation of legislation and the laws that govern 
them.  We hope that the government recognizes that fact, that it 
will honour those views and that it will implement them in the 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  When the hon. member finishes his discourse 
is up to him, but he has 10 minutes for questions and comments. 
Before we go to that, in order to give him a chance to get his 
thoughts together and to give other members a chance to get their 
questions together, I will go to Statements by Members and I will 
come back to this 10 minute question and comment period after 
question period, unless the member wants to go into debate. 
However, we will sort that out.

April, the lowest level since April 1976. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past 12 months, the number of full time jobs has 
increased significantly—by 3.1%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These performances are encouraging.  They clearly indicate that 
the climate remains favourable for investors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a country of choice to create jobs and develop 
projects for all regions. This picture also means that the 
Liberal government's economic and financial policies are 
producing solid results.  Nearly two million new jobs have been 
created under the Liberal government since it took office in 
1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a particularly fine job creation performance.

that this important bill is passed before the House recesses.

fight against private for profit hospitals.  Yesterday Brian

convincing victory for the Alberta NDP and a resounding vote of 
confidence for the only party that fights against for profit 
health care.

it was not clear to Liberals before it should be clear now. 
Canadians want the spirit of the Canada Health Act protected.

would never allow a private for profit health care system.  If he 
will never allow it, why is bill 11 law?  What has he done to 
stop for profit hospitals?  He is going down in history as the 
minister who allowed them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Albertans know it.  They are tired of the minister's syrupy

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe—Grey, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, today 
I rise to pay tribute a great Canadian, Jason Arnott.  Jason, who 
needs no introduction to hockey fans across the country, happens 
to be a local boy from Wasaga Beach where he began his hockey 
career in the minor hockey system.  He then went on to play for 
the Stayner Siskins as well as teams from Lindsay and Oshawa 
where he was a member of the 1990 Memorial Cup champions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following this he played for the Edmonton Oilers until 1997 when 
he joined the New Jersey Devils.  Then on June 10, Jason scored 
the winning goal during the second period of overtime against the 
Dallas Stars in the Stanley Cup finals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout his incredible career Jason has never lost sight of 
his roots.  He continues to be a huge supporter of local 
charities in Wasaga Beach including minor hockey. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know I speak on behalf of his parents, Bill and Eileen, the 
town of Wasaga Beach, the Parliament of Canada and all Canadians 
when I extend congratulation and thanks to Jason Arnott.  Today 
Canada recognizes him as one of its finest hockey sons.  By the 
way, Lord Stanley's Cup will soon visit Wasaga Beach.  I say 
congratulations to Jason.

may take part in this friendly competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the ninth year, on June 17, over 300 participants will 
entertain 3,000 spectators who will let themselves be carried by 
the sound of music.

provide an opportunity for artists to meet and, more 
importantly, to improve, since each participant is evaluated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a great musical party organized with dedication and 
competence by an army of volunteers, with the financial support 
of socioeconomic and sociocultural partners from the Granby 
region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This great event is the brainchild of Aline Couture Paré, who 
has an unconditional love for music and who has been in charge

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill 
C-20 has yet to be adopted, but it continues to draw serious 
criticism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, Claude Ryan strongly criticized the bill when he 
said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because it reduces the National Assembly to the rank of an 
inferior parliament, because it reflects a deep distrust of the 
Quebec democracy, because it suggests that Quebec sovereignists 
are seditious people who must be kept under surveillance, this 
bill is humiliating for the parliamentarians who sit in Quebec 
City and for the people whom they represent. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if Bill C-20 is passed by the current Liberal senators and 
those whom the Prime Minister will have to appoint to ensure 
that it is indeed passed, that will not give it the legitimacy 
it lacked when passed by this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This gag law will never deprive Quebecers of their right to 
choose their destiny, because Quebec is free, and the Quebec 
nation is sovereign.

Speaker, the Canadian Nurses Association begins this weekend in 
Vancouver its biennial convention with the federal Minister of 
Health as keynote speaker.  Its theme “Nursing in the 21st 
Century: Challenge and Change” is timely not only for the 
nursing profession but also for Canada's health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians know that when they come face to face with their 
health needs, whether in the ER or ICU, the acute or convalescent 
ward, the outpatient clinic, community centre or at home, they 
come with the reality of availability of access.  Nurses play a 
critical role as health care providers.  We cannot allow as a 
nation that their leading role be compromised.  Caring and 
competence are non-negotiable attributes.  Therefore governments 
have a duty to provide the needed resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even as the Government of Canada shares a partnership in 
commitment to see our health care system attuned to the realities 
of the new century, I am confident that the Canadian Nurses 
Association will share with all Canadians the wisdom of its 
collective experience.  Let us wish our nurses success during 
their weekend convention.

access paid consulting services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituent, Mr. Cornelis Hoogveen, from Rothesay, New

co-operation between dairy farmers and processors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While Cornelis was on site the final stages of privatization 
were taking place and his first task involved putting in place a 
new company structure.  He recommended reducing distribution 
costs by streamlining the order department and hiring a 
distribution supervisor.  A wage increase system was also put in 
place and an organizational chart developed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cornelis expects that the implementation of his recommendations 
and staff training will result in a reduction in duplication and 
waste as well as an increase in sales and profits.  I thank Mr.

<P><A NAME="LINK117"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, today StatsCan confirmed what 
Canadians have known for years, that the government is swallowing 
up more of their income in taxes than ever before.  What does the 
government spend it on?  Boondoggles, fountains, canoe museums, 
hotels, golf courses, and that is just in the Prime Minister's 
riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What right does the finance minister have to take so much of 
what Canadians earn and then squander it away? 
<P><A NAME="LINK118"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the reason the government's revenues are up is that 
things are going very well in Canada.  There are more people who 
are working.  There is more economic activity.  People's salaries 
are up.  I hate to say this to the leader of the Canadian 
Alliance, but that is good news for Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK119"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is for sure that incomes had to 
rise.  It is the only way they could afford the taxes really. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is spending $15 billion on transfers to health 
and $17 billion on grants and contributions.  Canadian families 
have been forced to finance for example the history of strippers, 
a display of French prostitutes, and the porn flick <I>Bubbles 
Galore</I>.  That is not to everyone's taste. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the finance minister against Canadian families keeping 
more of what they earn? 
<P><A NAME="LINK120"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, two-thirds of all of our new spending is in health care, 
education and basic research.  The issue really is, why did the 
Canadian Alliance vote against the increases in the national 
child benefit?  Why did the Canadian Alliance vote against 
increases in preschool child nutrition?  Why did the Canadian 
Alliance vote against every single measure the government has 
brought in to help the middle class in the country and to help 
Canadian families? 
<P><A NAME="LINK121"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, because we do not believe it for some 
funny reason.  Maybe it is just a drop in the sea to a shipping 
magnate but to the average family, $12,000— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  Please address each 
other by our proper titles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the finance minister, his 
highness, maybe does not realize that $12,500 is a lot of money 
to the average Canadian family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the finance minister could convince Canadians that he is 
buying better health care or improving the education system, 
Canadians might not mind so much, but he has not. He knows that 
he has not restored the health funding even to 1993 levels and 
the government is running a $5 billion surplus.

bungles, bubbles and boondoggles?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the leader of the Canadian Alliance would have us 
believe that her party is interested in health care.  Let me say 
that we were surfing the web the other day and we found the 
Canadian Alliance website.  We looked under health and I will 
read what it has under health, “There are no current articles 
for this category or department”.  The page is blank.

remember that it is Canadian entrepreneurs and Canadian 
businesses that fuel the economy.  It is the hard work of 
individual Canadians that provides not only family income but the 
government's income.  There is a limit to their generosity. 
Government is confiscating more and delivering less.  Worse, the 
Liberals do not even blink at a billion dollar bungle.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

out of a total of $58 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be prepared to defend on any podium in the country our

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley,

certainly an equal opportunity tax man.  It does not matter 
whether people are rich or poor as long as he gets his money. 
Robin Hood used to take money from the rich to give to the poor. 
The finance minister takes money from the rich and the poor to 
give to the human resources minister.

<P><A NAME="LINK129"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
three years ago, we held negotiations on this topic which 
produced nothing.  The government decided, and it announced very

would extend benefits from six months to twelve in order to help 
people on parental leave. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was very clearly established.  What I wonder today is why 
the Government of Quebec is speaking up after the decisions have

we are offering, if it has the money to do that, it is welcome 
to do so.  That will be just fine with us.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, there

section 69?  Will he negotiate with Quebec, or is the law no

</I></B></P><P align=left>If the benefit we are paying is insufficient, as Quebec claims, 
if 55% of earnings is not enough, it is fine with us if they 
want to bring it up to 75%.  We shall praise them for it, if 
they have the money to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we want is to treat everyone equally, and the money we will

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, recent 
income statistics show a growing gap, a disturbing gap, between 
Canadians with high incomes and those with lower and middle 
incomes.  StatsCan documents that government policies are 
aggravating this problem.  While European countries are 
relatively successful in fighting poverty, the U.S. record is 
abysmal.  Why?  Because economic growth alone will not defeat 
poverty. Better income support and child care programs are 
needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the government insist on mimicking the American 
approach? 
<P><A NAME="LINK138"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in fact we have worked very hard on that.  Some of the 
statistics do not take into account the fact that we have 
instituted in Canada a national child benefit program.  We are 
developing with the provinces a national children's agenda. We 
plan to lengthen employment insurance benefits for parents to 12 
months.  We have many, many other programs that are in place at 
this moment that were in the Speech from the Throne and in the 
last budget.  We are making a lot of progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time Canadians now have more revenue than they had 
before.  There were a lot of changes in the last budget to help 
the lower—

<P><A NAME="LINK139"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, if this 
government were serious about defeating poverty, it would be 
willing to learn the lessons in the recent income report.  If we 
adopt U.S. style tax policy, then we are going to get U.S. style 
social policy and the growing income gaps that come with it. 
Sadly, that is the goal the government is pursuing.  As UNICEF 
reports, countries that make up their minds to tackle poverty 
succeed, but in Canada, the odds are that a child of a lone 
parent is poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the government be so complacent about its record on 
poverty? 
<P><A NAME="LINK140"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it has been one of the items that we have devoted a lot 
of time to.  Statistics Canada yesterday reported that now our 
policies are beginning to pay off and said that fewer Canadian 
families are living in poverty today than there were some years 
ago.  We are making progress but the job is not over. We have to 
keep working at it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>    Mr. Speaker, the 
finance minister proposes in his financial services reform bill 
to grant himself unfettered power to say yes or no to bank 
mergers.  If merger proponents pass all the hurdles of his public 
impact review process, will he say yes to the mergers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  That is a hypothetical question.  I see the

<P><A NAME="LINK143"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am afraid the hon. member misunderstands the nature of 
the reforms.  The fact is that ultimately the Government of 
Canada has the right to make the decision and in fact must make a 
decision either yea or nay, and obviously that voice is expressed 
through that of the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that in this particular process we have introduced a 
number of steps, including the mandatory public hearings by the 
House of Commons finance committee and the advice from the 
Superintendent of Financial Institutions and the Competition 
Bureau. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure the hon. member that any decisions would be very 
well taken after a full examination in the public interest.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians have waited seven years for this government to 
introduce its financial services sector reform package which will 
not see royal assent until at least a year and may in fact be 
derailed by a general election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the changes in the global financial services sector 
occurring at web speed, why is this government moving at a 
snail's pace? 
<P><A NAME="LINK145"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the government is certainly not moving at a snail's 
pace.  We intend to push as aggressively as we possibly can, 
obviously subject to the prerogatives of parliament, to make sure 
that this legislation is passed as quickly as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we do want to have the public debate on the 
legislation. That is why fact we commissioned the MacKay report 
about 18 months to 2 years ago.  We wanted to examine every 
possible avenue open to make sure that on the one hand our banks 
are able to grow as much as possible and, on the other hand, that 
our consumers are protected as much as possible.

minister has been getting some lessons from the human resources 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It turns out that the human resources minister is not the only 
one with a dodgy set of books.  An internal finance department 
audit wonders whether the finance department's contracting 
practices could “be defensible if disclosed in the public eye”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the finance minister if he can tell the 
House why his department's contracting practices are not publicly 
defensible? 
<P><A NAME="LINK148"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the problem is of course that the hon. member opposite 
perhaps read the newspaper report.  What he should have done was 
to have read the report of the internal audit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I can just quote, it states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our review of CI&S controllable expenses indicated they were 
generally processed in compliance with applicable policies and 
procedures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also observed a desire on the part of CI&S staff to do things 
right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All professional service contracts adequately demonstrates 
CI&S's organizational needs.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, there were obviously defects in what the hon.

for CI&S.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley,

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are perhaps talking about some suspect contracting services 
in the Department of Finance.  This minister is the keeper of the

department, how can any Canadian trust anything the government 
says or does?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the premise of the hon. member's question just simply 
does not bear any kind of scrutiny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give one more quote from the report, following up on what 
the member said.  It states:

was adequately demonstrated.

elaborate criteria for major bank mergers, his colleagues are 
certainly free to make that suggestion in committee.

</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, the Minister of Finance is accountable to

to do with the holding companies that are permitted investments 
in that area as opposed to other places.

to people and small businesses in rural communities.  Yet this 
legislation only requires six months' notice before they pull 
out.  In six months they are gone.

it a requirement that the banks not be allowed to close a branch

make it eminently possible for a number of new banks, including 
credit unions, to provide smaller communities with a great deal 
more access to banking.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA NATIONAL PARKS ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK210">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-27, an 
act respecting the national parks of Canada, be read the third 
time and passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  When debate ended

he will not use the rest of his time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is indeed 
a pleasure for me to rise before the House to participate in 
third and final reading of Bill C-27, an act respecting the 
national parks of Canada.  We are talking about the national 
parks of Canada, which means that they belong to all Canadians 
and are for the benefit of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the real concerns I had with this government bill was 
that I believed the rights of some Canadians were being 
overlooked while the interests of others were being put forward 
in a very positive manner.  I was concerned that the commercial 
interests within our parks communities were being ignored as the 
government focused greater attention on preserving the ecological 
integrity of our existing national parks.  This increased focus 
on environmental issues relegated the concerns of our local 
entrepreneurs to the back burner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we could protect ecological integrity without having 
to sacrifice existing commercial interests.  I believe the 
interests of both can coexist given the willingness of each side 
to work together for the benefit of our national parks and those 
who depend upon them for enjoyment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was for this reason I introduced an amendment to subclause 
10(1) that specifically called for the inclusion of commercial 
interest among the groups that the minister should enter into 
agreements with for the purpose of carrying out the act. Although 
the government did not specifically adhere to the wording of my 
amendment it nevertheless amended the section to make it all 
inclusive, and it now includes commercial interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another major concern brought forward by a number of witnesses 
who appeared before the committee was that the federal government 
could have terminated leases or failed to renew leases without 
having to justify its reasoning to the affected individuals.  In 
effect, there was no recourse, no mechanism available for appeal 
by these individuals whose properties were effectively being 
confiscated by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party insisted that the bill include a clause which would 
demand that any property to be reclaimed by the government be 
done only if there were just cause.  These individuals are 
entitled to some kind of compensation in the event their leases 
are not renewed.  Therefore I am pleased that the government 
recognized the seriousness of this issue by reinstating the 
provisions contained within the Expropriation Act.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to congratulate my colleagues who sit with me on the 
Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage.  I especially want to 
acknowledge the efforts of my colleague, the member for 
Portneuf, whose amendments will give the committee more time to 
study the extension or the creation of future parks.  I also 
want to mention the efforts of his colleague from Manicouagan 
who made sure the opinions of the Mingan Archipelago residents 
would be taken into account. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the member for Churchill River for introducing 
his amendment to delete subclause 7.3 which would have limited 
debate on a motion to concur in amendments to our national parks 
system to only three hours.  That would have been a bad precedent 
to be set, the ability to legislate closure or the time allocated 
to debate a piece of legislation.  I am very happy that change 
took place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout our deliberations one of the concerns I had was 
trying to ensure that residents living within our national parks 
were provided with an opportunity to voice their concerns about 
the future direction of their local communities.  This concern 
was shared by all opposition members who through a number of 
proposed amendments tried to draw the government's attention to 
their need to have a voice in any future decision making. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, my colleague from Dauphin—Swan River introduced 
amendments at report stage that would have called for the 
inclusion of a “local government body” during any negotiations 
on the future of our parks communities.  Similar amendments were 
also introduced at committee by me and the member from Churchill. 
Unfortunately the federal government refused the inclusion of any 
wording that referred to a local government body for fear, I 
would think, of creating another Banff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned during report stage, and I will repeat it again 
at third reading, I regret that the member for Dauphin—Swan 
River opted not to actively participate in the debate of these 
amendments during clause by clause deliberations at committee. 
Instead he opted to introduce his own amendments during report 
stage.  His knowledge of parks communities, particularly having 
lived and operated near a national park for many years, would 
have provided all of us at committee very helpful insights into 
the unique problems facing individuals who reside within or just 
adjacent to our national parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the member for Dauphin—Swan River for introducing an 
amendment accepted by the government that secures access to a 
traditional source of fresh water emanating from our national 
parks which flows into adjacent communities.  This amendment was 
particularly important to the residents of Dauphin who have 
depended upon water from the Riding Mountain National Park since 
the early 1900s. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The priority of this government is undoubtedly to protect our 
national parks.  We are all aware of the problems existing in 
our national parks.  Many studies have been commissioned by the 
federal government and, each time, the consensus was that our 
parks are in jeopardy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government could no longer ignore the results of 
these studies.  Something had to be done before the integrity of 
our national parks was imperilled for ever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just like most Canadians, I want to protect our national parks 
for future generations.  As parliamentarians, we must take the 
appropriate measures to protect our parks, for our children and 
for our children's children. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party has a long history of wanting 
to protect and preserve representative areas of our unique and 
wonderful ecosystem.  As I have mentioned before, Canada's first 
Prime Minister, Sir John A. Macdonald, created our first national 
park when in 1885 his Conservative government designated 26 
square kilometres around the hot mineral springs near what is now 
the town of Banff, declaring it a national treasure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sir John A. Macdonald began a legacy that successive governments 
have continued to build upon.  He recognized the intrinsic beauty 
of Canada's natural environment.  It is this beauty that we are 
trying to protect in Bill C-27.  Is it perfect?  Far from it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will this piece of legislation respond to the need to protect 
the ecological integrity of our national parks?  I personally 
believe it will go a long way to help preserve for generations to 
come the natural beauty we are so fortunate to have here in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill does not address all the concerns that were expressed 
before the committee.  Residents in our national park 
communities, particularly in Jasper, are still concerned that 
their voices are not being heard by the Liberal government.  The 
success of Bill C-27 will depend largely upon the goodwill of the 
federal government and particularly the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I can understand why the residents of Jasper 
are concerned.  The government has failed to demonstrate any 
goodwill in its past dealings with the residents of Jasper. It is 
imperative that the government approach future negotiations with 
our park communities in a co-operative manner and not with the 
confrontational approach that has poisoned relations between 
Parks Canada officials and the local residents for years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said, the bill is not perfect.  However I believe it 
goes a long way in helping the government maintain existing parks 
while also speeding up the process of creating new national 
parks. I suggest that we support Bill C-27.

process where members of parliament can speak on the bill before

national parks should be above politics.  They are a trust for 
this and future generations of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As stated by the parliamentary secretary, a high degree of 
co-operation existed during the legislative review by the 
Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage. I would like to state 
our appreciation for the outstanding levels of co-operation 
during the committee hearings and the support of Parks Canada 
personnel throughout the legislative process.  I also wish to 
acknowledge the chair of the standing committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was very important to overcome several shortcomings in the 
legislation.  A good example of where Bill C-27 was strengthened 
by the committee working together right from the very start was 
on the definition of ecological integrity.  Many members were 
surprised to find that there was no definition for the mandate of 
Parks Canada on ecological integrity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most opposition parties put forward a definition found in the 
ecological integrity panel report and the government put forward 
its own definition of ecological integrity.  It was a definition 
that could have been construed or interpreted as simplified or 
weak.  The committee members from both sides of the House, with 
the assistance of Parks Canada and experts, were able to hammer 
out a suitable compromise on a proper and adequate definition. 
The final agreed upon definition reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Ecological integrity” means, with respect to a park, a 
condition that is determined to be characteristic of its natural 
region and likely to persist, including abiotic components and 
the composition and abundance of native species and biological 
communities, rates of change and supporting processes. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is quite a definition.  There is a reason why I raised the 
example of co-operation that transcends political boundaries. The 
respect for Canada's wilderness treasures has led to a stronger 
bill than the version that was first tabled in the House.  The 
ecological panel spent several years identifying and describing 
the risks that parks face. “Parks are not islands” was the 
panel's rallying cry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were other areas in the bill where improvements were made 
and others where improvements were not made at all.  My 
colleagues have raised the necessity for improving community 
consultations, which I will address in a moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For now I will speak on proposed clause 8(3) which was defeated 
and which I hope the other place will discuss. 
The report stage Motion No. 3 proposed by the NDP would have 
addressed the concerns put forward by the Canadian Nature 
Federation and some committee members.  Those concerns were that 
many of the threats to Canada's national parks are from 
developments and land use decisions external to the national park 
boundaries.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed as the ecological panel stated, parks are not islands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a growing appreciation and need for Parks Canada to 
work with adjacent landowners and decision makers to try and 
ensure the complementary management of national parks and 
adjacent lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parks Canada must be able to provide its information and 
knowledge of greater park ecosystems to any authority or body, 
environmental assessment panels, et cetera, to ensure that the 
decisions account for their possible impact on these nationally 
significant landscapes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament is ultimately responsible for the national parks act, 
for ensuring that the national parks are passed on unimpaired for 
the enjoyment of future generations.  It is our duty as 
parliamentarians to do our best to protect this country and our 
citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Twice now, in 1988 and today, parliament has directed the 
minister and Parks Canada to make the restoration and maintenance 
of ecological integrity of Canada's national parks the first 
priority in all management decisions.  If these goals that 
parliament has set out are to be met, then the men and women who 
manage our national parks must be confident in the fact that 
parliament fully expects them to participate in the decision 
making processes that are reasonably expected to affect the 
ecological integrity of national parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP motion would have assisted in this noble effort which is 
of great importance to all Canadians. The amendment sought to 
provide park managers with the assurance that while they may have 
no jurisdiction over land use decisions outside the parks, we do 
expect them to provide the best information and advice to those 
land use processes reviewing developments outside those parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only by participating in such forums can we expect Parks Canada 
and other landowners to work co-operatively to achieve the 
conservation of the parks landscape both inside and outside the 
boundaries in such a way that native species survive and human 
aspirations and benefits from the natural places are realized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The improvements to the bill are substantial and no bill is 
perfect.  However, we are disappointed that the government voted 
against the amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another amendment we would like to see in the future is the Bill 
C-27 definition of ecological integrity included in the Parks 
Canada Agency Act.  This would provide absolute clarity in the 
agency's mandate.  When parliament debated the agency act in the 
first session of the 36th Parliament, there was no definition of 
ecological integrity, although the term can be found in this bill 
now.   Let us clarify it in both acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of particular note for future discussion was a proposed 
amendment for clarifying “no net negative environmental impact” 
as part of the governor in council regulations and powers in 
relation to development.  This was a written witness submission 
that followed the somewhat hurried committee hearings, a point to 
provide assurance to developers and communities that this 
expression would apply evenly and fairly, to ensure the heritage 
minister's commitment to no net negative environmental impact was 
not misunderstood by any cabinet minister in the future, 
especially if it is related to a new park for example in Atlantic 
Canada or in the northern regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank the parliamentary secretary and Parks 
Canada staff for a particular improvement made to Bill C-27 
during the committee stage.  Witnesses and my colleague the 
member for Yukon raised specific concerns on the traditional and 
sacred gathering of objects and materials in national parks.  The 
committee made a specific change for clarification in clause 25 
to avoid a misunderstanding of the definition of trafficking in 
the bill, for example, to avoid traditional bartering of 
medicinal herbs as being defined as a crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee also struck down an attempt to limit the debate on 
the parks amendments to three hours.  The NDP and most members of 
parliament are against time allocation and limitations on free 
speech and debate.  Committee members agreed and the limitation 
on debate, a dangerous precedent for other legislation in this 
House, was defeated in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues, this point brings me to a constant concern for 
this bill.  As elected officials it is our duty to represent our 
constituents, our ridings and the majority views that these 
special places in Canada hold.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As stated by my colleagues, the recognition of parks communities 
was an important issue throughout the debate and hearings for the 
national parks act which led to this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prince Albert National Park is located in the Churchill River 
constituency. The community of Waskesiu in turn is located in 
the park, one of seven identified parks communities in Canada. 
Representatives are elected by the communities to participate in 
the Parks Canada process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We acknowledge that the government in clause 12 of the bill 
drew attention to and recognizes the representatives of parks 
communities.  This is an important step forward but the efforts 
should not have been limited there.  At no time in the future 
should the important contributions that the residents, Canadian 
citizens, play in Canada parks development, maintenance and 
future direction be ignored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Waskesiu an elected community representative committee 
consists of people like Shelley Funk, Peter Strassen and Hervé 
Langlois working with Parks Canada constantly.  There is a great 
working relationship with Parks Canada, especially with 
Superintendent Bill Fisher.  Our office appreciates his hands-on 
and progressive approach, and his honesty and sincerity which are 
a reflection on Parks Canada's history and professional standards 
that Canadians have grown to expect and treasure. 
The degree of respect held by committee members, Shelley, Peter 
and Hervé in Waskesiu, should be considered no differently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tom Lee, the CEO of Parks Canada, stated on May 30: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all I would like to state before the committee because 
Waskesiu does have concerns and they have written me that this is 
a terrific organization to work with, they're supportive of the 
park, they're valued.  We want to see that relationship 
maintained and we think they're important, we know they're 
important. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP acknowledges that an effort was made by the reference in 
clause 12 but still maintains that the government could have gone 
further in recognizing parks communities.  We do not state that 
more municipal power authorities were necessary, but more fair 
and just acknowledgement was required. Removing Jasper and 
leaving Banff in the bill was a political issue at best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Community buy-in and participation in the new direction of 
saving our parks and not just limiting operations to a 
cost recovery Disneyland theme park approach is an absolute 
necessity.  Parks communities such as Waskesiu have come a long 
way in recent years, overcoming distrust and shock at the degree 
of cutbacks inflicted during the government's slash and dash 
deficit years in the mid-1990s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have come a long way since my friend Cec Allen played on the 
shores of Kingsmere as a child, and watched as a decision from 
Ottawa removed the summer shacks that local residents enjoyed 
just because Ottawa's perception was that they were not pretty or 
aesthetic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jasper representatives described an emergency response vehicle 
ordered via the cookie-cutter approach in Ottawa that did not 
fit into the fire hall.  That put people's lives at risk and Parks 
Canada and the community to shame.  Communities are there daily 
and should be respected and heard.  Then these blunders would not 
appear.  There would be a smooth transition of community decisions 
and recommendations and parks delivery of the recommendations 
if they meet the appropriate standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Community participation could have been better defined.  This 
was the government's political decision, and we were disappointed 
that it did not materialize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the most important point about the bill that Canadians 
would like to know is, where do we fit in now?  Will access be 
closed to humans?  Will recreation be stopped?  I would like to 
state for the record, no.  All this is about accessibility.  Our 
population and international visitors will continue to enjoy our 
parks, perhaps in different ways, at different times and in 
different locations as parks grow in the country to offset 
seasonal peaks and breeding times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Gérin, the panel chairperson, said that stopping visitor 
use was not the point at all.  Better visitor use is needed.  More 
education and interpretation is needed.  A better respect for our 
natural treasures and the fragile nature of our parks must be taught 
and distributed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The increase in aboriginal participation is welcome across the 
country and throughout the parks system.  It is a welcome 
initiative for aboriginal communities to see parks take an open 
stance in delivering and preserving the natural heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the government defeated our reference to traditional 
aboriginal ecological knowledge, the reference is found in other 
pieces of legislation in Canada.  It could be brought in later. 
This is an important contribution that the original peoples and 
elders make to understanding our nature and national parks and is 
a key component for the future of our national parks.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the heritage minister for the foresight and vision 
demonstrated by her support for the aboriginal secretariat for 
Parks Canada.  Speaking of vision, I recognize that one reason 
for the new and improved parks act was to expedite the completion 
of Canada's national park system based on an eco-region approach. 
Of 39 eco-regions 14 remain unprotected.  This is a repeated red 
book promise.  The improved legislative capacity of Bill C-27 
will help this process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the governor general for her specific mention of 
completing Canada's parks system in the throne speech.  I know 
she shares the concern of the heritage minister and the Prime 
Minister that this legacy for our children and future generations 
be completed as soon as possible in this new century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP shared its surprise when the finance minister neglected 
to provide any money to fulfil this promise.  It was an awakening 
when in the budget speech Parks Canada was totally missed.  With 
the passing of this act perhaps the finance minister can provide 
a Christmas present for all Canadians this year by putting the 
100 million dollars plus identified as necessary for this noble 
goal that the NGOs, parks communities and Canadians have called 
on, especially Parks Canada personnel who need these resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time as there is sufficient funding to maintain let 
alone restore our national parks, our national wilderness 
treasures deserve respect, not neglect.  That is another debate 
for another day, a day when there are the values Canadians can 
hold true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We value our national parks.  The national parks are hereby 
dedicated to the people of Canada for their benefit, education 
and enjoyment, subject to the act and regulations.  The parks 
shall be maintained and made use of so as to leave them 
unimpaired for the future enjoyment of generations to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With those noble words that are a part of Bill C-27, we lend our 
support to the bill.  We hope that Canadians will enjoy the 
national parks this summer and for future generations.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
1996, the Minister of Canadian Heritage did me the honour of 
asking me to act as liaison with the working group that was 
appointed to study ecological issues relating to Bow Valley, 
mainly around Banff National Park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The working group, on completing its work, stated for the first 
time that the principle of ecological integrity needed to be 
applied in our national parks, especially those located in the 
Rockies, which were its main concern. Based on this principle, 
the working group called upon the minister to stop all 
commercial development, particularly in the city of Banff, which 
was continuing to expand commercially. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must congratulate the minister for the courage it took and for 
the integrity she showed. All her actions since then, first of 
all in implementing the recommendations of the working group, 
have required a lot of abnegation and courage. It was a 
controversial decision to implement the recommendations of the 
Bow Valley working group, but it was an even more controversial 
decision to establish, two years later, in 1998, a national 
panel to look into the future of our parks, namely the panel on 
the ecological integrity of Canada's national parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That panel, which sat all through last year, was made up of 11 
distinguished Canadians. I want to say a special thanks to the 
chairman, Jacques Gérin, and to other distinguished Canadians 
such as Stephanie Cairns, Louis Bélanger and Henry Lickers, who 
represented various segments of society, particularly in 
relation to their convictions with regard to the future of our 
parks. 
They came to some really striking conclusions. I want to quote 
here what their report said on the loss of habitats inside our 
parks.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada over 90% of Carolinian forests have been converted to 
farmland or towns.  On the prairies 99% of the native tall grass 
communities and 75% of mixed grass communities have disappeared. 
In Atlantic Canada 65% of the coastal marshes have been drained 
or filled.  Across northern Canada only 35% of the boreal forest 
remains undisturbed.  Largely as a result of this habitat loss 
many Canadian species are currently threatened. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife 
in Canada detected 339 endangered species. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amazing part of this report was that it developed a huge 
consensus in Canada.  After broad consultations involving all 
sectors the report received great support from Canadians who 
value our parks beyond every other value in Canada, except 
perhaps certain things like the flag, the CBC and national 
identity.  The parks represent all that is valuable to us in the 
sense of our well-being and our sense of values in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It included a panel on ecological integrity supported by 
industry, which again is a breakthrough.  I will quote from an 
industry association submission to the panel which indicates that 
parks must become centres of learning and study of ecological 
processes to provide answers for those who wish to manage in the 
best ecological way possible.  Parks must create research groups 
in partnership with universities and industry to build the body 
of knowledge necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 the state of parks report of Canada indicated that out 
of 38 national parks then in existence only one showed no 
ecological impact or stress.  Therefore 37 of the 38 parks showed 
some degree, mild to serious, of ecological impact or stress. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ultimate recommendation of the panel on the ecological 
integrity of Canada's national parks to the Canadian government 
was that ecological integrity should become the management 
priority of our national parks. This led to Bill C-27, which we 
are debating today at third reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation integrated the very principle of the ecological 
integrity for all aspects of the management of our national 
parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleagues from the Progressive Conservative Party and the 
New Democratic Party said earlier, the Standing Committee on 
Canadian Heritage came to a true consensus on Bill C-27. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this opportunity to particularly thank the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Canadian Heritage, the member for 
Ottawa—Vanier, who does a beautiful job listening to people and 
who has made himself available to all committee members in order 
to improve the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to particularly thank my colleagues in the 
opposition, the member for Dauphin—Swan River, as well as those 
for Portneuf, West Nova and Churchill River. All have shown a 
positive, constructive attitude. All the members of the committee 
have worked together, in a non partisan spirit, to improve this 
act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague for Churchill River said so eloquently, we 
believe that parks are above petty politics or partisan politics.

will be much easier to create new parks. Seven new parks will be

nations. There will also be—and this is very necessary—more 
fines for poaching and the trafficking of animals and wildlife

other as People.

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We thank our mother, the earth, for all that is good, 
represented so beautifully by our national parks.  I forgot to 
mention that I will be splitting my time with my colleague from 
Oak Ridges. 
<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, Bill 
C-27 proposes a number of important measures related to seven 
communities located within national parks.  In order to 
understand these provisions we should examine the history of the 
communities and the prospects for their future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All seven communities have their origins in the last part of the 
19th century and the early part of the 20th century.  In the 
Rocky Mountain parks of Banff, Jasper and Yoho, the development 
of communities is tightly linked to the development of our 
national railway and road transportation corridors.  The town of 
Banff was a railway construction and service centre some years 
before the national park was established. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both the towns of Banff and Jasper even today continue to serve 
railway needs along with the national park needs.  A small 
community which is an operational centre for the Canadian Pacific 
Railway as well as the administrative centre for the park, Field 
is essentially a residential community for railway and park 
employees.  Lake Louise and Banff National Park were developed as 
a tourist centre by the CPR prior to being incorporated into the 
park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further south, the community of Waterton Park in Waterton Lakes 
National Park was developed with the primary purpose of serving 
park visitors.  It operates seasonally and has a year round 
population of fewer than 100 residents.  The same is true of 
Waskesiu in Prince Albert National Park, Saskatchewan, and 
Wasagaming in Riding Mountain National Park, Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note these facts to underscore the context within which the 
communities were established.  It was at a time in Canada's 
history when we looked upon our nation as having unlimited 
wilderness.  Extraction of natural resources was not perceived as 
being in conflict with that belief.  Consequently forestry and 
mining were allowed within some national parks and communities 
which were established to serve those interests. 
For example, Anthracite and Bankhead were coal mining towns 
established in Banff National Park.  Oil City, in Waterton Lakes 
National Park, served the first of our oil drilling operations. 
Although these extracting activities in the communities of 
Anthracite, Bankhead and Oil City have long vanished, they remind 
us of an era when such activities were deemed appropriate within 
national parks.

<A HREF="#LINKT68"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, however, we know that our wilderness is limited and we 
understand the need to preserve representative areas within our 
national park system.  We no longer allow the commercial 
exploitation of natural resources within national parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, we understand that any development within a national 
park should be carefully limited so as to avoid impairment to its 
ecological integrity.  We understand, too, that high quality 
environmental conditions are the foundations for the tourist 
industry and the very reason millions of people visit our parks 
annually.  Therefore, no new communities will be located within 
national park boundaries.  The existing communities will be 
managed in ways that support park values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Canadian Heritage has put great effort and 
thought into the drafting the community provisions in the bill 
before.  She has been diligent in analyzing the key studies which 
identified problems and solutions within the national park 
system, which we discussed at committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Banff-Bow Valley study of 1996, and the work of the ecological 
integrity panel, which reported to her this March, contained wide 
ranging recommendations which served as the basis for her 
ecological integrity action plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous version of this bill, Bill C-70, died on the order 
paper last year.  One of its provisions related to the 
introduction of municipal taxation within park communities. These 
provisions would not have applied to Banff since it already has a 
municipal taxation regime as a municipality incorporated under 
Alberta legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposal to introduce municipal taxation in the other 
communities led to concerns which could best be summarized in the 
phrase “taxation without representation”.  The taxation 
provisions have been removed and Parks Canada will continue to 
subsidize the administration of these communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, I want to reassure members of the House that 
the park community residents will be actively involved in the 
management of their communities.  Each community is unique and 
the management model that evolves in a particular community will 
be tailored to that community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that the communities are special, federal responsibilities 
situated on federal crown lands within a national park, it is 
important that parliament retain an overview of their role and 
development.  To that effect, Bill C-27 proposes that community 
plans be tabled in each House as soon as possible after 
proclamation of the new Canada National Parks Act.  The plans 
with respect to the provisions in this act will be consistent 
with the park management plan; an accord with guidelines for 
appropriate activities; and, provide a strategy for growth 
management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Growth management will be achieved by describing the boundaries 
of the community and its commercial zones, along with a measure 
of maximum floor area permitted within the zones.  The shaping of 
these plans will also be guided by principles stated in the bill, 
namely, no net environmental impact, responsible environmental 
stewardship and heritage conservation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concerns were raised by the park community representatives 
during the hearings on Bill C-27 and the standing committee 
responded.  Regarding concerns with respect to the termination of 
the leases, the bill has been amended to state that the 
Expropriation Act applies.  Community plan has been identified to 
mean a land use plan for the park community.  This new definition 
serves two purposes.  First, it ensures that there will be no 
confusion between the use of the term “community plan” and this 
legislation and how the term is used in the  Alberta legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it signals to park community residents that there is no 
impediment to them undertaking their own planning for social, 
educational, health and related needs of their community.

evolution of the communities from the past century into the new

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it gives me pleasure to have a short opportunity to 
speak to this bill, particularly with Banff National Park being 
in my riding, an area which I have enjoyed for many years because 
of its beauty, expanse, the people who reside there and who have 
pioneered that whole area and the number of individuals with whom 
I have met and talked with regard to what takes place there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had the pleasure of living in that mountain range for 
over 60 years.  I know quite a bit about mountains and wildlife. 
I certainly can appreciate any effort to try to maintain the 
natural beauty and the natural state of any area that is so 
appealing to the people of this great land.  We must really 
continue to stress the fact that this land does belong to the 
people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I looked at the original bill, and then found out about 
Bill C-27, I have to admit that I was in total shock.  I never 
believed for a moment that the Liberal Party would back down from 
a tax grab, but it did.  That shock was a little too stressful. 
However, I certainly am glad to see that someone rattled the 
party's chain and brought it to its senses at least once in the 
time I have been here.  It will no longer be required to take 
extra money from residents when it has no business doing that, 
because it is taxation without representation.  I applaud them 
for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The thing that always bothers me about decision making in a park 
is the consultation factor.  Consultation, to the Liberal 
government, has bothered me for a number of years.  I have seen 
consultation on agriculture in my riding.  The Liberals come in 
droves to get consultation but they do not seem to understand 
what the people are saying in my riding when it comes to 
agricultural issues, for example, their beliefs on how marketing 
of their product should take place.  So much for consultation. 
They hear it but they do not do anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sat in on the consultations that were supposed to take place 
throughout Banff National Park regarding a number of issues.  The 
strange thing about it was that some people did not even know 
about the consultations.  They did not even know they were going 
to have an opportunity to speak, because in a lot of instances it 
is only a select few who get invited to the table when we have a 
consultation period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I am fortunate enough to get wind of it, I like to crash in 
on these consultation parties and listen to what is being said. 
It is not an open consultation process and it never has been.  I 
do not know why they continue to say things like “What a broad 
consultation we have had.  What a wonderful thing we are doing”. 
I can name dozens and dozens of people who have lived in Banff 
National Park all their lives and who may have worked for the 
railroads or in the original mines.  Believe me, these people 
have some knowledge about what should happen and what should not 
happen.  Their consultation process just does not seem to occur.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have good one-on-one visits.  I try to hold meetings and get 
input.  I had our critic out in Banff one night and we had a fair 
turnout.  We wanted some input from people so we could bring 
their message to this Liberal government and to the heritage 
minister.  I understand we have a heritage minister who was 
absolutely shocked that we had mountains in Banff, for goodness 
sakes.  It is really strange to hear these things but that is 
what I hear.  “Oh my, look at all the big mountains”.  She did 
not know we had those. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no way I can be convinced that public consultations 
will be held when it is not clear who will call for these things. 
The section states “The minister will have these discussions as 
appropriate”.  It will be the minister deciding if it is 
appropriate to have consultations, a minister who lives in the 
industrial area of Hamilton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps some people in Banff might need to have consultations. 
Maybe they should make the decisions.  Or, as Ralph Klein stated, 
“the lack of consultation that takes place with regard to 
stakeholders and park users indicates that Ottawa is dictating 
changes to park policy without input from even the provinces”. 
Like it or not, that is the feeling out there.  It does not 
matter whether the members jeer what I say or that they want to 
make a big noise about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spend a lot of time in that park because it is in my riding. I 
talk to individuals. I know decisions are made carte blanche 
without any input whatsoever from them.  They are getting a 
little tired of that kind of activity.  There is also no 
consultation with anybody who is affiliated with the province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lake Louise is another beautiful little community in Banff 
National Park.  I will tell a story to the House of what happened 
there, just to show the disgraceful way this government operates. 
When I was in the Samson Mall, a great stopping off place for 
people who pass through the park, a fellow told me he was glad to 
see me at Lake Louise and indicated that he would like to meet 
with me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three people wanted to meet with me behind a building and all 
three of them were park wardens.  Why did they want to go behind 
the building to meet with me?  As employees of Parks Canada, 
answerable to the Liberal government, they did not want to be 
seen talking to an official opposition member because it could 
mean they would be ostracised or punished for having done so 
without permission from park officials.  We had to have a secret 
meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The meeting lasted about 30 minutes and these individuals 
described to me the various reasons why they felt they needed to 
have sidearms.  However, the experts on that side of the House do 
not think they need them.  Have they ever consulted with park 
wardens who have lived there all their lives, who have confronted 
poachers and situations that are a little dangerous regarding 
wild animals, which those members also know nothing about? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do not give me this crap about consultations.  I had more 
consultation in 30 minutes out of sight because these guys, who 
are employees of this Liberal government, did not want to be seen 
talking about it.  After all, it could mean their jobs.  What a 
pathetic situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, that is not surprising.  When we go into communities 
and do our work as critics for prisons, guess who does not want 
their names being used if they talk to us?  They are called 
prison guards and prison correctional officers.  Why do they not 
want their names used?   It is because they are considered to be 
employees of this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consultation?  No, I am afraid not.  The government does not 
really know the meaning of the term. 
Consultation to them is to go out and put on a show.  They put on 
a good front, pretend to know what they are talking about, come 
back to Ottawa, make all the decisions, and then do whatever they 
like.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When good amendments that make sense are presented by various 
members of different parties the government will not consider 
them.  After all, they were put forward by members of the 
opposition who want to make it all political. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The preservation and the future of parks should never be a 
political issue.  The value of the land of this great country is 
far more than economics.  There is nothing more valuable than the 
natural beauty of the greatest country in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This group of people does not want to shove politics aside and 
deal with the issues in a truly open and consultative way, with 
true willingness to accept good, solid ideas to make a bill 
better.  When they take that approach then Ralph Klein is right. 
It is the dictatorial attitude of government members, ignoring 
input from people, not allowing input from the provinces or 
anyone else that causes the real grief in our parks.  The sooner 
we get rid of that attitude the better will be the chance for the 
future of our parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Before we go to 
questions and comments, in the flight of passionate debate the 
hon. member for Wild Rose used a word which has been deemed 
unparliamentary.  I am sure that it was used in error, in the 
flight of debate.  It was the term “crap”.  I wonder if the 
member for Wild Rose would retract that word.  I know that it was 
not meant in any disrespectful way, but let us not leave it on 
the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Yes, Mr. Speaker, I will replace that 
word with fertilizer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I was not exactly 
sure if he was referring to a political party's name that never 
made it or just where we were.  Anyway, we are over it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, maybe the word the member misused and then withdrew was 
typical of his oratory.  His speech was full of exaggeration and 
venom.  He talked about the minister not even knowing there was a 
mountain in Banff or that the Rockies existed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought it was a pathetic display, considering that members in 
the opposition had just finished saying how much consensus and 
openness there was in the committee for reviewing amendments. 
Each one of them praised the spirit of co-operation that went 
beyond partisan politics, which he reintroduced.  It is almost a 
slap in the face to his own colleague who leads the party in the 
committee, who was far more co-operative and viewed the whole 
exercise very differently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The panel on ecological integrity sat after the Bow Valley 
study.  I was involved in the Bow Valley study so I know how many 
people and groups were consulted.  The panel sat for one year and 
listened to I do not know how many groups from all sectors.  I 
quoted an industry association, but I could have quote many 
others that took part in the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mayor of Banff himself came to our committee.  He certainly 
did not speak like the member.  I suppose he must know something 
about his town and his park.  He spoke in very constructive terms 
about the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member felt so strongly about it to scream and shout and 
accuse everybody of wrongdoing, why he did not bother even once 
to turn up at our committee to propose amendments, to fight for 
his position and to tell us all he told us here?  We never saw 
him. The committee sat and heard a lot of people.  He could have 
taken the place of the member for Dauphin—Swan River, but he did 
not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The word he misused was probably very typical of what he said.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not sure if there 
was a question, so I guess there is no answer to that kind of 
rhetoric either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have loved to have gone to committee.  However, I would 
never want to replace my critic in that role because he is doing 
an outstanding job.  I would have loved to have had the 
opportunity to have been there, but we get these silly little 
heart attacks once in a while which do not give us the chance to 
be here when we would like to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk to a lot of people in our ridings who live in these 
areas.  We do not wait for those people to come here to the 
mountain.  We find that there are a lot more areas of 
consultation that could been dealt with.  It is just not their 
way.  That is my point.  It is not their way.  That is what Ralph 
Klein said.  It is not their way when they do not even bother to 
consult with the provinces.  It is a dictatorial method by which 
they operate in Ottawa which is unacceptable.  Even Ralph Klein 
said it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not care what kind of screaming the hon. member thinks I 
do, but I know one thing:  we want consultation with the people 
of Banff and the people in communities like Lake Louise and 
others who are not represented by a government body.  The Banff 
town council and the Banff mayor do an excellent job of looking 
after the town of Banff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is too bad there are not other government bodies in some of 
the communities within these parks where people are able to 
address their concerns.  This government will not allow even a 
definition of a government body of any sort.  I would be more 
than pleased to hear what the definition of a government body 
would be for Lake Louise.  Is it the voluntary advisory 
committee, the voluntary housing committee, or the staffers 
committee?  Who speaks on behalf of the people who have resided 
there forever? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals will not give us a definition of the government 
body for these towns.  The town of Banff is the only exception, 
and I applaud the people of that town for their efforts.  They do 
their best to make sure they do what needs to be done, in spite 
of the government.  They can do a better job themselves without 
any help from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is too bad the government does not listen a little more to 
some of the good advice that comes from those areas.  It is too 
bad it does not make it more available to the people who have 
lived there for years and years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would think that people as old and wise as the gentleman who 
asked the question would know how important it is to go to the 
elderly people who have lived in these communities for years. 
They have a lot more wisdom than we give them credit for.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to correct the 
record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In one of the comments the member for Wild Rose made he said 
that there were no amendments accepted to the bill from any of 
the opposition parties.  The exact opposite is true.  There were 
amendments made to the bill by every single opposition party. 
Those amendments were made as a result of listening to all who 
wished to be heard at the committee, including rank and file 
employees of the parks agency and everyone else who wanted to be 
heard, from Banff and Jasper, from the aboriginal communities, 
from Mingan and from all the environmental groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every single opposition party in the House put amendments 
forward and every single party had some of its amendments 
accepted by the committee, including the Canadian Alliance 
members at report stage, because they would not put them forward 
at the committee stage, with all due respect to my colleague from 
Dauphin—Swan River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to correct the record on what the member for Wild Rose 
said.  It is the opposite which is true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am aware of the 
amendment that was approved which the member for Dauphin—Swan 
River put forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am saying, and what I have said from the start when 
questioned about why I was not at committee, is that it has been 
my experience in the seven years I have been here that usually 
that is the case.  This might have been the one time when it was 
not quite that usual.  They may have put forward amendments and 
had one or two accepted.  But most of them come in the front door 
and, because of the dictatorial attitude that exists on that side 
of the House, they usually go out the back door.  That is the 
truth.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I agree to some extent with my hon. colleague.  I do not 
have a park in my riding, but Prince Albert National Park, the 
home of Grey Owl, is located north of my riding.  I think it is 
subject to creeping bureaucratization.  It needs to be cut back 
and spending priorities need to be looked at again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last summer I probably had more phone calls, more petitions, 
more letters and more newspaper articles written on the lake that 
Grey Owl's cabin is on than on any other issue in my riding. 
Groups of people came to see me.  I had to tour the park.  They 
have finally managed to wrestle it to the ground, but it has been 
quite a task.  The local people have to have their eyes open all 
the time.  They have to be aware of what is going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Vigilance is always very important when dealing with 
bureaucracies.  Legislation is important, but it is how people 
use legislation to accomplish their ends.  Parks are not an end 
in themselves and people are not an unnecessary and unwelcome 
intrusion on the national parks, and I think that is important to 
say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to point 
out another thing that occurs in my riding.  Banff is close to 
the major city of Calgary and a lot of visitors go there.  A 
number of seniors have shown up on my doorstep or at my office in 
Airdrie, just outside Calgary, who have reached the gates of 
Banff and have turned back because suddenly there was a fee 
increase that was totally unaffordable.  All this was done 
without consultation or news to anybody.  People said that they 
had gone to the gate and suddenly the rules had changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have talked to the park superintendents and other people who 
work in the bureaucracy.  They understand that they should 
correct it, and they do.  I applaud most of the people who work 
there.  They try to be very accommodating to me as the member of 
parliament and to the people who use the park.  However, most of 
the time they are directed.  From where do they get these 
directions to suddenly raise the fees?  I am the member of 
parliament. People would think that I might be one of the first 
to know they were going to do this.  Then maybe I would be able 
to defend their actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of a sudden a trail will be closed in Banff.  Nobody knows 
why, what is going on or what needs to be corrected to make it 
better.  There are many things that happen out of the blue.  The 
people who suffer the most are the ones who pioneered those 
parks, the seniors and other people in the territory who love to 
go for a weekend, have dinner and enjoy.  Now they cannot afford 
it because the fees are too high.  None of that is ever 
considered by the government.  It just reacts.  It does not seem 
to care whether it has a good reason or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Is the House ready 
for the question?

for Fundy—Royal, seconded by the hon. member for Shefford, 
asking that the second reading of this bill now before the House 
be hoisted for six month, which would be an excellent idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the eve of a possible general election in Canada, I did not 
have a speech on species at risk on my agenda. I believe that 
this government is going too far. I cannot but denounce this bill 
and, at the same time, the government that introduced it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is amazing to see that the Liberal government which, I must 
point out, obtained the support of only 38% of the population of 
Quebec and Canada in the 1997 general election, is behaving as if 
political thinking were the same in Quebec and in Canada. Yet, in 
the House, for the first time in the history of parliament, we 
find ourselves with four opposition parties. There is in the 
democratic choices made by the people of Quebec and of Canada a 
message that the Liberal government does not want to understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is more, this government's arrogance is leading it to hide 
things and act as if everything were fine. It keeps on 
introducing bills that do not reflect in the least the political 
realities in Quebec and Canada, which we represent collectively 
in the House, with five parties and not one only. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has this government, which is on the verge of going to the 
voters for a third mandate, done since 1993? In spite of what it 
keeps repeating, it has kept none of its basic commitments from 
the 1993 and 1997 campaigns. The GST is still with us. We are 
turning increasingly to free trade. The employment insurance 
reform has been worse than the one announced by the Tories. Every 
social program has felt the impact of this government's budget 
cuts, health programs in particular, and this is jeopardizing the 
universality of these programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the surplus derived from funds diverted to other purposes 
than those for which they were intended, the government now wants 
to hire spies who will go and lay down the law in the provinces 
on health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cultural budgets have also been reduced and the new president of 
the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, CBC, is almost at the 
point of becoming the first CEO of a public federal organization 
to be out on the street if he continues to cut like he has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on with the list of promises that were not kept but 
I would not want to immediately start an election campaign and 
put the Liberal government on trial. The government will not get 
off lightly because the moment of truth will come and will have 
major consequences for those who are showing arrogance today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In politics, promises must be kept. In politics, the affairs of 
the state must also be administered as though they were our own 
affairs and public funds must not be squandered. In politics, the 
affairs of the state must be administered with great attempts to 
reach consensus, and not with a confrontational approach, with 
quarrels and squabbles, as the federal Liberal Party has 
constantly done since taking office, particularly its leader, 
who is the specialist of the no, as though he did not have the 
chance to come out of his first identity crisis, which, in the 
normal development of a human being, happens traditionally around 
the age of two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are not fooled. They have had enough of this politicking 
that has been enriching the same people since Confederation. 
Whether they are liberal or conservative, this does not change 
anything in the scandals that have marked Canadian politics for 
so many years, at the expense of the little people who must be 
content with continuing to pay taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are starting to get the message. 
The government does as it pleases, grabs employment insurance 
funds, gets in bed with the oil companies, enriches the wealthy 
minority and distributes poverty to most of the people of 
Quebec and Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, let us move on to the debate on the order paper for 
today, Bill C-33, an act respecting the protection of wildlife 
species at risk in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Biodiversity, about which we are hearing more and more, 
represents the result of the evolution which the earth has 
undergone over billions of years.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That evolutionary process has provided the planet with a broad 
selection of living organisms and natural environments.  These 
make up the ecosystems we know today, and all of them have a 
role to play within the food chain, as well as playing a part in 
the biological equilibrium of this planet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years, however, the scientists have been reminding us 
that we are seeing more and more species become extinct, as well 
as increasing numbers of others being threatened with extinction 
or becoming highly vulnerable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decrease or degradation of 
this biological diversity affects us all and can eventually have 
unexpected consequences on the environment in which we live.  In 
Canada, as in a number of other countries in the world, attempts 
have been made in recent years to slow down this phenomenon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To that end, ever since the 1970s, we have seen some 
international conventions being signed for the specific purpose 
of limiting trading in certain plant and animal species in order 
to keep them from extinction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992, there was the Rio Earth Summit and an important part of 
the international community, including Canada, signed the 
Convention on Biodiversity.  Signatory countries pledged to 
develop and implement the legislation and regulations needed to 
protect endangered species and populations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Canada made that commitment, the government was lead by 
Brian Mulroney's Progressive Conservative Party.  That was enough 
for the Liberals to promise, in their red book, a long term 
protection for the species of our planet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following that commitment, in 1995, the then environment 
minister, the member for Hamilton, tabled a first bill which gave 
rise to an incredible number of protestations and critics, 
especially on the part of environmental groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996, the federal government proposed to provincial and 
territorial environment ministers a Canada-wide agreement 
entitled, “Accord for the Protection of Species at Risk”.  In 
October of the same year, the ministers responsible for wildlife 
approved the principle of that accord. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time, the Quebec government was represented at the table 
by David Cliche, the environment minister.  He signed the accord 
in good faith.  However, he immediately issued an independent 
press release where he stated very clearly that he could not 
remain indifferent to the fact that this accord was probably 
opening the door to overlapping and that it would be necessary to 
observe closely what ensued. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just a few weeks later the federal government, through its 
environment minister, Sergio Marchi, introduced Bill C-65, an act 
respecting the protection of wildlife species in Canada from 
extirpation or extinction, a bill which too was harshly 
criticized by the provinces mainly because of the broad powers it 
gave the federal government with respect to the protection of 
endangered species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many denounced the minister for his about face as his 
legislation was flying in the face of comments he had made a few 
weeks earlier saying he wanted to harmonize federal policies with 
the provinces instead of imposing standards and overlapping with 
provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Early elections called by the Prime Minister and member for 
Saint-Maurice caused bill C-65 to die on the order paper. Now the 
government is telling us that Bill C-33 is a new improved version 
of Bill C-65. If the Prime Minister keeps us here in the House 
long enough and does not again call an early election, we must 
send this bill back and not pass it under its present form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must find a way to respect each other's jurisdiction while 
finding a real solution to the problem of migratory species, that 
unfortunately know no border. It is obvious that if we are 
serious about finding a real solution to the problem of 
endangered species, a concerted effort is needed both nationally 
and internationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since this is an area of shared jurisdiction, greater 
consultation and closer co-operation among various levels of 
government are needed as it is imperative to improve the 
protection of endangered species both in Canada and Quebec. 
Again, this will not happen though confrontation but rather 
through a consensual approach.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does Bill C-33 really provide an additional protection that 
is enforceable? Will it really do something to improve the 
protection of our ecosystems and of the threatened species that 
are part of them? What good is it? What is in it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is sufficient cause for worry that the bill is suspicious. 
While lines 25 to 30 of the preamble state that responsibility 
for the conservation of wildlife in Canada is shared among the 
various orders of government in this country and that it is 
important for them to work co-operatively to pursue the 
establishment of complementary legislation and programs to 
protect species, the bill's wording does not reflect this. It 
does not reflect reality, which is that protection of habitats is 
essentially a provincial responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everything in fact suggests that the minister holds the power to 
impose his vision of protection on the provinces. In other words, 
his legislation will take de facto precedence over existing 
provincial legislation, even if the habitats fall solely under 
provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By doing so, the federal government is assuming the right to 
impose its own way of protecting species. It is not at all clear 
that force and fines would always be a province's preferred 
approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only does the bill give broad discretionary powers to the 
Minister of the Environment, but it does not respect the division 
of powers as stated in the constitution and as interpreted over 
the years. This bill truly interferes in an area under provincial 
and territorial jurisdiction and excludes the provinces and the 
territories from any real and direct input into the process. 
Existing legislation is totally ignored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that the protection of species can only be effective 
if habitats are also protected, but it is the responsibility of 
the provinces and the territories to manage these issues in 
co-operation with the various stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though the minister supports, theoretically, the shared 
responsibility between the federal government and the provinces 
with regard to the protection of species, in reality, first, he 
disregards the division of powers and the provinces' 
responsibility with regard to the management of habitats and the 
protection of species; second, he ignores existing legislation; 
and, third, he assumes very broad powers with regard to the 
protection of species. By acting this way, the federal government 
is going against true environmental harmonization between the 
various levels of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, what about the position of environmental groups? How did 
they receive this government bill? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who should be the minister's allies in any attempt to 
improve the protection of wildlife species find this bill 
totally useless and even dangerous, and they oppose it. Indeed, 
there has been much protest and criticism since the minister 
introduced his bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most stakeholders find the bill too weak. Even organizations 
representing the industry feel that the bill will not provide 
greater protection for species or specify the appropriate 
approach to protecting species living on a site under 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, it must be noted that, in its present form, Bill C-33 is a 
bit scary for the representatives of certain industries. As for 
the representative of the Mining Association of Canada, he said 
that the fines and legal proceedings were excessive in cases 
where a species was not deliberately killed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the main problem that seems to be raised by all 
environmental groups is the fact that the decisions on the 
designation of species will be taken by the minister and his 
cabinet, and not by scientists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has led some activists, such as the president of the 
Canadian Campaign for Endangered Species, to state that Bill 
C-33 was a dismal failure and that it will not ensure the 
protection of Canadian species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Others, like one of the lawyers of the Sierra Club, made more 
qualified statements, but still denounced the weakness of the 
legislation and described as disgraceful the fact that such a 
discretionary power with respect to the designation of species 
be granted to politicians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sponsor of the bill is being criticized for resorting to a 
piecemeal approach dictated by cabinet, instead of a set of 
gentle measures promoting negotiation, but supported by 
compelling legal measures if an agreement cannot be reached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For his part, Paul Bégin said that the proposed legislation was 
just another example of useless duplication for Quebec. Indeed, 
the Quebec minister indicated that the bill introduced by the 
federal government sought not only to create a safety net for 
endangered species and their habitat on federal lands, but also 
on the whole Quebec territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While it may be appropriate for the federal government to 
legislate to protect migrating species, this government has no 
constitutional authority regarding the management of habitats on 
provincial and territorial lands. The Quebec government cannot 
accept that the federal government would infringe upon areas of 
provincial jurisdiction and dictate to Quebec how to protect its 
ecosystems when Quebec already has its own legislation 
protecting endangered species and their habitats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the Quebec government believes an act such as Bill C-33 
would be acceptable if it excluded any species or habitat under 
provincial jurisdiction and applied to a province or territory 
only if this province or territory had explicitly asked that it 
did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering the increasing rate of species extinction, the 
situation is serious and it is true that we must take effective 
measures. But Bill C-33 is not the answer to the questions I 
asked at the beginning of my speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principle of providing greater protection to endangered 
species is in itself one the Bloc Quebecois readily supports. 
However, the Bloc does not believe that Bill C-33 will improve 
the protection of species at risk. In fact, the Bloc opposes the 
bill because it constitutes a direct intrusion into many areas of 
Quebec's jurisdiction. It even overlaps the act Quebec passed in 
1989, which is having good results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill could very well increase the paper burden and it will 
not allow for an efficient use of already scarce resources. The 
Quebec government has already legislated in areas covered by Bill 
C-33 and while recognizing that it is urgent to improve the 
legislation, the Bloc does not believe that Bill C-33 will give 
the expected results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc also recognizes that responsibility for the environment 
is shared between the federal government and the provinces. It is 
becoming very clear now that the federal government is ignoring 
this fact and is working against true harmonization of 
environmental issues by the various levels of government. Instead 
of assuming its major responsibilities in an appropriate way, the 
federal government is insisting on trampling on other 
governments' jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said at the outset that I fully support the motion of my 
colleagues from the Progressive Conservative Party. Whether or 
not a general election is called, I sincerely hope that this bill 
will be postponed indefinitely.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I

</I></B></P><P align=left>She has dotted the <I>i</I>s for the government, which persists in 
utterly invading areas under provincial jurisdiction. All the 
negative elements that the member for Rimouski—Métis has noted 
against this government suggest that this government believes it 
knows everything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like my colleague to give us other examples that prove, 
beyond a shadow of a doubt, as she says, that this bill should be 
postponed indefinitely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I

bill, is that there is overwhelming agreement against it. This is 
quite something.

complete failure. Nobody wanted anything to do with it. But they

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to advise you that I will be splitting my time with the hon. 
member for Louis-Hébert. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to take part in this debate. I would like to 
congratulate my hon. colleague from Jonquière, who is the Bloc 
Quebecois environment critic. She has done a lot of work and put 
a lot of heart into her defence of the interests of her fellow 
citizens, of everybody in Quebec, and by the same token, in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to indicate that I support the amendment by 
the Progressive Conservative Party. It is clear to us that this 
bill should be reconsidered, or at least hoisted for six months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The title of Bill C-33 is an act respecting the protection of 
wildlife species at risk in Canada. Biological diversity in 
itself is the result of evolution, which has been going on on our 
planet for more than 4.5 billion years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last few years, scientists have indicated that more and 
more species are becoming extinct and that more and more of them 
are becoming endangered or highly vulnerable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992, during the Rio summit, a large part of the 
international community, including Canada, signed the Convention 
on Biological Diversity. Canada agreed to draft or maintain the 
legislative and regulatory provisions required to protect 
endangered species and populations. Needless to say, on this side 
of the House, we know what the current government's signature is 
worth. It always claims to be acting in good faith, but in fact, 
that is not always what happens once it has signed a document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995, the Liberal environment minister of the day introduced 
a first bill, which was heavily criticized, especially by 
environmental groups. We all know what happened to that bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996, the federal government, through its environment 
minister of the day, Sergio Marchi, who has since retired, as 
mentioned by my colleague from Rimouski—Mitis, introduced Bill 
C-65, which was essentially the precursor of Bill C-33. Once 
again, the bill was heavily criticized. The Liberals called an 
election and, fortunately for them, Bill C-65 died on the order 
paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They still do not seem to have learned their lesson. They have 
brought this issue forward again by introducing a bill, which 
they say contains improvements. It is worth noting that the 
federal government can play a role in protecting wildlife species 
under certain statutes such as those dealing with fisheries or 
with our national parks. However, no federal legislation exists 
for this specific purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If passed, Bill C-33 would be the first Canadian legal 
instrument dealing specifically with the protection of wildlife 
species at risk.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since pollution and migratory species ignore boundaries, a 
concerted effort is obviously required at the international 
level. Logically, the same goes on a smaller scale within Canada. 
Canadian federalism calls for co-operation between the provinces 
on this issue, since this is an area of shared jurisdiction in 
our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Improved protection of wildlife species at risk in Canada is 
necessary. The number of known species living in Canada is 
estimated at 70,000, and apparently many of those exist only in 
Canada. To date, the committee on the status of endangered 
wildlife in Canada has designated 340 wildlife species as being 
at risk. 
Of these, 12 are now extinct, 15 are extirpated species or no 
longer exist in the wild in Canada, 87 are endangered, 75 are 
threatened and 151 are vulnerable, which means that there are 
concerns about these species. Of the 97 species whose status was 
reassessed in the last few years, 26 are now closer to becoming 
extinct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Needless to say that without proper federal or provincial 
legislation, without enforcement measures and adequate 
resources, the COSEWIC initiatives are insignificant, and their 
impact is limited. With the increase in the number of species 
facing extinction, the situation is critical. An efficient 
response is therefore needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But does Bill C-33 really provide an additional protection that 
is enforceable? Will this bill really ensure better protection 
of our ecosystems and of the threatened species that are part of 
them? We do not think so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to convey to the members of the House the position of 
environmental groups and industry. Most environmental groups are 
opposed to the bill put forward by the Minister for the 
Environment. Those who should be his allies in any attempt to 
improve the protection of wild species find the bill useless and 
dangerous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, the minister has been facing a lot of 
protest and criticism since he introduced his bill. Most 
stakeholders find the bill too weak. Even organizations 
representing the industry feel that the bill will not provide 
greater protection for species or specify the course of action 
they should adopt concerning the protection of the species 
living where they run their operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not only the Bloc Quebecois and the bad separatists who 
are saying this; environmental groups and industry 
representatives are saying the same thing. 
If anyone knows what they are doing, working year after year to 
protect those species, if there are any scientists who are 
experts in their field, it is the people in these 
environmentalist groups. And they have voiced strong opposition 
to and severe criticism of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe, among other things, that this bill intrudes on 
provincial jurisdiction, in particular the jurisdiction of 
Quebec, which already has its own legislation. Quebec is one of 
the few Canadian provinces that has legislated to protect 
wildlife and species at risk. Why not co-operate then? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is stubborn, set in its own ways, and this is 
especially true of the Prime Minister, who should have a maple 
leaf stuck to his forehead to satisfy his desire for visibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I am running out of time, I simply wish to read a few lines 
from a news release issued by the Quebec minister of environment 
on April 11, 2000. It says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec has always acted in a responsible and adequate way to 
protect its most fragile wild animals and plants, and it intends 
to continue to exercise its jurisdiction in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will never accept an umbrella legislation for all action in 
this area. It is out of the question for Quebec to accept 
federal intrusion on its jurisdiction. This bill must exclude 
all species, sites or habitats under Quebec's jurisdiction and 
must only be implemented at the request of the provinces or 
territories.

presentation. I think that our colleague from Beauce also agrees 
with the warning that the hon. member for Drummond gave— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Drouin:</B> Not at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> My colleague says he does not agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want not only to congratulate our colleague but also pay 
tribute to our environment critic, for she has worked very 
diligently and seriously in committee. She worked very hard to 
defend Quebec's interests. In fact, that is the difference 
between government members and Bloc members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can rise and on each issue and dedicate ourselves exclusively 
to the interests of Quebec, because we do not have to work out 
compromises for Prince Edward Island, Alberta and Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask my hon. colleague, who is obviously a seasoned 
parliamentarian since she has been here since 1993, like me for 
that matter, if she could tell us why a bill like this one is 
harmful to Quebec and give us many examples of the federal 
government's absolutely despicable reflex of interfering in 
areas of provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before yielding to my hon. colleague, I could refer to health. 
In this area, the government wants visibility. It has no 
principles. It has no respect for provincial prerogatives 
because it wants to do what it calls nation building. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is in this House a former minister of the environment in 
the Bourassa government. Under a rather austere exterior, he is a 
rather nice man. I believe he broke away from his party during 
the language crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to make a wish before giving the floor back to my 
colleague. Could we count on the support of all the Quebecers in 
this House, regardless of their political convictions? It is not 
a matter of nationalists versus federalists. I am convinced that 
when it comes to the environment, our debate can rise above 
partisanship and we can decide on general directions for the 
future, which will be in the best interest of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I am asking my colleague, based on her seven years as 
a parliamentarian, if she could show how this government has 
steadfastly refused to stay within its own jurisdiction and has 
shamelessly infringed on Quebec's jurisdiction? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve for his very relevant remarks. I also want 
to congratulate him. He highlighted the good job the Bloc members 
have been doing in the House since 1993. He is one of those who 
has been doing an excellent job defending the interests of the 
people of Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague asked me to give a few examples of infringement and 
overlap. We have seen quite a few since 1993. This government is 
always trying, with every new bill, to encroach on and stick its 
foot in areas of provincial jurisdiction. It has been its 
leitmotiv across Canada. This is what it was seeking with the 
social union. When they signed the social union agreement, the 
provinces sold out their birthright. They are now realizing it 
with the health care issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health care is one example. If there is an area of exclusive 
provincial jurisdiction, it is health care. We can see what the 
government is doing these days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Education, with the millennium fund, is another example. We have 
been a prime target in Quebec. It took a number of interventions 
and a great deal of efforts on the part of the Bloc Quebecois to 
denounce this state of affairs. And what about parental leave. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have this environment bill on endangered species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> I am sorry to interrupt, 
but the hon. member's time is up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform the 
House that the questions to be raised tonight at the time of 
adjournment are as follows: the hon. member for New Brunswick 
Southwest, Health; the hon. member for Québec, Parental Leave. 
<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, it is 
both interesting and important for me to be able to speak this 
afternoon on second reading of Bill C-33, an act respecting the 
protection of wildlife species at risk in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to begin by saying that I oppose this bill in its present 
form and that, moreover, I support the amendment by the 
Conservative member for Fundy—Royal for a six month hoist, if 
not a permanent one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, this will be very repetitious because we often keep 
coming back to the same points when we are addressing the same 
bill.  One learns early on in politics, however, that the best 
way to get a point of view across properly is to say the same 
thing often, even the simplest of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to start with an overview of the situation.  At the 
present time, there are 70,000 known species in Canada and a good 
number of them apparently are found solely in Canada.  So, we 
have 70,000 species and of that number 340 that are endangered. 
Obviously there are degrees to this.  Some are already gone, some 
are vanishing, some are more endangered than others.  Some can be 
saved with human intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I imagine that the purpose of Bill C-33 was to allow human 
intervention, although this bill does not include the necessary 
resources to satisfy that need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would there be some additional protection that might be 
applicable?  Is this bill really going to contribute to improving 
the protection of our ecosystems and the endangered species that 
constitute them?  Let us have a look at the salient points of the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The preamble is interesting, because it appropriately refers to 
the importance of protecting Canada's natural heritage and also 
reminds us of Canada's international commitments, for instance, 
under the convention on biodiversity, at the Rio summit, in 
1992. The government had already examined the issue and was 
prepared to take some action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This preamble also says that responsibility for the conservation 
of wildlife is shared among the various levels of government and 
that co-operation between them is essential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In clauses 1 to 6, the purposes of the bill are further 
specified, as well as the definitions—definitions are always 
quite important in a bill—that determine what land is involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous bill, Bill C-65, dealt only with federal land. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1655"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT83"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT83"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1655
<A HREF="#LINKT84"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the land was limited to what was part of the 
federal land, while the present bill goes further and deals with 
Canada's land in general, whether federal or provincial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to remind the House of some other clauses in 
the bill. For example, in clauses 8 to 13, it says the heritage 
minister, the fisheries and oceans minister and any competent 
minister must be consulted before the establishment of 
committees or the signing of agreements with other levels of 
government. There is already a lot of people around the table, 
but the bill does affect several sectors of government 
operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At clauses 14 to 31, the bill provides for the committee on the 
status of endangered wildlife in Canada, COSEWIC, which will 
have an official status and, from all appearances, will operate 
independently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other clauses, for example clauses 37 to 73, the bill talks 
of action plans, of recovery of endangered and threatened 
species and management plans for species of special concern. 
These interventions will be carried out in co-operation with the 
provinces, territories and the management boards, supervised, I 
imagine by COSEWIC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am passing quickly over all the enforcement aspects of the 
bill, over the infractions and penalties to reach clauses 126, 
127 and 128, which provide that the minister will prepare a 
report, which he will table in the House, on the administration 
of the act over the previous year. 
Every five years, an assessment will be tabled as well to enable 
us to see whether the action plans formulated have had effect or 
done nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at this, we can see that the bill provides food for 
thought.  Some aspects of it are interesting.  Some aspects 
should be examined, but some of them should go further. 
However, what we find embarrassing is that this legislation will 
immediately take precedence over existing provincial 
legislation, even when the habitats are completely under 
provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must remember that endangered species are found solely on 
provincial territory.  The government has ignored this and caps 
everything off with federal legislation that will take 
precedence over everything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other things made me smile. 
Clause 2 provides that the minister “may”—not must—“enter into an 
agreement”. Clause 39 provides that the competent minister must, 
“to the extent possible”, develop programs. A little further, in 
clauses 47 and 48, we find again the expression “to the extent 
possible”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know which jurist put the words “to the extent 
possible” in the bill, but that expression leads me to believe 
that there will be black holes, or grey areas, in that 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill does not respect the division of powers, as established 
under the constitution and interpreted over the years. It 
squarely interferes with the jurisdictions of the provinces and 
it excludes the latter from any real and direct input in the 
process. Existing laws are thus ignored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the protection of endangered species, of species at 
risk. We support it so much that we have already done something 
about it in Quebec. 
What bothers us is the fact that this government is proposing a 
bill that does not go as far as what we already have. To go 
backwards has never done any good to anyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, even though the minister supports in theory the notion 
of shared responsibility between the federal government and the 
provinces concerning the protection of species, he ignores the 
division of powers and the provinces' responsibilities regarding 
habitat management and the protection of species. He ignores 
existing laws and gives himself very broad powers with regard to 
the protection of species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In so doing, the federal government goes against true 
environmental harmonization between the various levels of 
government. This bill is too weak and it interferes with our 
jurisdictions. 
It must be reviewed. I do not know when, but the later the 
better, because an incredible amount of work needs to be done.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Many associations, such as the Canadian Pulp and Paper 
Association and the mining associations, which cover large 
areas, huge forests, as well as wetlands, know the pressure that 
such a bill can bring if guidelines are not clearly established. 
In the bill before us, they are not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that after the act come regulations, but we also 
understand the concerns of these large companies, because they 
occupy huge areas in all provinces of Canada, including Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have mentioned some of the weaknesses of this bill. 
I wanted to avoid mentioning all the environmentalists who have 
doubts in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, we have often acted reasonably.  In the case of 
migratory birds—and this is a good example, because migratory 
birds come under federal jurisdiction—Quebec, in co-operation with 
private organizations and the federal government has, for 
decades now, done an exemplary job of managing these wetlands 
and migratory birds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are therefore able to co-operate, but we really want to call 
the shots in an area we are already handling fairly well. 
Nothing is perfect, I admit, but, as I say, we are handling it 
“fairly well”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I wish to thank the member for Jonquière and 
congratulate her on the great job she has done for the 
environment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I was the 
Bloc Quebecois environment critic for several years in the last 
parliament. My colleague has now taken over. I was among those 
who fought Bill C-65 and I will briefly tell you why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time, Bill C-65 was introduced with haste because the Rio 
summit was to be held a few months later. Canada wanted to look 
good at that summit, and the government was rushing to introduce 
environmental bills so it would look good on the international 
scene, which is not a bad idea as such, but which can be very 
harmful to the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government cannot introduce a bill just like that. The first 
thing to consider when dealing with environmental issues is that 
the environment department should not be used for partisan 
purposes. 
The environment should be excluded from any form of 
partisanship, yet partisanship could be felt at the environment 
committee. This is not how it should be, however. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue is used for partisan purposes when it really should 
not. The environment should be a matter of concern to all 
parties and to all Canadians, and everybody should be willing to 
do their share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec has proved it. We have legislation to protect species at 
risk. We are willing to work with the federal government, but it 
should not stick its nose in our business and tell us what to do 
with our species at risk. We are already looking after things. 
We want to do it in harmony, but that is not what we are seeing 
in this bill. This is the same bill which has been brought back 
one more time. The problems are the same, and this bill will 
never solve the issue of species at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I advise my colleagues to examine this bill very carefully. This 
is just the second reading stage. Major amendments must be made 
to this bill to meet the needs that exist both at the federal 
and provincial levels, and even at the international level. We 
cannot simply say that this kind of bill will solve the whole 
problem with regard to the environment. It is not true.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie:</B> Madam Speaker, I agree wholeheartedly with my 
colleague's comments, since she has referred to the legislation 
Quebec has enacted, that is the act respecting threatened or 
vulnerable species, the fisheries act and the act respecting the 
conservation and development of wildlife. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also agree with my colleague that not all environmental issues 
are transborder issues. They are issues that are constrained by 
the limits we impose through other laws and policies. We need a 
great deal of harmonization and co-operation to get things done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be wise enough to examine what is being done, and what 
is being done well. Quebec is not the only place where things 
are done well. Other provinces too have worked very hard to 
protect wetland habitats. 
What is being done right should be our starting point, and then 
we should develop our bill, instead of taking the top down 
approach. 
<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to point out to my colleague from Laurentides that 
the Rio summit took place in 1992 and Bill C-65 came along at 
least five years later, but that is just an aside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree that there must be no politics where the environment is 
concerned.  In fact, the hon. member for Jonquière will 
acknowledge that, when the Environment Act was revised recently, 
members of all parties voted together, I do not know how many 
times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I wanted to point out was that we on this side of the House 
find that in this bill the federal government is not making 
use of its own jurisdiction.  That is what I criticized 
yesterday.  In fact, quite the opposite.  Instead of infringing 
on provincial jurisdictions, we are not doing enough in our own 
area for migratory birds, for habitats and for transborder 
species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to ask the hon. member for Louis-Hébert, for 
whom I have a great deal of respect and esteem, whether she was 
aware that I am the one who introduced the Quebec legislation on 
endangered species, so I am very very familiar with it. Under 
the Quebec legislation, when a species was listed as endangered, 
the habitat was automatically protected.  What was done recently 
was that, at the request of Hydro-Québec, in a case on which I 
can provide my hon. colleague the details later, cabinet 
recently passed an order in council separating the list of 
habitats, making— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> I am truly sorry to have to 
interrupt the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Louis, but the hon. member 
for Louis-Hébert has the floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for his 
comment. We always learn something new with this hon. member. 
I am grateful to him for introducing this legislation, which I 
hope will be applied in the best possible way in Quebec. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Gruending (Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to speak to the amendment to 
Bill C-33.  The amendment was put forth by our colleague the 
member for Fundy—Royal.  I want to state at the outset that I 
support the member's amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I previously spoke on the main bill so I do not intend to go 
into the detail I did at that time.  I will summarize what I had 
to say a number of weeks ago about Bill C-33, an act respecting 
the protection of wildlife species at risk in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I indicated that although the Minister of the Environment says 
the bill will do the job, it is weak in the protection of species 
at risk and their habitats.  I may have previously mentioned that 
the bill makes it discretionary to protect species at risk even 
on government lands.  Government lands account for a small 
percentage of the total land mass in Canada.  The bill is weak in 
that sense.  It also does not protect migratory birds and birds 
do not know borders so we have to do better than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill invites political consideration and lobbying as I and 
other members have said.  The minister has chosen to allow a 
group of scientists under COSEWIC to continue to list species at 
risk, but at the end of the day, the determination of what will 
be considered as species at risk will be made by the federal 
cabinet. 
There has been widespread criticism of that because it does 
invite lobbying.

<A HREF="#LINKT85"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A company which maybe is endangering a whale through mining or 
some other activity could now go to the cabinet and try to 
prevent that species from being listed.  I just use that as an 
example, but it is clear in that sense that the bill allows far 
too much ministerial discretion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also fails to include compensation provisions for 
workers and communities affected economically by action plans to 
rescue species at risk.  I am thinking of people working in the 
forest.  If it is decided that a patch of forest has to be saved, 
then of course we would support a patch of forest being saved, 
but what about the people who work in that patch of forest? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to very briefly indicate the NDP policy on this. I did 
not do that the last time I spoke on the bill.  Our policy is 
clear on what such a law should do.  This one really does not 
come close. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The policy was carefully thought out and debated at our last New 
Democratic Party federal convention.  We passed a resolution at 
our 19th biennial convention which said that the New Democratic 
Party supports comprehensive federal endangered species 
legislation developed in co-operation with other governments 
which includes the benefits of traditional aboriginal knowledge 
as well and ensures, first, identification and listing of species 
at risk by an independent committee of scientists, wherein 
scientific evidence is the primary consideration and not 
political interpretation of this evidence.  As I have said, the 
bill gives the minister far too much discretion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the NDP convention called for comprehensive nationwide 
natural habitat protection, including protection for species that 
range or migrate over Canada's domestic and international 
borders.  I have already referred to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the NDP convention called for legislation which would 
include stakeholders in the development of species recovery 
plans, provision of adequate support to those whose livelihood is 
disrupted by a species recovery plan, and provision for just 
transition to workers and communities by any recovery plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a very thorough, well thought out resolution about 
species at risk legislation.  I know the government does not 
always come to the NDP for advice, but had it done so, we would 
have a better piece of legislation before us than what we have 
now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I first spoke to the legislation, it was very shortly after 
the bill was introduced.  I was going by my own party's response, 
again based on our resolution in convention and the homework we 
had done.  It has now been some time since the legislation was 
introduced and perhaps it is worthwhile to spend a minute or two 
looking at what people are saying about it.  Let us call this a 
focus group for the minister for lack of a better term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Hamilton <I>Spectator</I> of Tuesday, May 2 stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its current form, the proposed Canadian Species at Risk Act 
will serve as little more than a token document, of little 
benefit to those species truly at risk in our country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On the day following the tabling of the legislation in the 
House, Stewart Elgie of the Sierra Legal Defence Fund had this to 
say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very disappointed.  This bill will do little to ensure 
that endangered species and their habitat are protected—it 
leaves everything up to political discretion.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Kevin Scott, director of the Vancouver based Defenders of 
Wildlife, said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation, as we have reviewed it, is in my opinion an 
international embarrassment.

described.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman:</B>  Madam Speaker, Bill C-297, an act to 
amend the Young Offenders Act, has been around this place for a 
number of years now.  It was first introduced as Bill C-260 in 
October 1997.  In fact it was my first effort as a private 
member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In May last year the government attempted to kill this private 
member's bill through a hoist motion.  Fortunately the government 
subsequently reconsidered to withdraw its motion. The bill was 
allowed to proceed to a vote where all members of the House could 
exercise their voting rights.  On May 25, 1999 it passed second 
reading by a vote of 164 to 75.  My friends in the Bloc, most of 
the NDP and some Liberals voted against the bill but the vast 
majority of the House voted in favour of it. As is the process, 
the bill was sent to the Standing Committee on Justice and Human 
Rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the prorogation of parliament it was reintroduced as Bill 
C-297 in November last year. According to the rules of the House 
it was then placed in the same position as previously and 
referred back to the justice committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 27 the bill was deemed to have been reported back to 
the House without amendment.  We are now at the third and final 
stage of this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, while I appreciate that you know the particulars 
of Bill C-297, I will briefly state them for the folks who may be 
watching the debate through the benefit of television tonight. 
There are some very serious misconceptions in the public, in the 
media and among some of my colleagues in this place about just 
what this bill proposes. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1845"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT94"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill itself is relatively simple.  It merely changes a 
sanction section of the Young Offenders Act from a simple summary 
conviction offence to a dual procedure or hybrid offence.  What 
this means is that the crown attorney has the option, and I 
repeat the word option, of proceeding by summary conviction or by 
indictable offence.  Indictable offences, of course, are reserved 
for the most serious of circumstances.  The maximum sentence in 
this case is two years.  In other words, offenders will receive 
provincial and not federal time at the top end; that is, the 
maximum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the offence that is covered by this sanction, we may 
ask. It has to do with section 7.2 of the Young Offenders Act 
that covers the offence of wilfully failing to comply with a 
court undertaking to supervise a young person.  As we all know, 
some young people come into conflict with our laws.  Occasionally 
some of these young persons are considered to be a danger to the 
safety and security of the rest of our society and are held in 
custody until their case may be resolved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 7.1 of the Young Offenders Act permits a responsible 
adult to sign an agreement with the court to supervise the young 
person.  The young person is then permitted to leave custody 
under the supervision of that adult.  The young person and the 
adult sign a form of contract with the court, agreeing that 
certain conditions will be followed for the protection and 
security of other citizens.  These conditions might include 
refraining from alcohol use, geographic restrictions, not 
associating with specified individuals, curfews and any other 
condition the court deems appropriate.  If the adult wilfully 
fails, and I stress the word wilfully, to properly supervise, as 
promised to the court, section 7.2 holds that adult accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I stated previously, the only real criticism of this bill 
comes from a misunderstanding or an unwillingness of some 
individuals to accept that this legislation has nothing 
whatsoever to do with parental responsibility to their children. 
We are not holding parents responsible for delinquent children 
through this bill.  The parent of the child who throws a rock 
through a window or gets into a schoolyard fight is not affected 
by this bill.  We are holding responsible only those adults who 
deliberately and voluntarily enter into a form of contract with 
the court to carry out certain defined duties of supervision. 
These adults are to be held accountable for their wilful failure 
to obey that contract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those adults who make reasonable attempts to supervise or 
control their charges will not be subject to prosecution and 
conviction.  Those adults who find they cannot control the young 
person can always advise the authorities and withdraw from their 
agreement to supervise.  As I have said many times before, all 
the person who makes an undertaking has to do is to make a phone 
call to the authorities and advise of the difficulty in 
controlling that particular youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this bill is attempting to do is to impress upon those who 
sign an undertaking and impress upon the young person the 
seriousness of the situation and to hold accountable those who 
wilfully fail to carry out their end of the bargain with the 
courts.  We are only attempting to protect our citizens from 
additional crime and victimization by the young person who has 
been released into our community prior to the resolution of the 
initial charge or charges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been stated many times by myself and others, including 
the Minister of Justice, this legislation has been incorporated 
within Bill C-3, which is essentially a re-writing of the Young 
Offenders Act.  Some may well ask why I am pursuing Bill C-297 
when the minister and cabinet through Bill C-3 have accepted the 
same initiative.  The answer, of course, is quite simple:  We can 
never be assured that Bill C-3 will become law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Simply put, as of now, the Young Offenders Act is the law of the 
land.  Bill C-297 amends the Young Offenders Act.  Each and every 
day we do not have this change to our law results in another day 
in which the failing of the Young Offenders Act in respect of the 
criminal breach of an undertaking order is permitted to continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister recognized the problems of these undertakings when 
she incorporated my Bill C-297 almost word for word in her youth 
criminal justice legislation known as Bill C-3.  All we are doing 
with Bill C-297 is bringing into law a portion of Bill C-3 to 
address the Young Offenders Act, the current law of Canada. Given 
the history of Bill C-3, we do not know when it will become law. 
Indeed, we do not even know if it will become law. If and when it 
does, we do not know if it will remain in its present format. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, yesterday, when I asked the minister if we would have 
new legislation before an election call, she declined to give a 
direct answer. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1850"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT95"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we do know that Bill C-297 is acceptable to the 
Minister of Justice because she used it when she prepared Bill 
C-3.  We do know that the majority of this place voted at second 
reading to pass the legislation and send it to the justice 
committee.  We do know that the bill was returned to this place 
without amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is good law.  It is one of the primary reasons I sought 
election to parliament.  I think many members know that I have a 
very personal reason for proposing the legislation.  If it 
succeeds in addressing justice in even one instance during the 
anticipated limited existence of the Young Offenders Act, then we 
as parliamentarians will have fulfilled some of our 
responsibilities as legislators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate that some may question the placing of this 
legislation on our agenda when the government plans to address 
the issue with its own legislation.  However, that legislation is 
severely stalled.  It may be shelved or radically changed.  It 
may never see the light of day.  We simply do not know what will 
happen to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-297 is on the parliamentary calendar.  It is a private 
member's initiative.  I understand it has the support of a 
significant portion of members.  It is my understanding that 
most, if not all, of my colleagues in the Canadian Alliance will 
be supporting the bill.  It is my hope that many, if not all, 
members of the government will support the legislation as it does 
exactly as proposed by the Minister of Justice in Bill C-3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has incorporated my initiative into her 
legislation, and I thank her for her support.  Members of the New 
Democratic Party and the Progressive Conservative Party have 
spoken in support of the bill.  I urge everyone to carefully 
consider its aim, its content and its consequences for victims of 
crime and for the support and respect of our justice system.  I 
urge all members to support the bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK266"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is indeed a pleasure to 
contribute to the debate and add my support to Bill C-297 
introduced by my colleague, the member for Surrey North. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation now before us is testament to the determination 
and dedication of the member for Surrey North in his campaign to 
bring some semblance of rationale to the Young Offenders Act and 
to put some emphasis and focus on an area that cries out for 
attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As most members of the House now know, the member for Surrey 
North and his family have been visited upon by youth crime.  In 
1992 the member's son, Jesse, was killed by a young offender. 
This young offender was in the community on what is called, under 
the Young Offenders Act, a section 7.1 undertaking.  We are here 
today to address this section by way of the member's initiative 
to ensure such a tragedy, like the kind that befell the member 
for Surrey North and his family, can from this point on be 
averted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for Surrey North has said, the bill is simple and 
minor.  However, the consequences of the bill are profound, 
addressing an issue that begs for attention and justice.  In 
short, Bill C-297 calls for parents and guardians of young 
offenders to account when they fail to discharge their 
responsibility to supervise.  One would not think that we would 
have to tell parents and guardians of their responsibilities in 
such instances, but alas, some parents and guardians are less 
responsible than the young offender in their charge.  It is sad 
but true.  The son of the member for Surrey North was a victim of 
this irresponsible and reprehensible parenting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-297 changes section 7.2 of the Young Offenders Act from a 
simple summary conviction offence to a dual procedure or hybrid 
offence.  If passed, Bill C-297 would make offenders of section 
7.1 of the Young Offenders Act subject to either imprisonment of 
up to two years or the normal summary conviction penalties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment, by way of this private member's bill, should not 
cause the government much concern.  In fact this initiative forms 
part of the new Youth Criminal Justice Act, Bill C-3.  Sometimes 
it takes a Canadian Alliance initiative to make things right, 
even if the government cannot admit it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to outline the genesis of Bill C-297 and what it 
attempts to accomplish.  Section 7.1 of the Young Offenders Act 
permits a youth court judge to allow an accused person, who would 
otherwise be held in custody, to be placed in the care of a 
responsible person who must undertake in writing to be 
responsible for the attendance of the young person in court as 
required, and to ensure compliance with such other conditions as 
the youth court judge may specify.  At the same time, the accused 
youth must also undertake in writing to comply with the 
aforementioned arrangements and to comply with any other 
arrangements as specified by the youth court judge.  It seems 
fairly straightforward and easy to understand.  It simply allows 
a parent or guardian to supervise the young person until charges 
are decided by the court.  It is a form of custody outside of 
formal detention and can be considered bail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One would think that any responsible parent or guardian would 
enter this contract with the courts in good conscience and abide 
by the terms and conditions.  One would think that no matter what 
the penalty would be for breaking the contract, the parent would 
be mature enough to comply. 
Sadly, as was the case involving my colleague for Surrey North, 
some parents wilfully fail to provide proper and sufficient 
supervision.  It is this negligence on the part of the parent or 
guardian that Bill C-297 seeks to address.  It is a shame that 
some parents are less responsible than the young person who is 
supposed to be in their custody.  This bill would make it clear 
for those irresponsible types that the penalties for breaking the 
contract are very severe.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>During his opening remarks in earlier debate on Bill C-297, the 
member for Surrey North painted a tragic and bleak picture, which 
I will paraphrase.  For example, suppose one of the terms and 
conditions of the handing over of the young person to the parent 
or guardian is a parent agreeing to a curfew to ensure that the 
young person, while awaiting court, is not tempted to fall back 
into a situation where friends can influence the person and cause 
that person further criminal charges.  What if the parent has 
always been the problem, never raising the young person properly 
to begin with, running loosey-goosey rules of curfew and never 
paying much attention to the young person's lifestyle?  Is it not 
time for that parent to be held accountable for this 
irresponsibility? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that most Canadians have come to realize that 
parents have to take more responsibility in raising their 
children and that they should not start after they offend. It 
should be a deeper responsibility.  Raising children is a 
commitment.  It means more than having them around as a 
accessories.  Bill C-297 reinforces that premise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bill C-297, if a young person merely breaks a condition of 
release, then the parent may face a summary conviction procedure 
for this failure to comply with the undertaking to supervise.  If 
the breach of the release condition leads to the commission of a 
serious offence by the young person, that same parent may be 
subject to an indictable proceeding.  Like all hybrid offences, 
the crown has the option.  In the final analysis, the judge 
naturally has the final say on the appropriate punishment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must impose on parents the gravity of improper, irresponsible 
parenting, particularly when they have entered into a contract 
with the courts.  We have a responsibility to society to protect 
the innocent, the innocent like Jesse Cadman.  If a parent 
thwarts this responsibility by not complying and wilfully breaks 
this trust they accepted, then penalties should be imposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some will say that Bill C-297 blames the parents for crimes 
committed by their children.  This is not the intent of Bill 
C-297, as the member for Surrey North pointed out.  Young persons 
are responsible for their actions.  Bill C-297 simply says that 
parents or guardians are guilty of an offence for failing to 
comply with an undertaking they entered into with the courts.  It 
is a serious commitment and not to be taken lightly.  If they 
cannot comply or have no intention of honouring the commitment, 
they should never have entered into the contract in the first 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-297 requires our support now.  We cannot wait for Bill 
C-3 which contains the essence of this private member's bill.  I 
ask my colleagues on the government side and opposition members, 
who have already agreed, to acknowledge the urgency of this 
legislation and add their support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I congratulate the member for Surrey North for his 
tenacity, in the three years we have been here since the last 
election, in getting his private member's bill to this stage and 
for the great work that he has done.  Most constituents never see 
it when their people are working in committee.  There is no more 
dedicated member than the member for Surrey North when working in 
committees of the House of Commons.  I and I know all members of 
the House congratulate him for that.  He has worked very hard 
since he has been here.  I hope and trust that we will see this 
bill passed and become law so that what happened to his family 
will never happen to another family in Canada again.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I must say at the outset that I understand what can 
motivate the member to present such a bill. However, I will 
surprise no one by saying that we, in the Bloc Quebecois, cannot 
support a bill aimed at changing certain rules provided for in 
the Young Offenders Act, which is working well at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying that the Young Offenders Act is the answer to 
all the questions and all the problems and that it cannot be 
touched. That is not what I am saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, with regard to the subject matter of the bill proposed 
by the member from the Canadian Alliance, it works. We must not 
change the whole procedure and change legislative provisions 
based on a single unfortunate incident.

<A HREF="#LINKT97"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, out of a large number of cases, there will always be 
one, two or three cases where people did not meet their 
commitments, which is unfortunate. It happens with young 
offenders as well as with adults, and each time people do not 
meet their commitments or honour their signatures, there must be 
a penalty. Certain penalties are currently provided for in the 
Young Offenders Act, and we must not touch that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before getting into the details of the bill, I would like to 
comment on some of the things the Canadian Alliance member said 
in order to set the record straight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member said he could not trust the government on this, 
simply because Bill C-3, the government bill that treats young 
people as criminals and increasingly turns the youth justice 
system into an adult system is somehow a rewrite of the Young 
Offenders Act. Nothing is further from the truth. It is totally 
false. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must confess I am extremely proud to say that I am the one to 
blame for Bill C-3 not being passed before the end of this 
session in June. I am the one, and I am proud of it. I am 
preventing its going through committee stage with my endless 
speeches, and this is why the government decided to move on to 
something else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why am I doing this? Simply because, in Quebec, we enforce the 
Young Offenders Act the way it should be enforced, and it is 
bearing fruit. When I am saying that, I am not just talking 
through my hat. We have the statistics to prove it, the same 
Canadian government statistics the minister is using to do her 
sell job, except that she makes a selective use of statistics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These statistics show that Quebec has the lowest youth crime 
rate and the lowest recidivism rate in all of Canada. Why? 
Because we invest where it counts, namely in the reintegration 
and social rehabilitation of young offenders. We did not start 
yesterday and we are not about to stop either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member really wanted to improve certain things, he could 
ask his provincial government to look at the Quebec model and see 
to it that his province does the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I said that we have been at it for a long time and that we 
have not stopped, it is because recently the Quebec government 
decided to deal with delinquency at its onset, because it is well 
known that delinquency starts at a very early age, especially in 
low income families. The poorer you are, the more likely you are 
one day to have a brush with the law. Quebec is poised to invest 
up to $20,000 per child in the zero to five age group. In total, 
Quebec is willing to invest $100,000 per young person to prevent 
delinquency and assist the very parents the member wants to help 
with his bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here again we have the statistics to prove that there is less 
violence in Quebec. There is still some violence, but less so 
than in other provinces. And as long as there is violence, we 
will have to intervene, I am quite aware of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, we have civil provisions as well providing that 
parents have the right and duty of guardianship, supervision and 
education of their child.  I believe there is similar legislation 
in other provinces also. On the civil level, then, the parent has 
a certain degree of responsibility if the child causes damage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the criminal level, there have been some very sweeping 
studies done in Quebec, one of them the Jasmin report, to which I 
have referred a number of times.  Justice Jasmin, the 
co-ordinating judge of the youth court, carried out an exhaustive 
study of this matter and reached the conclusion that—to connect 
this directly with the hon. member's bill—what the member wants 
to do must not be done, that is criminalize parental 
non-compliance with an undertaking they have signed in relation 
to a commitment to release or support their child who is 
experiencing problems.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All parents cannot be lumped together.  The situations must be 
analyzed case by case and discretion must be left for the head 
of the tribunal, the judge who examines the situation and will 
bring down the decision required to attain the objective of 
returning the young person to society as soon as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that Bill C-297 has a negative effect on three major 
points in terms of youth rehabilitation.  That is why we are 
opposed to it.  A potential two year jail sentence for the 
parents is not going to help their child fit back into society, 
when he has the example of parents who have not honoured an 
undertaking and have ended up behind bars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the government must support and accompany such parents 
so they realize the importance of the undertaking they have 
signed, but not to make them criminals by doing so because of 
something their child did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second thing concerns the parents dealing with the 
situation.  As I said earlier, it is often parents who have 
nothing, who are living in poverty, are needy and do not 
understand the whys and wherefores of the undertaking they have 
signed.  I am not saying that all those who sign it do not 
understand it, but I can say that, with the way the courts 
proceed and given the volume of cases presented, parents sign 
undertakings and often leave the court without understanding the 
implications of the undertaking they have signed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third point concerns a situation that could arise through a 
young person's abuse of his parents. 
We know that at certain stages of their development, adolescents 
go through periods of rebellion.  Who is to say that, with a 
bill such as the one the hon. member would like passed, the 
young person would not use it to blackmail his parents, saying 
“Listen Dad, Mum, you signed that.  If I make a mistake or if I 
go back to court, you will pay for it.  What is more, you could 
end up in prison”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present, the law contains a certain balance, especially as 
concerns parental undertakings.  The undertaking must be 
honoured and nothing must be done that would alter the balance 
of parent-child pressure.  These things work well, as I said 
earlier and should remain in force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I wish to say that before trying to amend 
individual sections of the Young Offenders Act because of 
situations in our riding or our province, we must look at the 
overall picture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the member to put to his provincial 
legislature, to the police in his province, and to all those 
with direct or indirect responsibility for enforcing the Young 
Offenders Act: How are they applying the legislation and what is 
their policy with respect to young offenders?  Very often, he 
will see that the answer is next to nothing.  That is where he 
needs to direct his efforts, to harp on this as often as 
possible so that the provinces apply the legislation properly 
and invest properly in retraining and rehabilitation, as the 
Young Offenders Act now in force requires them to do.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to begin by commending the hon. member for Surrey North

this issue, as it holds great personal importance for him.  I 
commend him for this, for all the work he does on the justice

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-260 was the forerunner to the present bill, Bill C-297, 
which would amend the Young Offenders Act in its current form and 
place significantly more responsibility on persons who agree to 
ensure that young persons will abide by specific court 
conditions.  They would be sureties that the judge would look to 
to give the public the confidence that in fact conditions that 
are placed on a young person will be adhered to.  Most often it 
would involve parents, but there would certainly be guardian 
situations and times when agencies would be involved in the 
assumption of these responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the time that has passed since October 1997 the government 
has had ample time to revamp the Young Offenders Act and could 
very easily have incorporated much of the same spirit that is 
behind Bill C-297. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that time the youth criminal justice bill has been brought 
forward in parliament and has been before the justice committee. 
Sadly, it is hopelessly bogged down in that committee and will 
not see the light of day in the remaining time we have in this 
parliament.  The majority of witnesses who appeared during the 
deliberations on Bill C-3 consistently denounced the bill in its 
present form.  They were very much in opposition to the bill 
itself and the manner in which it was drafted.  For these reasons 
and many others, it brings us to the current day where a new bill 
is sitting on the order paper in the committee and, because of a 
number of factors, the country will be deprived of very common 
sense and very positive amendments that could have been made, 
much like the premise of the private member's bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Public pressure is very much on the Liberal government to change 
this legislation because there is an active feeling in the 
country that the youth criminal justice system is not working. It 
has in fact failed Canadians and exacerbated the situation to 
such a degree that there are many young people in the country who 
feel that the current legislation protects them rather than 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be the first to acknowledge that there are parts of the 
country where the current legislation works better than others. 
One of those provinces is Quebec.  The initiatives taken within 
the justice system in the province of Quebec are quite 
innovative.  It leads the country in many regards in the 
application of programs and the positive initiatives that can and 
do in fact take place under the current legislation.  That 
province has interpreted this legislation in such a way that it 
works better there than it does in many other provinces.  We have 
to be quick to acknowledge that.  It signals that the problem is 
something that can be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly, one of the most overriding flaws in our current young 
offenders system is the lack of funding, the lack of resources 
which the current government has allotted to address the issue. 
We know that the original intent of the Young Offenders Act was 
that the funding would be shared 50:50.  The federal government 
has never approached that level of funding commitment. It has 
never held up its end of the bargain.  In spite of this, Quebec 
has been able to be very innovative and use programs to move into 
areas of restorative justice, early intervention, police 
counselling and community policing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what was behind the spirit of the new youth criminal 
justice bill, minus the funding.  In fact, what we saw was a bill 
that became very convoluted and very cumbersome in terms of the 
references, new interpretations and new processes that we would 
be putting into place.  There were things like a parole system 
for young individuals that would undermine any concept of truth 
in sentencing that currently exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would see a new type of system that would determine whether 
an offence was a violent offence or a serious violent offence; 
very esoteric and subjective notions which would be a make-work 
program for many lawyers.  I know that there are many criminal 
defence lawyers in the country and we heard from many of them at 
the committee.  They were wringing their hands in anticipation of 
the work that was going to be created by this new youth criminal 
justice act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a great and dire need for the government to introduce 
legislation that will be effective, and effective in a way that 
will address the current problems, but will also streamline the 
way the system is working and address the issues of funding, not 
only for those in the policing community, but also for those in 
social services upon whom much of the responsibility of the 
current system falls.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been many high profile cases in recent years.  The 
previous speakers would be very aware of them.  Many of the cases 
have tragic implications.  I am speaking of cases involving 
victims such as Clayton McGloan, Matti Baranovski and Jonathan 
Wamback. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the pleasure of meeting Jonathan Wamback's parents quite 
recently in Newmarket, Ontario, and again recently in February. 
We heard from Mr. Wamback at the justice committee.  He raised 
many of the same concerns we are discussing which form the 
premise of this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their teenage son Jonathan was brutally attacked by a group of 
teenage thugs and is still recovering from life threatening 
injuries.  As a result of this incident, his father Joseph 
Wamback is actively involved in a petition drive that has 
currently received over 800,000 signatures.  The petition calls 
for mandatory adult court trials of youths charged with serious 
violent offences with sentencing changes which involve strict 
incarceration, mandatory treatment programs and compulsory 
follow-ups, to mention a few of the initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the action of concerned citizens like Mr. Wamback as well 
as the actions of members of the House that are needed to bring 
about legislative change.  Bill C-297 is a very good beginning in 
dealing with but one of the many complex mosaic of issues that 
arise in our youth criminal justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly Bill C-3 will very likely die in committee.  It is too 
complicated.  It establishes too many hurdles.  Most of all it 
accomplishes persistent, experienced, repeat offenders preying 
upon a system that does not address their needs and does not 
address the needs of the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Teenage victims like Matti Baranovski and Clayton McGloan lost 
their lives in violent attacks by young offenders.  Their cases 
and that of Jonathan Wamback are glaring examples of what is 
currently wrong with our system and our ability to address 
serious violent offences.  If Bill C-3 were to pass it would only 
aggravate and further undermine the confidence of Canadians in an 
overloaded and overburdened system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a crown attorney I have had firsthand experience in dealing 
with young individuals, the victims and their families, and the 
fallout.  When I was elected as a member of parliament I came to 
this place on a platform that included changing in whatever way I 
could the way in which the system and the Young Offenders Act 
were operating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party has advocated changes.  One 
of the changes is to give judges more power to impose mandatory 
treatment on troubled youths, those in need of therapy, those in 
need of an attitudinal adjustment that came about through no 
fault of their own.  Many young people who find themselves 
involved in the criminal justice system have been victims 
themselves and have come from extremely troubled homes.  They 
have been involved in alcohol and substance abuse and have never 
had an example or a guiding hand.  With early intervention and 
the attention and counselling that sometimes come with it, those 
individuals would have a chance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Conservative Party would also be advocating an ability 
to make it easier to transfer serious violent crime cases 
involving young offenders to adult court.  Much of that has been 
accomplished.  We would also enact parental responsibility into 
our system in the way in which young offenders would be held 
financially responsible, as would their parents if there was in 
fact culpability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would lower the age of accountability to include violent 
criminals of all ages.  Currently violent offenders below the age 
of 12 face no criminal punishment under our system.  I saw on 
many occasions the failings of our system up close and personal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the efforts of the member for bringing the bill 
forward.  It is a bill that we support.  It is a bill that we 
very much embrace in the need and the drive to change our system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With Bill C-3 the focus is correct.  The focus is on 
rehabilitative front end justice, modelled after what they are 
doing in the province of Quebec.  I support that.  However, to 
have front end preventive measures enacted it is necessary that 
the resources and the focus be there to help those programs reach 
fruition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The type of initiative before us in the form of a private 
member's bill is very much a step in the right direction.  We 
need to broaden the approach and create more accountability, and 
this is what the bill seeks to do.  By putting greater emphasis 
on protecting the public Bill C-297—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
want to say at the onset, as mentioned by my colleague, the 
member for Berthier—Montcalm, our party's justice critic, that 
even though the Bloc Quebecois is not in favour of the bill, we 
have the greatest of respect for what motivated its mover. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We understand that very private event in his life, which I am 
told was the reason he entered public life, led him to look at 
the role of parental responsibility within the context of 
delinquency, I would even say of the criminalization of young 
persons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However we have to be very consistent with the approach and the 
values we have always adhered to in this regard and that are 
somehow part of the Quebec model. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a Quebec model in philanthropy, economic development 
and cultural affirmation. There is also one in the way we see 
equal opportunity. This vision of equal opportunity makes us 
realize that we are not all born equal, and I will get back to 
this later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Berthier—Montcalm established a somewhat 
mathematical link between the potential for crime in young 
persons and the environment they live in. As the member for 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, I am keenly aware when I rise in this 
House with the ardour, enthusiasm and determination that are my 
trademark, that, unfortunately, without prevention some of my 
constituents may in the future join the ranks of these youths 
who may, at one time or another, turn to abuse and delinquency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec model leads us to believe that there must be a 
difference. I wholeheartedly subscribe to what the member for 
Berthier—Montcalm said. There must be a difference between the 
way we administer justice for young offenders and for adults. 
This difference must be centered on the potential for 
rehabilitation we believe in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of parliament, I have often seen young people of 14 
or 15, and sometimes as young as 13, who belonged to gangs. They 
were subject to what was not always a positive influence, even 
though there were very often parents in the picture, parents who 
did their best to be good role models for their children. This 
can happen at a time when young people are vulnerable also. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we vulnerable at 13, 14 or 15? We were all that age 
once. For some of us, that was longer ago, but we were all 13, 
14 or 15 at one time. That is a time when we rebel. There are 
some for whom that rebellion goes on for quite some time, but we 
were all members of gangs at one time. At that particular time 
in our lives, we try to distance ourselves from parental 
authority. We ask ourselves questions. It is a time of life when 
physical transformations occur and we do not always understand 
them. It is a time when we wonder whether we have a place in 
society. 
It is a time when we ask ourselves questions about the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we do not find satisfactory answers, we may try various ways 
to attract people's attention and look for ways to challenge 
the social order. Some young people may choose delinquency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, we have always believed in rehabilitation. 
Incidentally, I must say that the Bloc Quebecois is extremely 
disappointed to see that the government decided to make the 
Young Offenders Act, which will become the youth criminal 
justice act, much harsher.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not understand. Still, we are well aware that the Minister 
of Justice, who is from Alberta, is moved by electoral motives. 
She must be more to the right than the Liberal Party's natural 
position. Why is such a thing happening in the year 2000? It is 
because there are clear indications—and political intuition never 
fails—that we are on the eve of an election. And on the eve of an 
election campaign, the whole issue of the reform of the Young 
Offenders Act is of particular importance in western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that in Alberta and Saskatchewan and, to a lesser 
degree in British Columbia, there is the issue of 
radicalization.  It involves discovering whether the Liberal 
Party or the Canadian Alliance Party will go farther in 
radicalizing justice and the treatment of young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate myself and the member for Berthier—Montcalm for 
not having lost sight of the values of justice and 
rehabilitation of young Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will recall 1988, which was an important year in 
parliamentary annals.  The year 1988-89 is important because, as 
the member for Québec and critic on poverty reminded us 
frequently, this parliament decided to eliminate poverty. 
A resolution was passed by all parties in the House.  It was a 
time when politics lived without the Bloc Quebecois, with the 
litany of injustices against Quebec that that meant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to remind members that in 1988-89 all political parties 
represented in the House passed a resolution to ask this 
government to reduce poverty substantially over 10 years. 
There was even talk of eliminating child poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To add to this fight against poverty, the Progressive 
Conservative Party, whose political weight we are aware of at 
the moment—and I do not want to bring back bad memories for 
anyone—which was in government at the time passed the CAPC 
program, the community action program for children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why am I mentioning this program?  Some may say that the member 
for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve is wandering off topic, which is not 
like him.  One of the objectives of this program was to develop 
parenting skills.  In my riding, there were several projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not always learn how to become parents.  There are no 
courses on becoming parents.  It sometimes happens in life that 
one is faced with a pregnancy and one sets out on this adventure 
that most of us find exciting, but one does not always have the 
parenting skills to cope with the various human development 
challenges that arise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The community action program for children was designed to 
provide parents with tools for developing a meaningful 
relationship with their children and keeping them from turning 
to delinquency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Bill C-297 were passed, it would mean that we could find 
ourselves in a situation where this vital parent-child 
relationship could be destroyed.  When I say this, I do not in 
any way wish to downplay the importance of parental 
responsibility.  In the Quebec system, the civil law system, 
there is full provision for parental responsibility.  There are 
even mechanisms for the loss of parental authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by saying that we understand the hon. member's 
entirely legitimate motivations.  We hope that he will decide, 
as the Bloc Quebecois has done, to invest in prevention and to 
believe that one cannot have the same justice system for both 
young people and adults. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with these considerations in mind that the Bloc Quebecois, 
with its usual sense of responsibility, has unfortunately 
concluded that it will be unable to support the bill before us.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it seems that some people construe this bill as an 
attempt to oppress people, throw kids in jail and throw away the 
key.  It is actually about accountability and accepting 
responsibility and consequences for one's actions and 
undertakings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am grateful for the opportunity to rise today to speak to the 
private member's bill of my hon. colleague from Surrey North, 
Bill C-297.  Last November I was ready to speak to Bill C-3, the 
new youth criminal justice act, which incorporated the entire 
substance of Bill C-297.  Unfortunately, the hon. member's words 
and remarks of last year have come true.  He said of the 
government's legislation “Quite simply, I do not anticipate that 
the new youth justice legislation will be implemented for some 
time yet.  I have heard possibly by year's end at the earliest, 
but even that may be wishful thinking”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also thought that this amendment was sufficiently important 
to be incorporated within the present Young Offenders Act.  As 
there is much to complain about the current legislation, it seems 
that we are left to reform by amendment rather than come up with 
new legislation that will do the job.  We will wait to see if 
Bill C-3 can get out of committee before the next election.  In 
the meantime, I certainly wish this bill success because the 
government's legislation seems to be bogged down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Surrey North is right.  This legislation is 
of sufficient importance.  From all accounts, it has sufficient 
support from most members of the House to succeed, despite the 
actions of the Bloc Quebecois in committee, which is 
filibustering the whole youth criminal justice bill. 
Consequently, this bill had to be brought back to the House in 
its present form, rather than incorporated in the new legislation 
that was meant to cover the entire range of youth justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was going to say that it will be interesting to see if Bloc 
members will support this private member's bill, but according to 
the speeches we have just heard, obviously they are not 
interested in accountability and responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-297 seeks to amend section 7.2 of the Young Offenders Act 
by allowing a youth court judge or a justice to allow an accused 
young offender to be placed in the care of a responsible person. 
This person would undertake in writing to be responsible for the 
attendance of a young person in court when required and comply 
with other conditions that a youth court judge or justice may 
specify, such as curfews.  The young person would also comply in 
writing with the arrangements and other conditions specified by 
the youth judge or justice.  It is a form of bail.  It is also a 
contract, with all the inherent elements of a contract, such as 
responsibility, terms, conditions and penalties for breaching the 
contract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-297 seeks to broaden the accountability of those who have 
in writing agreed to provide proper supervision for the young 
person involved.  This amendment would broaden the consequence of 
failure of compliance to the conditions of the contract from a 
simple summary conviction to a dual procedure or a hybrid 
offence.  Failure to comply under the new amendment would be 
punishable by up to two years of imprisonment.  It is a fairly 
serious punishment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently, failure to supervise constitutes a summary offence 
punishable by a fine of up to $2,000 or six months of 
imprisonment, or both, which for some offenders is a very small 
requirement. One could argue that serious incidents seldom happen 
with such breaches under the current system.  This may or may not 
be so. However, no matter if there were absolutely no incidents, 
such an amendment would still be necessary because the 
seriousness of the issue would still exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is definitely not a frivolous amendment, as the Bloc would 
construe it.  It is obvious, merely by the inclusion of this 
amendment in the legislation of the Minister of Justice, Bill 
C-3, that there is widespread support for this initiative.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note what this legislation is not.  It is not 
the sins of the sons or daughters being visited upon the parents. 
This is a common misconception of the bill.  No adult will 
vicariously suffer any penalty for the misdeeds of a youth.  The 
circle of accountability has been broadened with this amendment, 
as has the circle of responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both the adults and the courts will have agreed to take on this 
responsibility.  With the passage of this bill the courts would 
have a choice of summary conviction or to proceed by way of 
indictment.  That is a choice for the courts to make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If those responsible for the accused decide that the 
responsibility would be too much for them to handle, if 
circumstances change during that time, or even if the young 
person violates the agreement, the adult has the means to change 
the contract or has the option to inform the authorities.  In 
fact, I would say that the adult has the responsibility to inform 
the authorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taking on such a responsibility as that of parents and guardians 
for youth charged with crimes would be a tall order, requiring a 
serious commitment to the task.  For instance, if a youth had ADD 
or ADHD the parents would have to consider carefully their 
capacity to supervise and to comply with the agreement.  Such a 
disorder has a huge effect on behaviour.  Parents of youth with 
ADD or ADHD would say that it is difficult to manage at the best 
of times.  It would be almost impossible to ask parents or 
guardians to be responsible for such an unpredictable situation 
and person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment would also bring to bear the gravity of the 
agreement that would well address the relationship of the youth 
to the parents or guardians.  Rather than exacerbate the 
situation between the parents and the youth, this amendment would 
call upon the parents to acknowledge responsibility where perhaps 
none existed before.  Rather than avoiding the situation of lack 
of parental supervision, which may have contributed to the 
charges in the first place, a positive reaction would be the 
clarity in the issue of responsibility brought to the attention 
of the parents or guardians.  A clear choice would be made by the 
parents and a serious consequence would be the result of failure 
to comply with an agreement.  Again, I must reinforce that this 
is not a forced choice, but a serious one nonetheless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was glad to read of the support from members of both the 
government and the opposition for this bill.  We know that we are 
on the right track and that my hon. colleague is right to have 
this amendment in a private member's bill, given the state of 
Bill C-3 being bogged down in a Bloc engineered filibuster in the 
standing committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this amendment we do not see a “throw the book at them” 
approach, of which we on this side are sometimes accused.  We do 
see the bar of accountability and responsibility raised for both 
the courts and those who seek to enter such an agreement. The 
punishment for failure is greater because the stakes are higher 
and the cost of failure of compliance can be great. People 
experience and in fact my hon. colleague from Surrey North 
experienced the cost of failure to comply.  No one knows the 
price of the failure of the current system better than he does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reading the speeches of the various members of the parties in 
the House I see a common refrain:  Canadians want more 
accountability on the part of parents for the criminal actions of 
their children.  We also hear from some quarters that society is 
to blame and that accountability is somehow everyone's 
responsible.  We know that when we say everyone is responsible, 
that usually means no one is responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must get to the root of crime.  Peer pressure, poverty and a 
myriad of other conditions contribute to the decision to break 
the law, but we also know that there are many young offenders for 
whom social conditions were not a factor.  It is a complex issue, 
but let me say that it is also a decidedly simple one.  Our 
personal actions are ours alone.  We take on responsibility 
individually and our accountability is personal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill strikes a chord at all levels:  the courts, the adult 
population and youth.  The act, by enlisting the co-operation of 
parents or guardians in the courts, illustrates to the young 
offender that even adults must act with some sense of 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This seemingly tiny bill, the purpose of which is to make a 
common sense amendment to the Young Offenders Act, illustrates 
clearly that while people may forgive, circumstances can be very 
unforgiving. 
The circumstances which resulted in the death of the son of the 
hon. member for Surrey North were the result of a series of wrong 
decisions made by individuals.  He and his wife and daughter will 
never recover from the loss.  He and his family have turned their 
tragedy into a positive crusade to save others from similar pain. 
He is to be commended for his courage in acting upon his 
convictions.

I am asking him, in terms of transparency, how this came about. 
I hope the minister is prepared at least to answer that one 
question, if nothing else.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to answer not 
only this question but indeed all questions that members may want 
to pose about the content of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To answer the question the hon. member asked, it has been my 
practice as a minister in the rather unusual portfolio of Leader 
of the Government in the House of Commons to consult colleagues 
from all political parties through the leadership of of the 
parties as assigned by the party leaders for the purpose of the 
administration of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, there is rarely a day without my consulting the 
respective leaders of the parties in the House: the opposition 
House leader, the House leader for the Bloc, the House leader for 
the NDP and the House leader for the Conservatives.  That is the 
traditional way by which House leaders consult each other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a minister there is not a requirement to consult per se 
opposition parties before drafting legislation, but given the 
particular nature of this bill and given the particular role that 
I have as minister of state and Leader of the Government in the 
House of Commons, I have consulted very widely with other 
political parties through their House leaders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Might I take this occasion to congratulate the House leaders of 
other parties for their valuable contributions, each one of them 
speaking very eloquently on various issues that assisted in the 
drafting of the legislation.  They have always been very 
courteous in making themselves available and in contributing. For 
that I thank them immensely.  That is the way in which the 
consultations were held.  I am sure most members would agree that 
is the fair and appropriate way to have consultations in this 
regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Chairman, on that same point, this 
bill was presented to members of parliament exactly 24 hours ago. 
It is unprecedented that a bill as complicated as this one would 
be laid on the desks of all members of parliament 24 hours before 
we proceed to clause by clause consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian public watching tonight should understand that the 
minister because of the complexity of the bill has three 
officials with him at the table.  He has three officials with him 
to interpret a bill, which members of parliament cannot do in a 
24 hour period.  We do not have the resources in a 24 hour period 
to go through the details of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question I have for the minister would be simple.  Why would 
he attempt in the old fashioned sense to rush through a bill like 
this one in the dying days of this session without consulting 
members of parliament and without having the bill before members 
of parliament so that they could examine it as closely as he has 
been able to do with the aid of assistants?  I point to the three 
technical advisers that the minister has with him tonight.  They 
were not available to individual members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote from the editorial section of the <I>Hill 
Times</I>.  It deals with the point of individual members of 
parliament, and I am talking about the member of parliament from 
the Ontario region.  The article suggests that everything is 
conducted by the Prime Minister's Office, basically keeping 
members of parliament, in fact Liberal members of parliament, out 
of the circle. 
We have Liberal members of parliament not knowing what the 
government is doing.  They are being blindsided by their own 
ministers, particularly the PMO, and in this case I might suggest 
the minister responsible for this bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to quote from the article.  The member says that there 
are at least 50 potential Guy Fawkes in the Liberal caucus. 
Historians would know that Guy Fawkes led a group of rebels who 
wanted to blow up King James I and parliament in 1605 in what was 
known as the gunpowder plot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess the member is suggesting that there are a number of very 
disgruntled members of parliament on that side, the government 
side of the House.  Obviously the government was pressured by the 
official opposition.  The history of the bill will reveal that it 
has been brought in to appease what is now known as the Canadian 
Alliance, formerly known as the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Reform members landed in this place in 1993 because they 
railed against everything that we would consider the rightful 
duty of members of parliament.  In other words, they pretended to 
be everything but parliamentarians.  They exercised their lungs 
to a great extent on the benefits individual members of 
parliament would receive when they retired.  They railed against 
it because it was a very convenient thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have the CA members of parliament having second thoughts 
about what they did in the 1993 and 1997 elections.  The interim 
leader of the CA, the member who formerly represented Beaver 
River, talked about pigs at the trough in terms of pensions. They 
made the Canadian people believe that every member of parliament 
would retire as millionaires if they were in this place for as 
little as six years because of the pension plan, only to find out 
that it was not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The example I used last night was the member for Saint John, 
formerly the interim leader of the Conservative Party.  She has 
spent the good part of her adult life in public life.  In fact 
she has spent from 1993 to the present day in the House of 
Commons.  If she were to retire today she would get a pension of 
about $20,000 a year.  She would have to live to be 117 years old 
if it were to become a million dollar pension.  If we simply 
multiple $20,000 by 50, that would put it in the $1 million 
range. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That type of absurdity, which the Reform Party preached in 1993 
making all members of parliament look greedy and as if they were 
pigs at the trough, got them into this place.  Now they suddenly 
realize that it was not as good as they thought it was.  However, 
they did rail against it and it did get them into this place. Now 
there is a certain sense of reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is like a lynching in the morning.  They are now realizing 
that they are not quite as popular as they were back in 1993. 
There is a strong possibility that they will be defeated at the 
polls when the next election comes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us think about it.  They do not have a leader.  They are 
still trying to determine if the leader will be coming from 
Ontario in the name of Tom Long, or from Alberta in the name of 
Stockwell Day, or the individual who formerly led the Reform 
Party whose name I cannot mention in the House because of the 
rules.  He is the member who represents Calgary Southwest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are suddenly realizing that they are caught in a vacuum. 
Things are not going quite as well as they thought they were for 
them politically.  Some of those members are saying that they 
have been in this place since 1993 and if they suddenly leave 
they will not have pensions.

</I></B></P><P align=left>They are realizing they may not run in the next election because 
it does not look quite as easy as it was back in 1993, or indeed 
in 1997 when they won again out west.  They are saying they need 
a bit of a safety net, and understandably so.  We do not argue 
with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most intelligent people would say that when we dedicate 6, 8, 
10, 12 or 15 years of our lives to public life, at the sacrifice 
of our families in many cases, we are entitled to some kind of a 
package at the end of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, some of the wives of the CA members are now saying that 
their husbands went to Ottawa and railed against the pension and 
are asking where it leaves them as spouses or as widows if 
something should happen to their husbands.  That is the sad 
reality.  It is a sad reality that some of us will not be here 
forever and some of us will leave a spouse back home alone.  We 
are saying that they are entitled to pensions.  We have always 
said that as members of the Conservative Party, and rightfully so 
the Liberals have said the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I die my wife is entitled to some kind of compensation. 
This is a sad reality for CA members.  They are willing to 
swallow themselves whole on this issue because they realize that 
they made a huge mistake back in 1993.  Here is an example of the 
hypocritical nature of their position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of our members ran against a Reform member in the last 
election.  I will not identify the member, but I can if 
necessary.  The Reform candidate was railing about the pension 
the particular MP would get if he were re-elected:  he was going 
to get a million dollar pension if he were re-elected to the 
House of Commons, which was absolutely not the truth.  At that 
time that member was to get a $16,000 pension, not even equalling 
the $20,000 this member will get after eight years of service. 
The million dollar pension turned out to be a $16,000 at the age 
of 55. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform candidate was railing against a golden pension of a 
million dollars that turned into a meagre $16,000 pension. The 
candidate for the Reform Party was yakking in that fashion, 
condemning that little pension if the other candidate were 
re-elected.  If the Reform candidate had been eligible for a 
pension as a school bus driver, it would have surpassed by 100% 
the pension of the re-elected member of the House of Commons.  In 
other words, his pension would be $32,000 a year as a bus driver, 
but he wanted to deny a pension to a member of parliament who had 
come to this place week in and week out, leaving his family 
behind, because it was fashionable at the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to quote from a former member of this place who did not 
come back as a Reformer.  His name is Stephen Harper.  This is 
what he had to say about the process we are now going through. It 
was very accurate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am trying to lay out that the official opposition, the CA 
formerly known as the Reform Party, has scrambled in the last 
number of weeks to make this happen.  That is how it usually 
works.  It is sort of like the Friday night special.  It is 
getting late in the session, late in the week, and they will just 
kind of slide this thing through.  Guess what? They are not going 
to force it to a vote or to a debate.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It will be a conspiracy of silence to put this bill through the 
House of Commons without any public input, without any 
transparency.  There is no transparency.  As I mentioned, the 
bill was laid on every member's desk last night at six o'clock. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  You should have had your House leader 
talk to you about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  That is pure nonsense and he knows it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event, Stephen Harper, who refused to run for the Reform 
Party in the 1997 election said this about the case of the 
Reformers swallowing themselves whole or flip-flopping on this 
pension issue.  I am quoting from the <I>National Post</I>, the 
official Reform Party CA publication.  The owner of the paper is 
Conrad Black but at least he had the decency to print this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Stephen Harper said, “It is a case of you scratch my back, I 
will scratch yours and all the skin comes off the taxpayers”. 
Stephen Harper is president of the National Citizens' Coalition. 
He said, “It is a terrible betrayal of all the people who voted 
Reform”.  It is a betrayal of the people who voted Reform 
because many of those members, and I can point at them now, came 
in here in that bit of rage against pensions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of them came here because they defied everything that 
parliament stood for. For example the present leader of the CA, 
formerly the leader of the Reform Party, the member for Calgary 
Southwest, is the guy who took the keys.  They handed him the 
keys to a chauffeur driven car in 1993.  He made a point of 
having the press there when he eagerly passed the keys back and 
said, “This is a perk, I do not want this car”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 after having walked to the House of Commons on shoe 
leather as most of us do, he decided, “That car might have been 
a good idea.  Why don't I keep the car?  It is four years later 
and people will have forgotten what we did in 1993”.  It was a 
publicity stunt.  People will forget.  He is quoted as saying 
that people have 20 second memories.  I guess he figured that the 
20 second memory would kick in or kick out.  People would not 
remember, but they did.  It is on tape.  We watch it on the 
evening news from time to time.  They love to replay that one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a major flip-flop on that one.  That was a perk.  That 
is one thing most of us intelligently think when we look at a 
minister's or the Prime Minister's life and how busy they are 
going from here to there.  I think they are entitled to a driver 
to get around the city to go from meeting to meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there was the Stornoway issue.  For those people who do not 
know but I think most people do, Stornoway is the official 
residence of the official opposition leader. That is at public 
expense as is 24 Sussex Drive.  We are saying the Leader of the 
Opposition is entitled to a home because that person is 
sacrificing a lot to lead a party and it is a very responsible 
position.  It is the same for the Prime Minister. No one would 
deny the Prime Minister 24 Sussex Drive and what goes with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case the Leader of the Opposition mocked it.  He said, 
“Stornoway is nothing more than a fancy bingo hall.  I am not 
going to stay there.  Forget about it.  It is not in the cards”. 
Except when he got elected as Leader of the Official Opposition 
he changed his mind.  He suddenly forgot what he said.  It looked 
pretty attractive from his point of view after he became Leader 
of the Official Opposition. So guess what?  He moved into 
Stornoway.  How did he get there? He got there in that car 
provided to him by the taxpayers of Canada, the very car he said 
he would never drive in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He moved into the hall and, insult of all insults, he did not 
turn it into a bingo hall as he said he would.  That could have 
offset the expenses of running Stornoway if he wished.  If he 
took in 500 bucks a night on bingo he could turn it over to 
general revenue. Is the finance minister or the minister 
responsible for the treasury board here?  I do not see them.  I 
guess that was part of the scenario, “I will turn it into a 
bingo hall and hand over the 500 bucks or whatever we take in 
each night and that will help offset the expenses”.  But no, he 
did not do that. 
He is living there with his family which he is entitled to do. We 
do not deny that.  But the truth is he railed against it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the type of flip-flop which I think the Canadian people 
find unsavoury.  In fact supporters of the former Reform Party 
find it unsavoury.  That is exactly what Stephen Harper is 
referring to in the <I>National Post</I> article. I think the 
headline on the article tells it all.  It reads in big print in 
the <I>National Post</I> of June 13, 2000, “Grit pension ploy 
divides alliance” and it is subtitled, “Bill prompts party to 
drop hardline stance against system it had often attacked”. 
Those members attacked it often and ferociously for a number of 
years. I could read a number of other quotes of what they had to 
say about the pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I am attempting to make is simply how could any party 
rail against a pension plan the way those members did simply to 
get a seat in the House of Commons?  It was a convenient thing to 
rail against.  Then they came into this place and completely 
changed their position.  Hence, they were swallowing themselves 
whole.  What other party could get away with it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is pretty cute.  We are going through the bill clause by 
clause, not to lose focus on the bill itself.  There is a 
provision which gives them a year.  Maybe the officials at the 
desk can point this out when it is their turn to consult with the 
minister.  This is quite cute.  This is part of their scenario. 
They are hoping against hope that the election will be held 
within the year.  Then they could safely get away with what they 
are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tonight in the House I noticed how clever they are.  We have to 
give them points for being clever. About half of them stood up to 
vote for the bill and they were looking around to see if their 
neighbour would stand up to vote for it. Some of them, and I will 
give them credit for this, had the backbone to stand up tonight 
to vote for this pension change. Many of them did not.  They were 
looking over their shoulders to see what might happen.  Paranoia 
surrounds that party to begin with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was certainly no free vote which is another thing they 
railed and chatted about almost continuously between 1993 and 
1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyway, they now will have a year.  They have to decide within a 
year whether they are going to buy into the pension plan.  This 
is their second go around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  The third go around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>   Oh, it is the third go around.  The 
first time some of them opted in, they were relegated to the back 
benches for defying their leader because they chose to buy into 
the pension plan.  That was at about the same time when their 
leader was sitting in the second or third row. The leader of the 
Reform Party, when he first came to the House of Commons said, 
“Hey, listen.  This is new.  I do not want to be special. I am 
going to sit in the second or third row.  This is going to be 
great and wonderful.  It is a new sense of equality in the House 
of Commons”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was a very popular thing to say and do until after about 
three or four weeks he decided that he was getting lost in the 
crowd.  Yes, there are such things as television cameras.  Yes, 
there is something to be said for sitting in the front row.  I 
would just love to be sitting beside my deputy leader in the 
front row but that privilege is given to our House leader.  He is 
the honoured gentleman to sit beside this wonderful lady day 
after day and night after night in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Guess what the Leader of the Opposition did on this one.  He 
completely changed his mind.  “Hey, listen, that sounded good 
but it does not work so off I go to the front row”. He did not 
look too good in the front row.  He had to have his hair changed. 
This is true as I am standing here. 
He said, “I do not like the look of my hair”.  I think they did 
a focus group.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is like me, Mr. Chairman.  You can remember when I had a 
pretty good hairdo about 12 years ago. My wife does not brag 
about my hair anymore for obvious reasons. I do not have much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That did not stop the Reform Party leader.  Guess what he did? 
He had a makeover, which is fine.  There is nothing wrong with 
doing that.  A lot of people do it.  He got a new hairdo and a 
dye job to go with it. He did not like his voice because the 
focus group said it was too high and squeaky and he had better 
change it.  He attempted to change his voice in his makeover.  He 
got rid of the glasses as well and used contact lenses because 
apparently that gives a better impression on television. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I am making is that these are major flip-flops, some 
of them personal, to which we are entitled.  I guess dress is 
important in this business.  The way we comb our hair and the 
colour of it are all important.  Those are major flip-flops by 
the Leader of the Opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Let us get rid of those phoneys in 
Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  He is quoted as saying, “Let us get 
rid of those phoneys in Ottawa”.  Exactly.  He mentioned that 
time and again, those phoney politicians in Ottawa.  He railed 
against anyone who was a “professional politician”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We notice that he does not rail against these professional 
politicians anymore.  Why?  Because he is a professional 
politician.  He is the consummate politician.  He is the 
politician who came to Ottawa.  This was an intellectual 
flip-flop but I am not sure that he will pull this one off. 
Remember the slogan was that the west wants in, “We want a voice 
from western Canada that will go there and set the tone for the 
rest of the nation”.  That is what they wanted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The west wants in was his slogan.  It got him here in 1993, 
among other things which I have already mentioned.  He came to 
Ottawa but suddenly realized that his so-called right-wing 
agenda, if one wants to call it that because I hate mixing up 
left and right, would not make him Prime Minister of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Talk about this makeover; this was a complete flip-flop.  We can 
change our hairstyle, dye our hair, cap our teeth, put in contact 
lenses or whatever we have to do, even lose weight if we have to. 
The major flip-flop is he said, “I cannot get elected on this 
right-wing agenda so I am going to have to put a little water in 
my wine to temper down my policies.  We are going to do a number 
of things”.  This was the leader of the Reform Party speaking at 
the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, he said the party would change its name. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Mr. Chairman, I rise on a point of order. 
I have been listening very attentively for quite some time to the 
hon. member, my colleague from the Progressive Conservative 
Party.  I wonder what this has to do with the title of the bill 
because that is what I thought we were supposed to be debating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  I am getting to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Chairman:</B>  The member says he is coming to the title 
so we will look forward to those pertinent parts of his remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Chairman, I am getting to the 
title.  That is a good point and I will move in that direction. 
We are getting at the major flip-flop and it has to do with the 
title of the bill, and I will suggest a new title once I reach 
that point. I do not dare to say it out loud at this point but 
eventually we will get there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He decided that despite everything he has done he cannot become 
Prime Minister of Canada because he will have to water down his 
policies.  He will have to change direction a little and the 
first thing he will do is change the name of the party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It went from the Reform Party to CA.  We have had a lot of jokes 
in this place, some of them played out by the Prime Minister, and 
the Minister of Canadian Heritage has had some fun with that 
title as well. 
Talk about chameleons, Canadian Alliance members not only changed 
their image, they changed the name of their party in the hopes of 
broadening the base.  They have changed their policy to broaden 
the base.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to remember that they came into this place with the idea 
that the west wants in.  Now they are flirting around with the 
big blue machine in Ontario.  Bay Street will now run the party 
because they have a man by the name of Tom Long up there who has 
pockets deeper than all of us combined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Chairman, I rise on a point of 
order.  It does seem to me that we should be debating the title 
of the bill.  I wonder if the member is just running off at the 
mouth like this because his party is down to 9% in the polls.  Is 
that part of it?  I just wonder if he could work that into his 
comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Chairman:</B>  I appreciate the assistance of the House 
leader of the official opposition.  We are under a time limit, as 
hon. members know, with respect to the committee of the whole and 
there are some other members who have given notice to the Chair 
that they would like to ask some questions of the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Might I suggest we move on to questions?  The hon. member for 
New Brunswick Southwest of course will have the opportunity to 
make a 20 minute speech, at the very least, on third reading 
later this day.  Perhaps we can deal with the bill.  Is that 
agreeable to the committee? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Chairman, with your tolerance and 
understanding, I want to move to the question regarding the title 
of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Chairman:</B>  I think it might be wise, in fairness to 
other hon. members who do want to ask some questions, that we 
allow some time for that, given the time constraints on the 
committee.  I would urge the hon. member to exercise a little 
judicious restraint, particularly when he seems to be straying a 
bit far from the title in his remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I respectfully submit 
that the name of the bill should be changed to the reversal of 
fortunes bill for the reform party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Chairman, if nothing else, this has been 
somewhat entertaining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to answer a few of the initial questions that have been 
asked.  In the first part there were questions, but I think we 
eventually strayed somewhat from the questions.  I will leave 
other members to judge as to whether or not the word somewhat is 
appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One the first point, whether or not this bill was rushed, I do 
not think that is the case.  I submit to the House that there 
were wide consultations.  As a matter of fact, the consultations 
were so wide that things being what they are, some of them were 
even leaked to the media. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if one claims that he or she was not consulted, it was 
reasonably easy to find out from one's House leader whether or 
not consultations had taken place because it was front page news 
in several media, much to my chagrin.  I still have a few scars 
from that particular episode not that many weeks ago.  I do not 
believe that anyone can claim to be surprised that this bill is 
before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second thing is that there were some comments on whether or 
not this was a partisan effort on the part of the government 
against its own backbench, and stuff like this.  I have not made 
this a partisan issue at all.  Even if provoked, I have not 
touched this and I will not.  I will gladly engage tomorrow in a 
partisan argument on policy with my colleagues across the way.  I 
am looking forward to tomorrow's question period.  If hon. 
members across want to give it their best shot before we leave 
here on questions that are of interest on policy issues, I will 
gladly do that.  However, I have not and I will not take part in 
the debate on this bill in terms of a partisan accusation against 
anybody, nor will I say who wanted what portion of the bill to be 
enacted as opposed to another portion, which party, which group 
of MPs or which individual MP wanted a particular clause as 
opposed to another clause, as opposed to an amendment. 
I have not done that and I will not, even though there has been 
some provocation to do so.  I believe I have to be true to the 
admonition I gave to colleagues yesterday in the House at the 
second reading debate.  If I want to be consistent with that, and 
I believe that I am, then I will not reveal that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am of the view that the only reason this parliament has worked 
at all, and I happen to believe that it has worked quite well, 
has been that the House leaders of all parties have been able to 
speak to each other on a variety of issues at any time, without 
notice, and to consult each other for the benefit of making this 
great institution work.  They have been able to do that in full 
confidence knowing they would not have to stand in front of a 
microphone five minutes later and explain what they might have 
said in a remark to their colleagues of other parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not just saying that about the relations between myself as 
the government House leader and any one of the House leaders of 
other parties.  I believe it has been true of relations between 
opposition parties as well, and I compliment all House leaders 
for that.  Again on that score, I do not believe that it would be 
appropriate for me to say that this clause is beneficial for 
someone or that there was a deal made this way or that way, and 
so on.  I will not do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the initial remarks, I heard an hon. member say that I had 
experts available this evening.  I do not apologize for that.  I 
believe they are here to answer questions about an individual 
clause and how this bill will work.  These same officials and 
others will be available tomorrow and in the weeks to come for 
individual members of parliament because this is, after all, a 
bill that affects individual members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it is all said and done, I am told that the House of 
Commons officials will distribute a circular informing members on 
which officials can answer questions, whether it has to do with 
accrual or how one buys back time time, if that happens to be the 
case for a particular member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was informed earlier this day by the very competent people who 
are sitting with me here in the House of Commons that officials 
will be available to answer the following questions:  How will it 
affect the tax treatment?  How does it do so if a person has 
already full contributed to their registered retirement savings 
plan?  How does one transfer that?  What is the percentage of 
interest that one has to pay if one is buying back time?     All 
this will be made available for members of parliament.  Those are 
the kinds of questions I thought we would be engaging in 
regarding this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something has been said here that I do not think is accurate. 
There is this business of the election to buy back and the 
limitation of a year in that regard.  On this score, I will say 
that no one lobbied me on any side of the House for that 
provision to be there that way.  That provision is there that way 
because it is the one that already exists in the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, someone who was, hypothetically, elected in 
1984, defeated in 1988, and came back in 1997 had one year to buy 
back or to make up his or her mind to buy back the time.  If we 
are going to have a provision here whereby members can elect to 
buy back the time, why should we treat members of the House 
differently than we would treat someone who was defeated and came 
back?  My argument is that they are entitled to the same thing 
and that is why that is the case.  However, that is not a 
provision of this bill.  That is already the case for anyone who 
has ever served and came back later and bought back their 
service.  That was not invented for anyone sitting in the House 
now.  Finally, to repeat what I said, I was not asked by anyone 
to put that in as one of the conditions.  It is an automatic one 
that exists already.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Chairman, I have a question for the government House leader 
pertaining to the title of the bill, namely, the retiring 
allowances act.  I was wondering if the minister might be able to 
comment on a bill that was recently passed not so long ago with 
regard to retirement allowances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look around the Chamber I see the guards who represent us 
here in the House of Commons and who do their jobs dutifully.  I 
note that the government rated the pension plans of the public 
service employees not so long ago, yet it is ready to once again 
tinker with the pensions of the members of parliament.  I think 
that speaks to a real contradiction and conflict of interest when 
members of parliament can decide on their own pay, pension and 
perks, but other people in the country are not allowed that same 
type of privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, other people in the country do not decide 
on legislation that directly affects their net worth because they 
are not ministers and they are not members of parliament.  People 
like the guards in this place do not set their own levels of 
remuneration.  They do not have pension plans that are above and 
beyond what the private sector has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I would like to ask of the government House leader is this. 
Why does he feel that it is okay for members of parliament to be 
making these decisions on their remunerations?  In a sense it 
begs the question, who guards the guards?  I noticed that he had 
a particularly broad smile on his face, going from ear to ear, as 
the member for the Progressive Conservative Party was speaking. I 
have no doubt that the government House leader takes great glee 
in his Machiavellian manoeuvres with regard to the MP pension 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the title, would it not be better for everyone in 
the country to have a system whereby a certain percentage of 
their wages went to a mandatory retirement savings plan and a 
certain percentage went toward a mandatory unemployment savings 
plan, whether the person is the grass cutter in this place or the 
Prime Minister? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Chairman, I am glad the hon. member 
has asked a question about employees of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He perhaps knows, or perhaps does not because he is somewhat 
newer than other colleagues, that I am the only House of Commons 
employee ever to have been elected to this place.  I think that 
at least on this score I know something about it.  Without any 
pretension, I would like to say to the hon. member that I 
probably know a little more than he does about working conditions 
on Parliament Hill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also contributed to the House of Commons employees' plan. 
When I ceased to be a member of the House of Commons staff and 
was elected to the Ontario legislature, I was handed back my 
premiums with 2% interest.  I was not permitted to transfer it to 
the plan that I had as an elected official. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I came back as a member of parliament for the federal House 
of Commons, the federal civil service contributions could not be 
bought back and included in this plan.  How many Canadians know 
that?  How many Canadians know that even though I served in the 
House for 14 years, I was never able to apply one cent of that 
service toward another federal pension plan, namely the members 
of parliament plan? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas, for instance, if one worked for Nortel in an Ottawa 
plant and was then transferred to Nortel in a Toronto plant, that 
person is entitled to transfer the pension plan.  In my case, not 
only was I in the same plant, I was in the same room but was not 
entitled to transfer.  How many people know that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fine to say that the plan is generous, and perhaps there 
are aspects of it that are, but there are also sectors in which 
it is hopelessly deficient compared to plans elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not portray this thing as being a way to get rich. That 
is not factually correct.  There are many people who have very 
generous plans in the private sector where the employee 
contributes one dollar toward a registered retirement savings 
account and the employer contributes a similar amount, or even 
stock options.  Officials in the private sector are treated not 
only as generously but, in many cases, far better than we are.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the public service pension plan generally, I am 
pleased to answer that question too, because members of the House 
will know that for many, many years the public service pension 
plan was deficient.  It did not have enough contributions for its 
payout and the taxpayers of Canada, through the Government of 
Canada, supplemented that account in order to have enough money 
to pay the pensions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In another period, because of demographics and so on, the most 
recent one, when that account experienced a surplus, is it not 
normal that the taxpayers of Canada would get some of that back, 
given that they had contributed to it in the first place? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we have made the plan self-sustaining.  We have made 
the public service pension plan self-sustaining.  I believe that 
was the right thing to do for the long term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the Canada pension plan has that self-sustaining ability 
which the U.S. social security does not have.  Many things have 
been done in public sector pensions, and pensions generally, even 
pensions in the private sector, that did not exist before.  I 
will not give too much detail about that— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Chairman, I rise on a point of 
order.  I was gracious enough to get off my feet so that other 
members who have legitimate questions could ask them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is filibustering.  He is filibustering to take up 
the hour.  I graciously submit that other members should be on 
their feet asking questions.  The minister is taking too much 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Chairman:</B>  I have given the minister signals 
previously that he might curtail his remarks and he responded 
favourably to that request, as did certain other hon. members to 
whom I have given signals.  The minister is answering the 
question.  He may be taking a little longer, but I sense he has 
almost concluded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  No, Mr. Chairman, I am finished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Chairman:</B>  All right.  We will have a question from 
the hon. member for Winnipeg Transcona. 
<P><A NAME="LINK277"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Chairman, I have a question for the government House leader, 
which carries on the dialogue that has been established. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government House leader said, and I would certainly agree at 
one level, that House leaders and others who are privy to the 
consultations that preceded the tabling of the bill should not 
have to have a microphone stuck in their face and answer 
questions.  I think that was the phrase he used.  However, I 
wonder whether he thinks it proper, having said that, that they 
should be able to have a microphone stuck in their face and have 
it both ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am referring to the fact, as the minister said, that there 
were wide consultations preceding the tabling of this 
legislation.  In my judgment, the final form of the legislation, 
particularly with respect to the fact that the legislation 
legislates all members who had opted out back into the plan, is a 
feature of the legislation that was sought by the party which had 
the majority of the people who opted out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only reason this is before the House is because it was fast 
tracked, because there was unanimous consent sought and given to 
deal with this in the manner in which we are dealing with it, 
that is to say, in a fast track sort of way.  People sought what 
we have before us and gave unanimous consent to fast track it.

<A HREF="#LINKT116"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then, much to my dismay—and I mean this as sincerely as I can 
possibly say it—after seeking it, after giving unanimous consent 
for it to be fast tracked, they then voted against it at second 
reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I admire the government House leader's determination to be a 
gentleman about this.  Yesterday I stood in this place and I said 
that I thought an ugly chapter in Canadian politics was over, and 
I meant it.  That is because I thought that at the very least the 
people who had helped bring this legislation into being, who went 
out and defended the legislation, who justified it and said why 
they needed it, because of medical insurance, life insurance and 
the fact that they had brought this situation on themselves—all 
of those things I was prepared to listen to with the 
understanding that they would not then walk into the House, as 
they did this afternoon, and put the rest of us in a position of 
voting for a bill which they now have voted against, in the 
majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the government House leader that I cannot find this 
anything but reprehensible.  I wonder, are the people who 
voted against this provision not going to exercise their right to 
buy back, if that is one of the options that is open to them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just find it incomprehensible, I say to the government House 
leader, and I seek his view on this, that this could have 
happened this way.  I understood, yes, that there might be the 
odd backbencher, that there might be the odd person who would not 
accept what had been negotiated between the parties, but not that 
the leadership of the party and the majority of the caucus, after 
having sought this, after having fast tracked it, would then 
stand to vote against it.  I find it absolutely incomprehensible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no more to say.  In 21 years I have never seen anything 
like this. 
<P><A NAME="LINK278"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Chairman, first I want to congratulate 
the hon. House leader of the New Democratic Party for the 
excellent speech he gave last night in the House.  It was 
certainly the hon. member at his best.  He is a fine orator, and 
we all know it.  I am sure that he meant very much that which he 
said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I am trying to respect the way in which I have done this 
work, not only over the last number of months but over the last 
number of years, and I am afraid I will have to say to my 
colleague that I will not say publicly which clause of the bill 
was requested by whom.  I said I would not do that yesterday and 
I will not do it now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the fast tracking, we are at the end of the session. 
There are bills which we deal with more rapidly than otherwise 
would be the case by consent among the House leaders.  This is 
certainly one of them.  There is no doubt about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps we should take a moment to reflect on what all of this 
does.  This does not create a new law.  This does not even create 
a new benefit.  This does not add benefits.  It only does two 
things.  One, it corrects an historical wrong in terms of the 
severance component.  In other words, some people have a 
particular benefit while others do not.  However, nowhere does it 
raise the benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Secondly, it permits people who are eligible otherwise to be 
part of a group in terms of pension contributions to be part of 
the group that they should have been part of from the very 
beginning.  It actually makes it such that everyone starts 
contributing from the day the bill receives royal assent.  I for 
one believe that if there is a group package, whether it is group 
life insurance or whatever, everyone should pay the premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have said that all along.  I have said that when some members 
of parliament were disagreeing with me.  Today, of course, I will 
say it when people are agreeing with me.  The proposition is the 
same.  If it was the right thing to do then, I have to say that 
it is the right thing to do now.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am being asked about how people should have voted on this.  I 
am not going to reflect upon a vote of the House that has already 
been held.  Perhaps, in a little while, when we have the third 
reading of the bill, we could show some solidarity, if that is 
the appropriate word. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although not everyone wants the bill, since nothing is unanimous 
in this world, at the very least we could show that there is a 
form of consensus that we all know exists by having this bill 
carried on third reading without a recorded division. Perhaps 
that would be the correct thing to do.  It would help to 
re-establish the balance that the hon. member is seeking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously we cannot undo anything that has been done before, but 
that might be a good way to restore that balance. 
<P><A NAME="LINK279"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Chairman, could I ask how much time is left? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Chairman:</B>  Two minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Perhaps I will leave some of my remarks 
to third reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is somewhat different from most.  Most bills come 
through the departmental system.  They go through the department, 
the minister and the departmental consultation process.  There is 
quite a process in the development of a bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This one, as the House leader has already mentioned, has come 
through a somewhat different process.  Cabinet still has to 
approve a bill that goes to the House, but the process to get 
this bill to this stage is somewhat different than would normally 
be the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member tell me whether there was any 
consideration given in the drafting of this bill to the 
recommendations of the Blais commission report, which was the 
last independent commission report that we had before the House 
during the last parliament?   Was that part of the consideration 
in the drafting of this bill? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Chairman, in fact, the regular 
system of consultation did operate.  I am a minister and, 
obviously, other ministers had to be involved.  This bill has an 
implication for the treasury board.  It has an implication for 
other departments of government.  The usual consultations 
certainly were held, which is only normal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member also asked whether consideration was given to 
the Blais commission report.  Yes, in fact, that was done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, in my remarks last night I quoted the Blais 
commission report at page 40, and I would like to do so again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Departing members are entitled to a relatively financially secure 
transition from Parliament to the work force or to retirement, as 
the case might be. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another recommendation in the Blais commission report 
which states that the members of parliament retirement plan, the 
pension plan in other words, may appear on the surface to be 
generous, but it is not all that generous.  It is one which is, 
in the grand scheme of things, reasonable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report states at page 139: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The pension plan for Members of Parliament, while appearing 
generous, is not necessarily out of line with public and private 
sector plans that recognize the impact of the mid-career hire 
aspect of the career path of their senior employees. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Chairman:</B>  Pursuant to order made on Monday, June 12, 
it is my duty to interrupt the proceedings.  Shall the title 
carry?

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I am quite pleased to participate in the 
third reading stage of the bill.  My comments will be very brief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank all hon. members for their contribution to the debate. I 
also say to hon. members that whether or not they avail 
themselves of the privilege of buying back previous contributions 
is their decision.  I hope they all do so.  Whether they do or do 
not is their business.  On an individual basis that information 
is quite appropriately confidential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More important, as the House leader of the New Democratic Party 
said quite eloquently yesterday, we have put a page behind us 
with regard to issues of MP pensions, salaries and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recent reports have indicated quite clearly that members of 
parliament are not overly paid.  Anyone who was ever a high 
school teacher, high school principal, director of education and 
so on, would obviously know that salaries of MPs are not out of 
line compared with those professions.  Many other professions are 
paid even better.  We all know that is the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember in the 1993 campaign when it became fashionable for 
some people to say “Vote for me and I will reduce my salary”, 
and so on.  I resisted that and I took the following position.  I 
was asked if I would take a pay cut and I said “No. If you do 
not think I am worth the salary there are five other people on 
the platform with me.  Pick the one who is.  Do not debase the 
currency”.  My majority went up in that election campaign so it 
is not an issue that necessarily brings a higher level of 
support.  I do not believe that it does, if that is a concern of 
some people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is more important is what is right, and what is right is to 
have not a compensation package that makes members of parliament 
rich but one which is sufficient to attract a high level of 
candidates to participate in public life. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report of the Blais commission told us that on average a 
Canadian parliamentarian earned less than 40% of the salary of a 
member of the U.S. Congress. Of course, we are not here to 
become rich, far from it. But one should not claim that our 
compensation and benefit package is generous. It may be 
adequate, but it is certainly not generous, and I would not 
claim it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just would like to say that, in my opinion, what 
parliamentarians earn is far from excessive. 
Benefits provided under this bill are not excessive either. They 
are reasonable, no more no less, and I strongly recommend them 
to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope all parliamentarians will vote in support 
of the bill at third reading. Finally, as the bill will be sent 
to the other house after the debate in a few minutes, I hope 
members in the other place will be able to pass it without 
delay. This is my hope.

<P><A NAME="LINK283"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak to third reading of this bill.  As 
I mentioned last night, I still have the feeling of unease as 
anyone does when talking about one's own salary and trying to 
justify one's self-worth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the House leader has already mentioned, at times we have to 
get up on our hind legs and do such a thing.  Tonight is one of 
those moments when we must talk about something that is very 
personal.  Different members of parliament finds themselves with 
different financial needs in different stages of their lives and 
careers.  That is to be acknowledged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to address two or three points.  There is not much doubt 
the House leader of the NDP was referring to me when he said he 
did not feel I should vote against the bill when I did this 
afternoon.  He was offended by that.  I should like to speak 
briefly on the principle I was trying to follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been absolutely consistent when speaking in the House, in 
what I have written in papers, and what I have said in scrums 
outside the House.  I have admitted that the issue being 
addressed by the NDP House leader is in large part a problem of 
our own making.  I have said that before.  I will say it again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that by making the MP pension plan as big an issue 
as we did back in 1993 we are held to a different standard than 
everyone else in this place.  I understand that.  I understand we 
have taken some political heat.  There has been a good discussion 
down at the far end of this place about that this evening. 
However I still maintain that by holding our ground, especially 
in 1993, important changes were made to the old pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People started to consider what is fair to the taxpayers of 
Canada as part of the equation.  That was an important change. It 
was a change that would not have happened unless people forcibly 
made remuneration and the pension issues in the 1993 election. 
That is just a fact.  I do not apologize for it.  It had to be 
done.  It was done with a lot of passion, and some changes were 
made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that changes were made opens the door.  The fact that 
we are on our third different pension bill since I have been 
elected to parliament means that change will be possible down the 
road.  This deal is not set in concrete.  It will be reviewed 
again after the next parliament.  There is a statutory 
requirement to review it.  The government has a requirement to 
appoint an independent commission as it did last time. Parts of 
such commission reports deal with public perception and the 
public expectations in terms of pensions for MPs.  I hope the 
recommendations, whatever they are, will be adopted by the House. 
It takes the kind of debate we are having tonight out of the 
parliamentary area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said in scrums, as I have said here and as I would say 
anywhere, it is too difficult for members of parliament to say to 
everybody that this is what they will pay themselves out of 
taxpayers' pockets.  If as MPs we say that we are worth $70,000 
per year, someone might say we are greedy, self-righteous or 
hypocritical.  Whatever members might say they cannot fight. They 
cannot win the debate.  The debate is always slanted by the 
audience that wants to hear the message. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a better way to do it in the future, and I am hopeful 
it can be done that way.  We have seen three changes in less than 
seven years. 
The last change is not so much about the content but about the 
way we handle it.  I still believe there is a better way to do 
it.  We would not be having this debate tonight had the Blais 
commission report been adopted in its entirety.  That would have 
been a much better outcome, but that was not to happen and we 
have to deal with it.  We have to play the cards that are dealt 
to us.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reiterate that the policy of this party has always been that 
members of parliament deserve a pension.  It was the Reform 
Party's policy previous to the Canadian Alliance.  The Canadian 
Alliance policy is that members of parliament should get a 
pension plan.  That has never been in dispute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One good thing about the bill is that the debate in the future 
will no longer be whether MPs get a pension.  We have turned a 
page.  There will still be a debate on what kind of pension MPs 
should get, which is the proper debate.  The public will engage 
in it.  The National Citizens' Coalition is sure to give us a 
pound or two in the next while.  Others will get into it.  That 
is fine because a debate on what kind of pension is appropriate. 
That is fine enough question and a fine enough debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mistake, if there was one made or at least the impression 
that was left at one time, was that some MPs do not deserve a 
pension.  That double standard was wrong.  If people think I am 
coughing up crow feathers, or whatever it is I have to do, I just 
say the debate should have never been about whether some MPs 
should receive any pension at all.  All MPs should receive a 
pension.  We have said that.  It has been our policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was an honest attempt and effective pressure was brought 
on the government to change the pension plan.  Part of that 
effectiveness unfortunately was that some members of parliament 
received no pension.  It was part of a pressure tactic, part of 
of an effort to bring in changes and to bring in the 
recommendations of the Blais commission.  That tactic was taken 
to pressure the government.  It was somewhat effective, but the 
mistake in the end result was that some MPs were told they would 
receive nothing for the rest of their lives, whatever that might 
be.  That was contrary to party policy.  It always was and it 
still is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The party policy of the former Reform Party was that we should 
have a pension in line with the private sector.  The party policy 
for the Canadian Alliance is similar.  I can get more specific 
and say that we should live with the results of an independent 
commission that reports to parliament.  We would take its 
recommendations as binding.  If the commission says we should get 
rid of the tax free allowance, gross it all up and base our 
pension on a totally taxable amount, we will salute the flag and 
we will do it.  If it says we should have to work so many years 
before receiving a pension, if it says we will get a pension at 
such and such an age, or whatever it thinks appropriate is based 
on an independent commission, I will thank it kindly, shake 
hands, and we will pass it.  That is the way to do it.  Then 
there is no more debate as to how we handled ourselves or whether 
we scored or whatever.  All MPs would receive a pension plan as 
they should, but it would be reasonable because an independent 
commission brought it down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a lot of talk last night about the fast tracking of 
the bill.  A couple of points need to be said.  It is true the 
entire House gave consent to bringing the bill in without 48 
hours notice.  As I said to the media earlier today, if we had as 
much time to debate all bills in the House of Commons as we will 
have to debate this one we would be thrilled.  Every member who 
wants to speak is allowed to speak to this bill.  If we had as 
much time as that on the Nisga'a agreement, if we had as much 
time as that on the Clarity Act, if we had as much time as that 
on dozens of different pieces of legislation, as a House leader I 
would be thrilled to death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no restriction on this debate.  We brought it in 48 
hours early, but as our caucus and members over there know as 
many members as want can get up on their hind legs today to talk 
about whatever they want to talk about.  They are free to do it. 
What a wonderful way to do it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am much more proud of the way we are handling this bill as a 
parliament than the changes we made last time, when we brought it 
in and passed it in a day just two years ago. When I went home I 
had more complaints about how we handled the passage of the bill 
than the contents of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here it is a wide open debate.  Yes, it was brought in without 
48 hours notice, but what an improvement it is for all of us to 
stand up, and I will have to do it too, to go to the media, to go 
home and when they ask, “What did you say about the bill? Did 
you speak about it?”  I will say, “Absolutely.  I am on the 
record and you can read it in <I>Hansard</I> because no one was 
denied the right to speak”.  Not only that, but no one is denied 
the right to vote.  This is the way legislation should be passed. 
We have a vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to my final point which is the vote itself.  The 
House leader for the NDP is offended because I voted against this 
bill.  I tell him as I told the media earlier, and as I will tell 
my constituents, I am voting against the bill because the bill is 
not consistent with our party policy.  I am going to vote against 
it because I am going to be consistent with that. That being 
said, and I will say it here and I will say it back home, I am 
voting against it but my heart is not in it.  That is the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am voting against it not because I think there are some 
shenanigans going on, not because I think that the government 
House leader has been sneaky or underhanded or anything else. And 
anyone who says that just has not worked with the government 
House leader.  This is kind of shocking for me to say this, but 
those who say that the government House leader has not been 
honourable should be ashamed of themselves.  I do not mind saying 
that.  I think it makes cheap political points and I find that 
offensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the time we allow bills to come to this place. We fast-track 
them so to speak.  People should know how this works.  It is no 
secret.  There are negotiations. The House leaders get together 
and say, “How many speakers to you think you are going to have 
on this bill?”  I will say, “I think we have about three or 
four speakers”. The government House leader will say, “Okay, I 
have two or three.  It looks like we are going to have three or 
four hours of debate.  If we do that we are going to be pressed 
for time.  Would you cut back to just two speakers so we can get 
the bill into committee?”  I will say, “Okay, I can see the 
wisdom of that, but I am going to vote against it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not supporting the bill.  It is just part of how we 
handle it.  I have opposed bills because they originated in the 
Senate, not for the contents of the bill but because I find it 
offensive that the Senate originates bills which I think should 
properly originate here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have already said that I am voting against this legislation. I 
have done and I will again if it is a standing vote and if we 
have a vote on third reading, not because I think something 
sneaky, underhanded or dirty has happened but because I think 
there is a better way to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Often in this place we vote against legislation not because we 
think it is heinous, not because we think it is dastardly, 
underhanded, sneaky or anything like that; we see what the 
government is trying to do but we think there is a better way to 
do it.  I will vote against the bill because I think there is a 
better way.  I explained it last night thoroughly.  I will vote 
against it not because I want to smear anyone.  I have not said a 
word against anyone here and I am not going to.  It is not 
because I am trying to paint someone into a corner or take 
advantage of someone.  I am doing it because there is a better 
way. That is the way it works.  We do that consistently in this 
place, not because we think different bills are awful, but 
because there is a better way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When there is a better way we have an obligation as an 
opposition party to stand up, explain that better way and then 
vote against the legislation.  That is what I think. We do this 
routinely.  I am thinking even of bills that we will support. 
We will bring in report stage amendments even though we know they 
are not going to pass, but we think they will improve the bill. 
We will bring in the amendments but we will not hold up the bill 
or stop it or make somebody down the road pay the price. However, 
in our opinion, there is a better way.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is our obligation to put that better way on the table for 
everyone to see.  They can say yes or no.  They can say they do 
not like it or they think it is good, bad or indifferent.  As the 
official opposition, it is our obligation not just to rubber 
stamp it, but to say there is an alternative and this is what we 
would like to do.  It does not mean we do not think there is some 
other benefit in the bill.  It means that our obligation is to be 
consistent with our party line, with what we proposed and 
campaigned on and propose those better ways in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After what I have said I hope people can understand.  I will 
vote against the bill not because I think MPs do not deserve a 
pension because they do.  I will vote against it because it is 
inconsistent with our party policy.  Our party policy is not that 
MPs get no pension.  That has never been the deal.  That is not 
going to be the deal.  As long as I have anything to do with it, 
it will not be the deal.  MPs deserve a pension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate is what kind of pension they deserve and who should 
give it to them. I wish, I hope and I believe one day that is the 
way it will be done.  It will take the pressure off all members 
of parliament.  The debate and the rancour about this subject 
will be put behind us once and for all.  We will all be able to 
go home and say that we got the pension that somebody allocated 
to us, not because we asked for it or snuck it through or 
negotiated it or anything else.  We got it because it was an 
independent group of people who gave all of us a fitting 
remuneration and retirement package. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to that day.  It is not likely to happen before 
the next parliament, but when we go through the statutory review 
I hope all members of parliament will consider what I have said 
tonight.  There is a better way to handle this difficult issue 
for all members of parliament.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Madam Speaker, like other members of parliament, I am not anxious 
to jump into this, but there is an element to all of this debate 
that we have to keep in mind and put into a certain context.  It 
is very easy to say that we want to ensure fairness, that this 
bill is aimed at changing some anomalies that exist and that 
there are some technical adjustments that need to be made to 
ensure fairness.  We have pointed them out ad nauseam as to the 
purpose of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not kid ourselves for a minute.  This bill is tailored to 
allow members of one particular party to opt back into a pension 
plan that they denounced.  I take very much to heart the comments 
that have been made by the previous speaker.  I believe him to be 
very sincere in what he has indicated.  I do not do this with any 
great relish, but it is a matter of that was then and this is 
now.  Those words were easy to say at one time and now they are a 
little bitter when they have to be swallowed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out something that the hon. member for Fraser 
Valley said on this issue not that many years ago in debates in 
the House of Commons.  On May 9, 1995 he said, “All Reform Party 
members are going to opt out of the pension plan because we stand 
on principle and do not swim in gravy.  We are going to opt 
out”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His leader that same day in the course of the debate said, “It 
is the intention of Reform MPs to opt out of the pension plan. 
We call upon every member of the House to do likewise.  Opt out 
or get out will be the cry in the constituencies.  It is the cry 
which must be respected if fairness and leadership by example and 
integrity are to be restored to parliament on any budget it 
endorses”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was obviously a bunch of malarkey. Now by virtue of this 
bill, as my colleague from New Brunswick Southwest has indicated, 
the reform members of the House are now swallowing themselves 
whole. 
They are completely capitulating on their earlier stances.

<A HREF="#LINKT123"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not so much what they said here that really hurts, that 
really makes it hard for some members like the member who was 
here in 1993 and was defeated.  It is not just those members and 
the debate that is taking place here, but it is members that are 
not here who did not return and do not have the ability to 
collect a pension. They stated quite clearly where they stood and 
still stand, but now there has been a reversal of fortunes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a change in the mindset because individuals, in 
fairness, came here having said one thing and realized that 
things were a little different.  The pension was not so sweet 
after all.  It was not so easy to get on a plane and come to 
Ottawa and leave family and friends and a previous occupation 
behind.  It was not such a great deal after all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this comes down to is having said one thing and now turning 
completely around.  They have made a complete reversal of 
fortunes in their favour and have opted back in by virtue of this 
bill.  That is what this bill allows them to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know they do not like to hear this, but the unravelling of 
Reform principle is what we are seeing here.  There is a thinly 
veiled attempt at reinventing themselves and what they said. 
There was a name change but all the while they kept the same 
policy, the same membership and the same leadership.  A futile 
redundant exercise.  A cynical attempt at re-branding.  That is 
what this is all part of in the big scheme of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is easy to find integrity after the fact.  It is easy to opt 
into the pension plan, the same plan that the Reform Party railed 
against.  They screamed like banshees and suggested that somehow 
it was completely malicious and untenable that members of 
parliament would accept some remuneration after the fact for the 
hard work they do.  That was an issue that was not put forward by 
any other party.  This was an invention, a tool, a spear that was 
used to impale other members of the House.  Now it is impaling 
them.  They are going to have to go back to their constituents 
and explain how they can do this, how they can swallow their 
principle now and take the pension, vote against it perhaps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This pension plan will now be mandatory.  Make no mistake about 
it.  All 301 members of the House of Commons are in.  When this 
pension plan passes, they are all in.  Nobody is out.  We have an 
added bonus and it is a stroke of genius.  I am not questioning 
the government House leader's intention, it is a beautiful thing. 
It is the ability to buy back retroactively all of that 
pensionable time.  Fair enough.  Why not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nobody is suggesting that members of one party work any harder 
than members of another.  Those members are entitled to pensions 
and we do not dispute that for a minute, but they should not tell 
people they will not take the pension and then take it. They 
should not try to hide behind some guise, as was seen in the last 
attempt to bring in a severance package that would set up two 
separate types of plans.  There is the evil pension plan that 
members of parliament get and then there is the fine severance 
package that will be a lump sum that will go to Reform members. 
That is okay.  A big lump sum payment is fine, but a pension is 
bad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This reminds me of George Orwell's classic novel <I>Animal 
Farm</I> which we all studied in grade 9 or 10 in high school.  I 
know, Madam Speaker, that you are a scholar and you will recall 
this story.  We all recall the premise of what was going to take 
place in that famous novel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The pigs were appalled at the farmer and the lavish life that he 
lived and the terrible conditions the animals were toiling in. In 
<I>Animal Farm</I> the animals gathered in the barnyard and talked 
about rebellion and what they were going to do to change things. 
They spoke in wild terms of equity and fairness and what they 
would not do if they had the reins of power.  The animals 
continued to gather and whip each other into a frenzy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally the rebellion came.  Does this sound familiar?  The 
animals gathered up their strength and courage and pumped each 
other up.  They said they would do things differently if they 
ever had the chance.  They chastised the farmer for his 
comfortable life.  Remember the rallying cry, “four legs good, 
two legs bad”. 
When the rebellion was over the pigs moved into the house.  They 
started walking on their hind legs and they took the comforts 
that the farmer used to enjoy and which they had previously 
opposed.  Does this sound familiar?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our current circumstances:  reformers good, other MPs bad. 
That is what we have been hearing for 10 years.  For 10 years we 
have been hearing “No pensions, no car, no clothing allowance, 
no Stornoway.  That would never happen”.  The list goes on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reform leader is standing in the House on hind legs.  The 
barnyard buddies are also here.  The moral of the story is that 
it is very easy to say one thing but when one is saddled with the 
actual reality of what is taking place it is a different story 
altogether. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we have heard.  We heard one story when that party 
wanted to achieve office, but now that it is in office it is a 
different story.  The story does not apply anymore.  The 
conditions are not the same.  However, that will be for the 
Canadian people to decide.  Opting into the pension plan, the 
same pension plan that everyone here is entitled to and reformers 
are entitled to as well, is not what a lot of them said they 
would do.  Some of them did address the issue in an upfront way. 
What it comes down to is truth or consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened to bring about the change?  What was the crisis of 
conscience?  What was the shallow pool of principle that caused 
things to turn around?  It was simply the reality that some 
people may have to leave here and go home.  They have families to 
support and, as my colleague said, they may have children or 
spouses who have made great sacrifices. Those are fundamental 
things that cannot be denied.  They are fundamental things that 
every member of the House has to confront, yet that was put to 
one side when it was politically advantageous to pillar other 
members of the House of Commons on this issue.  I would suggest 
that it was done with reckless abandon and malice aforethought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was easy to criticize something when reformers did not really 
know much about it.  They came to the House, after having created 
this atmosphere of fear and loathing—and it has taken almost 10 
years to go that full circle—and completely swallowed themselves 
from head to tail.  What we have seen is a reptilian 
transformation, a shedding of the skin.  Now it is okay to have a 
pension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very easy to get up, speak emotionally, tell us that it is 
fine and that we wish things were different, but I am just one 
small voice.  There are many members of parliament who feel very 
offended by what has taken place, particularly members who are 
not here and who were defeated, and perhaps very much on this one 
issue.  It was made an issue.  It was not something that was a 
creation of anyone other than themselves, which is what makes it 
so difficult and so distasteful.  This is a bed that was made 
completely by the reform party, no one else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very easy to criticize and vilify one's opponent, but at 
the end of the day, when it has come full circle, in the sharp 
light of day and the cameras are on, and we are being asked to 
explain ourselves, that is where it gets a little more dicey. 
That is where the reform party finds itself now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The wrecking ball approach is simple:  come in, destroy 
institutions, strike everything down and criticize.  However, 
when harnessed with the reins of power, as we know this party 
never will be, it is different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the Liberal government has had to do.  It is 
nothing new for the Liberal government.  The reform party has 
been very critical of the current government but even this 
exercise cannot hold a candle to swallowing itself whole:  the 
GST, free trade, privatization, helicopter programs.  This 
government has not even begun to hold a candle to that record 
except the red book promises and the red faces that now exist in 
conjunction with that.  I suppose there is some comparison with 
the green book and the envy and greed that might be associated 
with what is taking place now.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate, unfortunately, does take a bit of a nasty turn 
because it is personal for members of parliament, having suffered 
the slings and arrows of what was deemed to be outrageous fortune 
by the reform party, which now it wants to delve into it.  We no 
longer see the plastic pink pigs being stuck in the front lawn of 
the House of Commons.  Of course, that was part of the new 
dignity that was coming to this place, just like the mariachi 
band in front of the Senate, a class act.  Those things certainly 
raised the profile and the feeling of dignity that members of 
parliament have for this place.  Double that up with the Canadian 
flags being tossed on the floor and the old jalopy with the 
Canadian flags painted on it circling the parliamentary precinct, 
it certainly raised the profile of parliament.  A new dignity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  What about taking off their jackets to 
fight? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Yes, they were challenging members of 
the House of Commons to fight.  That was reminiscent of a new way 
of doing things, of saying one thing and doing another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In simple terms, there has been a reality check that has taken 
place.  I hope Canadians are paying attention because I think we 
sometimes fool ourselves.  We think Canadians are watching this 
place with a close eye.  I would suggest it is becoming more and 
more of a jaded eye because of this type of, dare I say, 
hypocrisy.  The Greek god, Hippocrates, would be looking down on 
us right now with a very wry smile. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we arrive in this place we learn in very short order that 
this is an onerous task and a heavy responsibility.  We have to 
choose our words carefully and we have to be prepared to stand by 
them.  I think the next election is going to be very much about 
truth and about restoring some semblance of faith and belief that 
Canadians might have in their elected officials again.  This 
exercise is certainly not going to help that task. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it is all over, when it is all said and done, if we are 
prepared to say something to get elected, we had better be 
prepared to follow through with it.  We had better be prepared to 
stand by those words.  The inflamed passions that we see here 
today are only the beginning of what may be a very rigorous 
campaign that is potentially going to take place this fall.  The 
spears being used to lampoon one another here may be repeated out 
on the hustings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians deserve to know where we stand.  They deserve to be 
able to check up after the fact to see if we have followed 
through on it.  I sincerely hope that members of parliament, 
particularly members of the reform party, can go back and look 
their constituents in the eye and say that, yes, they have 
followed through with their promise in this regard because they 
chose to make it an issue.  They did make it an issue.  There is 
no doubt about that.  Pages and pages of <I>Hansard</I> have 
chronicled the commentary that has taken place in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is about fairness and, in principle, all Progressive 
Conservative members of the House of Commons support what this 
bill attempts to achieve, which is a fair and equitable system 
that brings parity in for all members of this place.  What we do 
not accept is that this pension plan was used as a club with a 
nail in it to beat other members of parliament.  We oppose the 
fact that the reform party is now very quick to embrace this same 
pension plan and gather it in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, that was then and this is now.  What we have seen is 
that there are no more references to gold-plated pensions.  That 
seems to have dissipated.  The rancour has somehow died.  The 
righteousness has disappeared somewhat.  Well, lo and behold, all 
the reformers are accepting what they once rejected, embracing 
what they once despised, counting and caressing what they once so 
vehemently opposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, they cast aside this previous commitment to their 
constituents.  In simple terms, that was then and this is now. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2125"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT126"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that principle, although I accept the magnanimous remarks of 
the reform party House leader, it is a bit of bitter medicine to 
have to swallow.  He has talked about changes.  I think we can 
all agree that we want to see any sort of change that will be 
inclusive and recognize the value and worth of members of 
parliament in their efforts, their daily tasks, what they do for 
their constituents, what they do here and what they do on the 
national scene.  We diminish that when we embark on this type of 
partisan exercise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not deny that were are engaged in a partisan exercise. It 
is necessary to point to the record on how quickly we sometimes 
forget what was said.  That has been much of the case in Canadian 
politics and with the government.  It will have its record to 
defend.  It will have to explain to Canadians what happened to 
all that money in the HRDC department.  It will have to explain 
why the Prime Minister was so quick to talk about tearing up the 
free trade agreement and then expand it when elected.  It will 
have to explain why the Prime Minister said very clearly that he 
would axe the tax and get rid of the GST and it is still here. 
If we go to the store we see that we are still paying the GST. 
It was expanded and harmonized in the maritimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it was convenient.  It is always easy to tell people 
what they want to hear.  There is a public appetite for it, just 
like this issue with the pensions.  People wanted to hear that 
and the reformers fed it.  They fanned those flames to their 
benefit.  Now it is only fair and just that this has come back, 
and that it has come back, in what some would describe as a very 
nefarious way, in the last dying days of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that members of my own caucus take issue with the way in 
which this was brought about.  I am certainly not proud of the 
way this has arrived before us.  I, as the House leader of the 
Progressive Conservative Party, have been a part of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, that is why, at the end of this debate, we will be 
saying that we cannot support this legislation.  We cannot 
support the way this has been brought about, not because we are 
against fairness or any form of pension that recognizes work, 
labour and input, but because we are against hypocrisy.  We are 
against saying one thing because it is politically advantageous 
and then doing another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that members of the reform party do not want to hear 
that.  It is not consistent with what they have done.  There have 
been all sorts of examples of this as well.  It is played out 
here in the House of Commons on a partisan level every day. 
However this is one occasion where there is nothing that can be 
said that will exonerate members of that party.  There is nothing 
that will to replace those words in the minds of constituents who 
voted for reform members after hearing that they were not going 
to be a part of the pension plan.  Guess what?  They are in, they 
are a part of it and those promises are long gone, just like the 
promises on the other side of the House that we heard before the 
previous election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  They'll be long gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Yes, there will be other members who 
will be long gone, too, if Canadians choose to dwell on this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should members of parliament therefore receive a pension?  Yes, 
they should.  Should we look at making further changes in the 
future?  Perhaps we should look at something that is more 
consistent with the private sector.  However, we have to look at 
the whole picture.  We know that members of parliament are not 
remunerated on the same level as those working in the private 
sector, for example, in certain positions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are going to look at this issue we should do it in a 
holistic way, not holus-bolus and not to the benefit of one party 
and to the detriment of another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude my remarks by saying that I hope there is 
sufficient attention being paid to what is playing out before us 
here, this morality play that was so convenient in years past 
that has now come home to roost.  I hope all members of 
parliament, including members of the reform party, will reflect 
on their conscience and review their words.  Maybe they will not 
be so quick to shoot from the hip the next time.

Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, here we go again.  I thought all 
this had been put behind us back in 1998 but this pension issue 
is kind of like a smelly dead animal. 
The dog buried it in 1995 and then he dug it up in 1998 and then 
he buried it again.  Now he has dug it up again within the last 
few days.  Maybe, just maybe, some day the public will be 
sufficiently offended by the smell of this dead animal that they 
will react against the Liberal Party and make it pay a price for 
its Machiavellian games.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill, this action on the part of the government, has had 
the effect of reinforcing the very unfortunate public perception 
that politics is a dishonourable profession and that MPs as a 
group are self-serving and venal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an institution, why on earth would we do this to ourselves? 
Why do we want to send out that message?  More properly, I would 
say, what motivated the government to do this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most charitable interpretation is that it was simple 
mischief.  It wanted to start the type of debate that we have 
heard going on in this House for the last 20 minutes, which went 
on last night and which will probably continue on interminably 
and forever.  I would have to say that unfortunately there is a 
more probable cause than simple mischief, which is simple 
venality on the part of some of government members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Edmonton West, for example, with her defeat 
imminent, has to be protected, along with many of her colleagues 
who want to have the best of both worlds.  They want to have 
their pension at 55, but they would like to have severance pay as 
well.  It is a new twist on double-dipping.  However, even if 
mischief were not the prime consideration, it did give the member 
for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough the opportunity to make a 
campaign speech tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did he attack the government for its perfidy?  Of course not. 
He raised this silly fiction that somehow the government is doing 
this to help the official opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been around this place for seven years and I have yet to 
see the government do anything to help the official opposition. 
That is not the way the game is played.  The hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough should know that.  It would be 
extraordinarily naive to think that we could move the government. 
We cannot even move it on the really big, important stuff.  How 
on earth could we move it on something like this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyway, the member supported his good friends on the government 
side, irrationally attacked the official opposition on a great 
variety of issues, and no doubt will have his reward in heaven or 
will be rewarded by his good buddies across the aisle.  It must 
be really tough to belong to a dying political party and be 
reduced to licking the hands of government members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This pension scheme was wrong in 1995 and it is still wrong.  It 
gives members of this House an indecent advantage over ordinary 
citizens.  It is as simple as that.  People who sit in parliament 
should in no way receive a greater public benefit than that to 
which ordinary citizens are entitled.  This is quite fundamental 
in my view to the way democracy is supposed to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who rationalize and say that we work hard and we really 
deserve this pension forget that a lot of them would not have had 
a pension of any kind if they had not been elected to parliament. 
Now that they are here, they say it is a good idea.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying that a pension per se would be wrong.  I never 
have said that.  However, the pension that we are talking about 
today is wrong, wrong, wrong.  It is an indecent assault on the 
taxpayers of Canada.  I do not know of a single member of 
parliament who was dragged kicking and screaming into the House 
of Commons and forced to work for menial wages.  Then, to take a 
pension at the end of that work perhaps would not fit with his 
views of what is right and what is wrong.  We are all volunteers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply cannot go back to my constituents and say that I have 
changed my mind and that I will buy my way back into this pension 
plan because I sure could use the money.  My self-respect 
precludes that.  I have to look in the mirror every morning when 
I shave.  We cannot do that if we do not feel good about 
ourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Five years ago, two years ago and again this week the government 
could have fixed this plan.  It could have made it acceptable to 
all, but it did not.  Originally it could have abided by the 
recommendations of the Blais commission.  It ignored it.  It had 
to have the lollipops inserted into the legislation, and the 
lollipops have stayed all the way through the various 
ramifications of the legislation that we have seen over the past 
few years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to comment on a comment which was made by the 
member for Winnipeg—Transcona which suggested that our party was 
not playing by “the rules” because some of our officers, after 
having agreed to let the government bring this legislation 
forward on a fast track, then followed our party policy for 
heaven's sake and voted against it.  How terrible to vote against 
something to support the policies of one's own party.  How dare 
we do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the hon. member for Winnipeg—Transcona, I would 
like to point out that some years ago I had a long and spirited 
but friendly correspondence with the late Stanley Knowles, one of 
my political icons.  If Stanley Knowles were alive today he would 
be horrified.  He is probably spinning in his grave when he sees 
his party supporting this perfidious pension scheme.  This is a 
party that has, unfortunately, forgotten its roots. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Well, by God, I have not forgotten mine.  I know where I came 
from.  I know who my constituents are.  I know who pays the bills 
around this place.  I will not support legislation which unfairly 
takes money from the pockets of ordinary, decent, taxpaying 
Canadians in order to create a completely unacceptable and 
immoral pension scheme for members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. government House leader alluded to private pension 
plans, which he said are just as rich as the one we are 
discussing here.  I wish that he would name one as a specific 
example.  In his statement he talked about a one to one 
contributory rate, to which I say amen.  That has been our policy 
forever, a one to one contributory rate, but we get $3.61 of 
taxpayer funding for every dollar which members put into this 
plan. 
That is why it is not right.  It is both fiscally and morally 
unacceptable to me and I believe to the great majority of my 
colleagues.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not kid ourselves.  It is easy to rationalize.  It is 
easy to throw out one's chest, as the hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough who is going to get his pension 
has done, and criticize the rest of us.  The bottom line is that 
it is a bad plan.  It smells.  It is that dead animal dug up for 
the third time.  I hope that this time we bury it and bury it for 
good, and that the next government of Canada will again revisit 
this situation, appoint a completely neutral commission, with no 
ties whatsoever to this place, and say “Gentlemen and ladies, 
sit down and give us a plan.  What is an MP worth?  Show us the 
remuneration.  Show us what the pension should be and then we 
will act on it”.  Then we would not have to have these nasty, 
divisive debates again and again.  It is unproductive and I am 
getting sick of it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, in 
listening to the hon. member of the Reform Party speak about the 
pension— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Alliance.  Members of the Canadian 
Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>  I forgot.  Yes, they changed the name. 
Is it CCRAP?  No, it is CA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  That is really classy, Elsie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>  It was not real classy when you did it 
either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I think the Speaker has mentioned many times that people 
should use the proper names of the parties.  I would specifically 
say before the member gets started that if she wants to be a 
class act she should change the way she is heading into this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Yes, indeed, I must 
remind the hon. member that the Speaker has ruled that in the 
House we call the official opposition the Canadian Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>  Madam Speaker, if we are talking about 
a class act, I would say that we would not be debating this issue 
if members of the official opposition had conducted themselves in 
a class act fashion in the past.  We would not even be discussing 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I brought forth a private member's bill to change the pension 
plan.  Oh, yes.  They are smiling.  My private member's bill did 
change the pension plan.  I had asked that no one be entitled to 
a pension until the age of 60, and the government lowered it to 
the age of 55.  Others can take all the credit they want, but it 
came through my private member's bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I listen tonight to the comments being made by the official 
opposition about money being wasted, I have to say that 90% of 
those who are sitting in the House when they leave will not get a 
pension until the age of 55, if they have been here for six 
consecutive years.  Some of them will have a long wait.  Some 
members of the official opposition probably have about 25 years 
to wait before they will get anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about taking all of this money from the taxpayers, 
that really is not painting the picture that should be painted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague, who is not in the House right now, who comes 
from the southern end of the province, mentioned that if I were 
to go out on a pension it would be $21,000, but it would not.  If 
I were to go out on a pension for the length of time that I have 
been here, it would be about $17,000, probably a little less than 
the vice-principals of our schools back home would receive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is fine.  That is very fine with me.  That does not bother 
me one bit.  However, I want to say this. 
I listened to the quotes that were made, the things that were 
said about the people here who have given from their hearts and 
souls to do what is right for Canadians from coast to coast.  I 
heard the things that members said.  They called us names.

understands this is questions and comments.  If she wants to 
comment, she can do so as long as she wants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>  On September 12, 1995, an MP from B.C. 
who at that time was a Reformer said that MPs were still at the 
trough.  Others did not think it was being at the trough.  They 
thought they owed it to their offspring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been hurt by the statements and comments made in the 
House about members of parliament.  I cannot believe what some 
members said about those of us who have given over 25 years of 
our lives to make for a better quality of life for our people.  I 
would never say that about any member of the House.  I have never 
ever said it.  I have never used that kind of language.  I do not 
intend to use it tonight.  I will quote what members of the 
official opposition have said about everybody else in the House, 
but I have never referred to any of them in that way.  Nor will I 
do it tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Fraser Valley stated that all Reform Party 
members would opt out of the pension plan because they stand on 
principle and do not swim in gravy.  I have never swam in gravy. 
I am pleased that I am known in my riding as someone of 
principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week I was asked to go to a Baptist convention in Moncton. 
I was the guest speaker for a pro-life meeting.  Representatives 
from all across Canada were there.  They did not ask others to do 
it. I was humbled and proud to be there.  I am a person of 
principle.  I take great offence at the statements that have been 
made by members of the official opposition about me, about others 
in my party and about others who sit on the government side.  We 
are people of principle.  Most of us would not even think of 
being here if it were not that we wanted to do something that was 
best for the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think about why members would come here if they did not want 
to do something that was better for their people.  Why would they 
want to be here and do and say the things they do?  If members of 
the official opposition wish to come into the pension plan it is 
up to them. Fine and dandy.  We have heard all kinds of rumours 
in the House about the large numbers in that party who want to 
have a pension. That is fine, but they should not say derogatory 
things about other people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  We are in questions and comments.  I think the member for 
Cypress Hills—Grasslands should be allowed time to respond to 
this comment.  I hope you would take that into consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Yes, indeed.  I will 
ask the hon. member for Saint John to allow a couple of minutes 
for the member to respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>  Unlike members of the official 
opposition I will say yes because I do not have a problem 
listening to other people.  I will listen for a couple of 
minutes.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison:</B>  Madam Speaker, I guess there was a 
question in there somewhere.  I was touched to hear that the hon. 
member was hurt by the tone of debate in the last parliament, as 
the practitioner of some of the most vicious debate that I have 
ever heard in this place.  It brings to mind the old proverb of 
the pot calling the kettle black.  This is one for the books. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member mentioned that she will only get a pension of 
$17,000.  I do not know what she did wrong or why she will be 
punished.  Anyone else with her number of years of service would 
be getting $19,096.  Perhaps she was bad and they took away some 
of her money. 
<P><A NAME="LINK287"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, hon. members down the way and 
members of the Progressive Conservative Party seem to be 
suggesting somehow what Canadian Alliance members ran on in the 
last election as Reformers.  I have here a copy of our quick 
facts policy handbook for Reform Party candidates from the 1997 
election which says that a Reform government would abolish the MP 
pension plan and replace it with pensions comparable to those in 
the private sector.  That is our position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note that the Tories had a position.  They promised a 
privatized plan like those of other Canadians.  Yet they were in 
government from 1984 all the way to 1993.  They had a massive 
majority.  They could have changed the plan but they did not. 
Would my hon. colleague comment on that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison:</B>  Madam Speaker, my comment would be that 
between 1984 and 1993 the Tories could have done a lot of things 
that they did not do.  This is just a very small example.  They 
could have balanced the budget for openers, but all they did was 
whine about it after they finally got booted out. 
<P><A NAME="LINK288"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, as 
usual the comments of members of the official opposition do not 
surprise me, but I will inform them of what it was like in my 
riding when we were in government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we were in government we had 4,000 men working at our 
shipyard, contributing to our economy and educating their young 
people.  It was a beautiful time for our city.  We also had a 
sugar refinery which dates back to 1903 with over 300 men 
working.  It is closing at the end of this month.  We had VIA 
Canada with over 300 men working.  None of them had to go to the 
United States to work.  They had their dignity.  I have to say it 
was about the best time I had ever seen in Saint John, New 
Brunswick.  I have nothing negative to say about our people when 
they were in power.  They did an excellent job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read the comments that have been made.  People will never 
forget the comments made in the House of Commons about everyone 
who sits in the House and whether or not they will take a 
pension.  In the next election the comments that were made here 
will certainly be repeated.  There is no question about that, but 
they will be repeated by other parties.  They will remind the 
people of the statements that have been made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not what one does.  One does not rise in the House of 
Commons to say the derogatory things that were said about all 
other members.  I look at our members who have contributed so 
much to try to stabilize the foundation of our country for our 
young people.  Yet Reformers say we should never have a pension 
at age 55.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We lost one member of the House before she became 55 years of 
age.  All kinds of nasty things can be said but the people do not 
appreciate that.  The people do not want that and the people will 
never forgive members of the official opposition for the things 
they have said. 
<P><A NAME="LINK289"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I was one of the members who ran in 1993 and was 
defeated in 1993.  We have heard a lot about what happened at 
that time.  It was a split vote from the right.  The vote I 
achieved in 1988 which put me in office was split in 1993.  A big 
argument that was used to take the votes away from me was that 
the Reformers would not allow the pension plan to stay in place, 
that they would not participate in the pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was hammered with it day and night in that election campaign. 
Many Reform members gained their seats based on that argument. 
That was the sole, main or prime argument they used against 
members of parliament like me who had served one term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember it just like it was yesterday.  They accused me of 
coming back only for the pension.  I did not run in the first 
place for the pension.  I did not run in the second place for the 
pension.  It is part of being a member of parliament.  They 
hammered away at that and I lost my seat because the vote was 
split. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the hon. member could comment on another issue in 
that campaign, that members of parliament should be subject to 
recall if they do not honour their promises. Reform members at 
that time said they were not interested in participating in the 
pension and that they would do away with the pension.  I wonder 
if the member for Saint John would comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering that the former Reform Party members who are now 
Canadian Alliance members say that members of parliament should 
be subject to recall, does the hon. member for Saint John think, 
if Reform members accept the pension and vote to go into the 
pension again, they should be subject to recall?  That is the 
first part of my question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second part of my question is:  Does the member think that 
the leadership candidates for the Canadian Alliance Party should 
state their positions?  I propose that each candidate should 
state his position on the pension plan.  They should indicate 
whether or not they support the pension plan and whether or not 
they support members of the Canadian Alliance Party opting back 
into the plan and buying back their former service.  I wonder 
what her thoughts would be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>  Madam Speaker, I say to my hon. 
colleague that when it comes to the maritime provinces and 
Newfoundland we have absolutely nothing to worry about in the 
next election because the people will not vote for the official 
opposition.  The member does not even have to worry about that. 
The opposition got only 2% of the vote in Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should there be a recall?  Certainly there should be a recall if 
any one of them joins in the pension plan.  We should be watching 
that on both sides of the House.  We can look at the comments 
they made.  On November 2, 1999, they said that 34 Reform MPs, 
including all second term Reformers from Alberta, fought for, won 
and exercised the right to opt out of the MPs pension plan. 
However, reflecting on the difficulty of going without a pension 
does not mean any of these principled MPs have changed their 
minds.  In any event they could not legally opt back into the 
plan even if they wanted to at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They can opt into the plan now.  We certainly will be watching 
to see who opts in to the plan in view of the statements that 
have been made in the House about everyone else who has been part 
of the pension plan.

never got a pension after 18 years at the local level.  I never

pension.  I would not have dreamed that there was a pension. My 
hon. colleague asked me about the candidates who are running to 
be the leader of the Canadian Alliance. There is one and that is 
the person who was the leader of the Reform Party who stated just 
this week, and I believe it is in <I>Quorum</I>, that if he

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, tonight we have heard members of the Conservative Party 
talk about the two times the Reform Party reversed its position 
on issues.  One was to do with Stornoway and the other one, 
according to them, dealt with taking a car for the leader of the 
party.  They have dwelt on that and they have brought that up 
again and again yet in 1984 their party ran on balancing the 
budget and lowering taxes.  I remember it well because I voted 
for them in 1984.  They reversed their position on those issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member lay it out before the people of Canada as to 
how important she sees the issues are of taking a car and living 
in Stornoway as compared to the issues that her party reversed 
their position on?  That was the issue of balancing the budget. 
When they left they had a $42 billion deficit that year.  They 
ran on reducing the debt, but they more than tripled the debt in 
their nine years in office.  They ran on lowering taxes but they 
increased taxes more than 100 times in the nine years they were 
in office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member to clearly lay out for the Canadian 
public how she sees the importance of the Stornoway and the car 
issues compared to the importance of the issues they reversed 
their positions on, which was the issue of running a $42 billion 
deficit, the issue of tripling the debt during their nine years 
in power, and the issue of raising taxes which they did over 100 
times.  Would she very clearly lay out how she feels the 
importance of these issues relate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>   Madam Speaker, I know that the hon. 
member from the Canadian Alliance would like to change the 
subject to something dealing with the economy instead of dealing 
with whether or not they are going to take a pension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want the member to know that when Brian Mulroney became the 
Prime Minister there was a $39 billion debt that was left to him 
by Pierre Elliot Trudeau.  A $39 billion debt was left to the PC 
Party by Pierre Elliot Trudeau and no one even talks about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back in the maritimes there is no prayer for the Canadian 
Alliance because our people understand the different regions of 
Canada and that different needs in different regions must be 
addressed.  I look at the flip-flops that have come from members 
of the official opposition, and they even flip-flop on their own 
name.  They flip-flop on everything. They flipped out of the 
pension plan.  Now they would like to flip-flop back into the 
pension plan.  They flipped out from the Reform Party name and 
went to another name and I believe they said it was CCRAP.  We 
did not say it; they said it.  Now they are down to Canadian 
Alliance.  They are flip-flopping all over the place. The 
stability is gone. People have seen it and we know that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to the pension plan, certainly as our House leader 
stated tonight, we feel they should all have had a pension. 
Certainly they should have been in the pension plan.  There is no 
question about it.  There is no reason in the world for them not 
to be in it. We could change it so that no one gets a pension 
until a certain age.  It was 60 for me.  Now it is down to 55 and 
the majority of the people do not get one when they leave here.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been major changes that have come about.  In the 
class of 1988 the immediate pension was about $37,000.  Now the 
immediate pension is around $18,000 or $19,000. That is only 
since the class of 1993.  There have been major changes and 
people in all communities across the nation respect that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I would like to split my time with my colleague from 
Prince Albert. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot say that this is a great pleasure to speak on this bill 
because it is not.  Back in 1992 I had just finished serving six 
years on council and I did not get a pension after I left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I found out from talking to many people, as a person at the 
municipal level does, that there was great discomfort in the 
country about the fact that there had been successive deficits 
run for years and years.  We had managed to amass a $600 billion 
in debt, yet the members of parliament had rewarded themselves by 
giving themselves a pension plan that was not available to anyone 
else. It was a plan that was topped up by their employer six to 
one. For every dollar put in by the member, the taxpayers of 
Canada, the poor beleaguered people who had already been taxed 
into submission and into $600 billion worth of debt, had to fund 
the members of parliament pension plan six to one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not my idea to bring this to the Parliament of Canada. It 
was my constituents' idea.  When I sought this nomination, I 
thought that one of the things we would have to put a stop to was 
the runaway spending and the unnecessary taxation of people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will never forget the day when Don Mazankowski was the newly 
minted finance minister.  I had a lot of respect for that man and 
thought maybe he was someone who would give us a budget that was 
somewhere near balanced.  My hopes were dashed. I think his 
deficit that year was a meagre $22 billion.  At that point I said 
I had to get out of municipal politics and into federal politics 
because it was absolutely horrendous; I had children whom I hoped 
soon would have children and I was very concerned about the state 
of the nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What options do ordinary Canadians who pay taxes to this place 
have for retirement benefits?  If they are lucky and have any 
money left after tax, they can put a few dollars into an RRSP to 
pay taxes on at later date.  They do not have a pension plan.  I 
suggest that a lot of the people who came to this place from some 
other business did not have a pension plan. Now that they are 
here they say they have to have a pension plan, that someone else 
is paying for it, so why not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lot of talk about the changes which have taken place 
to this very plan.  It is extremely significant that there have 
been three bills in seven years to deal with it.  If it had not 
been for pressure put on by the former Reform Party, those 
changes very likely would never have taken place.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we came here we were the Reform Party.  We made some 
changes to the pension plan by putting the pressure on the 
government.  That is how that happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us see what people have available to them.  They have the 
famed, or is it fabled, CPP.  They have the Canada pension plan 
and for the low, low price of 10% of what they earn, they can 
enrol in it.  The premium will soon be 10%.  By 2003 that plan to 
which self-employed Canadians, and lots and lots of the people in 
my constituency are self-employed, will pay $3,270 per year for 
an annual pension of $8,800. That is a whopping $733 a month, and 
certainly they will have money left over from that to pay taxes, 
to make sure that members of parliament retire in the manner 
befitting members of parliament.  Would that be reasonable?  I 
think not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today it takes a record 20% of Canadians' average earnings just 
to pay their taxes.  In the small amount of time we have been 
here we have made changes to this plan.  Taxpayers were putting 
in $6 for every $1 a member put in.  It was six to one.  It has 
been reduced to $3.61 for every $1.  That is still pretty rich 
and it is still too rich for me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I concur with my colleagues that the only way to handle this is 
to put it to an independent arm's length group who will come in, 
assess the job and the fact that we have to spend time away from 
our families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard people down at the other end say, “We spend time 
away from our families.  We have to get on an airplane”.  Where 
did they think MPs went to work?  Did they not know they had to 
come to Ottawa to go to work?  Did they not know that the House 
sits 135 days a year?  Was this some surprise, that after 
election day they said, “Oh my God, I did not realize I had to 
go to Ottawa”.  Of course they have to go to Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are people out there who are struggling.  They do not know 
where their next paycheque is coming from and we are worried 
about a pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit that anybody who has the wherewithal to get themselves 
elected to this place should have some wherewithal to make a 
living once they leave here.  If they have not, how in the world 
did they ever get here?  I think every one of us has that 
wherewithal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a lot of talk that we co-operated with the 
government to bring in the bill. Yes, we did.  We did that so we 
would get an opportunity to talk to the bill.  If we had not 
co-operated with the House leader, he very likely would have 
brought it in anyway.  He very likely would have put closure on 
every aspect of the bill.  He very likely would have got his bill 
and we would not have had any say.  We would have looked totally 
complicit in the whole affair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to eat into my colleague's time because I know 
that he has things he wants to get on the agenda, too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of parliament have families and they do have to prepare 
for their golden years.  However, I would like to see a pension 
plan that is fair, one that is reasonable, one that is somewhere 
near the ones that my neighbours have.  My neighbours manage to 
get along just fine and they do not have a cheque arriving from 
the Government of Canada every month.

</I></B></P><P align=left>At no time have I ever said that members of parliament do not 
deserve a pension plan.  What they do deserve is a pension where 
they can hold their head up high and say that this pension is 
somewhere in the neighbourhood of what their neighbours, their 
friends and the people who fund this place have available to 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill, in my opinion, and the whole approach to the pension 
issue, is just one more reason that I believe this government 
should be sent packing.  We have heard people down at the other 
end say that there will be nobody who will vote for the Alliance 
Party. There will be people who vote for the Canadian Alliance. I 
want to put them on notice that an election is in the offing.  I 
am sure the Prime Minister is a man of his word.  He said that we 
can rely on having an election within a year's time. I would like 
to put the party down at the end of the hall on notice that a lot 
of them are not going to be here next time around.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, I have a question for the member 
for Wetaskiwin.  I have a bit of a theory about the Liberal House 
leader out on a fishing expedition and casting flies.  Lo and 
behold, a fly fell in front of the hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough and he leapt on it like a big 
trout.  He and his colleagues have been doing the work in this 
place of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of the House may have noticed, the government members 
have had nothing to say all night.  They have been sitting there 
smiling like Buddha while that group over there does their dirty 
work for them.  I think this a little delicious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member for Wetaskiwin if he believes 
that the other party, the fifth party, licking the hands of the 
hon. House leader for the government, is the shape of things to 
come? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston:</B>  Madam Speaker, if ever there was a 
loaded or leading question that would probably be it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If my hon. colleague from Cypress Hills—Grasslands truly 
expects me to answer that, we will have to have a beer and talk 
that one over in private.  I am not prepared to make statements 
like that in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question from my colleague does give me an opportunity to 
let him know that I do recall that when we first arrived here 
after the fall election of 1993, my good friend from Cypress 
Hills—Grasslands, my colleague from Prince George—Peace River 
and myself went over to pay and benefits.  We said that we wanted 
to get out of the pension plan.  The people in pay and benefits, 
after they had quit laughing and had picked themselves up off the 
floor, said that nobody gets out of this pension plan.  They said 
that there was no way for anyone to get out of the pension plan. 
They told us that we were in it and that was all there was to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a lot of talk tonight about all the Canadian 
Alliance members being in the pension plan.  I would just like to 
point out to you, Madam Speaker, and I know that you have a grasp 
on this, no one is vested in this plan until they have served six 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point, I do not think it is entirely accurate to say 
that the Canadian Alliance people are in the pension plan.  They 
are making contributions to a pension plan that will absolutely 
ruin their RRSP eligibility which will be all but taken up by the 
contributions to this registered plan.  Therefore, to say that 
all the Canadian Alliance members are in the plan is absolutely 
inaccurate.  There will be no more Canadian Alliance members in 
this plan than there are at the moment.  Members will only be in 
once they have served their six years.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I would like to talk a little bit about an image 
that comes to mind when we get to the debate about pay, pensions 
and things like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go back to the Trudeau years.  I did not pay too much 
attention to politics in those days, but we were into 
hyperinflation in some of those years.  All of a sudden, Trudeau, 
his cabinet and the Liberal Party slapped handcuffs on the wage 
aspirations of the average Canadian worker of 5% and 6%.  Can 
anybody in the House forget where they were the night that 
happened, when Trudeau sat there in his expensive suit with a 
flower in his lapel and locked us into 5% and 6% wage increases 
over the next couple of years?  Before he did that, he made big 
wage increases to two classes of people:  members of parliament 
and senators, and federal judges.  The political and judicial 
elite of Canada were exempt from the laws they made for every 
other person in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, could there be a little less cross-talk in the 
House so I can speak and be heard? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The hon. member is 
asking for a little silence as he makes his speech.  I suppose 
that it can be very disturbing, so I would ask hon. members to 
please respect that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Put a sock in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad:</B>  Thank you, Madam Speaker, for asking 
them, as my colleague said, to put a sock in it.  It is hard 
enough to speak here when these people are talking over what one 
is trying to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Trudeau era is the primary image I have of what happens when 
the political elite takes control of its own wages and benefits, 
and passes legislation that is not to the benefit of every other 
person in the country.  That is why this needs to be taken out of 
the hands of the political elite and given to an independent 
commission to make those kinds of recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that in those days maybe even the Trudeau Liberals 
could have been re-elected—if they had not done something like 
that—if they had put it in the hands of somebody else outside 
the system.  No, they made sure that their pocketbooks were good 
and thick at the expense of Canadian taxpayers who were held back 
at a time when they were losing their homes, farms, businesses 
and everything else as a result of inflation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk a little about the pain the PC Party down at the 
end of the building here seems to be feeling as a result of the 
MP pension issue.  Members of that party think they were defeated 
because of the MP pension plan.  They think that was the major 
issue in the last election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me tell the House that the last Conservative to be elected 
in my riding was John Diefenbaker.  No other Conservative has 
been elected since.  We have had Liberals but they were defeated 
because they did not happen to know there was a place called 
western Canada.  It was just where another automatic vote came 
from.  It was good-bye to Gordon Kirkby who was one of the 
primary architects of Bill C-68, the firearms legislation.  Prior 
to that it was a NDP member.  It has been back and forth as they 
searched for an alternative who would make a difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for Mr. Diefenbaker, most of his supporters, workers and 
campaigners are now members of the Canadian Alliance.  They came 
through the reform party.  They have had it with the Progressive 
Conservatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the many reasons why the antipathy toward the 
Conservative Party runs so deep, so longstanding and is so 
visceral.  It is based on a number of factors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national energy program instituted by the Liberals was 
supposed to be done away with immediately when Mulroney and the 
rest of the Conservatives were elected.  They left it in place 
for years and took billions more out of western Canada.  That is 
one good reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aircraft maintenance contract was taken from Winnipeg by 
force and transferred to Bombardier in Quebec by an act of 
cabinet after it was fairly awarded by a competitive contract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They wonder why they do not elect anybody in western Canada? Let 
them think about it:  the ongoing deficits, the spiralling debt, 
increasing taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Saskatchewan there was a bush league boondoggle called 
gigatext where they thought they could translate French 
into English and English into French just by pushing a button. 
The only button that was pushed was the voters of Saskatchewan 
who awarded the Progressive Conservative Party roughly 7% in the 
last election.  I do not think it got much more in the previous 
election.  It had nothing to do with MP pensions.  It had to do 
with the things that I have just mentioned.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Added to that were ongoing, well documented excesses and 
scandals.   There is a book written about it, <I>On The Take</I> 
that most of us have read if we are from Saskatchewan.  In case 
the Progressive Conservatives are under any misapprehensions, 
they should read the text of what I have said tomorrow and they 
will understand why they have no voice, no members and no 
representation in western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting away from the historical aspects, we had an opportunity 
to do it right by adopting the recommendations of the Blais 
Commission report last time. That was rejected out of hand by 
the government, which is a total waste of more tax dollars.  We 
could have converted the non-taxable allowance to taxable and put 
the pension on a commercial basis, but we lost the opportunity. 
This is just another example of a process that is flawed when it 
is in the hands of MPs.  It needs to be taken out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance is governed by its members meeting in 
biennial assemblies and they set the policy.  We are just asked 
to implement policy.  I think it is rather a good idea.  They get 
to set the stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some parties have a policy similar to ours but they have zero 
chance of bringing it into effect.  What is the purpose of having 
a policy if we cannot bring it into effect?  For instance, the 
NDP wants Canadians to elect 20 of them so they can be the 
conscience of parliament.  Big deal.  When have the Liberals or 
the Conservatives ever listened to their conscience?  Why would 
anybody elect a party like that or any of its members?  For 
goodness sakes, that is just too much to hope for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I abstained from the previous vote to send the bill to second 
reading.  I will be opposing the bill in the upcoming vote. 
<P><A NAME="LINK294"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
have a simple question relating to the reform platform.  There 
are some aspects of it that I actually agree with from time to 
time, especially on tax policy and the need to lower taxes and 
pay down the debt.  Those are the kinds of things where a broader 
Conservative consensus can be built some time in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One aspect that I am curious about is the issue of recall.  How 
many signatures are required under the reform formula for recall? 
If we could obtain those signatures on this particular issue, 
would reform respect that petition? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad:</B>  Madam Speaker, as the hon. member is 
well aware, there is no reform policy any more because we are now 
members of the Canadian Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did make a commitment to my voters that if a majority of them 
got together and recalled in a petition, which has not happened 
by the way, then I would honour it.  I think that is the best 
answer I can give the hon. member.  Until a party becomes 
government it cannot implement recall.  I am quite sure that if a 
recall policy had been in effect in the last years of the 
Mulroney government, we would not have had to put up with so many 
years of mismanagement by the Tory Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad to hear that the Conservatives agree with our taxation 
policies.  That is important but it is only half the game.  There 
is parliamentary reform, which they are not interested in, and a 
whole list of things that need to be dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  Madam Speaker, I just want to explore 
this issue a little further.  We do have some concurrence on how 
we grow an economy by paying down debt and lowering taxes, so we 
do agree on that side of the equation. 
On the parliamentary reform aspect of things, he said I did not 
have any interest.  I am trying to get more interested as 
we speak.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that regard, the question is quite simple.  How many 
signatures under the Reform formula that exists, which now 
represents individuals from the Canadian Alliance, are required 
to have a recall on any particular issue?  How many signatures 
are required to do that?  That is my question.  It is a direct 
question.  What is the number of signatures required for a recall 
under the platform on which the hon. member ran? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad:</B>  Madam Speaker, I wish I had the blue 
book with me.  I believe it is about 25%, but he is asking for an 
absolute figure.  If we are talking percentages we cannot give an 
absolute number because numbers in ridings continue to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know, but maybe he is interested in recall because 
someone in his riding is planning to start a campaign against 
him, or something to that effect.  He is afraid people are going 
to ask why he does not pay attention to the previous Reform Party 
policies so that they can get rid of him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For me, it is no worry.  Nobody is that unhappy with me as their 
member of parliament.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, the member of the Conservative Party brought forward the 
issue of recall in a way that he seems to think is somewhat 
threatening to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the member for Prince Albert directly, if this 
government were to bring in a bill tomorrow on recall, would he 
support that bill? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad:</B>  Madam Speaker, that is a hypothetical 
question which does not require an answer, I am sure to say, 
because the government would never do such a thing.  If the 
Canadian Alliance did it, yes, I would support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rather doubt whether we would ever see such a piece of 
legislation coming from any other party in the House, but the 
answer is yes. 
<P><A NAME="LINK296"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to make some remarks in the 
debate this evening.  The course I will take in terms of the 
presentation I will make over the next number of minutes will 
reflect on the comments that I made in last night's debate.  I 
will speak very much to the politics of this particular issue, 
more so than to the substance of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it would be wrong for me to stand and accuse members of 
the CA, the party formerly known as Reform, of being people 
without principles because I clearly know that is not the case. 
They are individuals who believe in their country and they want 
to make a better country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The energy of the debate comes from the stunts, the antics, the 
rhetoric, the visceral attacks that members of the former Reform 
Party make against numerous members of parliament.  I could refer 
to the Minister of the Environment.  They chose to put that 
individual's picture on a billboard with one of Canada's most 
horrendous mass murderers to illustrate an issue with respect to 
the feint hope clause, section 745. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was done not only by Reform candidates.  To be fair, it was 
also done by a special interest group.  The point is, no one 
deserves to be put on a billboard or to be subjected to that kind 
of tactic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can also point to the stunts they pulled on the House of 
Commons lawn, where they actually had replicas of pigs to 
represent parliamentarians feeding from the trough.

<A HREF="#LINKT140"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also remember the stunts that they pulled with respect to 
giving away the keys to a car which was meant for the leader of a 
political party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. members for West Nova and 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough and I in my riding of 
Fundy—Royal like to play bingo.  It is an institution that 
exists very much in rural Canada.  I know that my constituents 
who have pensions play bingo.  Bingo cannot be played in 
Stornoway, as the member for Calgary Southwest advocated, because 
it was not turned into a bingo parlour.  It is now the home of 
the Leader of the Official Opposition.  Reform members made a 
stunt out of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also said that they did not need a chauffeur, but now the 
member for Edmonton North has a chauffeur driving her car.  Those 
are the stunts and the language these members choose to use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My comments are made in tribute to principled individuals who 
sat in the Progressive Conservative government between 1984 and 
1993, individuals who lost their seats because they were attacked 
with that same kind of rhetoric.  Some of these comments may be 
applicable today, but they would be against their own internal 
mechanism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Calgary Southeast commented in the Vancouver 
<I>Sun</I> that MPs who opt back in are liars or hypocrites.  He 
went on to refer to one member of parliament who had opted in. 
He said that he had told the voters he was opting out and that he 
had broken his word. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leader of the party formerly known as Reform said in 
September 1995 “Canadians will know which MPs are greedy and 
which really care about taxpayers.  Believe me, the voters won't 
soon forget those MPs who promised integrity in government but 
decided to pig-out while the trough was still full”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is this sort of visceral attack that actually precipitated a 
fair amount of the energy of the debate we have before us at this 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 28, 1995 the former leader of the Reform Party 
stated “It is the intention of Reform MPs to opt out of the MP 
pension plan.  We call upon every other member of the House to do 
likewise.  Opt out or get out will be the cry in the 
constituencies.  It is a cry which must be respected if fairness 
and leadership by example and integrity are to be restored to 
parliament and any budget it endorses”.  Those comments were 
made by the member for Calgary Southwest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the big picture issues that Canadians are concerned 
about?  They are concerned about the fact that we still have a 
$600 billion national debt.  We owe it to every young person and 
future generations to pay down the national debt in a very 
deliberate way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also owe it to the Canadian economy so that we can maintain 
our place in the world.  We must address the fact that we have 
the second highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world 
as a percentage of our economy and the highest personal income 
tax rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the issues Canadians want us to talk about in this 
place.  Instead, time and time again we have ratcheted up the 
rhetoric using the kinds of quotes I just read.  They are very 
visceral attacks made in the course of campaigns for crass 
political gain. 
That is the issue that we have before us.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A few weeks ago in my riding the member for Edmonton North said 
“We are going to send the member for Saint John, the member for 
New Brunswick Southwest and the member for Fundy—Royal home 
after the next election whether they receive their pension or 
not”.  The fact is, there is not one poll to substantiate the 
fact that they would even have one iota of a chance of winning a 
seat in Atlantic Canada.  The point is, they were still willing 
to use the pension card only a few days ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very happy to celebrate my nomination, at which there was 
a very articulate speaker.  Bernard Lord is one of the youngest 
and most dynamic leaders that we have in this country.  As the 
Premier of New Brunswick he has done some very special things in 
his first year in government.  He has been able to lower taxes, 
balance the budget and put more money into priorities such as 
health care and education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased that he had a chance to speak at that 
nomination meeting, which was attended by 300 people.  All eight 
MLAs were either there in person or sent letters of endorsement. 
A couple of cabinet ministers attended.  More importantly, 300 
grassroots members came to support and endorse that campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to pay tribute to my president, Glen Baxter, whom I 
regard as one of the strongest presidents of any political party 
in the country, for putting together such a positive event. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What that illustrates is that with all eight riding associations 
supporting my campaign provincially, all eight MLAs, we know that 
we will be very strong in the riding of Fundy—Royal the next 
time around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate that we have before us today gives us a chance to 
illustrate the stunts of sombrero dances against the Senate, 
visceral attacks against a great Albertan, Ron Ghitter, the 
stunts with respect to the car, Stornoway, the pension plan and 
the changing of the party name. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of these stunts come down to one issue.  I refer to the 
comment which came from across the way from the parliamentary 
secretary for heritage.  He said that they were going to do 
politics differently, in a more mature fashion.  What Canadians 
have witnessed on numerous occasions over these last seven years 
has been exactly the opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not taint all members of the Canadian Alliance or Reform, 
but the fact is, that is what they did.  They assailed our 
leaders.  They assailed people like Brian Mulroney, who was the 
prime minister between 1984 and 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were very quick to point out that the economy was in a 
worldwide downturn, but they went at it as if we were the only 
country not to have a balanced budget during that era.  Margaret 
Thatcher was a Conservative.  She had some of the same challenges 
in Great Britain.  I do not know if they would attack Ronald 
Reagan or George Bush in the same way, but they faced the same 
challenges over that timeframe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They forget to comment on the fact that the Progressive 
Conservative Party from 1984 to 1993 was indeed a prosperity 
builder.  It was able to upgrade our trade with the Americans 
from around $100 billion each and every year to over $320 
billion.  That is why we have growth in our economy today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the issues that Canadians need to hear and talk about. 
That is the legacy that we need to point out.  The debate comes 
down to one issue:  the visceral attacks, almost hatred, being 
uttered by so many of those members. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2245"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not repeat the comments that were uttered time and time 
again in yesterday's debate. But we should probably take the lead 
from the House leader of the Canadian Alliance when he said, “We 
have no one to blame for this but ourselves.  This is a bit of a 
dilemma of our own making.  Let us not kid ourselves”.  My 
comment to the members of the alliance is if they sincerely want 
to do politics differently, if they sincerely want to build a 
broader coalition of conservative voters, they have to do one 
thing and that is to tell the truth and apologize for the stunts 
and the antics which they performed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party has taken the time to speak 
here tonight to point out the hypocrisy that was demonstrated by 
those members.  A good number of them are now choosing to 
participate in the pension plan.  I do not begrudge them 
believing they should have some kind of compensatory regime upon 
retirement.  I will even tip my hat and say that the pension plan 
is more palatable to Canadians currently because we cannot 
collect it until we are 55, that of the amount of contribution 
dollars required there is a higher input from members than from 
the taxpayer.  I will tip my hat to the Canadian Alliance for 
helping moving the yardstick and helping to correct the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the issue of concern here is that they have an awful lot of 
crow to eat.  There is the pensions, the bingo hall, the car 
keys, the chauffeur.  In the election of 2000 or 2001 the voters 
will remember this issue more than anybody can imagine. 
<P><A NAME="LINK297"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I might suggest coming from a House leader, I think we 
could probably wind up this debate.  I want to make a few 
comments to capsulize what we have been saying with regard to 
Bill C-37. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To remind people who may be channel surfing and watching this 
ordeal, Bill C-37 is an act to amend the Parliament of Canada Act 
and the Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act. Being a 
former educator, I think it is important to lay out what the 
debate is all about in such a fashion that the Canadian viewers 
understand.  From time to time we tend to get off track to make 
our point and I am no exception. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will allow members of parliament who opted out of the 
pension plan to get back in.  This is the third go around for 
what was formerly known as the Reform Party. Those members have 
basically swallowed themselves whole.  I have used that 
expression a couple of times tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of that party, as my hon. friend mentioned, railed 
against pensions for years until they came to this place. Many of 
them got elected on that issue.  There are other issues and we 
concede that, but many of them got elected on that issue because 
it was a popular thing to say, only to find out that once they 
were here it does put limitations on what they can do back home 
in terms of a business and what they can do in the future when 
they leave this place.  They have suddenly realized they might 
need it.  They actually conceded that last night in the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How this was brought about was there were secret meetings on 
this issue between the House leader of the Canadian Alliance, 
formerly known as the Reform Party, and the government House 
leader. 
They did it behind closed doors.  They were pressured by members 
of the Canadian Alliance to do something about the state of their 
pensions because obviously they had since found out that they may 
need a little bit of a safety net when they leave this place, 
understandably.  They had to do it in such a fashion that it 
would not appear that they were pushing that agenda. They were 
pretty clever at it.  They almost succeeded until our party 
decided to rail against it and vote against it, which we did.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whatever twisted logic the CA wants to use in terms of our 
position, it just ain't going to work.  The fact is we will vote 
against the bill in the way in which it was brought about. It was 
brought about by secret meetings between the House leader of the 
former Reform Party and the government House leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The <I>National Post</I> tells it just about as well as anybody 
else in its June 13, 2000 edition.  That would be today's, almost 
yesterday's edition by now.  The headline reads, “Grit pension 
plan ploy divides alliance” and goes on to say, “Bill prompts 
party to drop hardline stance against system it has often 
attacked”. Our House leader often refers to the <I>National 
Post</I> as the Reform Party daily bugle, I guess with a little 
sense of humour to be fair.  This capsulizes what we are talking 
about tonight.  That is why we have been up on our feet so much 
on this. The <I>National Post</I> article said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The pension bill, introduced in the dying days of Parliament's 
spring session, also allows dozens of Alliance MPs who were 
elected as Reformers in 1993 to “buy back” years of forgone 
contributions to the plan. The party which once threatened MPs 
with punishment for joining the plan has apparently dropped its 
opposition.  Its MPs agreed to give unanimous consent to the 
tabling of the legislation last night, which ensures its speedy 
passage through the House of Commons before Parliament's spring 
session ends this week. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They did exactly that.  They gave unanimous consent to push the 
bill through the House truly without debate.  They did not want a 
debate on it. They did not want to vote on it.  They did not want 
members to express their feelings on it, as we are doing tonight. 
I would say it was a conspiracy of silence on their part.  They 
simply wanted to slide it through in the dying days of this 
session, which in fact they have done on a couple of occasions, 
pressuring the government to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has a legitimate interest in this as well.  We do 
not want to deny that.  But the fact is that MPs were left 
outside of the process. Again this is to educate the people back 
home. Hopefully as the final speaker we can get a sense of what 
is actually happening.  We will not deviate onto the national 
debt and past history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill was laid on the desks of members of parliament one-half 
hour before we came into this place last night.  That rarely 
happens unless the government is trying to push something through 
quickly without debate.  That is what it is attempting to do with 
the help of the Reform Party.  There was unanimous consent to 
push it through, ram it through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is complex.  Tonight in the House of Commons the 
minister responsible for this bill, the hon. government House 
leader, who is still here with us to give him credit, had three 
officials with him, three technical advisers to explain to him 
what the bill is about if he got questions from the floor of the 
House of Commons.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill was laid on our desks one-half hour before it was 
debated.  There was no opportunity to review it or to get any 
kind of consultation or advice on it. The House leader tonight 
had the audacity to say, “We are going to pass this bill and you 
people will have an opportunity to ask these officials exactly 
what you want to know about it.  Let us get it through the House 
of Commons”.  That is truly what he said tonight, let us get it 
through the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to quote from the bill, just to give an idea of how 
complex it is.  We have to go back into a lot of past history and 
bills that preceded this to truly understand it. I am reading 
from page 1 of the bill.  Listen to this: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 1(1)(70)(4) of the Parliament of Canada Act is replaced 
by the following: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(4)  Subject to subsections (4.1) and (5), the severance 
allowance to be paid to or in respect of a person under 
subsection (1) or (2) shall be a lump sum amount equal to 50% of 
the aggregate of 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a)  the sessional allowance under section 55; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b)  any salary or allowance under section 60, 61 or 62 of this 
act or section 4 or 5 of the Salaries Act. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That tells us exactly the complexity of this bill.  And it was 
laid on the desk of every member of parliament minutes before it 
was going to be introduced and debated.  They did not want 
debate.  We have to remember that.  They did not want debate on 
this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has to be known when this bill is read is that the 
Reformers are now in the pension plan.  They have achieved 
exactly what they wanted to do.  They have done it by stealth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last night the Canadian Alliance House leader spoke in this 
House.  To quote from the <I>Hansard</I> of Monday, June 12, he 
said, “We have to vote on this issue”.  He was talking about 
the bill in question here. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will have to move on it and defend it and explain it.  All of 
the speeches and all of the debate will give people confidence 
that members of parliament have applied themselves to this 
thoughtfully and have come to a conclusion collectively. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the member for Fraser Valley who happens to be the House 
leader for the Canadian Alliance.  He went on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very unfortunate that those of us who have remained out of 
the pension plan have run that gauntlet and, as I said earlier, 
have reaped what we have sown. We had hoped that by staying out 
of the plan we could press for a more modest and acceptable plan 
but alas, it was not to be. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to talk about the Blais commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The <I>National Post</I> actually picked up on part of what he 
had to say.  He is basically saying they railed against this in 
1993; they railed against it for almost 10 years, actually long 
before 1993 leading up to the 1993 election.  The House leader of 
the Canadian Alliance, the member for Fraser Valley said, “We 
have no one to blame for this but ourselves.  This is a bit of a 
dilemma of our own making”. Imagine.  He was being quite modest, 
“This is a bit of a dilemma of our own making.  Let us not kid 
ourselves”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He got up in the House tonight and 24 hours has given him enough 
time to spin his story.  As the member for Winnipeg—Transcona 
said tonight, it is almost unbelievable that the same House 
leader of the Canadian Alliance allowed his party to give 
unanimous consent to push this bill through without debate. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2300"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT145"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, after 24 hours of reflection and probably getting some 
calls from back home, he has completely flip-flopped on his 
position. It has basically allowed him to massage the message 
that he was giving last night.  Although every one of them 
unanimously consented to ram the legislation through the House, 
they stood in their places tonight and voted against it.  They 
want to have the best of both worlds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have received a note from my House leader which says that 
Reformers are in an suspended existence of purgatory, caught 
between the devil and the deep blue sea: what they said to get 
elected and what they truly want and desire.  They now walk 
softly and avoid the big stick with which they like to club other 
members of the House.  That is pretty good humour, but does it 
not tell the whole story about exactly what they are attempting 
to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That pretty well winds it up from our point of view.  They truly 
have swallowed themselves whole.  That is the long and the short 
of it.  I think the Canadian people have basically figured them 
out.  They have attempted everything.  We have talked about some 
of the things they have attempted to do in terms of watering down 
their policies, trying to broaden the base of their party, 
changing the name of their party, and so on and so forth.  We 
could go on and on forever on some of the things they have 
attempted to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth is they wanted this to slide through the House in the 
dying days of this session without any opposition.  They 
conspired secretly with the House leader of the Liberal Party to 
make this happen.  In terms of the cynicism that is sometimes 
expressed about the way this place works, that is living proof of 
it.  The House leader of the government does not have a lot to be 
proud of.  Certainly the House leader of the CA has nothing much 
to brag about on the particular bill.  It is a sad day for 
parliament when we see a display of arrogance like we have seen 
in the last couple of days.  On that note, I rest my case. 
<P><A NAME="LINK298"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, I have a few comments to make and 
hopefully the hon. member will keep his comments short.  I know a 
couple of my colleagues would like to have some time during the 
10 minute question and comment to make some comments about the 
hon. member's intervention.  He raised a number of issues during 
his intervention.  If I can understand where he was going with 
it, one was— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  He wasn't going anywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  One of my colleagues says “He wasn't going 
anywhere”.  During the committee of whole process he said that 
he did not have an opportunity to direct questions to the 
officials or to the hon. government House leader.  Anybody who 
has been watching the debate tonight at home and anybody who has 
been participating in the Chamber knows that is rubbish, as one 
of my colleagues said.  The hon. member used the majority of that 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had one hour in committee of the whole during which 
opposition members and members of the government could ask 
questions pertaining to the bill of the minister responsible, in 
this case the government House leader, and the officials he has 
asked to be present.  The hon. member used 20 minutes or 25 
minutes of that time to rant and rail against the Canadian 
Alliance.  Anybody watching the debate saw that.  He had lots of 
time to put questions to the officials or to the government House 
leader, yet he chose not to do so.  That is the first fallacy in 
what he stated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  When bills are brought forth in the House they are 
normally sent to a parliamentary committee where they are 
scrutinized and Canadians participate, as opposed to being sent 
to committee of the whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I am afraid the hon. 
member is into debate right now.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Madam Speaker, as you correctly pointed 
out, even though it is eleven o'clock at night that certainly was 
not a point of order.  The hon. member knew it before he rose in 
his place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second assertion of the hon. member from New Brunswick was 
that somehow my House leader, the member for Fraser Valley, and 
the Canadian Alliance had an opportunity to spin their story. Let 
us look at who is spinning what story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member represents a party that had a massive majority 
government between the years 1984 and 1993.  If I am not 
mistaken, the father of his House leader, the hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, was a member of that government 
for a portion of that time as a cabinet minister.  These 
individuals in the Progressive Conservative caucus are somehow 
trying to point the finger during this debate.  They had a 
majority government for nine years.  At that time they promised 
the Canadian people a privatized pension plan like those used by 
other Canadians.  They had a massive majority government for nine 
years and did nothing to change the MP pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since we were elected in 1993 we have tried for seven years to 
bring about changes to this plan, and we are in opposition.  We 
have tried everything we can including opting out of the plan to 
draw public attention to what we believe is an unfair plan.  We 
have tried to get changes that we all can participate in.  We 
have tried to get a plan that we can all participate in, hold our 
heads up, look at ourselves in the mirror, and participate in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservatives were in government between 1984 
and 1993.  They had a massive majority, indeed the largest 
majority in Canadian history.  They had 212 of the 285 seats and 
they never changed the pension plan.   They have the audacity to 
stand and attack others who have tried to change it.  They should 
be ashamed of themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Madam Speaker, I hate to say it but I 
think I am getting under the hon. member's skin.  I certainly 
would not want to do that.  This is the famous old bait and 
switch tactic.  He wants to get us off the topic.  The truth is 
that they are attempting to spin their story and they are not 
succeeding.  The truth is they conspired with the government 
House leader to sneak the bill into the House of Commons in the 
dying days of this session.  That is what they attempted to do 
and they will not get away with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason for that is pretty simple.  Now that they are going 
into an election they realize they have been here long enough to 
be pensionable.  Most of them have been here at least six or 
seven, going on eight years.  They realize they need a little 
safety net for themselves.  They are saying they may not run as 
Reformers so they do not really care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All they want is to get locked into a pension in some fashion 
even though they railed against it for the two terms they have 
been here.  When they leave, when they wave goodbye as one of 
them is doing now, they will have the golden parachute, the thing 
they railed against. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what is getting under their skin.  They have truly 
flip-flopped on this issue as they have on every other issue 
including changing the name of the party.  They went from being a 
party that would bring in the west.  Its rallying cry was that it 
would let the west into this thing called Confederation because 
the west wanted in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that they are courting with Bay Street, the big blue machine 
in Ontario and Tom Long.  They risk losing their party to the 
very people they railed against.  They are going from a western 
based party to a Bay Street party, from a populous party to a 
corporate board party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime they will do whatever they have to do to land on 
their feet back home.  If it means a safety net that is fine. 
They might have railed against it, but the fact is that is what 
they want and that is what they will get.  They conspired with 
the government to move this through the House very quietly, very 
silently.  Unfortunately some of us stood up on our hind legs and 
railed against exactly that type of manoeuvring.

his House leader was involved in those discussions.

is a point of order.

nonsense and he knows it.  Again he is attempting to find a 
scapegoat as they normally attempt to do on any issue they are 
not comfortable with.  The truth of the matter is that his House 
leader conspired in secret with the House leader of the 
government to bring their members into a pension plan which they 
railed against for 10 years of their elected life.  That is the 
sad reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about a simple plan that no other member of 
parliament including House leaders were involved in.  We have 
always made pretty clear where we stand on pensions, as do the 
NDP and for the most part the Liberals.  They conspired with the 
House leader of the government to bring this about very quietly 
in the dying days of this session of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of

hon. member used is parliamentary.  I do not believe you will

our reference book the word is not considered unparliamentary, 
especially in that context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Madam Speaker, that was a great ruling 
and I appreciate it.  I just want to remind the House of one 
thing.  CA members said that they would never take a pension, 
that pigs would fly first.  All I can say is that there is a lot 
of pork in the air tonight.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to mention that the hon. member for Cypress 
Hills—Grasslands suggested during his remarks that the bill 
represented a carcass which is being dug up for the third time by

suggest that it was a herd of pigs which was digging up this 
carcass for the third time, or hogs as the case may be.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a serious matter and it rests with a very basic 
principle that ought to govern our affairs, the simple principle 
of fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fairly well known in these environs that I have a long, 
outspoken record on this issue as former president of the 
Canadian Taxpayers Federation.  The hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough earlier suggested that in fact it 
was the reform party that was responsible for making issues, such 
as extraordinarily generous parliamentary perks and pensions, 
issues in the past.  No.  I think that citizens advocacy 
organizations, such as the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, can 
take the lion's share of the credit for having amplified public 
concern about the double standard to which parliamentarians here 
and in the provincial legislatures had begun to treat themselves 
through the 1980s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us just revisit the history because we have heard various 
comments from various shrill members of the regional fringe party 
to my extreme left, the fifth party.  We have heard all sorts of 
huing and crying this evening about the parliamentary pension 
plan.  In that process, I have not heard a single word of 
contrition or humility from that party which was reduced to two 
seats, in large part because of the overstuffed attitude and 
arrogance of its former government, which was typified by its 
unrelenting defence of a then platinum-plated pension plan that 
provided pensions of $6.50 for every dollar provided by the 
parliamentarian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those members seemed to have remembered everything but to have 
learned nothing from their experience in government.  One of the 
things they seem to have forgotten is that Canadians were 
disgusted with the party that refused to accept the simple 
principle of fairness.  I have heard them stand in this place all 
night long and criticize this party and Canadians for wanting a 
fair pension plan that operates on a self-funding, dollar for 
dollar, actuarially sound basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The history of this is that before the early 1970s there was no 
pension remuneration for members of parliament.  I hear some 
defenders of the status quo ante often say that if we do not 
provide super rich benefits far in addition to what one could 
expect in the private sector, that we will not be able to attract 
high calibre parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think most Canadians would suspect that before the days of 
great largesse, in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, before the 
gold-plated pension plan was introduced, we had some pretty sound 
public servants working in this Chamber on behalf of Canadians. 
To suggest that these benefits, at the levels introduced in the 
1980s, are necessary to attract talent, I think is rather 
specious.  In fact, there seems to be a direct inverse 
relationship between the generosity of pension benefits and the 
quality of members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was in the early 1980s that the then Liberal government 
introduced a pension plan with a 5% accrual rate at its maximum 
generosity.  It was shortly thereafter that we had nearly 200 
Tory members of parliament in this place, supposedly attracted by 
that generous benefit, who decided to double the country's 
national debt, double federal spending, increase taxes 72 times 
and help bring about the longest and most painful recession in 
post-depression history.  Boy, did we not get our money's worth 
by juicing up those benefits to attract those Tories to this 
place, benefits for which they still shamelessly apologize? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to say that members of the former Reform Party stood 
on principle in the lead-up to the 1993 election and thereafter 
by the principle of fairness when they said, as we do today in 
the Canadian Alliance, that members of parliament and public 
servants ought not to be given access to benefits, pensions or 
remuneration that is any more generous than what is available to 
ordinary working Canadians.  That is a very simple principle.  It 
ought not to be difficult to understand but it seems to be for 
the regional party on my extreme left.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out that what the Canadian Alliance policy stands 
for is to allow an independent commission to determine the 
compensation for members of parliament so that it removes us from 
this intolerable conflict in which we are placed every time a 
bill such as this is brought before the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, we see that virtually every province has undergone a 
major overhaul of their compensation packages for MLAs, MPPs, 
MNAs and so forth.  For instance, the provinces of Saskatchewan, 
Manitoba, British Columbia, Ontario and, I believe, New Brunswick 
have all trashed their old, gold-plated, unfunded, actuarially 
unsound, taxpayer subsidized pension plans and replaced them with 
what our party has long advocated, which is a simple dollar for 
dollar, actuarially sound, money purchase style pension plan, the 
kind of plan available to all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the current plan do that this legislation maintains? 
It creates and perpetuates a defined benefit pension plan that 
provides for benefits far in excess of what the MP contributions 
plus matching government contributions could possibly fund. It is 
a recipe for an unfunded, future liability, otherwise known as a 
taxpayer IOU, an IOU which will be picked up by future taxpayers. 
How does it do this?  It does this because it has in it a 4% 
benefit accrual rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members of the regional party on my left do not seem to 
understand how this pension operates.  In fact, I heard the member 
for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough completely disingenuously and 
shamelessly suggest that the one time severance package brought 
in in the last legislation was somehow comparable to the generous 
benefits under the current pension plan before us this evening. 
That is totally facetious and completely inaccurate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a 4% benefit accrual rate.  What does that mean?  That 
is a technical term, so let me explain it.  The Income Tax Act of 
Canada has certain limits for what constitute registered pension 
plans.  Registered pension plans are those to which contributions 
by employers and employees are tax deductible. There is a certain 
maximum that the Income Tax Act creates in terms of the 
generosity for registered pension plans.  The maximum benefit 
accrual rate under the Income Tax Act is 2%.  This is a 4% plan. 
In other words, the benefits are twice as rich as the income tax 
allows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Tories love it.  We hear them rushing to the defence of 
that system.  Fortunately, because of the efforts of my 
colleagues in this party and the Reform Party in the last 
parliament, the benefits were slightly modified from a 5% accrual 
rate to a 4% accrual rate and certain other peripheral changes 
occurred, such as an increase of the age of vesting to 55 and a 
certain restriction on the practice known as double dipping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By and large, this plan is not an actuarially sound plan.  It is 
a plan that is available to fewer than 2% of Canadians.  In fact, 
it is so extraordinarily generous that the government in this 
legislation must actually go outside of the Income Tax Act to top 
up the contributions that are not tax deductible.  This is 
essentially twice as generous as the average defined benefit plan 
available to Canadians in the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston:</B>  By law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Yes, by law.  The legislatures of 
British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and other 
provinces looked at these unfunded, actuarially unsound pensions 
and they decided that they would bring in the same fair dollar 
for dollar money contribution plans that would be fully funded. 
Guess what they did? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Jordan:</B>  Mike Harris got $1 million when they 
closed that pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  They trashed the defined benefit plan 
and introduced a defined contribution plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Jordan:</B>  Ernie Eves got $850,000.  You are full 
of nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  The member across the floor points out 
that the members of the Ontario legislature, in the process of 
converting from a gold-plated, defined benefit pension plan to a 
self-funding defined contribution plan, received a certain lump 
sum payment to be invested into an annuity. He is absolutely right. 
They invested that money into an annuity and the money that went 
into that annuity is a fraction of the defined benefits they 
would have been paid through the unfunded liability.  Mike Harris 
did what was fiscally responsible.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish the members of the regional party on my extreme left 
would follow the example of Mike Harris or Gary Filmon on this 
issue, or of Ralph Klein who followed the leadership of the 
reform party in moderating these benefits and putting them on the 
same level that average Canadians expect and anticipate.  Yes, 
they got an annuity, the annuity being a fraction of the benefits 
that would have been paid to them under the old status quo ante. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point that we raise here is one of simple fairness.  Why 
could we not simply have introduced and passed in legislation the 
recommendations of the Blais Commission.  Honest, hardworking 
Canadians volunteered, such as a former colleague, Ray Speaker, to 
sit on the Blais Commission, look at parliamentary compensation 
and determine what would be fair by analyzing the workload and 
responsibilities of members of parliament and senators and 
comparing those responsibilities to compensation packages in the 
private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commission came up with some very sensible recommendations, 
first among which was to take the defined benefit plan we have 
now, the actuarially unsound plan, and convert it into a 
self-funding, dollar for dollar, standard pension plan, the type 
of which has been adopted in Ontario and several other provinces. 
That was the Blais Commission's recommendation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government, instead of accepting the recommendations of that 
hardworking, thoughtful and objective independent commission, 
decided that it was going to continue with the status quo. 
Incidentally, that commission also recommended that we eliminate 
the completely odious practice of allowing MPs to hide a portion 
of their income and shelter it from taxes.  Elected officials, alone 
amongst Canadians, are allowed, through a special provision in the 
Income Tax Act, to exempt one-third of their ordinary income from 
the same taxes that we impose upon Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a private member's bill that would eliminate the 
so-called tax free expense allowances which, of course, are 
effectively a proportion of our salary, and make that money fully 
taxable.  This would create full transparency so that Canadian 
taxpayers could see what they are actually paying their members 
of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Blais Commission made the same recommendation that we 
eliminate the tax free status proportion of our income and gross 
it up for full transparency.  However, again the government decided it 
did not want Canadians to see what we are actually being paid. It 
does not want Canadians to see that the $21,000 tax free 
allowance is actually worth about 40,000 pre-tax gross dollars. 
It does not want Canadians to see that so it ignored the 
recommendations of the Blais Commission on issue after issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the government continue to put us in this conflict of 
interest position?  It makes absolutely no sense to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I voted against this bill at second reading because it fails to 
implement the recommendations of the Blais Commission.  It fails 
to live up to the spirit of fairness that has swept the 
legislatures of this country which have reformed their 
legislative compensation packages.  It also fails to simply 
respect the basic principle of fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make it absolutely clear, as a former president of the 
Canadian Taxpayers Federation and somebody who has raised the 
issue of fairness, that I for one have never advocated that 
parliamentarians or legislators in Canada ought to have no 
retirement benefits.  Quite to the contrary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember appearing before committees in this place in the last 
parliament as a lay witness and suggesting the kind of pension 
plan that Canadians would accept, the sort that has been 
adopted by the various provincial legislatures, a defined 
contribution, completely actuarially sound pension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I never suggested as president of that organization that any 
member of parliament be required to opt out of the pension plan. 
In fact, we never asked for an opting out provision.  I want to 
make it clear that those who have been fighting for fairness in 
MP compensation have been fighting for reasonable fairness. They 
have not been fighting for a double standard where MPs of one 
party would be set at a disadvantage compared to MPs of another 
party.  We think MPs of all parties should have the same standard 
as all Canadians, and that is what this debate is about.

shrill.  After all, they are not only fifth in number of seats 
but I think they are now fifth in the public opinion polls.  They 
are sad and tired with a retread leader from the 1970s who cannot 
even figure out whether or not he wants to run in a byelection, 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been postulated to me by members of the PC Party that one 
of the reasons their leader will not run for election to this 
place is that is he is receiving very generous pension plan 
benefits right now, whilst at the same time receiving from his 
party a compensation package equivalent to that of the leader of 
his party in this place.  Talk about double dipping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These shameless advocates of the old status quo have learned 
absolutely nothing.  Their leader will not run, in part because 
he is getting that very generous pension and a very generous 
salary from his debt ridden party.  Is it not interesting that 
the party which doubled the national debt, which ran the longest 
and largest string of deficits in Canadian history but never 
apologized for it, all the while defending a six to one 
parliamentary pension plan, should now have for a leader a man 
who continues to collect that pension plan and a generous salary 
from a party that is in as much debt as it put the country in? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What a delicious irony.  They have learned absolutely nothing. 
The shrill partisan squawking we hear from that extreme and 
narrow fringe of Canadian politics will continue.  I think that 
they should do themselves and this place a favour.  I would be 
willing to exempt my principles on the question of euthanasia 
because I would like to see that party die a dignified death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we see before us now is anything but dignified, as the 
Conservatives continue to apologize for the grandiosity and the 
pomposity of the regime which they represented and the six to one 
pension plan which Canadians have said enough about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud of my colleagues for having taken a stand on this 
issue, for having forced the moderation of these benefits.  I 
look forward to the day when we sit on the other side and one of 
the very first pieces of legislation we introduce will be to 
institute an independent commission, which I fully anticipate 
will come back with recommendations to create a self-funding, 
actuarially sound pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point.  I just 
want to help out the hon. member.  His members have taken great 
pains to point out that they should be called the Canadian 
Alliance and not the Reform Party.  He called himself the Reform 
Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that party is in such a 
pathetic state that it cannot even use progressive political 
terminology such as reform without getting nervous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that I am proud of my colleagues for having led 
the fight on this issue over the past two parliaments, for having 
forced the moderation of these benefits, something that party on 
the fringe has never advocated, has never stood for and is 
fighting against here tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to the moment when we will see under an alliance 
government a commission report back that we should have an 
actuarially sound, fully funded pension plan.  As the Blais 
commission recommended, we ought to eliminate the hide and seek 
game of the tax free expense allowances.  We ought to put 
ourselves on the same standard as the rest of Canadians and 
remove the conflict of interest which we are now in. I look 
forward to that moment.  Unfortunately the only bitterness for me 
is that members at the other end will not be in this place to 
enjoy our retroactive reduction of their pension benefits.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I did not say my simple 
colleague.  I said I had a simple question for my hon. colleague. 
Today my hon. colleague's successor, Walter Robinson, called what 
the alliance was doing slimy, slimy politics.  I would like my 
hon. colleague to respond to that comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I concur with that comment 
with respect to this government, its approach to this issue and 
its legislation.  I think it is irresponsible and that is why I 
will vote against it.  I think it is irresponsible not to accept 
the recommendations of the independent commission.  I think it is 
irresponsible not to bring in legislation which adopted the 
recommendations of the Blais commission.  I agree completely with 
Mr. Robinson and the Canadian Taxpayers Federation when they 
fully and heartily endorsed the recommendations of the Blais 
commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, let me tell the House what is really slimy.  It is a 
party that continues to defend a pension plan which Canadians do 
not think is reasonable.  It does so without any shred of 
humility.  It pains me to see my colleagues at that end, after 
all of these years, refusing to learn the lessons of their tragic 
defeat in 1993.   It was a tragic fall.  Tragic falls come after 
the hubris.  They still have not divested themselves of the 
hubris of their government.  Had they simply taken the steps 
recommended by the Blais commission in 1984, I suspect there 
might still be a Tory party worth talking about in this place. 
<P><A NAME="LINK301"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds—Grenville, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
want to ask the member quite a specific question.  He talked 
about the Canadian Alliance's intention if it is elected.  Let us 
hope that never happens.  It will retroactively change the 
pension.  He sang the praises of Mike Harris.  Mike Harris took 
action in Ontario.  I do not care what hat he wants to wear, the 
former president of whatever.  Mike Harris got $900,000 when he 
changed that pension.  Bob Runciman got $900,000.  Ernie Eves got 
$850,000.  Norm Sterling got $800,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, they calculated the unfunded liability, what an 
annuity would be, and rather than put the annuity in trust they 
gave themselves the principal.  It is a heck of a deal.  Just 
before Christmas an order in council in the Ontario government 
allowed them to access that money immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member singing the praises of Mike Harris style of 
pension reform?  Is that what he is talking about?  The silence 
was deafening.  The silence in this regard from the Canadian 
Taxpayers Federation and from the Reform Party was deafening. 
They made instant millionaires out of these people.  Yet they 
parade themselves around as great pension reformers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that member was shouting 
so loudly a few moments ago that he was deafening himself with 
his heckling.  I pointed out to the member that the annuities 
paid out to those MPPs of the Progressive Conservative Government 
of Ontario were substantially less than the benefits would have 
been paid under the status quo defined benefit pension plan. That 
was clearly the case.  That was clearly the intention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger:</B>  Not bad.  The member can say that 
with a straight face, but the member beside him cannot listen to 
it with a straight face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, perhaps the member for 
Ottawa—Vanier is not an actuary.  Perhaps he is not familiar 
with the figures.  I looked very closely at that issue and 
understand that the members of the Government of Ontario saved 
the Ontario taxpayers millions of dollars by reforming the 
pension plan.  They received a one time benefit based on years of 
service, based on what they had funded in terms of contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is marvellous that the Ontario government decided by order of 
council to allow those MPPs to manage those dollars themselves 
through their own annuities to generate a higher rate of return 
than they would otherwise get through a government managed 
annuity.  That is essentially the same principle that we advocate 
for all Canadians.  They should be free to invest what belongs to 
them.  Those are benefits vested in them for the future.  They 
ought to be able to invest them to maximize the rate of return. 
The point is that the MPPs are then taking the risk and not the 
taxpayer, which is the case in an unfunded defined benefit plan.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
question at hand is the amount of rhetoric that we receive from 
the member when he talks about the hypocrisy of the situation and 
attacks our government. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2340"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT154"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT154"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 2340

<A HREF="#LINKT153"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate is about the unprecedented rhetoric and the stunts 
that were played by putting replicas of pigs in the House of 
Commons and by giving away keys to cars.  They said they would 
not take the chauffeur and would not move into Stornoway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On August 6, 1998, when a member of that party decided to opt 
into the pension plan this member said, according to an article 
in the Vancouver <I>Sun</I>, that MPs who opted back in were liars 
and hypocrites.  He went on to say that he opted out and told the 
voters he was opting out.  Now he has broken his word.  This is 
the same pension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is quite simple.  Which one of the members who voted 
yes to Bill C-37 is a liar and which one is a hypocrite? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We settled this 
yesterday.  I am going to refresh everybody's memory.  We will 
not sanitize the English language to the point where it loses all 
its spice, but we will not use hypocrite or liar when we are 
directing those words directly at any member in any circumstance. 
I said yesterday that hypocrite in the general sense of an 
action that is hypocritical in nature was fine.  Hypocrite 
singularly will not be permitted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will rephrase the 
question.  I think the way I phrased it was indeed over the top 
and I do apologize in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Which one of his members who voted yes to this bill would he add 
to the comments he made to the Vancouver <I>Sun</I>? Would the 
members who actually voted yes to this bill fall in the same 
class and receive the same kind of reaction on an internal basis? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there are no members of 
parliament opting into this pension plan under this legislation. 
I think the question is immaterial.  At the end of the day 
constituents will make a judgment about the conduct of their MPs 
in all these matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can say with confidence that when they do so they will see 
that this party and its members have fought tirelessly for the 
moderation of these benefits so that they are put on a fair, 
fully funded basis.  They will see that members of the regional 
party at the other end continue to this day not to have learned 
the lessons of 1993 and continue to apologize and promote a 
double standard for MPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have not said a single word tonight about the Blais 
commission.  I have not heard a Tory MP utter a single word about 
the principle that the compensation of MPs ought to be set 
independently and at arm's length.  They seem not to care about 
the conflict of interest in which we are put by legislation such 
as this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not heard a single word of concern about the unfunded 
liability which exists in this sort of pension plan.  I have not 
heard a single word of commendation for the Progressive 
Conservative provincial governments which have brought in 
sensible legislation to moderate pensions plans, not a single 
constructive word, not a single word of humility, not a single 
word that would contribute positively to the debate about how to 
make the compensation of MPs a matter for independent scrutiny 
and not this kind of conflict of interest.  Canadians will make a 
judgment and I think that the judgment will be on that party. 
<P><A NAME="LINK303"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will only take a couple of minutes.  I think we have 
had all the fun we can probably stand for one night.  I should 
like to correct some misconceptions that have been said tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first one was corrected by my colleagues.  I am referring to 
the allegation by the fifth party, the Conservative Party, that 
Reform MPs and now Canadian Alliance MPs have always been against 
an MP pension plan.  That is just simply not the case.  What we 
have been against is a pension plan that is unfair and is out of 
line with what Canadians expect from us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second one is that the bill is about the Canadian Alliance 
forcing the government into allowing Canadian Alliance members 
back into the pension plan. 
That is what one of the Conservative Party members said.  That is 
so absurd we should think about it again.  He said that the 
Canadian Alliance House leader somehow put pressure on the 
government House leader to bring in a pension bill to allow 
members of the Canadian Alliance party to get back into the 
pension.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are that powerful as the official opposition, imagine what 
we will do when we are in government a year from now.  I would 
like to know why the Conservative members, the few who are left, 
are not rushing to join us given that kind of power.  That was an 
interesting comment by the member from the Conservative Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third thing is members of the Conservative Party have said 
that some kind of dealing went on which allowed the bill to go 
ahead with unanimous consent and that there would not be a debate 
or a vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any member of the House can deny unanimous consent.  There are 
still about 17 members in the Conservative Party.  Where were 
they to deny unanimous consent?  If they were doing their jobs, 
they would have denied unanimous consent.  They went along with 
it too, because all that unanimous consent did was to allow the 
legislation to come to the House two days earlier than normal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With full debate, we could debate it for the next 10 days if we 
chose to.  That is what is allowed here.  For the Conservative 
Party members to suggest that there was conniving which took 
place to allow this to go ahead and that they were tricked, I do 
not know what they are saying really. The fact is that any member 
of the Conservative Party could have denied unanimous consent to 
allow the bill to go ahead two days earlier than normal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Canadian Alliance forms the government, we will change 
this plan.  We will change it based on the recommendations of an 
independent commission.  We supported the Blais commission 
recommendations.  An independent commission is needed to set the 
pay and benefits of members of parliament. That is what will 
happen when we form the government, I believe a year from now. 
Because that has not been allowed to happen in this situation, I 
will vote against the bill at third reading, as I did at second 
reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a lot said about the bill.  I think we have had 
full debate on it.  There is still a lot I could say about it but 
I think it has been said.  I will leave my comments at that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with others who have said that our constituents will 
judge each one of us on this issue.  I welcome that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK304"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I listened with great interest to the member's 
comments.  As with the previous speaker, it was a cross between 
vitriol, high octane fuel and pure adrenalin. At the end of the 
day it really boils down to a simple question. He has told us 
what he would do and we have heard about what they would do 
before. That seems to have dissipated.  Why should Canadians 
believe the member now? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member asks why 
Canadians should believe me now.  The answer is that I am 
trustworthy.  I make a point of speaking the truth.  I would like 
the member to say so if he doubts that. That is my answer.  I do 
not know what he was referring to beyond that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the member for Lakeland put to rest some of the absurd 
comments from the Progressive Conservatives tonight.  I am not 
sure whether they were trying to be progressive or conservative 
or just completely irrelevant which I think they have succeeded 
in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do find it interesting that there is one thing that was not 
covered by the member for Lakeland. Many members of the Tory 
caucus said that they did not know anything about the bill and it 
was a complete and absolute surprise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the member for Lakeland could describe what exactly they 
think their House leader was doing for the past three or four 
weeks and if he is not talking to his own caucus what exactly he 
thinks his role is.  It seems to me, and I am just guessing, that 
there were discussions about it.  The government House leader 
said members did not even have to go to a caucus meeting. They 
could pick up a newspaper a month ago and read that people were 
talking about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Tories seemed to be completely and utterly surprised at 
this, that it came out of nowhere.  It was just laid on the table 
and then the Canadian Alliance gave unanimous consent, just like 
the Tories said they did, “Just like us in the Tory party, they 
gave unanimous consent”.  Whoops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not mind someone giving unanimous consent because we knew 
this was being talked about.  What I find remarkable is they gave 
unanimous consent to something they say they had no idea existed. 
They said, “We will give unanimous consent to something which 
we have not got a clue what we are talking about”. I give up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I cannot say it as well 
as my colleague did.  It shows the state of that party.  Those 
members granted unanimous consent, obviously according to what 
they said, not knowing what is going on.  It shows the state of 
communication within that party when the House leader who was 
involved in all of these negotiations did not tell his own 
members what was going on. My question is what is going on over 
there? 
<P><A NAME="LINK306"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I want to take a few minutes to be on record at third reading of 
the bill.  I greatly regret what is happening in the House these 
days.  We should be debating what is good for Canadian taxpayers 
and we find that distant party over there has used pretty well 
all of the time to spread misinformation about us and to try to 
make political points in a very cheap way.  That is very 
unfortunate and I also found it very hurtful.  The things they 
said about me are things which are just not accurate. It reminds 
of the 1997 election campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say this.  In the 1993 election campaign the Conservative 
who was the sitting member of parliament was a real gentleman. 
He was a really good man.  When we had the all-candidate debates 
in the different fora he was a real gentleman.  He was thoughtful 
and considerate.  I do not hesitate for a moment to give him, Mr. 
Brian O'Kurley, great accolades for the way he conducted himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Somehow the party which was defeated and annihilated in 1993 
decided to use the approach of attacking people viscerally and 
personally. That was why the Conservative candidate in the 1997 
election, whom I will not name, said things about me which anyone 
who knew knew were not true.  They were just not true. When he 
said these things publicly on one occasion I remember I stood up 
and said at a meeting, “Mr. Chairman, anyone who knows me knows 
that what this candidate has said about me is untrue. Why should 
they consider even voting for a person who has so little regard 
for the truth?” 
As a matter of fact, that Conservative candidate did not even get 
his deposit back because people saw through that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier this evening things were attributed to me that I take 
personally because they were attributed to me as a member of the 
Canadian Alliance, formerly the Reform Party.  Publicly and 
loudly the members of that distant party put me into a category 
which is frankly not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I came here with great ideals.  I believed then and I believe 
now, that the MP pension, because it exceeded what was available 
to other Canadians under the Income Tax Act rules, was 
excessively generous.  Very frankly, for them to say these things 
is very demeaning and I was hurt by it when they spoke that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Be that as it may, I guess one cannot be in this business and 
not expect to be falsely accused occasionally.  However, I would 
like to say unequivocally that I have been committed for the last 
seven years and continue to be committed to bringing into this 
place a pension plan which a person of honour can participate in 
without shame.  I do not believe that we are there yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for me to also say that this plan is 
particularly bad for me because I decided in 1995 to opt out of 
the other plan.  I have been making contributions to an RRSP.  I 
am trying to organize my financial life so my wife and I will not 
be on welfare when we finally retire.  This particular plan is a 
real dilemma for me.  As soon as this plan is brought into place, 
money will be taken from my paycheque without my ability to stop 
it which will thereby take away my RRSP deposit room. I find that 
distressing because I had hoped to do it that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not my choice to change this system and plan.  To be 
falsely accused that I wanted it and that I want back in is 
hurtful, harmful and simply is not true.  I think it is 
unbecoming of the members who have made those accusations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nonetheless, it is almost midnight.  I am on the record as 
saying that I am opposed to it and that I will vote against the 
bill again, as I did earlier.  This is being done against my 
will.  I want that to be clearly on the record.  Very frankly, my 
integrity is not for sale and I really regret that even that 
implication is being made.
