	<B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York-Simcoe, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am very pleased to stand in the House and congratulate Chief Bill 
McCue, the Chippewas of Georgina Island and the minister of 
Indian affairs for their hard work in introducing a bill that will 
enable 14 First Nations to opt out of the land management section 
of the Indian Act. Chief Bill McCue, along with this colleagues, 
initiated this historic agreement.
<P>
	This progressive piece of legislation promotes economic 
development in native communities and enables these communities 
to manage their own lands and resources.
<P>
	This is a significant step closer toward full self-government and 
all of us in the House should applaud this initiative.

	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I know the Liberals do not like to be reminded of their 
promises, but the Prime Minister could not escape the frustration of 
Canadians about the broken promises on CBC's town hall last 
night. Jobs, jobs, jobs. It was evident then, as it is every day in the 
House, that the government has no real solutions to ensure a 
reduction in unemployment.
<P>
	Reform's tax reduction strategy is the real solution. For low 
income Canadians our tax reductions would  reduce their tax bill in 
most cases to zero and provide them a credit that would be put 
toward job training and education. For middle class families tax 
reductions will provide up to $2,000 more in their pockets each 
year by the year 2000. This will help the growing number of 
entrepreneurs that are starting their own businesses or improve 
consumer spending.
<P>
	The reductions in capital gains tax and unemployment insurance 
premiums which the Liberals despise so much will give Canada's 
job creators more incentive to create jobs. Canadians now have a 
real choice.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Canada Post has given Profac responsibility for managing the 
renovation and replacement of its buildings in a territory that 
extends from Windsor in Ontario to Halifax.
<P>
	Not long ago, after a call for tenders in which three companies 
were asked to bid, Profac awarded the contract for repairs to 
windows in the Thetford Mines post office to a firm in Ontario.
<P>
	Profac offers its services as a contractor and then works on the 
principle of contracting out. Since we are talking about public 
moneys, it would be normal for the exact value of the contracts 
awarded to Profac to be made public. More transparency is 
certainly needed in the process of awarding contracts for the crown 
corporation.
<P>
	We think it is too bad that calls for tender are not open to the 
public, because this system would encourage local businesses and 
promote growth and development in the regions. It is clear that 
Canada Post is creating some controversy about its current 
management methods.

in each session of Parliament I offer a challenge to the pages who 
serve us in the House of Commons. The current group was given 
the challenge of producing a picture of their home area. The contest 
included a small six-pack of Crayola crayons which are produced 
in my riding of Victoria-Haliburton in the town of Lindsay, and a 
single piece of white paper. The contest was judged by Hélène

	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on February 2 to 4, 1997 a micro credit summit will take 
place in Washington, D.C. to focus attention on the provision of 
credit to the world's poorest entrepreneurs, especially women, in 
order to provide them with employment and a better quality of life.
<P>
	This summit is being supported by the OECD, the World Bank, 
NGOs, experts and individuals from all over the world. It has been 
shown that by lending small amounts of money, between $35 to 
$300 in developing countries, one can start up small businesses and 
cottage industries which allow individuals to support themselves 
and their families.
<P>
	I ask our government and all members to support this initiative. 
By contributing to the capital of micro credit banks, they can work 
wonders with small amounts of money.

	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Canada's 
universities have proposed a five year $1.8 billion program to build 
and renew Canada's research infrastructure, and to help keep the 
country's top young researchers in Canada.
<P>
	The federal government would pay for roughly half of the 
project while the rest would be provided by the universities and the 
provinces. The program would provide funding for top quality 
researchers and would help stop the brain drain to the United States 
and renew the network of centres of excellence program.
<P>
	As technology becomes more and more sophisticated, and 
research more collaborative and interdisciplinary, the renovation 
and expansion of laboratory areas in such fields as information 
technology, environmental science, engineering and biotechnology 
become essential for Canada's ability to compete in the global 
marketplace.
<P>
	Innovation at home means exports abroad and jobs for 
Canadians at home. The research infrastructure program is 
essential for Canada's economic growth.

the economy wide costs of regulation in Canada are an average $86 
billion a year. For a Canadian family of four, like those in my riding 
of Okanagan Centre, it means annually a cost of $12,000.
<P>
	Yes, we need regulations. But too many ineffective and 
inappropriate regulations are stifling Canadians entrepreneurship 
and thus the economy.
<P>
<B>(1405 )</B>
<P>
	We could avoid this unnecessary burden if federal governments 
did a few simple things: carry out thorough cost benefit analyses, 
study the economic impact of regulations and write them in simple 
language.
<P>
	Unless we do so, the effect of regulation will continue to create 
impediments to Canada's competitive position in the global 
marketplace. For Canadians it will mean an unacceptable and 
unwelcome level of government intrusion into our lives.

	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Canada's record on human rights has improved 
dramatically since the adoption of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights by the UN General Assembly in 1948. In many 
respects, the declaration of that seminal document has served as a 
watershed in Canada's own record in human rights.
<P>
	Since then, Canada has taken a leading role in advancing the 
interests of women and in its treatment of minorities, aboriginal 
people, people with disabilities and those with different sexual 
orientation.
<P>
	Canada has also taken a very different approach to new 
immigrants and ethnic and racial minorities of all kinds, an 
approach which has embraced diversity and encouraged an open, 
tolerant and multicultural society.
<P>
	Human rights day reminds us that there is always more to be 
done and new struggles to be waged. We have come a long way. 
Human rights day allows us to reflect on where we have gone and 
simultaneously to plan for the future.

	<B>Mrs. Anna Terrana (Vancouver East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
the last session of Parliament, Bill C-114, an act to amend the 
Canada Elections Act, was introduced and passed.
<P>
	Section 31 of the elections act requires that a party that could not 
field 50 candidates must have its status revoked, all assets 
liquidated and all debts paid.
<P>
	Section 31 caused the Communist Party, the Social Credit Party 
and other parties to be deregistered. Most newspapers came to the 
defence of such parties: the Toronto <I>Star</I> calling the change a 
draconian treatment of fledgling political parties, while the 
Vancouver <I>Sun</I> called such an act unjust.
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>
	Other medias commented negatively in this respect, and I think 
it is a very serious matter when parties that have been recognized 
for more than 75 years are forced to relinquish their status of 
official political party. They also had to liquidate their assets.
<P>
	Last year, I presented a bill that would restore the democratic 
rights of these parties.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Unfortunately the bill collapsed. In the meantime, the 
Communist Party sent a petition with almost 4,000 signatures, 
respectfully calling on the government to repeal section 31 (11-14) 
of the Canada Elections Act. This problem must be redressed.

Commissioner of the Canadian Human Rights Commission, 
headed by a woman for the first time in its history.
<P>
	Human rights are everyone's concern. However, not unless these 
rights are known and accessible can we stand up for those rights in 
full confidence. Mrs. Falardeau-Ramsay's main task will be to 
inform the public of its rights and how those rights are protected.
<P>
	After explaining how the system works, the commission and its 
new chief commissioner will be responsible for gaining acceptance

	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it will not be a very merry Christmas for more than a 
million Canadians who remain unemployed despite Liberal 
promises of jobs, jobs, jobs.
<P>
	There is a terrible human cost to unemployment which is nearly 
double that of our largest trading partner, the U.S.A., whose 
average is 5.4 per cent.
<P>
	However, a new federal study also points to dollar costs of $29 
billion to $77 billion in lost productivity, plus $14 billion in health, 
crime and other social costs for the year 1994 alone.
<P>
	The sorry fact is that Canada's net job creation from 1993 to 
1995 inclusive was nearly 25,000 less than the number of 
immigrants admitted during those same years. Consumer 
bankruptcies were at a record high of 65,432 last year, with three 
million people on welfare and 2.9 million who collected 
unemployment insurance. Years of Liberal and Tory 
mismanagement have created this bleak result.
<P>

government.

the Prime Minister got the message last night when it was 
confirmed on the national news that Canadians across the country 
view that he has betrayed them. He promised to can, to kill, to axe 
the GST and now he denies saying it. He promised jobs, jobs, jobs 
but now he says that governments do not create jobs. Obviously 
jobs is a four letter word in the Liberal Party.
<P>
<B>(1410)</B>
<P>
	He promised to keep the Crow benefit but cancelled it. He 
promised stable funding to the CBC. How ironic, the day after his 
CBC town hall meeting the axe falls on 1,200 more CBC 
employees. He promised to protect health and education but 
instead he has slashed core funding of $7 billion from these 
programs to the provinces.
<P>
	The Prime Minister is stealing Christmas from millions of 
unemployed Canadians who see a dismal future for themselves and 
their families. The Prime Minister has a lot to think about this 
holiday season.
<P>
	I recommend that he get out of his office, go down to the shelter

a resolution recognizing Louis Riel as one of the Fathers of 
Confederation. Today, however, from a legal standpoint, Louis Riel

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr.

message the Prime Minister received loud and clear again 
yesterday. Unemployment is increasing and Statistics Canada 
released 
<P>
<HR>

<P>
figures today showing that over 5 million people, up 38 per cent 
from 1989, are living under the poverty line.
<P>
	It is now December 11, 1996, and the EI reform takes effect in 
three weeks. The Minister of Human Resources Development has 
been trying for weeks now to reassure the public that the reform is a 
good one, but we are worried, and so is the public.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Human Resources Development claim 
that complete information on the new EI system is available to 
everyone from a 1-800 number, when it was impossible to obtain 
this telephone number in Canada employment centres, when it took 
several days to get it, and when those answering this 1-800 number 
were not even able to tell us anything useful about the transition 
measures?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, now that our government has 
finally decided on an active measures approach, and I see that Mme 
Harel in the Quebec government is trying to do the same thing with 
social assistance, I have trouble understanding that, when 
Quebecers have led the way with active measures, the opposition is 
today trying to discredit a reform that is actually based on active 
measures.
<P>
	The transition measures have been worked out, and I signed and 
ratified them last week. The Leader of the Opposition was absent 
that day. These measures have all been designed to favour workers. 
We are looking out for workers, and each of these measures is to 
their advantage.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, how unfortunate it is for the minister's reputation that he 
always comes up with the wrong answer to the right question. I do 
not get it.
<P>
	If we question the minister about active measures, he tells us 
about transition, when we ask him about transition, he talks to us 
about employment centres, and when we ask him about 
employment centres, he goes off on another tangent.
<P>
	I will ask him another question. We have checked, and it is quite 
obvious that public servants are still not able to inform the public 
about the new EI system.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Human Resources Development confirm 
that nothing, and I mean nothing, has been done as of yet to provide 
public servants with the information they need to inform the public 
properly about the new system and the related transition measures? 
In short, will the minister admit that the situation in his department 
and in employment centres is one of total confusion?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have checked, and employees 
of our department have had training sessions since the bill became 
law. They are perfectly aware of how the new legislation will apply.
<P>
	I have checked and the transition measures have been worked 
out, and they are to the advantage of workers, in the sense that each 
week worked in the last 26 weeks will be considered to contain 35 
hours.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	The only employees not yet trained are those who have no 
contact with the public, with clients. And those who will begin 
processing applications referred to them by their colleagues have 
asked to have these training sessions at the end of January, when 
the first applications come their way.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it took our researchers several days to come up with the 
1-800 number that all unemployed workers in Canada will need to 
know. Our extensive research showed us that employees were 
unable to answer the questions put to them. And the minister thinks 
that the poor folks who will soon be unemployed will have no 
trouble obtaining all the answers and information they need. It is to 
weep.
<P>
	The 1-800 number is to all intents and purposes not in operation 
at the present time. Three weeks before the system is to start up, 
and I draw the minister's attention to the coming holiday period, 
employees have still not been trained to implement the EI system. I 
ask the minister to tell us what has become of the transition 
measures that were going to ensure that people moving from the 
old to the new system received fair treatment? Where are they 
written down, where can a person see them? That is a clear 
question.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, what I find encouraging is that 
it took you three weeks to find the 1-800 number. It is a sign that

<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Dear colleagues, I would remind you always to 
address your comments to the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pettigrew: </B>Mr. Speaker, the 1-800 number has been given 
out to all those who have received UI benefits since the month of 
July. This number, and I am giving it out because it is important, is 
1-800-276-7655. This number has been given out to anyone who 
has received EI benefits since the month of July.
<P>
	I can therefore assure you that the information is available to our 
people, and that, throughout the country, our people are well 
trained to receive clients and provide them with very good service.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	Since the minister raised the issue of active measures, let us talk 
about them. Last week, after several days of questioning and 
denials, he finally realized that transitional measures were 
required. The minister will now have to admit that the shift to 
active 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7384"> 7384 </A></B>
<P>
measures is in fact window dressing to hide cuts to the consolidated 
fund.
<P>
	Does the minister know that the federal government will spend 
some $150 million less on active measures in Quebec in 1996-97 
than it did in 1993-94? Will the minister recognize that the 
so-called shift to active measures is nothing but window dressing?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the active measures we are 
implementing now are designed to break the old cycle of 
dependency. It is extremely important to put people back to work. 
We are very happy to have a system that fosters active measures. 
Over the next few years, an extra $800 million will be added to the 
$1.9 billion already available, for a total of $2.7 billion.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister did not answer my question. Does he know that, in 
1993-94, $854 million was spent on active measures in Quebec and 
that, according to figures I obtained from his own senior officials, 
this amount will be reduced to about $710 million this year, or 
some $150 million less? Does he know that?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am always shocked by the 
attitude of people who like to fiddle around with this figure or that 
figure. I am glad that our government's transparency seems to be 
operating in favour of the hon. member for Mercier.
<P>
	But do we recall the number of times through equalization 
payments, for instance, made to the Quebec government, Quebec 
alone receives 47 per cent of all amounts paid in equalization; 47 
per cent, that is quite a large share.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday at a CBC town hall meeting, Canadians started 
to hold the Prime Minister accountable for his broken campaign 
promise of jobs, jobs, jobs. Lori Foster of Saskatchewan wanted to 
know why she could not find full time work with three university 
degrees. Alain Reny of Quebec used his UI to go back to school and 
upgrade his skills, but still no job. Juanita MacKeigan of Cape 
Breton wondered how the Prime Minister expected her to start her 
own business when she does not have enough money to pay the 
bills.
<P>
	Canadians could not get a straight answer from the Prime 
Minister last night so I would like to try today. After three years of 
being in office, why is it that these Canadians and thousands like 
them feel that the Prime Minister has broken his number one 
election promise?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we said that jobs were to be the priority of this 
government. Over the last three years 672,000 new jobs have been 
created in Canada.
<P>
	We have worked very hard to put the finances of the nation in 
good shape. We have been very successful. Today we have the 
lowest interest rates in Canada in 40 years. Because we have turned 
the fundamentals the right way, yesterday we read in the press that 
last month housing starts rose by 17 per cent. People now believe 
that they have a future and can borrow money at the lowest rates 
they have ever known. We have done what is right.
<P>
	Nobody can promise that there will be a job for everyone in 
Canada tomorrow. There will always be some unemployed people. 
What is important is that the government have a priority to create 
jobs and give everyone an excellent chance to find a job. That is 
exactly what this government has done.
<P>
	We wish that we could have created a million jobs, but 672,000 
jobs were created. That is the best record of all G-7 countries other 
than the United States.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, those numbers and that answer did not satisfy the 
audience last night and those numbers and that answer do not 
satisfy this House.
<P>
	The Prime Minister last night told the 17.2 per cent of Canadian 
young people looking for work: ``Go back to school''. His answer 
to the two million to three million people who are underemployed 
in this country was: ``Get a loan and start a business''. His answer 
to the 1.5 million unemployed Canadians was: ``Some are lucky. 
Some are unlucky. That is life''. That sounds like rolling the dice 
with the lives of the unemployed.
<P>
	Is that really what the Prime Minister has to say to 1.5 million 
unemployed Canadians, that some are lucky, some are unlucky and 
that is life? Is that the Prime Minister's position on the 
unemployed?
<P>
<B>(1430 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is very true that the government has put order into the 
affairs of the nation. I said that we could not put everybody on the 
federal payroll. Is that what the leader of the Reform Party is 
proposing?
<P>
	We have set the conditions for people to find and create jobs in 
Canada because the conditions are now the best. When we started, 
the interest rates were much higher than they are today. Today they 
are the lowest they have been in 40 years and people can start to 
work. It is why three-quarters of the jobs have been created by 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7385"> 7385 </A></B>
<P>
small businesses in the last three years, and 672,000 new  jobs have 
been created in Canada since this government came to power.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is completely unacceptable for the Prime Minister of 
this country to tell 1.5 million unemployed Canadians ``that's life''. 
That is a tragedy .The policies that were created are a failure. The 
Prime Minister is the one who promised people jobs, jobs, jobs and 
gave them the heave ho. He is the one whose jobs strategy is not 
working. He is the one who will not balance the budget until the 
next election. He is the one who will not provide the tax relief 
required to create more jobs.
<P>
	Instead of wishing unemployed Canadians good luck, why does 
the Prime Minister not adopt a new jobs strategy? Why does he not 
balance the budget, lower taxes and facilitate the creation of the 
millions of jobs required by unemployed Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the last budget the government put $350 million new 
dollars toward helping young people in their search for work. Not 
long ago for example the Minister of Finance reduced the 
contributions for employers who are employing new employees, 
exemptions for EI contributions so that it would be easier to create 
jobs. Jobs are created by the private sector because the government 
has decided to put the nation's fiscal house in order, and that is 
what we have done so far. That is why we are praised around the 
world. We have been the best in bringing down our deficit and 
creating the proper conditions for job growth.

	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development, the 
one who is on the workers' side.
<P>
	The Liberal government is obviously more generous with 
businesses than with workers, regardless of what the minister may 
say in his speeches. Indeed, in addition to allowing the 
non-payment of pension contributions, the federal government also 
remitted customs duties to Singer, from 1982 to 1986, for an 
undiscounted amount of $30 million. This is outrageous.
<P>
	How can the minister justify such generosity toward Singer, 
when the only compassion he is showing to the retired employees 
of that company is nothing but hot air? As we say: ``With a friend 
like this, workers do not need enemies''.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, obviously, I was not a 
government member in the early or mid-eighties. Maybe the hon. 
member should talk to his friends of the time.
<P>
	As regards this very important case, I wish to point out that 
Singer's solicitors asked us to settle out of court. I looked at 
everything that relates to this issue, and I came to the conclusion 
that there were no precedents, and my legal advisers said that this 
very serious issue had to be settled by the courts.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, when the 
minister does not have his little piece of paper, he really has a very 
hard time answering.
<P>
	The federal fund that manages private pension plans, including 
the one for retired Singer employees, is called ``government 
annuities''. This fund generates actuarial surpluses of $2 million 
per year, and these $2 million are put into the federal government's 
consolidated fund.

currently letting the dispute deteriorate because he wants to get 
these $2 million and put them into the government's consolidated 
fund? Instead of settling the basic issue, he is appropriating these 
$2 million and too bad for his friends, the retired Singer 
employees.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, it want to tell you, since we 
must address the Chair, that we asked our legal advisers to review 
this extremely important issue. Given the seriousness of the

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last 
night Johanne Savoie from Montreal wanted to know why the 
Prime Minister had broken his promise to abolish the GST. Instead 
of giving her a straight answer, the Prime Minister said that he did 
not make such a promise, but the tape does not lie. During the last 
campaign when he was asked about the GST, the Prime Minister 
said publicly on CFRB radio in Toronto: ``I will abolish it''.
<P>
	I ask the Prime Minister: Which statement is true? Is it the one 
he gave Johanne last night when he said that he did not promise to 
kill the GST, or is it the one he gave on CFRB radio that he did 
promise to abolish the GST? What will it be, flip or flop?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, contrary to the Reform Party, we put in writing what we 
were going to do. We said that we were going to modify the GST, 
that we would harmonize it with the provinces so there would be 
only one form of taxation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7386"> 7386 </A></B>
<P>
	Not long ago the Reform Party said that was the solution. 
Reformers applauded the actions of the Minister of Finance. They 
agreed that it was the proper solution to put provincial tax with 
the federal tax to make a new tax, a harmonized tax. The GST 
is not a harmonized tax.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, maybe 
this is a classic case of believe what I write but not what I say.
<P>
	Ms. Savoie showed last night that her memory was certainly far 
better than the Prime Minister's. In October 1990, December 1992 
and May 1994 the Prime Minister promised Canadians that he 
would scrap, kill and abolish the GST. He even said it in this place. 
That is the promise that Johanne Savoie said she voted for in 1993. 
That is the promise the Liberals ran on in 1993 regardless of some 
small print in the red book.
<P>
	Instead of trying to rewrite history and change what was seen on 
the news last night which was the actual truth, why will the Prime 
Minister not just admit that he broke his campaign promise to 
abolish the GST? He should just admit it.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we wrote in the red book that we were going to modify the 
GST. For a while the Reform Party had the GST in its program.

	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was just 
commenting that in the report made by the Reform Party on the 
harmonization of tax on page 118 it said: ``We commend the 
government on its attempt to harmonize the tax with the provinces. 
While we support the much needed harmonization of the tax, this 
will be a very difficult political objective to achieve''.
<P>
	Let us not forget that at its party convention in 1992 it promised 
to eliminate the GST only after the budget is balanced. It changed 
its position about six or seven times. We put it in the program and 
we are in the process of harmonization right now.

	<B>Mr. Bernard St-Laurent (Manicouagan, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	Until November 1, there were 126 people working in 11 Quebec 
information centres, 66 of these people in Montreal, and the other 
60 distributed throughout the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, Quebec 
City, Outaouais, Eastern Townships, Eastern Quebec and North 
Shore regions. According to certain sources, the government 
apparently intends to close 9 of the 11 information centres as early 
as February of 1997.
<P>
	Will the minister confirm that his government intends to close 
nine information centres, retaining only two: one in Montreal, 
which is totally logical from a geographical point of view, and the 
other, purely coincidentally, in the Prime Minister's riding, in 
Shawinagan?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources

makes it possible for us to repatriate certain services to a certain 
number of strategic spots, to which we can gain access in a far 
more interesting and administratively far more efficient manner.

	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the people in the opposition will 
have to do their homework a bit better. The Quebec regional 
division selected Shawinagan for their centre for reasons of 
efficiency, because the Revenue Canada centre is already located 
there.

	The matter of transferring the regional airports in Sherbrooke, 
Charlevoix, Forestville and Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu is still

government is the one responsible for withdrawing from airport 
management, and thereby imposing unacceptable financial burdens 
on the municipalities.
<P>

government rehabilitates these airports' infrastructure, the 
Government of Quebec will not sign the agreement to transfer 
these airports, as the Quebec Minister of Transport has recently 
stated?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (Secretary of State (Federal Office of 
Regional Development-Quebec), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I have 
already stated in this House, my colleague, the Minister of 
Transport, has indeed drawn up a national transportation policy in 
order to give full responsibility for certain facilities back to 
communities. At issue are wharves and airports.
<P>
	The policy was introduced so that regions could manage airport 
facilities in a manner better suited to their particular situations and 
needs.
<P>
	This said, a policy has been implemented in connection with 
airports, and will be adhered to throughout the country. It is aimed 
at allowing us to provide assistance, under a certain program, to 
airports serving commercial airlines. The others, which are not 
used by commercial carriers, will receive somewhere in the order 
of $50,000, if memory serves me correctly.

<P>
	Is the Minister of Justice planning a national gun amnesty

<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General

Leeds-Grenville has been a vigorous and longstanding proponent 
of a gun amnesty. On those occasions when he has spoken about it 
the hon. member for Leeds-Grenville has pointed out the many 
advantages of a gun amnesty. It provides Canadians with an 
opportunity to turn over unwanted guns to the authorities, no 
questions asked. It gives people a chance to get removed from their 
homes, in a convenient way, weapons that could be dangerous if 
stolen or found by children.

	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when we say that we work on the creation of jobs, and I 
reported on TV and I say to the House of Commons, in the last 
three years Canada has created more jobs than Great Britain, 
France, Germany, Italy and Japan together.
<P>
	It is a question of debate. He can say that he would have done 
much better. He can say that he would wave his magic wand and 
there would be no deficit tomorrow. That is a matter of debate.
<P>
	The record is there. More jobs have been created in Canada than 
in the five nations I mentioned in the last three years. This is a fact 
and it is recorded clearly.

<P>
	We had a program with respect to the GST. He had a program. 
We said that we wanted to harmonize the GST. We have 
harmonization in four provinces. If the other provinces want to 
have only one tax to make life easy for business in Canada, there 
will be no GST, there will be a harmonized tax. However, only four 
provinces have agreed to it so far.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance is working to make the harmonized tax 
the system for Canada. No, it is not complete yet. I admit that. 
However, we cannot make decisions for the provinces. We respect 
the Constitution of Canada.

	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, I wish to return to a matter which 
occurred during Statements by Members and then I am going to 
hear a point of order.
<P>
	I put the case squarely before the hon. member for 
Regina-Lumsden. During the statements you made a statement 
which I found to be unparliamentary. Subsequent to that I asked 
you to withdraw the statement and you made another statement 
which I also find to be unparliamentary. After that, my colleague, 
you were kind enough to approach the Chair and converse with me 
for a few seconds.
<P>
	You are in your seat now and I put it squarely to you. I would ask 
you to withdraw what I deemed to be unparliamentary language in 
your statement and subsequently, I would ask you to withdraw the 
statement that you made after that. Will you do that?
<P>
<B>(1505 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
out of respect for the institution of the House of Commons and out 
of respect for the Speaker, I withdraw remarks in reference to the 
broken promises of the Liberal Party. The remark was specifically 
the word ``lies''. I also withdraw the remark that I made subsequent 
to my statement which made reference to that very same word.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I thank the member for that. I consider the matter 
closed.
<P>
	Now I will proceed to a point of order by the hon. member for 
Markham-Whitchurch-Stouffville.

	<B>Mr. Jag Bhaduria (Markham-Whitchurch-Stouffville, 
Ind. Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order concerning my 
statement today. According to Standing Order 31, the  Speaker may 
among other things rule out of order any personal attacks.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleague, I am well aware of the citation that 
you are giving to the House. The reason I intervened was that in my 
view the statement that you were making was unparliamentary. I 
only heard part of it, but from my point of view while I was sitting 
here it was unparliamentary.
<P>
	If the hon. member would like to discuss it further with me, I 
invite you to see me in my chambers. But when I do not know 
where a member is going with a statement and I feel it is in the 
interests of the House to intervene, I do and I will continue to 
intervene.

the development of our country and this is a regressive tax on 
reading and hampers the development of literacy.

Abbotsford, B.C.
<P>
	The petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the House 
that our police and firefighters place their lives at risk on a daily 
basis as they serve the emergency needs of all Canadians.
<P>
	They also state that in many cases the families of officers and 
firefighters who are killed in the line of duty are often left without 
sufficient financial means to meet their obligations.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to establish 
a public safety officers compensation fund to receive gifts and

and caring for preschool children is an honourable profession 
which has not been recognized for its value to our society.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to pursue

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="FIFTHREPORTOFSTANDINGCOMMITTEE">FIFTH REPORT OF STANDING COMMITTEE</A></H4>
	The House resumed from December 9 consideration of the 
motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to speak today to the report of the Standing Committee on 
Finance on the prebudget hearings.
<P>
	I started speaking on this matter a day or two ago and, 
unfortunately, I was interrupted, so I am back again. I will begin 
where I left off. I left off by saying that, in my judgment, the 
government was searching for the answer but it would not tell 
people what the question was. I want to advance the debate a bit 
beyond that now.
<P>
	This whole debate will be seen in a new light today as a result of 
the Prime Minister's town hall meeting last night. Last night we 
saw a side of the Prime Minister which I have not seen before. We 
saw a Prime Minister who seemed almost disdainful of the people 
who came forward, whose lives were in disarray because they were 
unemployed or because they had fallen on hard times. That stands 
in stark contrast to the words of the committee report.
<P>
	The chairman of the finance committee is sitting across from 
me. I am certain he believes very strongly the  words that are in his 
report which emphasize how much he cares about people who are 
unemployed, the poor and people who have fallen on hard times. 
However, I did not see that in the Prime Minister's responses to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7396"> 7396 </A></B>
<P>
questions from regular Canadians last night. Those people have 
fallen on hard times.
<P>
	I want to talk about these issues one by one. These issues are 
very important to Canadians.
<P>
	Last night at the town hall debate there was a graph shown on 
television which indicated that 42 per cent of Canadians said the 
number one priority they saw for government was unemployment. 
It is a huge problem. The Prime Minister brushed the whole issue 
aside.
<P>
<B>(1540 )</B>
<P>
	In the finance committee report the government does speak of 
the unemployed, but mostly it boasts about the job the government 
has done in creating an environment so that the economy can create 
jobs. Last night I think that claim was really challenged by 
reporters at CBC when they pointed out that since the government 
came to power, only 109,000 jobs truly had been created outside of 
the natural growth in the workforce. Therefore it amounts to only 
about 30,000 jobs a year since the government came to power, 
which allowed the unemployment rate to come down to about 10 
per cent, still a double digit.
<P>
	I know I speak for Canadians when I say 10 per cent 
unemployment is completely unacceptable. When we look at the 
regional breakdowns it is even worse. In Saskatchewan there is 6 
per cent unemployment; we are getting there. But in Atlantic 
Canada, Cape Breton, 22 per cent, as the lady claimed last night. 
That is unbelievable.
<P>
	What did the Prime Minister say in response to that lady's 
queries about what can be done to help people get a job? He said 
``we have ACOA, some ACOA grants''. I think we have been 
trying ACOA grants for 20 years and they have done nothing to fix 
the unemployment problem in Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	He said ``perhaps you can start a business''. But as the lady 
correctly pointed out, when you are unemployed you do not have 
the money to run out and start a business. These are common sense 
responses. And with respect to the Prime Minister, after 33 years in 
this place and serving as a big city lawyer, I think has has become 
too far removed from the common people. I think he has forgotten 
what it is like to come from humble beginnings. The people who 
spoke last night were simply not satisfied with the Prime Minister's 
answers.
<P>
	I think it would be irresponsible to criticize without offering 
some answers of our own. We have suggested there is another 
approach. We have suggested that the way to deal with the problem 
of unemployment is to create an environment, as the Prime 
Minister says, where the economy will produce real jobs. But the 
government  has not done that. That is not done simply by reducing 
the deficit ever so slowly but not giving people any of the benefits 
of a balanced budget and surpluses.
<P>
	We are proposing, and I think it is what a lot of Canadians want 
to hear, is balance the budget, shrink the size of government, get rid 
of the wasteful programs; and there are many of them. Give the 
provinces some of the responsibilities which are theirs in the 
Constitution and which the federal government has never done a 
good job with. When that is done, a surplus will be run. When that 
is done, people can be offered lower taxation.
<P>
	The Reform plan is to download $15 billion in tax relief to 
Canadians across the country so that the people in Atlantic Canada, 
where taxes are unreasonably high and are going to get even worse 
under this harmonization agreement that the Prime Minister spoke 
of today in question period, will benefit tremendously from lower 
taxes. The problem with the Atlantic Canadian economy is it is so 
bound up by taxes that it cannot possibly create the amount of jobs 
necessary to help the people in Cape Breton, Newfoundland, all the 
regions of Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	One of the saddest commentaries on the failure of the 
government to deal with the problems that seize the country is 
today's release from Stats Can that says an estimated 1.472 million 
children liven in ``straitened circumstances'' in 1995, in poverty, 
up 110,000 from the previous year. In the finance committee report 
government members pointed out that child poverty is a problem. It 
certainly is but words are not enough. During the last election 
campaign the words were jobs, jobs, jobs. What has happened? 
Virtually nothing. This time apparently it is going to be child 
poverty, but words do not put food on the table.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	The government report says that not too much can be done. 
Maybe some money can be put into a working income supplement, 
maybe it could be enhanced. That is not enough. The Reform plan, 
$15 billion in tax relief, would take 1.2 million low income 
Canadians completely off the tax rolls. That is how people who are 
struggling just to get by are helped. That is how the poor are 
helped. That is how children living in poverty are helped. That is 
how 1.2 million Canadians would be taken completely off the tax 
rolls. That is the Reform fresh start.
<P>
	Just a couple of minutes ago, as we went through Routine 
Proceedings, we heard petition after petition make reference to the 
GST. Probably a dozen or 15 members of Parliament got up with 
petitions in their hands saying that the government should fulfil its 
promise to get rid of the GST on reading materials.
<P>
	Unless I missed it, I did not see that addressed in the finance 
committee report. Sometimes when things are not said it speaks 
volumes about the approach to an issue.  This was a blatant promise 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7397"> 7397 </A></B>
<P>
that was broken. Nowhere is it addressed in the finance committee 
report.
<P>
	It is important that this is brought to the attention not only of 
Canadians who voted for the government on the basis of this 
promise but also the government MPs.
<P>
	It is incumbent on government MPs to stand up and represent 
their constituents. They know very well that the Prime Minister 
wrote to the Don't Tax Reading Coalition just before the last 
election and said that he would get rid of the GST on books. It is 
still there. Yes, the government made some minor changes but it is 
still there. It is another broken promise. It should have been 
addressed.
<P>
	The GST is barely mentioned in the finance committee report 
but Canadians had some hard questions for the Prime Minister last 
night. We had the spectacle of a waitress from Montreal standing 
up meekly at first, trying to challenge the Prime Minister on his 
GST promise, and what did he do? He attempted to dress her down. 
He tried to corner her and suggest somehow that she did not know 
what she was talking about. But she knew a lot better than he did 
what she was talking about.
<P>
	She pointed out that the Prime Minister had said many, many 
times that he would scrap the GST and it was the basis on which 
she had voted for him. What did the Prime Minister do? He did not 
say: ``You're right. I am sorry''. He did not do what the Deputy 
Prime Minister had to do. He certainly did not resign. What did he 
do? He tried to deny that he had said all the things that a couple of 
minutes later appeared on the television news.
<P>
	I would think, after having gone through the debacle of the 
Mulroney government and the myriad broken promises and the 
myriad times when people completely lost faith in government, the 
Prime Minister, the hon. member from Shawinigan, would have 
learned his lesson. Instead he let pride get in his way. He denied 
that he had said the things that ended up on the TV news a few 
minutes later and again, people have a very good reason to not trust 
government.
<P>
	I wonder how many million people watched last night. I wonder 
how many million people saw a side of the Prime Minister that they 
had never seen before. We are all amused when the Prime Minister 
puts on his little guy from Shawinigan act. He is very amusing. He 
seems like a very nice man, but last night, although sometimes the 
words were there, there was a curled lip, there was an arrogant 
attitude. I did not see any sympathy at all for what the people out 
there were asking about.
<P>
<B>(1550 )</B>
<P>
	After what we saw last night this whole debate has been put in a 
new light. I hope Canadians remember this as we approach the next 
election.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, one of 
our most important challenges is to work toward restoring the level 
of credibility and integrity of this place. The words we have just 
heard have not helped that cause.
<P>
	I was particularly disgusted with the attack on the Prime 
Minister. He has been characterized as a big Bay Street lawyer who 
has somehow lost touch with the people. If the member would look 
more carefully into the Prime Minister's background he would 
know that the Prime Minister comes from a rural area, that he 
comes from a family with 19 children. I do not know how the 
member could possibly characterize the Prime Minister as some fat 
cat Bay Street lawyer. He does a disservice to this place by 
somehow twisting the facts.
<P>
	The member has agreed with the Prime Minister that the role of 
government is not to create jobs but rather to promote an 
environment which is conducive to job creation. The member did 
not articulate what the elements of that environment are.
<P>
	Interest rates in Canada are currently the lowest they have been 
in 40 years. Inflation is also at a very low, very acceptable rate. The 
economy has performed exceptionally well and is projected to be 
the highest of the G-7 countries. The government has worked on 
these elements to promote an environment conducive to job 
creation.
<P>
	This member said that Reformers would not mess around with 
little pieces on the deficit. He said that they would use their 
extreme policies to balance the budget and cut all those things in 
order to create that environment.
<P>
	I have articulated the government's position vis-à-vis an 
environment to promote job creation. I would like this member to 
tell this place exactly what elements of the environment he feels his 
party is shooting for.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member mentioned the word 
extreme. An extremist is anyone who happens to be winning an 
argument with a Liberal.
<P>
	I want to make sure the member understands and does not take 
too much credit where credit is not due. The reason interest rates 
have fallen to this point is because the economy is so soft. That is 
why there are tremendous unemployment problems in this country. 
That is why interest rates have continued to fall. Everyone would 
acknowledge that the economy has been extremely soft.
<P>
	Exports have done well because the dollar has been low but no 
one will say that the domestic economy has been anything but 
extremely soft. I do not think the hon. member should be taking too 
much pleasure in that fact. The same thing applies to inflation.
<P>
	I will answer the member's question very specifically by 
pointing to what the Government of New Brunswick has done. It 
has acknowledged that low interest rates  alone cannot fix the 
problem. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7398"> 7398 </A></B>
<P>
That is why that Liberal government has introduced income tax 
cuts.
<P>
	Note that it has a balanced budget. Note that it has the capacity to 
do that. Most people would acknowledge that Frank McKenna in 
New Brunswick has done a good job with that province. It should 
be a model for the federal government. Our approach parallels 
exactly what is being proposed in New Brunswick. When you give 
people more money for their pockets they will start to spend it. 
That will create jobs.
<P>
	The member talked about the fresh start plan.
<P>
<B>(1555 )</B>
<P>
	The fresh start plan will provide people with $15 billion in tax 
relief. It gives them more money in their pockets so they can go out 
and spend money in the economy, save for their retirement, look 
after their children's education, take a holiday once in awhile. It 
allows small businesses to create the jobs that are so necessary for 
the people, certainly of Atlantic Canada, Ontario, the prairies and 
British Columbia.
<P>
	People everywhere are suffering today under this government's 
policies. It is about time Canadians had the chance to take the 
dollars that the government uses right now and spend them on 
things that are their priorities, not the government's.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Mr. Speaker, following up on that, the member 
stated balancing the budget and after that they would lower taxes. 
However, he also said that 10 per cent unemployment is 
unacceptable. With the program he has outlined, he is prepared to 
suggest that Canadians should wait until the budget is balanced and 
taxes are reduced. When that is done then jobs will come.
<P>
	They cannot have it both ways. They cannot suck and blow at the 
same time. They cannot balance the budget and give tax cuts at the 
same time.
<P>
	The member has to answer the question. What is he going to do 
for Canadians to create an environment that will get Canadians 
working again? What elements is he going to create, not in two or 
three years from now, but today because that is exactly what he is 
asking of the government?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, in 1993 the government did promise 
jobs, jobs, jobs. Three years later those things have not happened.
<P>
	The evidence is clear. If one brings down a plan that clearly 
states that there will be a balanced budget and tax relief, the 
stimulus effect is immediate. There is evidence from around the 
world to demonstrate that is the case because finally investors have 
the confidence to begin spending again in the economy.
<P>
	We need not speculate about this. There are many examples 
around the world. Probably the best example is right here in 
Canada. When the Government of Alberta announced that it was 
going to balance the budget and  begin running surpluses, there was 
an immediate influxof investment into the economy because finally 
someone had a plan to deal with the problem, something that this 
government is missing.
<P>
	People are paying for it with their jobs. People are paying for it 
with lower standards of living. The average family has taken a 
$3,000 national pay cut since the government came to power 
according to the Fraser Institute. We have had a massive attack by 
the government on transfers to the provinces of $7 billion. This 
government has closed more hospitals than all of the provinces 
combined. That is unacceptable.
<P>
	That is the price of delay when the government cannot get its act 
together and recognize the importance of balancing the budget and 
starting to deal with the tremendous problems that were left not 
only by the Conservative government but by the Liberals before 
them as well.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roger Simmons (Burin-St. George's, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have my Christmas tie on because I am in a very 
Christmas mood. My friend from Medicine Hat has just had some 
things to say and I will be responding to some of those.
<P>
	Given the tone of his speech and watching the House during the 
afternoon, I wanted, in the Christmas spirit, to get something on the 
record.
<P>
	There was a party back in 1993 that was going to come here and 
do politics a new way, I say to my friend from Red Deer. I was 
excited and said: ``This is marvellous''. ``There will be no more 
shouting, no more screaming and no more nastiness,'' that party 
said. This is a light at the end of the tunnel. ``Rational debate. No 
talking out of both sides of your mouth,'' that party said. ``No 
maligning people. No character assassination''.
<P>
	In the Christmas mood, let us give them credit where credit is 
due. They have not shouted. I have not heard them scream once. 
Mr. Speaker, have you heard them malign anybody? Even this 
afternoon in the last speech, have you heard them malign anybody? 
Have you, Mr. Speaker, heard any character assassination? Have 
you heard them speaking out of both sides of their mouth on the 
issue? Let us have the Christmas spirit. Let us give credit where 
credit is due. If anybody has brought a new kind of politics, it is the 
people who said they would bring a new kind of politics.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	The member for Medicine Hat made a lot of sense. He said that 
words do not put food on the table. He is absolutely right. My 
friend from Bourassa is right. Words do not put food on the table.
<P>
	I will suggest something which does put food on the table, in a 
way. If a house mortgage is now $800 a month instead of a $1,000, 
I would suggest that the extra $200 could put some food on the 
table.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7399"> 7399 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> You would probably take it back in taxes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> Like I said, Mr. Speaker, no shouting. We have 
just heard from the no shouting party again.
<P>
	The extra 200 bucks could put some food on the table. Or maybe 
if a car payment is $250 instead of $275 or $300, thanks to low 
interest rates, the lowest interest rates in this country in over 40 
years, maybe that would put some food on the table.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Every country has lower interest rates.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> What will not put food on the table is all that 
shouting. That will not put any food on the table.
<P>
	Let me say it for them one more time slowly. All the shouting, all 
the screaming, all the maligning, all the character assassination, all 
the talking out of both sides of their mouths; none of the above 
would create one job in this country and none would put food on 
the table. Low interest rates will do it. They are doing it for people 
all across the country, particularly the 670,000 who have jobs 
because of the mandate of this government.
<P>
	Of course the hon. member for Medicine Hat is right. We have 
not employed everybody but there are 670,000 more jobs now than 
there would have been.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> What about taxes?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> Mr. Speaker, I cannot take this, all this business 
of attacking that party for shouting. Talk about spreading malicious 
lies about people. I want to come to their defence.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I have great 
respect for the hon. member who is speaking. I cannot imagine he 
implied that the Reform Party was spreading malicious lies. Out of 
respect, I would love to have him withdraw that statement.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The Chair did not catch that word. I 
wonder if the member would be kind enough to indicate what in 
fact he did say.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was viciously attacking all the 
people who go around suggesting that the Reform Party has not 
brought new politics to this place. I said that the people who 
suggested that are spreading malicious lies. We all know it is the 
non-shouting party. We all know it is the party that never maligns 
anybody.
<P>
	I want to talk about this marvellous report of the Standing 
Committee on Finance.
<P>
	I say to the hon. member for Medicine Hat that it is not the 
government, it is a committee of which he is a member. Not one 
single person on that committee, including my good friend from 
Willowdale, the chairperson, is a member of the administration. 
They are all MPs from various parties.
<P>
	That committee went to St. John's. When in St. John's it heard 
concerns from seniors and from small business. It heard concerns 
about youth and about job creation. It heard concerns about deficit 
reduction targets, social programs and the fishery. The hon. 
member for Medicine Hat, the hon. member for Willowdale and the 
other members of that committee from all parties heard those 
concerns. Then the committee responded to those concerns.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	On the issue of seniors, the report points out that as of the 1996 
budget, thanks to the Minister of Finance, those 60 and over, along 
with their spouses whatever their age, are guaranteed no less than 
current pension payments.
<P>
	On small business, the total lending ceiling under the Small 
Business Loans Act has been raised to $12 billion.
<P>
	For youth, over the next three years the government is going to 
put out $1.2 billion including an additional $350 million 
announced in the last budget a few months ago.
<P>
	On job creation, over 600,000 jobs have been created.
<P>
	On deficit reduction targets, we are meeting them and we are 
beating them. That is performance. Let us stop right there.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you are looking at a person who never particularly 
got his jollies out of deficit reduction. I had to tell you that. I have 
never seen deficit reduction as an end in itself. I never go to bed 
and say ``thank the dear Lord I have reduced the deficit some more 
today''. It is never in my prayers at night because it is not an end in 
itself. If it were an end in itself we should shut the government 
down and all go home.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> Mr. Speaker, you have to hand it to me, I know 
how it feels to the Reform crowd.
<P>
	Deficit reduction is not by itself an end in itself. It is just a very 
important, pivotal, crucial way to an end, but we should never lose 
sight of what the end is because the end is all about people. It is all 
about those 670,000 who got jobs in the last three years but it is 
also about those people, 10 per cent in some provinces, 25 per cent 
or so in parts of my province, those large numbers of people who 
are kind of camouflaged by near percentages, those people who are 
hurting every day because they do not have jobs.
<P>
	For them we must see to it that not only is the deficit reduced but 
that the interest rates are low, that they have more access to capital 
if they are in small business. If they cannot start a business because 
they do not have the first bit of capital we have to find a way to get 
them to a job so that they have an income. An $800 mortgage 
cannot be paid if there is no job in the first place to put food on the 
table.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
	For those who suggest that somehow with a wave of a magic 
wand suddenly all is right with the world, it does not work that 
way, even a couple of weeks before Christmas.
<P>
	I am sharing my time with my friend for Annapolis 
Valley-Hants. Before I sit down let me say I believe the 
committee, through its recommendations on children and poverty, 
people with disabilities, the old question of productivity, a better 
deal for the volunteer and charitable sectors, has done a marvellous 
job.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Murphy (Annapolis Valley-Hants, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak today on the 
prebudget debate, following my friend from Newfoundland who 
did an eloquent job. He did not need to put anybody down in doing 
it.
<P>
	I would like to congratulate the members of the finance 
committee for their comprehensive report and many excellent 
recommendations. The committee has tabled a thoughtful report 
and has offered many positive and tangible actions our government 
can take to help improve the economy and help reaffirm our 
commitment to the principles of social equity and fairness.
<P>
	When we look at the financial record of our government the 
numbers speak for themselves. Let us look at the facts. When our 
government took office the deficit was $42 billion, 6 per cent of our 
gross domestic product. In three years we have reduced that 
number to a figure below 3 per cent of GDP. Recently the Minister 
of Finance confirmed that this figure will be down to 1 per cent of 
GDP, or $9 billion, by the year 1998-99. This is significant because 
it will mean that our government will no longer have to borrow 
from the markets to fund the deficit. This, combined with low 
interest rates and a strong economic growth rate, will allow us as 
Canadians to have greater sovereignty over our economic affairs. 
As a result of our tough fiscal actions we now have broader options 
to set our own economic agenda rather than being at the mercy of 
international financial institutions.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	In the past, it would seem that the deficit targets were never met. 
Governments would table budgets offering rosy financial outlooks 
and would then proceed to miss their targets year after year.
<P>
	Our government, however, has reversed that trend. We are 
restoring Canada's fiscal credibility. Our government has shown 
that when we make a commitment, we keep it.
<P>
	There are two specific issues raised in the report that I would like 
to focus on, child poverty and the need for active job creation 
measures.
<P>
	In a country as prosperous as ours, it is unacceptable that 20 per 
cent of our children still live in poverty. I sit as a member of the 
Standing Committee on Health and in recent months we have been 
conducting a study on the  health of Canada's children. As part of 
our efforts we have heard from health groups and child advocacy 
organizations from across the country. These groups have raised 
many serious concerns and put forth many excellent 
recommendations.
<P>
	I am pleased, and I think many children's organizations will be 
pleased to see that the committee has recommended an increase in 
the working income supplement in order to target the children of 
working poor.
<P>
	The chair of the finance committee stated in his remarks in the 
House Monday that families among the working poor often have 
benefits of $3,000 a year less than those on social welfare. In many 
instances this creates a disincentive to work.
<P>
	I would strongly urge the Minister of Finance to accept this 
recommendation as a means of working to alleviate child poverty. 
But I do not believe that we can stop there.
<P>
	I want to take this further and recommend that our government 
target increased assistance toward federal programs that deal 
directly with the issue of child health and child poverty. One such 
program I am sure members are familiar with and which I believe 
is worthy of increased investment is the community action program 
for children, CAPC.
<P>
	I noticed in the finance report that the future of CAPC was 
addressed during public consultations. I agree with the 
recommendation that government funding intentions for CAPC be 
made clear and that the support for CAPC continue.
<P>
	In communities across Canada 450 community based groups are 
using CAPC dollars to provide families with parenting education 
and support and children with opportunities for early learning 
experiences. I have seen firsthand this program and how it 
strengthens families and helps children achieve their goals.
<P>
	However, in April 1997 the CAPC program is scheduled to face a 
51.9 per cent reduction in federal funding. This could in turn 
threaten the very viability of this program at the community level.
<P>
	Recently I hosted a meeting where members of the Nova Scotia 
Association of Family Resource Projects briefed members of 
Parliament about the important role CAPC programs play in their 
communities. At this meeting members of the organization played 
a cassette recording of comments by parents who have benefited 
from the program. There was no question in our minds that this 
cassette left members with a firm understanding of how a 
government can positively affect the day to day lives of people.
<P>
	I would like to read for my hon. colleagues one of the comments 
that I was particularly touched by. This message was left by a 
young mother of two. She said: ``I was trying to do the best I could 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7401"> 7401 </A></B>
<P>
with the resources I  had, but they were limited. I felt helpless not 
knowing where to find the skills, but I knew they were out there''.
<P>
<B>(1615 )</B>
<P>
	Once she started attending the family resource centre, a CAPC 
funded program, she said: ``I have learned so many new skills that I 
have been applying not only with our children but with other 
relationships in my life. Our family is much happier since I have 
been coming to the centre. I feel that the programming offered at 
the centre for our children is doing all that is necessary for our 
children to be prepared for school''.
<P>
	We are making a difference through programs such as CAPC. I 
would urge our government to commit targeted resources toward 
this program and other similar proactive programs aimed at 
assisting poor children and families. By focusing on the 
elimination of child poverty now, we are making a direct 
investment in our own future as a nation.
<P>
	I would now like to turn for a moment to the issue of job 
creation. In my riding of Annapolis Valley-Hants, job creation 
continues to be one of the most important concerns I am hearing. 
Even the finance committee's report states that Canada is faced 
with a situation where employment growth remains strong but 
unemployment continues to persist at unacceptably high rates.
<P>
	It is true that during the last three years jobs have been created. 
At last report there were some 670,000 new jobs created in Canada. 
While this is no small number, unemployment numbers across the 
country clearly show us that more needs to be done. I believe in the 
position put forward by our government that our primary 
responsibility is to create the right economic climate for job 
growth.
<P>
	When I say that our government must play a greater role in job 
creation, I am not referring to costly short term, make work 
projects that have little long term benefit. Instead our government 
must continue to focus on creating new partnerships with the 
private sector, research and educational institutions and other 
levels of government. We need to be an active partner in those 
areas where we can help create new jobs.
<P>
	A perfect example of this type of partnership is the national 
infrastructure program. The first tripartite agreement was a 
tremendous success. In my riding of Annapolis Valley-Hants a 
total of $22.3 million was invested in order to address local 
priorities. This program showed that when governments are 
working to achieve common goals, our communities reap the 
benefits from this co-operative spirit.
<P>
	I was pleased therefore to see that in the finance committee's 
report there is a recommendation calling for a new infrastructure 
program. I was also pleased that as a part of this program the 
committee has recommended that we refocus our infrastructure 
dollars toward research  and development. This is a 
recommendation I fully support.
<P>
	I would like to also add that as well as partnering with 
universities and health institutions, we should focus greater 
attention on R and D in the agriculture and natural resources 
sectors. These sectors are extremely important to rural 
communities like those in my riding of Annapolis Valley-Hants.
<P>
	As well focus must be given to our transportation and 
communication infrastructures. This is particularly true in Atlantic 
Canada. By focusing more attention to these areas we can help 
create sustainable jobs in our rural communities.
<P>
	There is a lot more I would like to say on this issue but I see that 
my time is running short. I will close by once again commending 
the work of the finance committee and the many excellent 
recommendations it has put forward. This document offers a 
thoughtful analysis of the many serious issues still facing our 
government and all Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want 
to congratulate the member for Annapolis Valley-Hants for his 
thoughtful comments and remarks.
<P>
	It is very difficult for a member to talk about his or her own work 
but other members can. I would like to let the hon. member's 
constituents know that he has been one of the leading spokesmen in 
this place about family, children and has been an advocate on 
behalf of the CAPC initiative. He shared that experience and 
expertise within his riding with other members so that they could 
see the valuable contribution that makes to the strengthening of our 
families and children. I congratulate him on the excellent work he 
has done on behalf of this place.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	My question has to do with the infrastructure program. I concur 
with the member that it has been helpful. Would the member care 
to elaborate a little on the initial infrastructure program that the 
government had and the contribution it made to his area? Maybe he 
could give some ideas on the specific things that might be of 
benefit to his constituency.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Murphy</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his kind 
remarks.
<P>
	The infrastructure program in my riding was very successful. 
The major success was that it built some infrastructure to help draw 
in new companies and industry to our area. That is very important. 
The infrastructure program is not meant just to create short term 
jobs; it is to set a tone, to set an infrastructure foundation for future 
growth and development. It did that in our area.
<P>
	We worked very closely together. The communities and the 
municipalities chose the direction in which they  wanted to go and I 
was there to help them do it. I went to every one of the chambers 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7402"> 7402 </A></B>
<P>
and talked about the infrastructure program with them. I heard 
what their priorities were and acted on them.
<P>
	For the future, yes, we want to talk about partnering with 
universities and hospitals, partnering with provincial and 
municipal governments. But there is another aspect I would like to 
see us get into, which is the whole area of being in partnership with 
businesses. We could help businesses build their infrastructure so 
that they could employ more people with more sustainable jobs. 
That would be a really helpful endeavour for instance in my riding 
of Annapolis Valley-Hants.
<P>
	I look forward to the government coming forward and initiating 
this project so that we can do what we said we would do and 
continue to do what we have been doing, which is creating jobs and 
economic development.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to participate in this debate on the prebudget report. Naturally, I 
support the Bloc's dissenting opinion expressed in the report of the 
Standing Committee on Finance entitled ``The 1997 Budget and 
Beyond: Finish the Job''.
<P>
	This government has made unprecedented cuts in health, social 
assistance and higher education, but we still have double digit 
unemployment. Compared to the 1989 employment situation, we 
are still 925,000 jobs short. The federal government is forcing the 
jobless onto welfare and forcing the provinces to make the most 
difficult choices in its place. We will recall that Liberals ran on a 
platform of ``jobs, jobs, jobs''.
<P>
	Today, three years into the Liberal government's mandate, the 
unemployment rate, at more than 10 per cent, remains outrageously 
high, roughly double the American rate. We must recognize that, in 
the area of employment, this government's record is poor. I 
watched, last night, the Prime Minister's interview on the CBC. 
Several questions were about Canada's high unemployment rate. 
We heard accounts of the hardship individuals and families are 
going through across Canada today. The CBC itself just announced 
job cuts affecting more than 1,000 people.
<P>
	It should be pointed out that the cost of high unemployment has 
become huge, totalling some $91 billion a year. This figure, taken 
from a study conducted by the Department of Human Resources 
Development, includes the costs of lost productivity and crime, 
health costs and all the social costs associated with an employment 
crisis.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	One of the social costs associated with the situation the jobless 
are in is malnutrition, which can result in chronic illness. 
Unemployment can also cause severe stress in  some individuals, 
as well as mental disorders, alcoholism, suicide, accidents and 
heart disease.
<P>
	These social and health problems associated with unemployment 
represent additional costs to the federal government. In the end, the 
taxpayers have to foot the bill for this increase in costs. We find 
ourselves in a situation where not only citizens are provided with 
fewer and fewer services by the government, but they are paying 
more and more taxes.
<P>
	I agree with eliminating the deficit and putting the federal 
government's financial house in order. But I disagree with the way 
the government is going about it. They are penalizing the 
unemployed, welfare recipients, seniors, immigrants and the most 
disadvantaged in our society, while at the same time protecting and 
favouring the wealthy.
<P>
	More than five million Canadians are living below the poverty 
line, including more than 1.5 million children. I should point out 
that 1996 was designated International Anti-Poverty Year by the 
United Nations. Yet, poverty is growing in Canada.
<P>
	The government tells us that fighting poverty, particularly 
among children, is one of its priorities. Let us not forget, however, 
that the federal government's Canada social transfer cuts have 
increased poverty among children and adults alike. This indicates 
that the government's choices are not consistent with the objectives 
of employment and fairness that it claims to be pursuing.
<P>
	I also condemn once again the decision to use accumulated 
surpluses in the employment insurance fund to reduce the deficit. 
The government is reducing its deficit by about $5 billion every 
year by dipping into this fund, to which only workers and 
employers contribute so they can have a social safety net.
<P>
	By reducing the accessibility and duration of benefits, the 
federal government deprives a considerable number of claimants 
from money they have already paid into the fund. This is a 
disgrace.
<P>
	The situation will get worse as of January 1, 1997, with the 
implementation of new drastic unemployment insurance measures. 
The unemployed and their families will have a rough winter.
<P>
	The Liberal majority report mentions that the technical 
committee on corporate taxation will only submit its report by the 
end of 1997. This committee is not at all impartial. Indeed, it is 
made up of experts from the private sector whose role is to provide 
advice to major corporations on how to pay the smallest amount of 
tax possible. Some of these members are clearly in a conflict of 
interest.
<P>
	The government has shown that it has a soft spot for major 
corporations. These are almost unaffected by cuts made to improve 
the state of public finances. By contrast,  the federal government 
cuts into social programs and targets workers' rights. The only 
protection for wage earners is their right to collective bargaining, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7403"> 7403 </A></B>
<P>
particularly under the Canada Labour Code. However, this right has 
been violated by the government on a number of occasions.
<P>
	In the dispute opposing Canadian International and the Canadian 
Auto Workers union, the CAW, the government once again sided 
with the employer. The labour minister unduly interfered in the 
union's internal affairs. It bypassed the action of CAW's 
democratically elected leaders by exerting unwarranted pressure 
and threatening to invoke some obscure section of the Canada 
Labour Code to force them to hold a vote on major wage 
concessions.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	A duly signed collective agreement is in effect between the 
parties. For political reasons, and to favour Canadian International, 
a western company whose head office is in Calgary, the 
government resorted to political interference and forced the union 
to hold a vote. I hope this government will have the courage to 
demand from Canadian International officials a restructuring plan 
that will protect the jobs of its 16,000 employees.
<P>
	I want to salute the courage of CAW's leaders, who stood up to 
the company and to the government. I also condemn the unjust 
attacks in this House by the leader and the reform members against 
this union, and particularly against its president, Buzz Hargrove, 
who is defending the legitimate interests of those of his members 
employed by Canadian International. These employees have 
already taken several pay cuts to keep this airline afloat.
<P>
	As for the overhaul of the taxation system for corporations and 
for individuals, the government does not seem to be in any hurry. It 
does, however, seem to be in quite a rush to reduce UI benefits and 
transfer payments to the provinces for health, higher education and 
social assistance.
<P>
	The federal government must clean up its own act and reduce its 
own spending. There are still too many examples of taxpayers' 
money being wasted or used inefficiently. This is why, year after 
year, the auditor general criticizes billions in unnecessary 
spending, and tax loopholes.
<P>
	For over three years now, the Bloc Quebecois has been 
condemning family trusts and tax havens. It has been calling for an 
overhaul of the Canadian corporate taxation system. Federal tax 
revenue from corporate taxation has dropped considerably in the 
last 30 years, going from 23 per cent in 1961 to 9 per cent in 1995.
<P>
	In addition, Canada is one of the G-7 countries where 
corporations pay the least tax. Its taxes are also well below the 
average for OECD countries. The same also holds for Quebec. The 
tax rate on profits is lower than  elsewhere. The impact of federal 
cutbacks on Quebec is substantial. These cuts are reflected in a 
major shortfall in revenue for this province, estimated at $16.3 
billion for the period from 1982-83 to 1995-96.
<P>
	Quebec will suffer cuts totalling $636 million in 1996-97 and 
$1.2 billion in 1997-98. If the federal government had not 
offloaded its deficit since the early 1980s, Quebec would now have 
a balanced budget.
<P>
	These federal cuts dramatically reduce the resources available to 
the Quebec government to pay for the social programs its 
population needs. I want to take this opportunity to condemn the 
attitude of a government that has laid off 45,000 employees in the 
federal public service. And for many years, it has refused to 
increase the salaries of its remaining employees.
<P>
	I hope that the upcoming negotiations with the Public Service 
Alliance of Canada will lead the government to grant reasonable 
salary increases. In March 1997, the Public Service Alliance of 
Canada's 135,000 members will start their negotiations with 
Treasury Board. For six years, salaries have been frozen, there have 
been cuts in service and a huge reduction in the number of 
employees. They are asking for wage increases, the introduction of 
wage equity, reinstatement of the guidelines on workforce 
adjustment, employee training, and so forth.
<P>
	I would also like to say a few words about the incredible salaries 
of business leaders, salaries we can only dream of.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	The president of a large company earns more than the President 
of the United States and the Prime Minister of Canada. They make 
at least $300,000 or $400,000 a year, in addition to all their other 
advantages. And these advantages are often considerable: stock 
options, production bonuses and premiums, social benefits, and so 
forth.
<P>
	I would like to give a few examples of well-heeled executives, 
and that is an understatement. The president of the National Bank, 
Mr. Bérard, takes home an annual salary of $1.4 million, while his 
counterpart at the CIBC had a salary of $1.83 million in 1995. 
Laurent Beaudoin, the president of Bombardier, earned a total of 
$19.1 million, one of the highest compensation packages in the 
country. This $19.1 million includes a salary of $900,000, a bonus 
of $525,000 and $17.5 million in profits on options. The former 
president of Bombardier, Raymond Boyer, received an annual 
salary of $7 million, including $5.9 million in profits on options.
<P>
	Frank Stronach, founding president of Magna International, 
made $47.2 million in 1995, including option profits worth $32.3 
million. Gérald Pencer of Cott Corporation received $13 million, 
including option profits worth $12.5 million. David Walsh of 
Bre-X Minerals Ltd. got $10 million, all in stock options.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7404"> 7404 </A></B>
<P>
	There are more heads of companies who earned very attractive 
salaries, often more than $1 million per year. These include 
William Doyle and Charles Childers of Potash Sales Ltd.; Pudy 
Crawford at Imasco; George Petty, Repap Enterprises Inc.; James 
Dougham of Stone Consolidated Corporation; Larry Solari of 
Domtar, and so forth.
<P>
	According to a study of 268 corporations whose shares are 
traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange, the presidents and CEOs 
received an average salary of $776,000 last year. This is an increase 
of 32 per cent over 1993 and 12.6 per cent over 1994.
<P>
	These incredible salaries are huge, compared with the earnings 
of those who work for the minimum wage, which varies between 
$5 and $7 per hour, depending on the province. These differences 
are out of all proportion.
<P>
	The extremely high salaries of heads of companies are also a 
strange contrast with the social conditions of the unemployed and 
welfare recipients. While the first group lives in luxury, the second 
is working very hard just trying to find ways to survive each day.
<P>
	This government's first priority should be to shrink the huge 
abyss separating the richest and the poorest. This concern must 
always be taken into account when difficult choices are made about 
reducing the deficit. The government must have the courage to ask 
the upper strata of society to make a little effort to help reduce the 
debt. This in turn would mean that fewer Canadians and Quebecers 
would be living in abject poverty.
<P>
	On December 1, I held a brunch with the theme of social 
solidarity in my riding of Bourassa. More than 300 persons 
attended. They came from very poor backgrounds, community 
organizations, the Montreal North AQDR, business and unions. 
The subject was sharing the wealth and protecting workers and 
social benefits.
<P>
	We had distinguished speakers. Clément Godbout, the president 
of the FTQ, spoke of workers' rights, as did Monique Simard, and 
Jean Campeau, a former Quebec minister of finance. I discussed 
the issue of social solidarity and the solidarity of the people of 
Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	I invited the federal government to use this solidarity to revive 
the economy and especially to create jobs. The speakers also 
criticized the huge profits of Canadian banks: over $6 billion for 
the six main banks.
<P>
	On the other hand, cuts are being made to welfare, 
unemployment insurance, the system of subsidies, and so on. 
Things are tough. On the eve of Christmas, many people will be 
unable to buy gifts and to partake in the festivities.
<P>
	In closing, I would first like to wish Merry Christmas to all my 
constituents in Montreal North and to the people, immigrants, 
seniors, young people and those hardest hit especially.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when 
my colleague across the way began his speech he said he endorses 
the dissenting report of the Bloc Quebecois in the report of the 
finance committee. In looking at this report, while the Bloc 
Quebecois endorses the move to eliminate the deficit and to 
rationalize the federal government's public finances, it disapproves 
of the government's way of reaching the ends.
<P>
	I looked at the report to see how the Bloc would eliminate the 
deficit. One of the recommendations is to increase the transfers to 
the provinces, which actually increases the deficit. The Bloc wants 
to reduce individual taxes which would increase the deficit. It is to 
stop using the notional surplus in the UI fund, some $5 billion, to 
apply against the deficit. This again is an increase in the deficit. 
Finally, there was a recommendation to start fighting child poverty 
which is to spend money through various programs. All of those 
increase the deficit.
<P>
	On the other side, there were two items. The first one was to 
increase corporate taxes by some $3 billion, but it goes on to state 
that the $3 billion should be spent on job creation initiatives. The 
final item is basically cutting government spending.
<P>
	If the corporate tax increase is not available to reduce the deficit 
and all the other items in fact increase the deficit, I wonder if the 
member would care to outline for the House exactly what he is 
going to cut to cover the $15 billion-plus increase in the deficit that 
his party is proposing.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunez:</B> Mr. Speaker, as I said, I support the minority report 
tabled by the Bloc Quebecois and every measure contained in it. 
The hon. member wants to know where the money required to 
finance federal spending will come from. I am telling you where to 
cut: in tax shelters. We have condemned such shelters. Family 
trusts are a disgrace and should be eliminated as soon as possible.
<P>
	Also, all the unnecessary expenditures identified by the auditor 
general in his report must be cut. More cuts are required in defence. 
The cold war has been over for quite some time. A more equitable 
tax system must be developed and we do not think the government 
should use the $5 billion UI fund surplus to finance its deficit. That 
money is not theirs to begin with. It belongs to those who have 
contributed to the unemployment insurance fund, that is to say 
employers and employees, and only to them.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7405"> 7405 </A></B>
<P>
	For these reasons, once again, I commend our finance critic for 
presenting such a fine report.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for St. 
Boniface.
<P>
	I appreciate the opportunity to participate in this prebudget 
debate. The government has done a good job of getting our finances 
back on track. The deficit has been reduced from $42 billion to $24 
billion in 1996-97, and it is a projected $17 billion in 1997-98. 
These numbers are as a result of a concerted effort implemented 
over a gradual period but it must be acknowledged that many 
Canadians have sacrificed to get there. Before I get into just who 
they are, I would like to also point out that there are parties present 
in the House today who would have moved faster and cut deeper, 
given the chance.
<P>
	I look at the campaign that we all waged some three years ago 
and both the Progressive Conservative Party and the Reform Party 
pledged to eliminate the deficit inside the first term. I recall during 
a budget debate more recently when the leader of the Progressive 
Conservative Party specifically demanded that we cut deeper and 
faster, again repeating the expressed position that we should 
eliminate the deficit inside our first term in office. This course of 
action would have left devastation throughout the regions most 
affected by the reduction of government services such as the 
Atlantic region.
<P>
	Now that we have made some progress, real progress in the area 
of deficit reduction, we need to start focusing on the future instead 
of focusing on the problems of the past. We also have to recognize 
that some problems have been neglected as we have pursued deficit 
reduction. We have to start working for those people, poor children 
and Canadians with disabilities to name just two groups.
<P>
	I recently hosted a public policy forum in my riding of 
Fredericton-York-Sunbury to deal specifically with the budget. 
The discussion included questions around the deficit, the role of the 
private and public sectors with respect to economic growth and the 
harmonized sales tax.
<P>
	The majority of individuals at the forum expressed the view that 
the country's social safety net cannot stand another round of cuts, 
that the government has cut those kinds of expenditures as much as 
it can. They proposed that we must now look at high end tax reform 
as there is a sense that many large corporations and Canadians at 
higher income levels are not paying their fair share.
<P>
	Discussions around the role of the public and private sectors in 
the economy focused on whose role it is to create jobs and how to 
do it. Forum members suggested that the government does have a 
role to play in intervening in the economy to protect disadvantaged  
Canadians and disadvantaged regions, to show leadership in 
dealing with global adjustment, school to work transition and 
lifelong learning.
<P>
	Since the traditional safety net perhaps is not as comprehensive 
as it once was, we need to create an environment that will produce 
equality of opportunity. We have to start dealing with the problems 
of child poverty. We need to address the unique obstacles faced by 
persons with disabilities on a daily basis.
<P>
	The government needs to make sure that the country is working 
for everybody. In other words, the role of the state is an active one. 
It is to mitigate the inequity of the market for underprivileged 
children, seniors, middle aged persons with disabilities. We have 
an obligation to intervene on behalf of those less likely to succeed 
in a market driven, survival of the fittest world.
<P>
	This flies in the face of the ideologies of both the Reform Party 
and the Progressive Conservative Party which have said that the 
government should get out of the face of Canadians, that the market 
will correct itself. That will undoubtedly succeed for some, those 
who are active participants in and beneficiaries of a purely market 
driven system, but I ask: Is the government's job to work for those 
individuals or for the individuals for whom the market does not 
work? This is a fundamental question, one that these two 
opposition parties should stop and ask themselves.
<P>
	When many of us on this side of the House were agonizing over 
the impact of the deficit reduction imperative, lobbying internally 
and fighting the good fight, the right wing parties insisted that we 
were not cutting quickly or deeply enough. Now that the economy 
is getting back on track, they have the unmitigated gall to complain 
that we are not spending enough, a position that pushes hypocrisy 
to a new level.
<P>
	I want to reiterate that I believe there is a time for deficit 
reduction. After the last election our debt was at an all-time high. 
We were spending far more than we were taking in. This needed to 
be dealt with so that we could reclaim our sovereignty and stop 
looking over our shoulder at those threatening to take over our 
finances.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	As we reclaim our fiscal sovereignty, we can now institute the 
programs that help those most in need without having to spend all 
our energy focused on interest rates. In other words, we see light at 
the end of the tunnel. We must restore the faith that Canadians have 
in us that we are going to be dealing with those social imperatives.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I would like to bring to your attention an issue 
which I know is very important to you, Canadians with disabilities. 
I had the good fortune of recently chairing a task force that looked 
at the issue of how the Government of Canada should intervene in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7406"> 7406 </A></B>
<P>
our society to make life fairer and more equal for Canadians with 
disabilities.
<P>
	The government task force produced a report which calls on the 
government to consider 52 recommendations which included 
dealing with the cost of disability, allowing Canadians with 
disabilities to have more access to the workplace, and tax measures 
that would underwrite the cost of disabilities to a large extent by 
the government. Basically, it was to see to it that Canadians with 
disabilities have the same shot at the quality of life Canada is 
prosperous enough to offer to all.
<P>
	I welcome the opportunity to speak to an issue I know is 
important to all of us. I urge the government to take very seriously 
the recommendations of our task force report. I also suggest that 
we take every opportunity to use whatever capacity has been 
generated by our good management to see that Canadians who have 
suffered during this fiscal imperative have their needs attended to.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 
38, to inform the House that the questions to be raised tonight at the 
time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. member for 
Saint-Jean-retired Singer employees; the hon. member for 
Bourassa-immigration.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (St. Boniface, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to take part in this important pre-budget debate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As a member of the Standing Committee on Finance I was very 
closely involved in the prebudget consultations. I am proud to be a 
member of the government which opened up the budgetary process 
to Canadians in an unprecedented fashion. The Minister of Finance 
is to be commended for having undertaken this innovative 
initiative which has been done since 1993. It was exceptionally 
well done again this year.
<P>
	The finance committee was split into two groups. The western 
wing which covered the western provinces was headed by the able 
parliamentarian from Essex-Windsor, the vice chair of the 
committee. The eastern wing was headed by the chair of the 
committee, the member for Willowdale.
<P>
	We heard from over 300 associations and individuals and 
received numerous representations from people from all walks of 
life. Therein lies the strength. We heard from people not only from 
every geographical region but virtually from every single segment 
of society. They told us what they thought ought to be in the next 
budget.
<P>
	Hearings were held in Ottawa and across the country. By holding 
hearings locally we were able to make the consultative process that 
much more accessible. In addition, the finance committee agreed to 
split in two, as I indicated. This was extremely useful because we 
were  able to spend a full week on the road to hear Canadians, quite 
apart from the many meetings that we had here in Ottawa.
<P>
	One consistent theme to the testimony was the support of 
Canadians for the government to finish the job that had been 
started. Canadians know we must continue to meet and surpass our 
deficit targets then move forward to begin to pay down the debt.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The committee is in favour of adopting the objective proposed 
by the Minister of Finance to bring the deficit back to $9 billion, or 
1 per cent of GDP by 1998-99.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	To date as we all know, the government has successfully met and 
exceeded its deficit targets.
<P>
<B>(1655 )</B>
<P>
	We recognize that these have been difficult times for all 
Canadians. However it is imperative that we work toward a more 
affordable and efficient government and an era of sustainable 
government programs. It is critical that our deficit targets be met so 
that we can start working on the debt.
<P>
	During the consultations Canadians gave us guidance, a 
framework from which to work and to build for the future. 
Canadians made their priorities clear. They want us to begin 
addressing problems that have been neglected in the past in order to 
build on our future.
<P>
	I will focus my discussion on a number of areas of priority that 
were mentioned by Canadians. I would suggest that the opposition 
parties would do well to listen to what is being said because they 
might glean some valuable insights that could help them make 
some constructive suggestions to the government as opposed to 
continually whining, berating and denigrating the excellent work of 
the Minister of Finance and the government in this area.
<P>
	Priority areas of concern are those issues which came up time 
and time again during the consultative process. Those are the areas 
that we need to build upon for the future. The committee believes 
that action needs to be taken in future budgets. However, actions 
taken must be within the context of our ongoing commitment to 
meeting and surpassing our deficit targets, dealing with the issue of 
our enormous debt, the restoration of our fiscal health and I 
reiterate, finishing the job we started.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The committee recommends that Revenue Canada determine the 
changes to be made to the earned income supplement, to make it 
easier to adjust to changes in the employment situation of parents, 
and to provide assistance when needed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7407"> 7407 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In 1989 the House of Commons unanimously approved a motion 
seeking to eliminate poverty among Canadian children by the year 
2000. The committee very strongly believes that assisting children 
in poverty must be the main priority of government. We need to 
find a way to speed up the way in which resources get to those that 
need them.
<P>
	A good example is the working income supplement. Currently 
this benefit is based on the previous year's income. As a result it is 
not responsive to changing circumstances, not as much as they 
ought to be, and we need to rectify this situation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The committee congratulates the federal task force on people 
with disabilities for its excellent work and recommends the 
inclusion, in the next budget, of measures that will take into 
account the additional costs incurred by people with disabilities.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I had an opportunity to meet with my hon. colleague the member 
for Fredericton-York-Sunbury concerning the task force report. 
I must commend him and his colleagues for their excellent 
thorough report. What I took away from that meeting above all else 
is that Canadians living with a disability almost always have 
additional costs. Within federal jurisdiction we should take action 
in the area of tax policy to deal with this situation. In addition, any 
actions in the area of tax policy should be in support of the social 
policy objectives of inclusion, independence and productivity.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The committee recommends a significant increase in the support 
provided to literacy organizations under the National Literacy 
Secretariat, which currently stands at $22.3 million per year.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	During the consultations we heard from witnesses that the 
changing economy is demanding ever higher levels of literacy from 
all working Canadians. Our future will require workers, managers 
and executives with higher skills that are required today and 
constant upgrading I might add. Literacy is an essential tool in such 
a knowledge based economy and more so than ever before. Our 
challenge is to provide literacy and learning for all because without 
these tools workers and employers will fall behind their 
competitors. We believe that this problem can be addressed 
through partnerships with every sector of society, co-ordinated 
through the efforts of the National Literacy Secretariat.
<P>
	Subsequent to the release of the prebudget report, I have 
received a congratulatory letter concerning literacy from Frontier 
College which reads in part: ``This is great news. This is the 
knowledge and information age and every Canadian must be able 
to read and write well in order to be part of it-.The finance 
committee gave us the assurance that we will have the resources to 
continue this fight''.
<P>
	There are a number of other such letters from members of other 
communities who felt that this prebudget report was of first quality 
and addressed the needs of Canadians. I would be delighted to 
share those with all of my colleagues.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Tuition fees are increasing everywhere in the country. The 
committee made three recommendations.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	These recommendations dealt with carrying forward tuition fees 
as deductions against future income, doubling the $500 exemption 
for scholarship, fellowship and bursary income, and special 
opportunity grants being provided for students with parental 
responsibilities. These recommendations recognize that an 
investment in education is an investment in our future. Research 
and development was recognized as key to Canada's ability to 
compete in the global economy.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The committee recommends that priority be given to increasing 
the funding of granting councils such as the Natural Sciences and 
Engineering Research Council, the Social Sciences and Humanities 
Research Council, and the Medical Research Council.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The committee recognized the important work and the unique 
opportunities provided by the Networks of Centres of Excellence 
program. It recommended the renewal of the program for a third 
term.
<P>
	Recommendations were made on the implementation of a 
second, more modest national infrastructure program. The 
committee recognized the great success of the first infrastructure 
program. Support was given for the second program which is well 
directed and available to traditional infrastructure projects such as 
waste treatment, water supply, transportation, et cetera, as well as 
to health care and educational institutions. Support for health care 
and educational institutions represents a long term contribution to 
Canada's overall level of productivity and our long term prospects 
for high level, high knowledge jobs.
<P>
	We recognize the importance of charities and the voluntary 
sector. The committee had a number of recommendations 
concerning endowments, bequests, corporate donations, stretch 
proposals, withholding taxes, community economic development, 
program related investment and taxpayer awareness.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7408"> 7408 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	To conclude on this issue, the committee believes that its 
proposals to increase tax incentives for charitable donations will 
help correct the imbalance resulting from the reduction of direct 
subsidies, and it recommends that these proposals be implemented.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We recognize the important role played by charities in our 
communities. We recognize the need to help them find sources of 
additional resources in a fiscally responsible manner and the role 
the government can play. I received a letter from an organization 
called Heritage Canada. It congratulates the committee for its 
recommendations in the area of charities: ``Recommendations in 
the area of charitable giving are similarly welcome. Greater 
incentives to encourage more in the way of personal and corporate 
giving could clearly have a beneficial impact on the heritage 
field''.
<P>
	At a town hall meeting in my riding I had the opportunity to meet 
with members of my community, my advisory committee. Their 
recommendations were not unlike others. Constituents are 
supportive of our fiscal goals and deficit reduction targets. They 
want us to invest strategically in the future, in our young people 
and in certain research that could be value added. They want to 
make sure that universities and community colleges are not 
neglected. They want increased R and D funding that will create 
better jobs and a better quality of life for all Canadians. They urged 
us not to forget small and medium size business and they wanted to 
be sure that we considered another modest infrastructure program.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to participate in this prebudget debate with two 
objects in mind, first to outline an alternative federal budget which 
would give Canada a fresh start for the 21st century, and second to 
define two distinctively different approaches which members of 
this House can take to the prebudget debate and the budget debate 
next spring. One approach is essentially negative and reactionary. 
The other approach is positive and constructive.
<P>
	The people of Canada long for a federal budget that delivers high 
growth rates, many more jobs, higher incomes and increased 
personal security. Canadians want a federal budget that vastly 
accelerates job creation. Under this government we have 1.5 
million unemployed, a youth unemployment rate of over 17 per 
cent, two million to three million underemployed people and one 
out of four workers afraid for the future of their jobs.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	Canadians want a federal budget that strengthens social security 
because under both Liberal and Tory administrations, federal 
support of health, education and old age security has deteriorated in 
absolute terms.
<P>
	Under the current administration, for example, federal health 
care spending has been reduced by over $3 billion and reform of 
the Canada pension plan languished while government members 
preoccupied themselves with revamping the MP pension plan.
<P>
	Canadians want a federal budget that reduces federal debt and 
increases personal incomes. Why? Under Liberal and Tory 
administration the federal debt has risen to over $600 billion while 
the disposable income of the average Canadian family has declined 
by $3,000 over the last three years.
<P>
	High taxes kill jobs. Tax relief for consumers and private sector 
job creators creates jobs. Thus, Canada needs a federal budget that 
clearly establishes the link between job creation and tax relief and 
that makes tax relief, not further tax increases, a national priority.
<P>
	Canadians need a federal budget that aims at federal surpluses, 
not further deficits. Why? Surpluses make possible reinvestment in 
those social programs like health care that have been cripples by 
cuts, and only with federal surpluses can one start making progress 
on debt retirement.
<P>
	Because the federal budget that the Canadian people need is so 
much different from the budgets that have been produced thus far 
by the government, Reformers produced an alternative budget plan 
in our fresh start platform.
<P>
	That fresh start budget calls for five actions. Number one, 
balance the federal budget by 1999, a faster timetable than that 
pursued by the government.
<P>
	Number two, aim for surpluses after 1999, with the size of those 
surpluses increasing each year.
<P>
	Number three, from those surpluses use $5 billion to $10 billion 
as initial down payment on the federal debt, with some fixed 
proportion of future surpluses being devoted to debt retirement.
<P>
	Number four, increase federal transfers to the provinces for 
health and education by $4 billion per year.
<P>
	Number five, provide up to $15 billion in broad based tax relief 
through seven specific tax relief measures, all targeted to increase 
consumer spending, raise the disposable income of families and 
stimulate job creation by private sector job creators.
<P>
	That is the kind of federal budget Canada needs. It is the budget 
described not in the government's prebudget document but in 
Reform's fresh start platform.
<P>
	This prebudget debate and the budget debate next spring will be 
a prelude to the 1997 federal election debate. There are two 
distinctively different approaches which members on both sides of 
the House can take.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7409"> 7409 </A></B>
<P>
	On the one hand, there is the negative and reactionary approach 
to ideas for improving Canada's budgetary situation, an approach 
which has unfortunately been taken so far by the Minister of 
Finance.
<P>
	For example, on page 18 of our fresh start platform Reform 
presented a proposal for increasing, not decreasing, federal funding 
for health care and education by $4 billion a year and presented a 
budgetary strategy for doing that.
<P>
	How has the government reacted to this proposal? The finance 
minister stood in this House and charged the Reform Party with 
wanting to eliminate health care. In other words, the response of 
the government and the finance minister to one of our principle 
budgetary proposals was reactionary, 100 per cent negative, and in 
this case 100 per cent false.
<P>
	On page 19 of our fresh start platform the Reform Party drew the 
attention of Canadians to the critical state of the Canada pension 
plan and put forward a four point plan to rescue the Canada pension 
plan from 30 years of Liberal and Tory mismanagement.
<P>
	That rescue plan for CPP calls for guaranteeing that every citizen 
who is a senior receives every penny he or she is entitled to under 
CPP.
<P>
<B>(1710 )</B>
<P>
	It proposes to extend the principle of RRSPs, personalized tax 
sheltered retirement income savings accounts, to lower income 
workers. It proposes to reduce poverty among elderly widows and 
widowers by allowing funds from a deceased person's RRSP to be 
transferred to the surviving spouse tax free.
<P>
	Yet on November 18 the finance minister replied to a question 
from the hon. member for Beaver River, a member who has public 
credibility on the subject of pension reform because she opted out 
of the obscene MP pension plan. In his reply the minister made the 
astounding statement that Reform stood for abolishing the Canada 
pension plan. Again, that is a reactionary statement which is 
completely negative and 100 per cent false.
<P>
	On pages 7 to 11 of our fresh start program Reform puts forward 
a budgetary plan containing the most comprehensive proposals for 
tax relief and job creation through tax relief ever presented in this 
Chamber. Six of our seven specific tax relief measures, over 90 per 
cent of the $15 billion in tax relief offered by Reform's program, 
are aimed directly at lower income and middle income Canadians.
<P>
	Reform's proposals to raise the personal and spousal income tax 
exemptions provide tax relief to every Canadian, especially lower 
and middle income Canadians. More than 1.2 million low income 
Canadians would be removed from the tax rolls altogether.
<P>
	Under Reform's tax relief measures an average family earning 
$30,000 per year would have its federal taxes cut by 89 per cent. 
Under Reform's plan a single mother with one child and an 
allowable child care expense of $4,000 per year would have her 
federal taxes cut by 100 per cent.
<P>
	Yet what is the reaction of the Prime Minister, the finance 
minister, the Liberal government to these proposals? In Toronto the 
Prime Minister declared that there would be no national tax relief 
for Canadians under his administration. The Liberal government 
completely opposes faster deficit reduction so that tax relief and 
debt retirement can come about more quickly. The government is 
against increasing the personal exemption for every federal income 
taxpayer, as Reform proposes. The government is against 
increasing the spousal exemption and changing the child care tax 
deduction, as Reform proposes. In other words, it is against 
providing broad based tax relief to families and against making the 
tax system neutral with respect to the form of child care chosen.
<P>
	The government is opposed to substantive cuts to payroll taxes 
and capital gains taxes, as Reform proposes, tax cuts designed to 
put more dollars into the hands of private sector job creators.
<P>
	The government wants to retain the Tory 3 per cent and 5 per 
cent surtaxes, so bitterly criticized by Liberal MPs when they were 
in opposition, rather than remove them, as Reform proposes.
<P>
	On November 18 in the House the finance minister even went so 
far as to describe the Reform Party's tax relief package as a tax cut 
for the rich. That can be found on page 6366 of <I>Hansard</I>. Again, a 
reactionary and negative statement, and one that is 100 per cent at 
variance with the facts.
<P>
	What we have here is an approach to budgetary proposals from 
the government which is completely reactionary and negative. I 
frankly fear where this approach is going to lead. It is my 
experience that once a debate on any subject becomes completely 
negative and reactionary, and particularly when that approach is 
taken by people in positions of responsibility and authority, it 
simply breeds more of the same.
<P>
	I do not know why the Prime Minister and the finance minister 
especially are so adamantly opposed to the consideration of a 
budgetary plan to deliver tax relief to Canadians. I do not care to 
speculate on their personal motivation, but what I can report on is 
what an increasing number of Canadian taxpayers are saying. It is 
their deep suspicion that well to do, tax sheltered, prime ministers 
and finance ministers simply cannot personally identify with the 
tax burden now carried by the hard pressed Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7410"> 7410 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1715 )</B>
<P>
	If all they see from the Prime Minister and the finance minister 
is negative reactions to tax relief, particularly negative reaction to 
tax relief for low and middle income Canadians, they will react in 
kind.
<P>
	Therefore, it would not surprise me at all if those taxpayers, 
through their various associations and interest groups which are 
mushrooming all over the country, were to in their anger and 
frustration, produce a pamphlet, a newspaper ad or a TV 
commercial with the following headline: ``Well-to-do, tax 
sheltered Liberal leaders indifferent to tax burden of working 
Canadians''. If and when that happens, the Prime Minister and the 
finance minister will react in anger and frustration, as the finance 
minister has already in this House, and the whole subject of tax 
relief and alternative budgetary plans to deliver tax relief will be 
lost in a welter of negative reactionary recriminations.
<P>
	Is there an alternative approach to the prebudget and budget 
debate which is more positive and constructive, one which would 
inspire public interest and hope for the future rather than anger and 
recriminations? I believe there is. That approach is for each major 
party to this debate, in particular the Liberal government and the 
Reform Party, to put forward their alternatives plans and proposals 
in as positive and constructive a light as possible, and let the public 
decide which course of action represents the best budgetary plan 
for Canadian citizens and taxpayers.
<P>
	This is the approach that Reformers prefer to take to the 
prebudget debate, to the budget debate and to the federal election 
campaign itself.
<P>
	In taking this approach, Reform will propose that this country 
aim for a trim $94 billion a year federal government, one that 
balances its budget sooner rather than later, one that focuses on 10 
major areas of national and international responsibility and 
decentralizes virtually everything else to provincial and local 
governments.
<P>
	We would propose a $94 billion a year federal government which 
focuses its social spending on three major areas: federal support of 
health, education and old age security, and which reduces its 
spending on virtually everything else in order to sustain and 
guarantee its commitments in those three areas.
<P>
	In contrast, working off the prebudget documents provided by 
the government, the government is on course to present Canadians 
with a $109 billion a year federal government. Under the 
government's plan, which is really an extension of the status quo, 
the federal government would attempt to continue to provide 
certain programs and services from regional development grants to 
the continuation of the CBC as a public corporation, to a plethora 
of social expenditures which Reform would  either eliminate, 
privatize or delegate to lower levels of government.
<P>
	The big difference between these two alternative budgetary 
approaches is about $15 billion a year. The question for the 
Canadian people is which course of action is best for them and their 
children. Will that $15 billion per year be more productive in terms 
of job creation and social security if it is collected by the Liberal 
tax man and spent by Ottawa or would that $15 billion be more 
productive in the hands of Canadian consumers and private sector 
job creators through tax relief?
<P>
	This is the great issue ultimately to be decided in the prebudget 
debate, the budget debate next spring and to be conclusively 
decided in the next federal election.
<P>
	I want to conclude by appealing to members on both sides of the 
House. The prebudget debate, the budget debate and the federal 
election debate can be negative and reactionary. We are already 
seeing examples of where that can lead and all it does is divert 
media and public attention from the real issues and the decisions 
that have to be made.
<P>
	On the other hand, we can approach this debate positively and 
constructively. Let the Liberals put forward their budgetary plans 
for a $109 billion a year federal government with no tax relief and 
defend that as best it can. Let Reformers put forward its plans for a 
$94 billion a year federal government plus $15 billion in tax relief 
and argue as strenuously as we can for the benefits of that 
approach.
<P>
	Let us take these alternative proposals before the great tribunal 
of the Canadian people and then, appealing to the good judgment 
and better instincts of our fellow citizens, let Canadians make the 
decision as to which approach will provide a fresh start for the 
Canada of the 21st century.
<P>
<B>(1720 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Peterson (Willowdale, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think all 
members of the House are pleased that the leader of the third party 
has joined in the debate, a debate which is very important. As he 
has quite correctly pointed out, it involves an incredible number of 
choices that as legislators, as representatives of the people, we have 
to make on behalf of Canadians from every region of the country.
<P>
	It is constructive that Reform members have made the effort to 
put before Canadians an alternative budget, an alternative strategy, 
that they have thought it out, that they have put numbers to it, that 
they are offering that type of alternative. Just as our debate on the 
prebudget report is the subject of extensive debate throughout the 
country, I welcome that he has put forward their alternative budget 
as a serious element of debate.
<P>
	I commend the third party for doing this. It is a departure from 
the traditional role that opposition  parties have played. 
Traditionally opposition parties have simply criticized. They have 
nit-picked, they have gone after the chinks that they saw or thought 
that Canadians might perceive to exist in the other party's platform. 
The Reform Party has dared to be creative. I commend it for the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7411"> 7411 </A></B>
<P>
approach that it has taken. I know it has done that with a great deal 
of sincerity and a great deal of thought.
<P>
	We have had on the finance committee through the excellent 
leadership of the Reform Party and its members very constructive 
debates from coast to coast throughout this country on many of the 
very important issues we face. I think members from all parties 
have been influenced by this exchange of philosophies and 
exchange of means of getting to a new end. All of us realize that we 
have to go beyond where we are today.
<P>
	The Reform Party did a marvellous job over the past three years 
in pointing out the incredible problems that we face in Canada 
because for the 20 previous years governments of both stripes spent 
way beyond the means of Canadians and put us behind the eight 
ball. We are so far in the hole that our biggest expenditure today is 
$50 billion on interest, which is two and a half times what we spend 
on our next biggest expenditure, seniors' pensions.
<P>
	I do not denigrate the approach which Reformers have taken but 
I do put forward with a certain amount of enthusiasm the approach 
taken by the Minister of Finance under the leadership of the Prime 
Minister. There are not too many people who five years ago would 
have thought that it was going to be the Liberal Party that had to 
come to grips with the deficit and the debt.
<P>
	We took an approach which has reduced the deficit from 6 per 
cent of GDP when we took office down to 5 per cent, 4 per cent, 3 
per cent and it will be below 3 per cent of our gross domestic 
product and heading for zero, be it in the year 1998-99 or the year 
that the leader of the third party would like to see it hit zero, 
1999-2000.
<P>
	We are not going to be far off from what the leader wants in 
terms of that objective if we continue to surpass the deficit 
objectives the way we have. We agree probably with the Reform 
Party that government does not have a role of intervening in every 
aspect of Canadian life even though we might like to or feel that we 
have an obligation to help. We can no longer afford this. This has 
been demonstrated by the fact that incredible cuts have had to be 
made in budgets. There is a difference between our parties and the 
approach that we have taken.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	First, our cuts have been gradual, not the draconian cuts that 
were called for by the other party. This has allowed provincial and 
municipal governments to adjust. It has enabled Canadians to 
adjust over a period of time to the tough, harsh realities. This is not 
a disagreement on what had to be done, but it is the timing and 
giving Canadians the opportunity to adapt.
<P>
	Second, I think our vision of what the country is about is slightly 
different, perhaps vastly different. For example, none of our 
budgets cut equalization payments which we feel are so critical to 
maintaining that confederation, that community of provinces, that 
community of neighbours, a country which is sharing and cares 
about every region.
<P>
	This has been built on our history. It has been built on the fact 
that at the time of Confederation, Nova Scotia was the richest 
province. Before the big oil discoveries in the 1940s, Alberta was 
really a have not province.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Frazer:</B> Mr. Speaker, a point of order. The comments are 
very apropos, I guess, but they are really not giving the member for 
Calgary Southwest time to respond.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> I was watching the time. I 
was going to warn the hon. member for Willowdale in another 
minute or so that he was going to perhaps put himself in that 
position and I am sure that he did not want to do so. I expect he will 
conclude his remarks shortly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peterson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am certainly in your hands. Please, 
just tell me when my time has expired.
<P>
	The very fundamental difference between the Liberal Party and 
the Reform Party is that we believe equalization is fundamental to 
the maintenance of the partnership that exists among all provinces, 
the federal government and Canadians no matter where they live.
<P>
	We also have a fundamental disagreement on how we should 
treat health care. Part of the Reform platform is that it will allow 
provinces to opt out of the Canada Health Act, that private billing 
can be done and a two-tier medical system. Now, all of a sudden it 
said that it is going to pour $4 billion a year more into medical care. 
This will be done through increasing transfers to the provinces. 
However, there will be no strings attached. How does Reform 
intend to do it?
<P>
	We have fundamental differences and but we are fighting toward 
a lot of the common goals.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member, the 
chairman of the finance committee, for his generous comments. 
Perhaps the Christmas spirit has permeated this place, and we 
reciprocate.
<P>
	However, let me respond to three of the points he made. He 
mentioned that one difference between the government and Reform 
is the pace at which we would balance the budget. The government 
has proposed to take the gradual approach. What he did not 
mention was the price that is paid for going too slow. Part of the 
price has been that the government has accumulated over $100 
billion in debt because it has gone slow on deficit reduction. That is 
the other side of the story.
<P>
	The interest charges on that debt have resulted in the government 
having less money to spend on social  services. That is another part 
of the price. And the biggest part of the price of going slow on 
deficit reduction is not being able to get quickly to a surplus 
position. Therefore, the government cannot offer substantive debt 
retirement, it cannot offer substantive social reinvestment and it 
cannot offer tax relief. We say the price the government paid for 
gradualism is too high. It would have been better to have gone 
<P>

<B><A NAME="7412"> 7412 </A></B>
<P>
faster, to follow the timetable followed by the majority of the 
provinces.
<P>
	With respect to equalization, let me say that we support 
equalization, but we support a true and focused equalization. Right 
now under equalization, three provinces are carrying seven. We 
believe we ought to strive more to a situation where there will be 
four or five carrying six and five rather than the current situation, 
and target equalization even more steeply to the most 
disadvantaged provinces.
<P>
	The third point is on health care. The Reform position, as I 
argued earlier, is to increase the funding for health care. We are 
able to do that because we have a plan that gets to surpluses faster 
than what the government is doing. We would argue that is a more 
sound approach to preserving health care than the approach that the 
government is taking. It is the government itself, not Reform, that 
has reduced federal transfers for social and health programs by 
over $7 billion.
<P>
	My last point would be to respond to the member's question. He 
asked how we can hold the provinces to spending transfers that the 
federal government may say are targeted to health care, education 
or something else when there are no strings attached to those 
transfers. There is one simple answer to that.
<P>
	If both levels of government listen to the public they will find the 
public has a set of social spending priorities. If both levels of 
government listen to the public that is where they will get their 
direction as to how social dollars ought to be spent and they will 
both hear the same message because they are talking to the same 
taxpayers.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> It being 5.30 p.m., the 
House will now proceed to consideration of Private Members' 
Business as listed on today's Order Paper.

	The House resumed from October 31 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-236, an act to prevent the importation of 
radioactive waste into Canada, be now read the second time and 
referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
believe that you will find consent for the following. I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That at the conclusion of the debate on Bill C-236 this day, the question be 
deemed put, a recorded division be deemed requested and that the said vote be 
deemed deferred until Thursday, December 12, 1996 at the end of the time provided 
for Government Orders.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	(Motion agreed to.)
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Marlene Cowling (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, thank you for the 
opportunity to conclude this debate in the House of Commons on 
the proposed legislation, Bill C-236.
<P>
	Throughout the debate we have heard many arguments for and 
against this bill. The members opposite repeatedly stressed that 
they want to prevent Canada from becoming the world's dumping 
ground for radioactive waste. The image of a dumping ground is 
misleading. Today radioactive waste in Canada is managed in an 
environmentally reasonable way. All forms of radioactive waste 
management and disposal are strictly regulated by the Atomic 
Energy Control Board, the independent federal nuclear regulator.
<P>
	As the House is aware, the Government of Canada has recently 
introduced modern and comprehensive legislation, the Canadian 
nuclear safety control act. Bill C-23 updates the Atomic Energy 
Control Act. During the debates the Government of Canada 
presented its reasons for not supporting Bill C-236 and the three 
main reasons can be summarized as follows.
<P>
	First, this bill is simply not needed. The regulatory system in 
Canada already strictly controls the management of radioactive 
waste, including imported waste specifically. Canada has the 
knowledge base, the expertise, the infrastructure and the regulatory 
systems to ensure that radioactive wastes are treated in such a way 
that they pose no undue risk to human health or the environment.
<P>
	In Canada an independent federal agency, the AECB, strictly 
regulates the nuclear industry. This bill adds nothing to Canada's 
current regulatory system. It adds nothing to the regulations under 
the Atomic Energy Control Act, nor to those under the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	Compliance with these regulations is mandatory for all licensed 
applicants to the AECB whether they be individuals, companies or 
groups, including aboriginal groups. There are no exceptions.
<P>
	The current concept for the disposal of nuclear fuel waste in 
Canada is intended for handling waste from domestic CANDU 
reactors. There are no plans to import nuclear fuel waste from other 
countries.
<P>
	In Canada, the owners and the producers of low level radioactive 
waste are planning for the disposal of their own waste. Under the 
radioactive waste policy framework, waste producers and owners 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7413"> 7413 </A></B>
<P>
are responsible for funding, organizing, managing and operating 
disposal and other facilities for these wastes.
<P>
	Uranium mine and mill tailings will be decomissioned at the 
mine sites.
<P>
	Second, the bill is a threat to Canadian companies exporting 
medical equipment containing radioactive substances or the 
substances themselves.
<P>
	Let me offer two examples to highlight the government's 
concerns. Nordion International Inc. is a worldwide leader in the 
production of medical radio isotopes. In 1995 its total revenue was 
$191 million. About 98 per cent of its sales come from exports and 
it sells to more than 70 countries. Should the bill pass, the company 
expects to lose half of its annual revenues.
<P>
	This is because its clients around the world in developed as well 
as developing countries require sales contracts to include a take 
back clause for the spent radioactive sources. These spent materials 
are considered radioactive waste.
<P>
	Nordion is quite willing to include such a clause since Canada 
can indeed effectively deal with the disposal of such waste. Take 
back provisions and practices are highly recommended by 
international organizations such as the International Atomic 
Energy Agency since it ensures that the wastes are managed by the 
most capable authorities under effective regulatory regimes.
<P>
	Theratronics International Ltd. is a worldwide leader in cancer 
therapy machines. It would also be hurt by this bill. In fact, 
Theratronics executives say that the legislation would probably put 
the company out of business since the repatriation of radioactive 
sources for disposal is an integral element in its contract and is 
often a condition for new sales.
<P>
	The company feels that it has an obligation to offer disposal 
services such as services for a good way to keep track of spent 
radioactive sources. This tracking is essential to avoid the kind of 
tragic radiation accident that occurred a few years ago in Brazil 
where several people died after being exposed to radioactive 
materials that had been carelessly abandoned.
<P>
	If we are not prepared to take back the spent radioactive 
substances resulting from the use of medical equipment abroad, 
then Canada may have to stop exporting to countries that cannot 
deal with the waste.
<P>
	This would deprive the people in those countries of access to 
modern medical devices. The result could be needless illness and 
death in client countries, the disappearance of these successful 
Canadian high tech companies and significant job losses.
<P>
	Third, the bill would impair our co-operation on radioactive 
waste management initiatives with other G-7 nations, especially 
the United States. It would also hurt our reputation with developing 
countries.
<P>
	Again, let me be more specific. The law in both Canada and the 
United States covers on-site storage of radioactive waste at 
hospitals. Under some circumstances it may be more practical, 
effective, efficient and environmentally sound to use the disposal 
or storage facilities across the border, but this co-operation has to 
work both ways.
<P>
	Developing countries, many African nations for example, have 
recognized that they do not have the expertise, the infrastructure or 
regulatory authority to safely handle these wastes and have banned 
their import. They are well aware that they will have to export such 
waste if they are to avail themselves of modern medical devices 
that contain radioactive material. This is not the case for Canada, 
which has leading expertise in this area.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	If passed, this legislation would send a signal to developing 
countries that we are indifferent to their medical needs. As a 
developed nation, Canada is an active and effective participant in 
international fora to develop conventions, codes and guides to 
ensure that all countries adopt proper radioactive waste 
management practices.
<P>
	Up to now Canada's views have commanded respect in the 
international community. Our opinions are actively sought because 
we have the expertise, the infrastructure and the regulatory 
authority to deal with radioactive waste safely. This legislation 
would show the G-7 countries that Canada is no longer prepared to 
effectively participate in international fora.
<P>
	I will address the specific issue of nuclear fuel waste. Canada has 
developed something called the deep geological concept, a 
proposed method for disposing of nuclear fuel waste generated in 
this country by burying it deep within the stable granitic rock of the 
Canadian Shield. In the international scientific community there is 
general agreement that the deep geological method is the best form 
of disposal for nuclear fuel waste.
<P>
	I re-emphasize that Bill C-236 offers no advantages and entails 
many harmful consequences related to the import of radioactive 
waste. This bill would produce no benefit whatsoever for 
Canadians and would add nothing to Canada's current regulatory 
system. On the contrary, it would inhibit environmentally 
responsible practices both here and abroad and would result in 
significant job losses in the nuclear medical equipment industry in 
this country. I strongly urge members of the House to vote against 
this bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome 
this opportunity today to express my views on Bill C-236, standing 
in the name of the hon. member for Fraser Valley-East, which 
would prevent the importation of radioactive waste into Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7414"> 7414 </A></B>
<P>
	The hon. member is to be commended on his initiative, and I 
want to say that I support his proposal, because this is a very 
serious matter, involving future generations for which we are 
responsible.
<P>
	Much has already been said by my colleagues who support this 
bill and who spoke earlier in this debate. After the events of 
Chernobyl, none of us can afford to ignore the terrible impact such 
dangerous materials have had on the local population. Ukraine, 
with thousands of people dead, people who are sick and children 
who have become invalids, knows the consequences.
<P>
	We have no right to put humans at risk nor, for that matter, the 
animal and vegetable species of this planet. We must not expose 
our country to potential disaster for financial considerations.
<P>
	That is why legislation is needed to ensure that commercial 
interests do not look to the market in radioactive waste as a golden 
opportunity to make a quick buck, at the expense of the health and 
safety of the public.
<P>
	Let me explain. Certain groups see attempts being made by 
countries to get rid of their own radioactive waste as an opportunity 
to make a huge profit. We must have the courage to speak out, 
again and again, because the huge amounts of money they can 
charge for burying radioactive waste are the only reason why they 
are prepared to ignore the very real risks involved.
<P>
	It is surprising that despite the potential risk, there is no 
legislation to control the importation of radioactive waste. Because 
of our vast uninhabited areas, Canada is the ideal destination for 
industrialized countries that are incapable of dealing with the 
disposal of their radioactive waste.
<P>
	I cannot imagine my riding, Abitibi, most of which is covered by 
the Canadian shield, being selected for this purpose. I might as well 
say right away that the people of Abitibi, like Canadians generally, 
do not want radioactive waste in their backyard, especially if it 
comes from a foreign country.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	The people in my riding held a major debate some ten years ago, 
when there was a possibility of excess PCB material being stored in 
our region. I expect that the debate would be stormy if the subject 
were nuclear waste.
<P>
	It is, of course, our responsibility to get rid of our own nuclear 
waste, but other countries must make the same commitment. We 
have no responsibility in the problems currently faced by the 
United States, for example. The United States is no doubt a country 
of excess, in economic and other terms, but surely in terms of its 
radioactive waste as well.
<P>
	For example, the Hanford site, 300 kilometres south of the 
British Columbia border is a huge radioactive waste disposal site. 
To give you an idea of the size of it, it is  some 26 times the size of a 
football field and a metre thick. You can imagine the cost.
<P>
	The American government estimates the cost to be 
approximately $57 billion, only to convert the site. As I mentioned 
earlier, you can imagine that certain groups see this as an 
opportunity to make huge profits by importing waste and burying it 
here. They figure the profits will be good. The cost of cleaning up 
all of the States is estimated at $230 billion. With a net profit of 1 
per cent, these companies could make a tidy sum eliminating these 
products, but at what risk and to whose advantage?
<P>
	Are we prepared to become the nuclear graveyard of the U.S. or 
any other country in exchange for financial compensation? I think 
the people of Canada would say no.
<P>
	Why do countries trying to get rid of their waste by selling it not 
keep that money and invest it in research to find a solution to the 
problem they have created for themselves? Because, however 
advanced the technology may be today, it cannot be denied that 
there are still risks involved.
<P>
	I digress for a moment to say that Canada is not necessarily 
better than any other country, as it is not considering the use of 
other technologies to eliminate large amounts of nuclear waste.
<P>
	For example, the Tokamak nuclear fusion project in Varennes 
offers unique high technology facility for research on clean energy, 
because unlike fission, fusion produces energy without radioactive 
waste. If it could be commercially developed, this process would 
allow atomic energy to be produced without any waste.
<P>
	The federal government refused to finance half of the $14 
million project by investing $7 million into it, arguing that it could 
not afford to spend that kind of money, when it has spent $23 
million on the flag project. The way of the future may be to manage 
our own nuclear waste, but it would certainly be brighter if very 
little or no waste was produced.
<P>
	I would like to remind the federal government that Canada is 
party to the convention signed in Switzerland on March 22, 1989, 
that came into force on May 5, 1992. The terms of this agreement 
were clear. They provided among other things that no country will 
import dangerous waste that poses a threat to the environment. 
Everyone will readily agree that there is a very serious threat to the 
environment involved. This is an indisputable risk, given that 
nuclear material can have effects that last for thousands of years.
<P>
	However, under the convention, the export of waste is allowed if 
the exporting country does not have the necessary facilities to 
dispose of the waste, and if the importing country can recycle and 
manage that waste. One can see the danger for companies trying to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7415"> 7415 </A></B>
<P>
prove that they can manage and bury their hazardous waste, in 
order to make a profit.
<P>
	The fact is that we have not found a solution to stock our own 
waste. We have been searching for a solution for 10 years and we 
have invested several millions of dollars without being sure of 
finding a solution. The Canadian shield may be a solution to deeply 
bury our own radioactive waste, but that solution cannot apply to 
all the countries in the world.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	Daily newscasts remind us that the issue of atomic waste must be 
taken very seriously. We must not confuse the recycling of 
plutonium from nuclear warheads, as part of the disarmament 
process in the United States and in Russia, with other requests. 
Canada can indeed do its share to promote nuclear disarmament in 
the world, but some would probably take this opportunity to get rid 
of other dangerous radioactive material in their country.
<P>
	As member of the Standing Committee on Natural Resources, I 
discussed Bill C-23, which seeks to replace the old Atomic Energy 
Control Act. Bill C-23 will still allow the commission to import 
radioactive material, but does not specify the nature of this 
material. The bill of my colleague, the hon. member for Fraser 
Valley East, Bill C-236, is intended as a complement to this to 
prevent any legal possibility of importing radioactive waste.
<P>
	In closing, I should like to return to the speech made by my 
Liberal colleague, who said this was not necessarily the right time 
to introduce this bill. On the contrary, I believe that, given the 
present turn of events, this is the ideal time to introduce a bill on 
this matter, so as to protect Canadians and Quebecers.
<P>
	She also said that the public is sure that current waste processing 
operations are safe. This is not true. At the present time, regardless 
of the studies, there is no certainty that this is a risk-free 
undertaking, even if the Canadian shield, a very good location, is 
used.
<P>
	She also said that there were no plans for importing waste at this 
time, while in the same speech she referred to Nordion, which was 
taking back the waste from its sales. I also believe that the purpose 
of a law is prevention, and there must be prevention before we have 
to face the consequences.
<P>
	You will conclude that the Bloc Quebecois and myself are in 
agreement with legislation in this area. If the Liberal government 
thinks this is not totally justified, it will have the option of tabling a 
bill which might not be totally airtight, perhaps, but it absolutely 
must see that a bill on the importation of radioactive waste is 
necessary. And we shall be voting in favour of the bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to 
speak today on Bill C-236. It is very timely to talk about setting 
ground rules for the transport of  nuclear waste. It is something that 
has been in the news the last couple of nights. I was rather shocked 
a few minutes ago to hear the parliamentary secretary for natural 
resources say that there are no plans for the movement of any 
nuclear waste between countries, that there are no plans anywhere.
<P>
	Whatever researcher wrote that speech obviously must have 
done it prior to April because the Prime Minister agreed openly and 
publicly to accept Russian nuclear waste at the Russian conference. 
He said Canada would do its part to take nuclear waste. I am not 
talking about medical waste. I am talking about war grade 
plutonium.
<P>
	Just two days ago one of the ministers in Mr. Clinton's cabinet 
noted that Canada had agreed to take U.S. nuclear waste and that a 
test project would be undertaken in the next few months. It is kind 
of scary that the parliamentary secretary for natural resources 
would say that the government has no plans. The Prime Minister 
announced the plans and other ministers have confirmed those 
plans. To say it is untimely to talk about this and that something 
like this is not necessary is totally and absolutely incorrect.
<P>
	Members are getting used to having different things said at 
different times and the interpretations are left for the public which 
will see what the truth really is.
<P>
	For decades there have been problems with the waste from the 
the 413 commercial nuclear reactors that now exist in the world. 
Not only is it a problem in Canada, it is a problem in many 
countries. I would like to relate to the House an experience in the 
last month when we were in the Scandinavian countries looking at 
the problem of Russian nuclear waste.
<P>
<B>(1755 )</B>
<P>
	In Murmansk there are 80 submarines containing nuclear waste 
which it would be so dangerous to move that they would need a 
cement ship built around them. They would then have to be 
transferred in a special rail car with a special rail line built to 
transport them.
<P>
	The question is how that nuclear waste can be transported to 
Canada. Two icebreakers are 3,000 feet under the ocean leaking 
nuclear waste. That needs to be cleaned up. Eighteen nuclear power 
plants are as bad or worse than Chernobyl. The world has a serious 
nuclear waste problem and we need to look at what Canada's role 
should be.
<P>
	It is very fitting that we talk about the transport of nuclear waste. 
How is the nuclear waste to be moved from one point to another? 
How is the nuclear waste from the U.S. to be moved to Canada? 
How is it going to be moved from places like Murmansk? Do 
Canadians want to be the nuclear dumping ground for the world?
<P>
	What are nuclear wastes like? I am not chemist or physicist and I 
do not know the details about this, but I am told that a grapefruit 
sized ball of plutonium  conceivably would destroy a city the size 
of Toronto. We are then told that the intensity can be downgraded 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7416"> 7416 </A></B>
<P>
so it can be transported safely. Let us have the details concerning 
that transportation.
<P>
	The next item we need to have some details on is terrorism. How 
is the transfer of this plutonium, of this nuclear waste, of these 
spent rods, from Russia to Canada to be secured? How can this 
plutonium be guarded so that it is not open to terrorists to get their 
hands on it? If they are that dangerous, Canadians at least need to 
have that item discussed.
<P>
	A serious study was done, the Bellona report, which resulted in 
the top Russian nuclear scientist committing suicide and the second 
in command nuclear scientist in Russia now being held in prison 
without a trial because he released some information on the 
dangers of the nuclear waste.
<P>
	One does not fool around with this stuff. It is not something 
about which you make an ad hoc deal with the Americans or the 
Russians around tea some place. This is the sort of thing that should 
be openly discussed with Canadians, that should be openly debated 
in the House of Commons and the decisions are made after that 
debate.
<P>
	For the parliamentary secretary to say that we have no plans for 
moving nuclear waste is wrong. The Prime Minister signed a deal 
in April in Moscow saying we would do our part and take war grade 
nuclear wastes.
<P>
	One can argue that is our part to the international community but 
to say that we do not have any plans, there are plans. There are 
plans in Russia and in the U.S. Those are clear, open and we know 
about them.
<P>
	There are more questions to be asked. If we can get it here 
without terrorists getting their hands on it, if we can transport it 
safely without it being dangerous to the population, then we have to 
find out how much of it can be burned. Only about one-third of that 
waste can be burned. The two-thirds that are left have to be stored. 
That means transporting nuclear waste here, of which only 
one-third can be burned and the other two-thirds will have to be 
stored. How are we going to store them? How much is it going to 
cost? How are we going to deal with the problem? As far as I know, 
there is no answer to those questions.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> We would have to store it for 2,800 years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> The half life is 2,800 years. Where are 
we going to store these nuclear wastes for 2,800 years and who is 
going to pay the bill?
<P>
	In Russia the spent rods are stored in a gully. They have been 
dumped there and they are leaking. In Canada we store the rods in 
an air conditioned, liquid filled cement vat and the cost is 
phenomenal. In Russia they turned off the air conditioning because 
they could not afford the power so there was no air conditioning for 
the  stored rods. Is there a time bomb there? You had better believe 
there is a time bomb there and it is one we have to deal with.
<P>
	It can be argued that accepting nuclear waste creates a lot of 
jobs. If that is the case then we have to weigh the jobs versus the 
costs and the benefits versus the dangers. The point I am making 
here is the fact that we must have an open debate on this subject. I 
believe that this bill is saying that before we agree to transport any 
nuclear waste, we must know the facts and they must be clear.
<P>
	It does concern me as a Canadian that the government does not 
have a plan, that this is going to be done ad hoc. It will be sprung on 
us and there will be only two days of debate or a take note debate 
some night and at the end of it we will not get to vote and we will 
be stuck with tons of nuclear waste.
<P>
	To say that we have legislation and that this bill is redundant is 
totally untrue. We need legislation and a long term plan. Obviously 
if we are talking about 2,800 years, that is a pretty long term plan.
<P>
	To simply say that this bill is not timely or that it is not important 
to the Canadian public is really misrepresenting the entire issue of 
nuclear waste. I know Canadians across the country are going to 
start asking these questions. They are going to expect answers to 
the many questions members are raising during the discussion.
<P>
	In conclusion, I am saying that Canadians need information, an 
open debate, open discussion, open presentation to the House of 
Commons. It affects every one of us. Before any further planning is 
done in this regard, we need to deal with it here.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian Murray (Lanark-Carleton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to clarify Canada's approach to the 
safety of radioactive waste management.
<P>
	I just want to mention I believe that the hon. member for Red 
Deer referred to plutonium in his remarks. In looking back at the 
remarks of the hon. member for Fraser Valley East when he spoke 
on the bill, he said: ``From the outset I want to make it clear that 
this bill would not ban the importation of plutonium from the U.S. 
and Russian warheads''. He went on to say: ``That is not waste. We 
can still do that and Canadians are willing to consider that option 
because they feel it is part of what we can do. If we can get rid of 
the number of nuclear weapons around the world, we certainly are 
prepared to do our part''.
<P>
	Before I get into a discussion on the Canadian approach to the 
safety of radioactive waste management, I also want to draw the 
attention of the House to one of the unintended but important 
negative aspects of Bill C-236. I am pleased that the parliamentary 
secretary raised this in her remarks because two of the companies 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7417"> 7417 </A></B>
<P>
she mentioned are in my riding, MDS Nordion and  Theratronics. 
They literally could be put out of business if the bill becomes law.
<P>
	Fifty years ago the company we now know as MDS Nordion 
began operations with three employees in a temporary government 
building beside the supreme court, just a few hundred yards away 
from this building. Today in its segment of the health care industry 
it is recognized as a world leader in the development, production 
and marketing of radioisotope products and technology.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	The radioisotopes it produces and distributes are used in nuclear 
medicine to diagnose and treat disease. Every year roughly 20 
million diagnostic imaging tests are carried out in hospitals around 
the globe using Nordion's radioisotopes. Industrial processes too, 
such as quality assurance and non-destructive testing, rely on 
radioisotopes supplied by the company.
<P>
	MDS Nordion is also the world leader in the supply of radiation 
processing equipment and cobalt 60 used to sterilize medical and 
surgical supplies and a wide range of consumer products from 
bandages to contact lens solutions to baby powder. This same 
technology can be used to eliminate salmonella bacteria in poultry 
and E. coli, a deadly bacteria sometimes found in red meat, 
particularly hamburger.
<P>
	MDS Nordion is a major economic contributor to Canada's 
economy. It employs more than 600 well educated and highly 
skilled men and women in Kanata, Vancouver, Laval and overseas. 
Ninety-five per cent of the products it produces at its main 
production facility in Kanata are exported to more than 70 
countries.
<P>
	Theratronics employs some 240 people in Kanata. It is 
recognized internationally as the leader in the manufacture of 
cobalt teletherapy units and cobalt teletherapy treatment planning 
systems. It has one of the largest installed bases of cobalt units and 
treatment planning systems in the world. As a supplier of cobalt 
sources for these units, Theratronics has a moral obligation to offer 
disposal services.
<P>
	Many countries do not have the infrastructure to properly 
dispose of radioactive material. This is because the quantity of the 
material generated does not warrant a full program. Developing 
countries often do not have the financial resources to commit to the 
disposal of radioactive material or do not have the required 
expertise. Smaller countries with large populations do not have the 
land or geography required to set up a radioactive material 
repository.
<P>
	As with MDS Nordion, the radioactive material which is being 
imported for disposal by Theratronics originated in Canada and 
was created through a nuclear process at the Chalk River 
laboratories. Cobalt 60 is totally Canadian or being replaced by 
Canadian made sources.
<P>
	I wish to make it absolutely clear that the control of nuclear 
energy falls under federal jurisdiction. To prevent undue risks to 
human health and the environment, any practice involving 
radioactive waste management would be strictly regulated by the 
Atomic Energy Control Board, the AECB, and the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Agency.
<P>
	The Government of Canada is well aware that the nuclear 
regulatory body must be competent and empowered by appropriate 
legislation if it is to ensure that operations in the nuclear industry 
are conducted safely. The government has introduced modern and 
comprehensive legislation, the Canadian Nuclear Safety Control 
Act. This act updates the Atomic Energy Control Act and is 
currently before the House. I remind the House of this fact in view 
of statements made during the last two House debates.
<P>
	During the last two debates members on the other side of the 
House argued that Canada should not even think of accepting 
radioactive waste from other countries since it cannot properly 
manage its own radioactive waste. To support this premise they 
referred to the May 1995 report of the Auditor General of Canada 
on federal radioactive waste management. Clearly these hon. 
members are not aware of the expertise acquired by Canadians over 
the years. They risk alarming the Canadian public unnecessarily.
<P>
	The main message of the auditor general's 1995 report was not 
that Canada cannot properly manage its radioactive waste, but 
rather that it has not kept pace with some other countries, namely 
Finland, France and Sweden, with regard to some aspects of 
disposal plans.
<P>
	Federal officials closely follow developments in other countries 
and they know about the processes driving the scheduling of 
radioactive waste disposal around the world. In fact, countries 
around the world have already expended considerable effort to 
come to an agreement on the transboundary movement of 
hazardous and radioactive waste and to establish appropriate 
principles for the import and export of these materials.
<P>
	In Canada steady progress is being made in the field of 
radioactive waste disposal. For example, on July 10, 1996 the 
Minister of Natural Resources announced a radioactive waste 
policy framework that will guide Canada's approach to radioactive 
waste disposal into the next century.
<P>
	The framework establishes a comprehensive and integrated 
approach to long term management and disposal of radioactive 
wastes. The government developed the framework in consultation 
with waste producers and owners. The policy framework 
recognizes the federal government's responsibility for developing 
policy, regulating the industry and ensuring that waste producers 
and owners comply with legal requirements and meet their funding 
and operational responsibilities.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>

<B><A NAME="7418"> 7418 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1810 )</B>
<P>
	Under the policy framework, the polluter pays. In accordance 
with this principle, waste producers and owners are responsible for 
funding, organizing, managing and operating disposal and other 
facilities for their waste. The policy framework emphasizes the 
Government of Canada's commitment to sustainable development.
<P>
	I assure the House that the first priority of the Government of 
Canada is the health and safety of Canadians. The AECB, through 
various processes, including inspection and ongoing assessments, 
reviews, and licence renewal, works to satisfy itself that the 
operations of its licensees are safe.
<P>
	The bill we are discussing today does nothing to contribute to 
safety. It adds nothing of value to regulations under the Atomic 
Energy Control Act nor to those under the Canadian Environmental 
Assessment Act. Existing regulations are strictly enforced. 
National and international organizations continue to develop safe 
practices for the management of radioactive waste including its 
import and export. The Government of Canada will continue to 
ensure that any projects or policies that involve the management of 
radioactive waste do not pose any undue risks to health, safety, 
security or the environment.
<P>
	Canada clearly has the ability to properly manage the waste we 
generate domestically. Banning the import of radioactive waste on 
the specious grounds that we cannot even manage our own supply 
is simply not warranted.
<P>
	I believe votes in this House should be based on credible 
information. There is no real doubt that Canada has the knowledge 
base, the expertise, the infrastructure and the regulatory system to 
ensure that radioactive waste, including imported waste, is treated 
in such a way that it poses no undue risk to human health or the 
environment. I urge all members of Parliament to reject this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to speak to Bill C-236 which was 
introduced to the House by my colleague from Fraser Valley East. 
Bill C-236 has a very simple bottom line. It would ban the 
importation of high level radioactive waste into Canada.
<P>
	I will speak as a citizen of the province of Saskatchewan which 
has a nuclear industry. In fact one of Saskatchewan's major 
industries is the uranium mining industry. It has generated a lot of 
income. I am not an alarmist who gets fearful. My knees do not 
begin to shake when I hear about nuclear energy. When electricity 
was invented and was being developed, it had a dangerous 
component and a beneficial component. The automobile can be 
very useful; it can get us to Ottawa, it can get us around our ridings 
but it also has a potential for danger.
<P>
	The problem with the nuclear industry is the waste material 
associated with it. Some may want to pretend it is not a serious
<P>
matter. Others may want to be alarmists and suggest that the whole 
industry should be immediately shut down. Both responses are very 
irresponsible.
<P>
	It would be wrong to shut down electricity producing plants, 
whether for hydro or nuclear electricity, just because a person had 
been electrocuted. It would be wrong to ban automobiles because 
someone had been killed in a car accident. Those would be rather 
extreme reactions to very real problems.
<P>
	In the agricultural sector which I am involved in, there is waste. 
The trick is learning how to deal with that waste. In Canada we 
have high level radioactive waste and we do not know how to deal 
with it. We are developing the technology but we are not there yet. 
My colleagues have outlined a number of these problems.
<P>
	If we have problems here at home, why are we even considering 
the importation of high level radioactive waste into Canada? We 
should be developing the technology to handle and control 
radioactive waste. Once we have the technology down, once we 
know how to handle our own problems then perhaps rather than 
importing radioactive waste from outside Canada we should be 
selling that technology to other nations around the world so that 
they can effectively deal with their high level radioactive waste.
<P>
	It is common sense. Reformers always talk common sense. I 
know, Mr. Speaker, you have been persuaded and I appreciate this 
very brief opportunity to make a very cogent point.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. This being 
the third hour of debate on this bill, could I ask the permission of 
the House for 30 seconds or so just to wrap up this discussion on 
my bill?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Does the House give its 
consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> I hear nos. It being 6.15 
p.m., pursuant to order made earlier this day, the question on the 
motion is deemed to have been put and a recorded division deemed 
demanded and deferred until Thursday, December 12, 1996 at the 
expiry of the time provided for Government Orders.

	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, today I 
want to speak about the Singer affair.
<P>
	Over a period of some time, we have asked three different 
ministers a dozen questions in all concerning Singer. 
Unfortunately, we are still getting vague answers. It is clear from 
the minister's latest answers that the door to any out of court 
settlement is being slammed shut. I find this completely 
disgraceful.
<P>
	Of course, we could have asked that this matter be raised during 
proceedings on the adjournment motion each time, but you know 
that an MP's duties are already sufficiently thankless, difficult and 
numerous. We do not always have the time, but since we have been 
stepping up our questions over the last few weeks, we felt it very 
appropriate today to table a request for a reply from the 
government. I am pleased that the House is able to grant me four 
minutes so that I can at least explain the problem.
<P>
	Today, I want to tell you about a terrible injustice. Between 1942 
and 1967, the federal government was trustee of a retirement fund 
for Singer employees, who, at the time, had great confidence in the 
federal government. They told themselves that, if the government 
was looking after it, there was no problem.
<P>
	Unfortunately, several decades later, there is an enormous 
problem. From 1942 to 1967, surpluses accumulated in the fund. 
Instead of observing the terms of the contract it had signed at the 
time with Singer employees to the effect that these dividends could 
be paid out at the end to employees, the federal government 
allowed Singer to stop paying premiums.
<P>
	Instead of paying its annual share for the employees' pension 
plan, the company, seeing that there was a surplus, said: ``This 
year, we will pay only part''. If the surplus was greater, it said: ``We 
will not pay at all''.
<P>
	Employees continued to pay their fair share, but Singer did not, 
with the result that, at the end of 1967, the accumulated dividends 
should have been $450,000. It does not take long to figure out that, 
if the amount is doubled every eight years, it would be close to $6 
million today.
<P>
	Therefore, if the federal government had kept its part of the 
bargain, these retired employees, whose average age is now 80, 
would be receiving $6 million. Unfortunately, the employees and 
ex-workers perhaps placed a little too much trust in the federal 
government, because we have asked these questions of three 
ministers, and three ministers have shut the door in our face.
<P>
	These employees won their first suit, because there are a number 
of potential suits. I was telling you that, from 1942 to 1967, the 
Canada Pension Plan was involved, and then, from 1967 to 1986, 
the Quebec Pension Plan. They have just won their case against the 
Quebec Pension Plan and many other cases are pending. One of 
them is  the case involving the federal government, where we will 
have to get involved in lengthy legal proceedings if the minister 
shuts the door in our face tomorrow and the day after, the last days 
before the House rises. There is a statute of limitation, and 
employees will have to go to court.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	People in their eighties have a rather short life expectancy. 
Although the minister has said some nice things, and told us he will 
act with all due diligence, being forced into a lengthy lawsuit at this 
time does not leave these employees very hopeful.
<P>
	I have some typical examples. My own father worked for Singer 
for almost 45 years. Do you know what he now gets from the 
Canada Pension Plan, the federal plan? My father gets $12 a month, 
after 45 years of contributions. It is a complete travesty. These 
retired employees are getting $20 a month on average.
<P>
	They are victims of the federal government and of Montreal 
Trust, because, beginning in 1967, Montreal Trust also held the 
money in trust. When their spokesman, Mr. Châteauneuf, to whom 
I give my regards by the way, lodged his claim, the court agreed to 
freeze the Montreal Trust fund with approximately $2 million in it.
<P>
	Despite all that, Singer's counsel took their fees out of the 
Montreal Trust fund. Montreal Trust was guilty too. Singer, which 
had changed its name to TSCO in the United States, got away with 
approximately $10 million. The workers are up against employers 
who have exploited them all their lives, while these same workers 
have worked all their lives to build up a pension fund. Now they are 
staring at nothing.
<P>
	In conclusion, I tell you that time is of the essence. This case 
must be resolved. Singer has been granted a $30 million tariff 
exemption. Now it is the employees' turn. We are asking the 
department to resolve this matter before the House rises.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Parliamentary Secretary to President 
of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to 
respond on behalf of the Minister of Human Resources 
Development to my hon. colleague's question.
<P>
	Based on the advice we have received we believe that the 
Government of Canada has fulfilled all its contractual and legal 
obligations concerning the contract between it and Singer.
<P>
	However, the points of law raised by the former employees are 
serious and complex, and existing precedents do not provide a 
definitive answer to the issues raised.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development had to refuse 
the offer to settle out of court made by the  lawyer representing the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="7420"> 7420 </A></B>
<P>
former Singer employees. The legal issues raised by the employees 
are, briefly stated, simply too serious and complex.
<P>
	The minister must ensure that the plan is administered in 
compliance with the Annuities Act and that the rights of all citizens 
are respected. The department has nevertheless shown compassion 
by co-operating fully with the receiver, that is the liquidator, 
appointed in 1995 by the Régis des rentes du Québec.
<P>
	Consequently, HRDC employees have done a considerable 
amount of work without charging liquidator's fees to help divide 
surpluses held by a private trustee by providing detailed 
information about each annuitant to the actuaries hired by the 
receiver.
<P>
	We should also remember that the Government of Canada has 
always borne all the administrative costs incurred under the 
Annuities Act, which today amount to approximately $3 million 
per year.
<P>
	The government finds the situation regrettable. Let us remember, 
however, that the Government of Canada has not abandoned its 
seniors. Through the combination of old age security benefits and 
the guaranteed income supplement, the Government of Canada 
offers low income seniors a monthly income up to $875.16.
<P>
	We want to repeat that these former Singer employees, if they 
are to go to court, the Government of Canada will try to ensure that 
any costs that they may incur are kept to a minimum and that the 
case progresses as quickly as possible.

	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
December 5, I put a question to the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration about the $975 head tax immigrants must pay when 
they apply for permanent residence in Canada.
<P>
	Since it was introduced by the federal government in February 
1995, this tax has been vigorously and repeatedly condemned in 
this House by the Bloc Quebecois. It is a particularly odious, unfair 
and discriminatory tax, especially when imposed on refugees.
<P>
	This tax has met with almost unanimous opposition from 
agencies involved in assisting and defending immigrants and 
refugees, human rights organizations, labour unions, the Bloc 
Quebecois and now the Liberal Party of Canada.
<P>
	At the last convention of the Liberal Party held in Ottawa from 
October 23 to October 27, a resolution was passed demanding that 
the tax be either reduced or abolished altogether. The resolution 
indicated that these expenses were an obstacle to large families 
intending to immigrate to Canada and a heavy burden on those who 
were trying to become part of the Canadian economy. This 
document went on to say that the admission fee should not be 
payable until after the arrival of the new immigrant. The minister 
should therefore act on his party's resolution immediately.
<P>
	On November 3, in Vancouver, I met Maria Barahona and her 
five children, who had sought refuge in Trinity United-St. Mark's 
Anglican church to avoid deportation. This family has lived in the 
basement of this church for a year, since December 6, 1995, 
exactly.
<P>
	They are living in difficult conditions, despite generous support 
from the church ministers, administrators and congregation as well 
as from labour unions and community organizations, but not, 
however, from the Liberal member for Vancouver Centre.
<P>
	Maria Barahona is 34 years old and comes from El Salvador. She 
applied for refugee status in 1991. Her application was turned 
down by the IRB. She and one of her children suffer from asthma. 
Children are unable to attend school.
<P>
	I was deeply touched by this tragic situation. I ask, in fact I beg 
the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration to stay the 
enforcement of the deportation order and to grant this family a 
ministerial permit, followed by permanent residence in Canada.
<P>
	I hope that the Christmas spirit will prompt the minister to 
render a favourable decision in this case. I also wish to raise the 
problem of Zairian nationals in Canada, who are currently being 
returned to their country of origin.
<P>
	As everyone knows, the situation in Zaire is very precarious. It is 
therefore dangerous to deport these people to Kinshasa. Would it 
not be more appropriate to stay the removal orders against Zairian 
nationals in Canada, given the involvement of this government in 
the African Great Lakes region?
<P>
	Why is it that, while it is considering taking part in an 
international humanitarian operation in that region, the federal 
government continues to deport people to Zaire? There is a glaring 
inconsistency that will have to be corrected to preserve the 
credibility of this country on the international scene.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, allow me to conclude by wishing a Merry 
Christmas and a Happy New Year to my family and to my staff, 
who are sitting in the public gallery.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Parliamentary Secretary to President 
of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to 
respond on behalf of the minister of immigration to my friend, the 
hon. member for Bourassa.
<P>
	It surprises me that the hon. member for Bourassa seems to be 
concerned about the unity of the Liberal Party, given the present 
condition of his own party. Perhaps he and his colleagues should 
get their own house in order before they start criticizing others.
<P>

<P>
	It is true that the Liberal Party's membership has asked the 
government to examine the right of landing fee, and that is exactly 
what we are going to do. We will take the recommendation from 
the party very seriously.
<P>
	The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration has already said 
that she will look at the question in depth. Such a review will need 
to take into consideration several factors, including the views of the 
party, the wishes of the Canadian people and the fiscal restraints 
facing the government.
<P>
	When the Government of Canada introduced the right of landing 
fee it created a loan option for immigrants and refugees to help get 
the financial assistance they need to help pay the fee. Not all 
immigrants have immediate resources necessary to pay costs 
associated with becoming a permanent resident. The government 
knows that and that is why we developed a loan program in the first 
place. The loan is available to newcomers who can show that they 
need it and have the potential to repay it.
<P>
	The loan option helps to maintain a balance between Canada's 
humanitarian commitments and the government's response to 
program review. It helps us to ensure that no one will be denied 
permanent residence just because they did not have enough money 
in the bank.
<P>
	We have a good system in place which helps us to meet our 
immigration needs and our humanitarian commitments. We are 
constantly striving to make the system even better. If it means 
re-examining our policies, we would not hesitate to do that, which 
is exactly what the government is going to do.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> A motion to adjourn the 
House is now deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly, the 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.29 p.m.)
