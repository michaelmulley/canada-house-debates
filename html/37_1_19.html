</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ovid Jackson (Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, today all of Canada's parliamentary representatives had 
the distinct pleasure and privilege of hearing the Right Hon. 
Tony Blair, the Prime Minister of Great Britain, deliver his 
address to the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prime Minister Blair paid tribute to and talked about the deep 
links between our two countries, which he said went beyond 
economics and were deeper than commerce.  We were very pleased 
with Prime Minister Blair's words about Canada's honourable 
reputation and how prominent Canadians are around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prime Minister Blair noted the development between Britain and 
Canada in the use of the human rights act.  Prime Minister Blair 
astutely pointed out that our two countries continue to have a 
special relationship, with Canada being the country in North 
America closest to Europe and Britain being the country in Europe 
closest to North America.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Peschisolido (Richmond, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in April 1999 the federal government started requiring 
Canadian residents to report their foreign assets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was a ham-fisted way of trying to reduce tax evasion.  It 
has not worked.  In fact, it has discouraged many immigrant 
investors and has done nothing for compliance.  People are moving 
from resident to non-resident status, thus paying no taxes at 
all.  This threatens to take as much as $1 billion out of the 
B.C. economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, tomorrow I will send a letter to the Ministers of 
Finance and National Revenue asking them to commission the 
auditor general to conduct a cost benefit analysis of the foreign 
asset disclosure rule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that the ministers and auditor general will respond 
quickly.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this 
year scores of young Canadians visited Antarctica with the 
Students on Ice Expedition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Students and teachers from all across Canada participated in 
this remarkable experience.  They included:  Ben Whatley of PCVS, 
Justin Tighe of Norwood District High School, Aimie Elliot of 
Omemee, Virissa Lenters of Cobourg West Collegiate and Justin 
Standeven of Clarke High School.  Most of these students are with 
the Kawartha Pine Ridge District School Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These students are now ambassadors for Antarctica in Canada. 
Their “Statement on Antarctica” calls on Canada to become a 
full member of the Antarctic treaty and to ratify the treaty's 
environmental protocol.  To learn more about these students, 
visit www.studentsonice.com. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take the advice of these wonderful young Canadians.  As a 
great polar nation, we have a moral responsibility to participate 
fully in the protection and appropriate use of Antarctica.

have a downturn in our coal and steel industries and we have over

</I></B></P><P align=left>Cape Breton is a very diverse society.  We have to communicate 
and work with all the various departments of this government. 
This gives me a great challenge.  As a new MP I have to learn 
very quickly to make sure our concerns are heard.  I also want to 
help other Canadians to keep this country the number one place in 
the world to live.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this government should be ashamed. It 
should be ashamed because it continues to fuel the flames of 
western alienation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This past Friday a meeting was held in my hometown of Yorkton, 
where over 300 people joined together to discuss the idea of 
western separation.  At the meeting it was stated over and over 
again that Ottawa ignores the west, and people had plenty of 
examples to back up their statements:  the lack of attention to 
the farm crisis; the unaccountability of our Prime Minister; the 
lack of democracy in the House of Commons and Senate.  The list 
goes on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the government refuses to address any of these 
issues, which only adds fuel to the fire.  We have been telling 
the Liberal government about the dissatisfaction of westerners 
for years and we have been giving the government ample ways to 
deal with the problems, yet it refuses to listen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The movement for western separation did not just pop up 
overnight.  It is the result of years of Liberal neglect of 
western issues and a lack of democracy. 
Now the government wants to blame farmers for this movement. 
What the Liberals cannot seem to realize is that it is their 
fault this whole issue arose and it is really not Canada that—

Speaker, the last couple of months have been especially difficult 
for farmers.  I certainly understand the difficulties farmers are 
going through, especially with poor prices and bad growing 
conditions this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year will be no exception.  Farmers are facing rising costs 
of production and an unfair playing field with the European Union 
and the United States when it comes to subsidies. Some grain and 
oilseed farmers in my riding, for example, cannot afford to buy 
their seeds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call upon the federal government to come forward with an 
assistance program that will deal with this financial hurt.  This 
is a critical time for our farmers and their farms, especially 
with spring seeding just around the corner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to reassure all farmers in my constituency that I have 
not forgotten their situation and that I will continue to voice 
their concerns.

Mr. Speaker, at Saint-Placide, on the shores of Lac des

Guides play a vital role in our communities and their devotion

William E. McKinney, who passed away in New Westminster on 
February 12, 2001.  Born in Boissevain, Manitoba, on June 25, 
1915, he is survived by his loving wife of 60 years, Beryl, four 
children and six grandchildren. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He arrived in New Westminster in 1937 and retired as 
vice-president of Johnson Terminals in 1980.  He was president of 
the Lions, a school trustee, chair of the YWCA board, chair of 
the city crime prevention committee, director of the Kiwanis Care 
Centre, Citizen of the Year in 1985 and president of the Canadian 
Diabetes Association Vancouver, to name just a few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was awarded the Order of British Columbia and was made 
honorary chief constable of the city.  He joined the army in 
1940, was commissioned and served in the U.K. and Europe.  Upon 
his return he joined the local militia and later commanded his 
Royal Westminster Regiment for two different terms and was later 
honorary colonel from 1980. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He left the community a better place than he found it.  A man of 
action, strong opinions and a heart of gold, who showed us all 
how to live and never stop giving, my friend Bill was indeed a 
great Canadian.

</I></B></P><P align=left>They mentioned the following concerns: attacks on freedom of 
religion such as the arrest and detention of Catholics, 
Protestants and Buddhists; the repression against intellectuals, 
writers, democrat political leaders and protectors of human 
rights; the greater control of the state over the national and 
foreign press; and the decision to impose the death penalty for 
29 different crimes, which led to the execution, in April 2000, 
of a Canadian citizen, Nguyen Thu Hiep.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, last fall, the 
Prime Minister of Canada admitted that he made a mistake in 
imposing the new employment insurance program. Now, the 
government is back at it with Bill C-2, which only partially 
corrects the mistakes of the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the permanent perverse effects of the current 
program, the Minister of Human Resources Development penalized, 
in the whole Lower St. Lawrence, North Shore, 
Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean and Charlevoix region, the workers whose 
applications were submitted between July 9 and September 17, 
2000, by requiring them to work 525 hours to qualify and by 
giving them only 21 weeks of benefits. All this to correct the 
injustice resulting from the minister's improvised review of the 
employment insurance regions. There is no reason justifying such 
discrimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The office of the Prime Minister was informed of the situation 
on December 22 and we are still waiting, like the unemployed 
concerned, the quick restoring of a fair treatment for seasonal

with the Canadian oil company, Talisman Energy.  Some of the

deplorable.

<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we are going through a volatile period.  Everyone 
understands that.  Everyone understands what has happened in the 
United States.  The simple question is why on the other hand is 
it that the Leader of the Opposition will not point out the good 
things that are happening instead of trying to talk us into a 
recession as he has been doing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me just tell the House that our housing starts, as an 
example, are up more than 20%.  That is the highest in six years. 
Why does he not point that out? 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Finance is the only 
person using the recession word in the House.  I am not.  And I 
was not talking to the market this morning when it fell below 
8,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Falling markets do not just affect so-called rich people.  It 
affects many Canadians:  those who invest in union pensions, in 
RRSPs, and in the CPP.  All of those investments have taken a 
hit.  As a matter of fact, about half of all Canadians are 
invested in some way in the markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How much money will Canadians need to lose before the Minister 
of Finance brings in an up to date budget and shows that we have 
a plan to take us through these choppy economic times? 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would ask the Leader of the Opposition to take a look 
at the transcript of the press conference that he gave earlier in 
the week.  He kept begging the press to ask him, to use his 
words, “Ask me about the recession.  Ask me about the recession. 
Don't ask me about my litigation fees.  Ask me about the 
recession”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is exactly what he was saying.  I would suggest to the 
Leader of the Opposition that what he might want to do is to go 
on a speaking tour of the United States and the litigation fees 
alone would turn the U.S. economy around. 
<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is about as on topic as me 
talking about him registering his ships in other places and 
avoiding taxes and having people in other countries build his 
ships when the shipbuilding industry here could use that 
business.  Some of us cannot avoid those taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A falling dollar means a weakened economy.  It zaps the buying 
power of Canadians.  It puts our economy at a disadvantage.  He 
might be at an advantage by taking his business offshore but how 
much lower will the dollar have to go?  It fell below 65 cents 
just a few minutes ago.  That is not my fault.  I did not talk it 
down. 
<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  The 
question, Mr. Speaker, is how much lower can the Leader of the 
Opposition stoop? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Leader of the Opposition wants a report on what is going 
on in the economy, let me give some examples.  In addition to 
housing starts, let us look at our retail sales.  In December our 
retail sales were the strongest they have been in the last three 
years. 
Our trade surplus is $5.8 billion.  That trade surplus is a 
record monthly surplus for this country.

Mr. Speaker, if that was the case, then why did the industry

Dakota.  We have assured it happening by our taxpayers' $32 
million funding that transfer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the minister again to demonstrate he has some 
understanding of his own department as much as he has of many of 
the other members' departments in the House.  The fact remains 
that Canadian taxpayers should not be fleeced to bolster the 
United States economy.  The fact remains that $32 million is a 
lot of cross border shopping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I again ask the minister why it is that Canadian people should

intervene with respect to the rights of workers and/or the union

Mr. Speaker, I raise my question of privilege in response to a

Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot.  This letter was 
distributed to members and to all media.  It came to my attention 
yesterday, February 21. 
I believe this question meets the criteria as described in 
Standing Order 48, and Marleau and Montpetit, page 121.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member's letter contains information discussed in camera 
among the members of the procedure and house affairs subcommittee 
on private members' business.  This, in and of itself, has been 
found to constitute a prima facie matter of privilege, as noted 
in Marleau and Montpetit, page 838 which states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Divulging any part of the proceedings of an <I>in camera</I> 
committee meeting has been ruled by the Speaker to constitute a 
<I>prima facie</I> matter of privilege. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot's Bill 
C-234 was deemed non-votable by the committee, and he wrote in 
his letter that the bill “was ruled non-votable by the 
opposition members on the subcommittee for private members' 
business”.  He went on to say “crude partisanship has thus 
deprived all MPs of a debate”.  He also said “opposition MPs 
have been complaining about the lack of opportunity of backbench 
MPs and the relevance of parliament.  Yet when given a chance to 
do something about it, they failed to take it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I argue that the tone and content of the letter is inappropriate 
and that he has divulged in camera details of a subcommittee to 
other members and to the media.  In doing so he has put both 
myself and all my colleagues in an untenable position of being 
unable to defend ourselves against such charges because to do so 
would force us to divulge information from an in camera meeting, 
which we will not do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you know, Mr. Speaker, it is a committee that works much 
differently than the sometimes more partisan parliamentary 
committees.  I commend all my colleagues for their excellent work 
on the subcommittee for private members' business.  The member 
for Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot may not be aware 
that the decisions as to which bills and motions are deemed 
votable are reached through a consensus process with 
representatives of all parties, including his own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the matter of privilege, Marleau and Montpetit, page 52 
states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—Members can only claim privilege insofar as any denial of their 
rights, or threat made to them, would impede the functioning of 
the House. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit to you, Mr. Speaker, that my right to defend myself, 
and for all members to defend themselves against such 
accusations, have been denied by the member and his actions.  His 
actions have impeded my ability to fulfil my function as a member 
on this committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marleau and Montpetit point out “The unjust damaging of a 
member's good name might also be seen as constituting an 
obstruction”.  In ruling on a question of privilege, Speaker 
Fraser stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The privileges of a Member are violated by any action which might 
impede him or her in the fulfilment of his or her duties and 
functions.  It is obvious that the unjust damaging of a 
reputation could constitute such an impediment. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I respectfully submit that the actions of the member for 
Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot have done just 
that and brought unjust damage to the reputation of all members 
of the subcommittee and, in fact, to the entire House of Commons. 
Members who sat on the subcommittee have worked together and 
given many hours of their time to hear submissions from their 
colleagues from all parties.  Which member in his or her right 
mind would want to give of themselves for the benefit of their 
colleagues knowing that they may be faced with indefensible 
rebukes and the prospect of a damaged reputation from a colleague 
they have sought to assist? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should you, Mr. Speaker, find that this is a prima facie matter 
of privilege, I would be prepared to move the appropriate motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree fully with the very pertinent remarks just made by my 
colleague, the deputy whip of the Canadian Alliance Party.  I 
think that we should not, as parliamentarians, allow such

additional pressure on the members of the subcommittee on private 
members' business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not wish to delay the proceedings of the House, because we 
have an important bill, the act to amend the Canada Elections

of the discussions that took place in this committee.

the members of the opposition but it is also an insult to the 
government member who chairs that committee, and who placed a 
heavy emphasis on the consensual character of these 
deliberations, and on their non-partisan nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The strongest proof that the composition of this subcommittee is 
not like other House committees is that the government is in the 
minority; there is only one Liberal MP, the chair.  The four 
opposition parties are represented on it. This is a clear 
illustration of this parliament's desire for, and custom and 
tradition of, lending it a consensual and non-partisan character.

made by a consensus of all the committee members.  There was no

</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, in our case there were eight New Democrats 
who presented motions to the committee and only one was chosen. 
There were no government motions.  There was no Conservative

the Bloc had more motions chosen than anyone else.  That was the

camera with respect to the private members' bills that were 
deemed votable or not votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you are very well aware, Mr. Speaker, one of the awkward 
things about this subcommittee is it is dominated by the 
opposition members.  It deliberates in camera.  A report is 
tabled in the House and there is no opportunity at any time for 
the members affected by whether their bill is chosen to be 
votable or non-votable.  There is no opportunity at anytime to 
know the reason why the bill is deemed votable or not votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, if I may just go through my letter. I think I need to 
defend myself.  I am sure, Mr. Speaker, you will agree that I 
have not said anything in my letter that besmirches the 
reputations of my colleagues opposite, nor in any sense, shall we 
say deviates from the information that I have fairly acquired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, the first paragraph said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My Bill C-234 to amend the Supreme Court Act was ruled 
non-votable by the opposition members on the sub-committee for 
private members' business even though it met all the criteria for 
votability. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite you, Mr. Speaker, to examine my bill versus the known 
criteria for votability and you will find there is no argument. 
It met every one of those criteria for votability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as my knowing that the opposition members voted against 
making my bill votable, I can assure the House that that arises 
from the fact that I had and still have great confidence that 
certainly the Liberal member on the subcommittee for private 
members' business would not have argued against his own 
colleague's bill.  So by elimination, Mr. Speaker, it was very 
clear that the opposition members, now by their own admission, 
Mr. Speaker, in this Chamber, now the opposition members do admit 
that they did speak against my bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second paragraph said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would have required the Supreme Court to consider the 
intent of parliament when considering Charter cases.  It would 
also have prevented the government from broadly applying 
split-decisions like that of Marshall where the Micmac were given 
an aboriginal right to the fishery.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you will agree that there is nothing contentious in 
that, which merits a point of privilege.  It is a mere statement 
of the truth and a mere statement of what my bill would have 
done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the third paragraph may have caused a little bit of 
awkwardness on the part of my colleagues opposite, where I say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Crude partisanship has thus deprived all MPs of a debate on 
judicial activism and judge-made Charter law that most of us have 
been crying out for. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit, first and foremost that in this 
place of all places, to accuse another member of being partisan 
is one of the most normal things that could possibly occur here, 
because indeed more often than not, particularly during question 
period, we pride ourselves on being partisan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the adjective “crude” was a little offensive.  But, 
Mr. Speaker, I would draw your attention to the fact that when 
items are selected for their votability, among the many items 
that come before the subcommittee, is that they have the option 
of selecting 10 items.  In this instance they only selected 
seven.  They could have selected three Liberal items. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out that it was not only me that had an item before the 
committee.  The member for Davenport and the member for 
Lac-Saint-Louis, both Liberal members, also had items before the 
committee yet they were not chosen to be votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can only conclude, as a member, that crude 
partisanship must have taken effect because all three of these 
Liberal items met all the criteria.  If the people who were 
deliberating on this wanted to reject other opposition bills, 
that was perfectly fair. But I really do feel that there is no 
point of privilege here.  As I stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Opposition MPs have been 
complaining about the lack of opportunity of backbench MPs and 
the irrelevance of Parliament. Yet when given a chance to do 
something about it, they failed to take it. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I merely stated the truth. 
<P><A NAME="LINK149"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  We have had an extensive discussion on 
the question of privilege raised by the hon. member for 
Dewdney—Alouette.  The Chair would like to thank all hon. 
members who participated in this discussion for their 
interventions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that at first glance it might appear that there 
was some basis for objection when one reads the first paragraph 
of the letter of the hon. member for 
Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, from which he quoted 
extensively in the course of his remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chair is of course very mindful of the privileges of the 
House and anxious to ensure that they are properly upheld. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I must say that a few years ago I was a member of this 
subcommittee and I took part in the discussions.  The 
subcommittee operated exactly as has been described today. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that it proceeded by consensus then.  We always strove to 
obtain that and avoid a vote.  There was not a government 
majority on the subcommittee at that time.  It was one where 
members worked together to choose the bills that were of interest 
to members of the House and were chosen for that purpose.  It 
sounded to me, in the discussion today, as though the committee 
is carrying on exactly as it had before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The letter sent by the hon. member for 
Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot may have been somewhat 
indelicate but, having said that, I do not think that it has 
offended or breached the privileges of any hon. member.  Some 
have clearly found it offensive.  I can understand why that might 
be so, but partisanship is a fact of life in this Chamber.  As 
the hon. member has pointed out, we do have it from time to time. 
Sometimes members make the mistake of sending partisan letters 
here and there.  This one appears to have gone everywhere. It is 
one of those things that happens from time to time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I think we have had an airing of the grievance.  I 
think it is a grievance.  I do not believe it is a question of 
privilege.  Having had the airing, I believe we will let the 
matter settle there.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.) </B>moved that Bill C-9, an act to amend the Canada 
Elections Act and the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act, be 
read the second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased today to introduce the bill 
entitled an act to amend the Canada Elections Act and the 
Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to make changes to reflect the Ontario Court of Appeal 
decision in <I>Figueroa</I> concerning the identification of political 
party affiliation on the ballot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I trust that all hon. members will acknowledge the importance of 
re-examining certain provisions of the Canada Elections Act and that we 
will support this process. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to explain the reasons we are counting on the support 
of all hon. members for what I hope will be the expeditious 
passage of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Late August of last year the Ontario Court of Appeal rendered 
its decision in what has become known as the Figueroa case.  In 
his argument, Mr. Figueroa, representing the Communist Party of 
Canada, challenged the constitutionality of the provisions of the 
Canada Elections Act relating to the official registration of 
political parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, he argued that the requirements that a party nominate 50 
candidates, which is the rule with which we are familiar, in 
order to be an official party violated section 3 of the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  Mr. Figueroa claimed that 
because they were deprived of official recognition, certain 
parties were not entitled to the same tax benefits as were 
provided for other official parties and were accordingly placed 
at a disadvantage in what he claimed to be a violation of 
guarantees under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this point, the Ontario Court of Appeals affirmed that the 
political parties play an important role in the electoral 
process.  The court stressed that any political party aspiring to 
form a government or to play a significant role in the affairs of 
the state must at least offer a large enough number of candidates 
to allow for such a role.  In other words, one person or two and 
so on is not a political party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The court also noted that the principle of effective 
representation underlying section 3 of the charter is only given 
expression when a political party assumes a significant level of 
involvement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the court's view, the issue was therefore to determine a 
reasonable number of candidates to meet the criteria for the 
purpose of tax benefits, and a current limit of 50 appeared 
reasonable in every respect.  We agree with that point and that 
provision will therefore remain unchanged.  In other words, if 
one cannot round up 50 candidates, one does not get the tax 
benefits.

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time Mr. Figueroa challenged the minimal requirement 
of 50 candidates in order for the candidate's political 
affiliation to be included with his or her name on the ballot. 
This was ruled to be a separate and different point.  Prior to 
that most of us had assumed that to be the same threshold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His reasoning on this issue was that the identification of each 
candidate's political affiliation on the ballot made it easier 
for voters to choose.  The Ontario Court of Appeal took careful 
note of Mr. Figueroa's statement in that regard. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the moment, as I have said, the existing law does not 
provide for the identification of candidates, except when they 
belong to a duly registered political party.  So, if the party 
is not duly registered, it is not recorded on the ballot.  That 
means that they, here too, must run a minimum of 50 candidates 
to have the party name appear with the candidate's name on the 
ballot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, on this point, the Ontario court of appeal has 
recognized that, in certain instances, political affiliation can 
play a role in the choice of the electorate and that, therefore, 
it must be indicated clearly on the ballot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the court held that, while the criteria set for 
official recognition of a political party are entirely 
justifiable for the purposes of granting financial assistance, 
this is not the case with the identification of the political 
affiliation on the ballot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the court noted, just the political identification 
of a candidate on a ballot can cause the voter to choose one or 
another candidate.  This would be particularly relevant in the 
case of two candidates from two different parties with the same 
name. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, for all these reasons, the court recognized that 
candidates' identification and political affiliation on a ballot 
are justified and important enough for political parties to have 
greater access. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There again, we must have a minimum number of candidates to 
reasonably talk about political parties without misleading 
voters. It is critical that voters can make an educated choice. 
That, of course, automatically rules out individual candidates. 
In other words, a person is not a political party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government is proposing to this House amendments that 
reflect the ruling issued by the Ontario Court of Appeal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1991, the Lortie commission proposed a minimum of 15 
candidates for the name of a party to appear on the ballots. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is of course no magical number. In this House, a party 
must have a minimum of 12 elected members to be officially 
recognized. Therefore, we are proposing to set the number at 12. 
Twelve candidates could, in theory, when they are registered on 
ballots, form a political party in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, in order to achieve that recognition, a party would 
have to get 100% of its candidates elected, which is unlikely. 
But still— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> It is mathematically possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B> It is mathematically possible, as the hon. 
member opposite said. In fact, it almost happened to my political 
party in Ontario. So, it is mathematically possible, and this is 
why we are proposing it. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The number 12 is found in various functions of our parliamentary 
system.  It coincides, as I said a moment ago, with the number 
required for recognition in the House.  If a party does not have 
12 members in the House, it is not a political party or no longer 
a political party and so on.  In this way small political parties 
could be identified on the ballot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We propose that henceforth the name of a political institution 
comprising at least 12 candidates in an election be included 
along with the name of those candidates on the ballot.  This does 
not give an automatic tax incentive for that group of people.  In 
that regard the threshold would remain at 50. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must never lose sight of the fact that the Canada Elections 
Act forms the very foundation of our democratic process.  Its 
primary purpose is one of access, in the absolute respect of our 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
It must be open to Canadians to exercise their democratic right 
to promote new ideas in parliament.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the modifications we made in the last parliament made it 
possible for a large number of Canadians to vote where they would 
have been prevented from doing so before.  I am very proud of the 
fact that the House in the last parliament sought to widen the 
franchise as it did, allowing people who are out of the country 
to vote and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must welcome with enthusiasm and generosity the emergence of 
any political party capable of enriching and complementing our 
society.  Indeed, two of the five parties represented in the 
House today did not even exist a decade ago, so obviously our 
present system has permitted the emergence of new political 
parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the new act entered into force in September 2000 its 
implementation has revealed a few anomalies that need to be 
rectified.  I propose to do so at the same time with the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill introduces amendments to the Canada Elections Act that 
are of a more technical nature.  Sometimes the amendments are 
simply terminological changes to make English and French versions 
consistent.  At other times there was a reference to a committee 
of the House when it should have referred to a committee of both 
houses, and I am correcting that as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I indicate to all hon. members that it is my 
intention in the future, following the presentation of the chief 
electoral officer to the parliamentary committee, to listen to 
the committee's advice and to propose substantive changes to the 
Canada Elections Act where there is a consensus to do so.  I 
intend to do so quite openly, as I did in the last parliament, to 
incorporate ideas from all sides of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That will happen at a time in the future, once we have listened 
to the report of the chief electoral officer and the important 
contribution made by the parliamentary committee.  I want the 
House to know that I am quite open and quite willing to do that 
when the time comes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not before us today.  What is before us today is merely 
to respect the decision of the court to correct the law in a way 
that makes it possible to recognize the court's decision, to 
correct the legislation accordingly and to do so within the 
timeframe the court has given to us.  That is why I hope we will 
pass the bill very quickly in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time I want to assure hon. members that this is not 
the only change I propose to make to the Canada Elections Act in 
this parliament.  I am quite open to listening to the 
constructive advice of all hon. members, after the chief 
electoral officer appears before the committee, and to undertake 
further changes as will have been deemed necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile I ask all parliamentarians in the House to support 
these minor changes, changes which are important, because we have 
been instructed by the court to take care of them.  I believe the 
changes we are undertaking today will improve the Canada 
Elections Act.  The changes we will undertake after the chief 
electoral officer appears before the parliamentary committee, as 
well as the recommendations of the committee which is chaired by 
my own parliamentary secretary, will do so even more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank hon. members for their co-operation in the matter.  I 
hope the bill will go to committee in a timely manner so that we 
can respect fully the court's decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tony Blair's speech today reminded us of the link between 
Britain and Canada.  To listen to our Prime Minister one might 
have been forgiven for thinking that the chief link between 
Canada and Britain was that it was our number two investor, as if 
this place were not named after the House of Commons at 
Westminster, as if Canada and Britain did not share a head of 
state in Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, and as if we had not based 
our own constitution upon that of the United Kingdom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The preamble to the British North America Act, our constitution, 
reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas the Provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick 
have expressed their Desire to be federally united into One 
Dominion under the Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain 
and Ireland, with a Constitution similar in Principle to that of 
the United Kingdom: 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This then went on and dealt with substantive items. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea at the time was that we would benefit as Canadians from 
the liberties and ancient freedoms that Englishmen had enjoyed 
and that the unwritten British constitution guaranteed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1868 the classic statement of those liberties was given in 
Walter Bagehot's famous book <I>The English Constitution</I>, a 
classic which is still read today by those who seek to understand 
both the British constitution and the unwritten aspects of our 
own constitution, many of which are still in place today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Walter Bagehot stated something very interesting, which is of 
relevance to the debate today, on the legislation before the 
House.  He stated that the United Kingdom, although nominally a 
kingdom, was not a tyranny like the monarchies of the European 
continent but rather that it was, in hidden or veiled form, a 
republic.  He meant that it was a country with a mixed system of 
government; that is to say, with a monarch, with an aristocratic 
element in the form of the House of Lords and with a democratic 
element in the form of the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was the ideal represented by Great Britain at the time.  It 
was also the ideal that we had hoped to gel in Canada when we 
created our constitution.  We wanted to set as our principle the 
goal of being, as much as we could be, a mirror image and a 
transcript of that country which was the freest country in all 
the world and a model for all the world.  That was the ideal our 
laws were meant to represent up to the present day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly, Bill C-9 does not reflect any of that.  It reflects 
instead our degraded constitutional status.  I am speaking of the 
unwritten constitution in which the Queen and the Governor 
General are no longer permitted to bear the true pomp and dignity 
of their office.  Much of that role has been taken over by an 
increasingly self-important and pompous prime ministerial office. 
The Senate is no longer the natural aristocracy it was meant to 
be but has become a body full of appointed political hacks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, and the greatest tragedy of all, the Commons, the 
democratic wing of government, is no longer a parliamentary body 
but an electoral college in perpetual session whose role is to 
perpetually reaffirm the status of the Prime Minister as the 
elected monarch of the country.  Canada is an elected monarchy 
today, and this is a great degradation from the original model 
that was set up and understood by the Fathers of Confederation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lone remaining aspect of our original republican 
constitution, republican in the original form, is the electoral 
process that takes place and allows this electoral college to be 
elected every four or five years or, in the case of this 
government, every three and a half years.  That part of our 
constitution does still function somewhat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I am afraid to say that a series of initiatives, 
culminating in this pernicious bill, seek to deprive us of the 
full measure of freedom our electoral system is meant to 
guarantee.  The bill does this, regrettably, by depriving small 
parties of the full right to participate in elections on the same 
terms as major parties, such as the Liberal Party, my own party 
and all the parties represented in the House.  It also deprives 
independent candidates of that equivalent right.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It does this in the following manner.  It seeks to do so by 
being part of a concerted strategy of squeezing the freedom out 
of free elections.  We see the government taking action over and 
over again to put restrictions on third party advertising as its 
laws are struck down by the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Laws are passed restricting third party advertising.  They are 
taken to court, struck down, re-enacted with minor variations and 
will be struck down again.  In the meantime third party 
advertising cannot take place.  That is something of which we 
should all be ashamed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In another matter related to the bill we saw the federal 
government's failure in June 1995 to permit the mandated review 
by law of the referendum act.  We now see restrictions being 
placed on the rights of minor parties to participate on an 
equivalent or equal footing with the larger parties in federal 
elections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to give a bit of historical background to explain exactly 
how the present situation has evolved.  In May 1993 the previous 
Progressive Conservative government with all party support, 
except for the support of the hon. member for Beaver River who is 
now the member for Edmonton North, passed a law stating that any 
party which failed to field 50 candidates in a federal election 
would have its assets confiscated.  There would be a process by 
which the assets would be sold off.  Its debts would be cleared 
and any remaining money would be turned over to the Receiver 
General for Canada or, more correctly, to the chief electoral 
officer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of the law being passed and the fact that the 
Communist Party of Canada failed to field 50 candidates in the 
1993 election, the Communist Party of Canada was ordered to close 
up shop in the manner prescribed by the law.  The Communist Party 
did so, but the leader of the Communist Party, Mr. Miguel 
Figueroa, took the electoral law to court and argued that the 50 
candidate rule was unconstitutional. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It took a long time for him to work his way through the court 
system, but in a ruling on March 10, 1999, Madam Justice Anne 
Marie Malloy of the Ontario Court, General Division, ruled that 
the Canada Elections Act violated the charter of rights in a 
number of important ways and that therefore substantial chunks of 
the law would be struck down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote from Madam Justice Malloy's decision in order to 
make the point.  She wrote the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only parties which nominate at least 50 candidates in a federal 
election are entitled to be registered under the Act.  This 
provision violates s. 3 of the Charter because it provides an 
advantage to candidates of larger parties while denying it to 
others—Further, the fifty-candidate threshold is not rationally 
connected to stated objectives of ensuring that only “serious” 
parties or parties with a broad base of support be entitled to 
register—There is a rational basis for restricting registration 
to parties which have at least two candidates as the act of 
running a slate of candidates under one party banner is the 
hallmark of a political party. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is to distinguish parties from independents. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The appropriate remedy is to read into the relevant provisions 
the requirement of at least two candidates for registered status, 
rather than the current 50-candidate threshold. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She continued to say that the defendant, the government, 
conceded that the provision that only candidates of registered 
parties are entitled to have their party affiliation appear on 
the ballot infringes on freedom of expression contrary to 
subsection 2(b) of the charter.  The government itself admitted 
that.  She continued: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also infringes the s. 3 rights of those candidates because the 
use of a party identifier is a benefit which should not be 
extended to any candidates if it is not extended on an equal 
basis to all. 
</UL>
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1545"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She went on to say the following.  The provision for automatic 
deletion from the register of a party which fails to nominate at 
least 50 candidates in any federal election, the effect of which 
is that the party is required to sell all of its assets, pay its 
debts and remit any positive balance to the government, has a 
devastating financial effect on political parties, as well as on 
voters, and limits the ability of a party to continue its support 
of its candidate.  It violates the section 3 rights of both. 
Since the supporters of the party are less able in association 
with each other through their chosen party to express their 
political views to the public, the provision also infringes their 
right to freedom of expression and freedom of association 
contrary to sections 2(b) and 2(d) of the charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During this part of the speech, the minister has been offering 
some commentary about how parts of this decision were overruled 
by the Ontario court of appeal.  He is quite correct as to the 
facts; there was some overruling of some parts of the bill.  What 
he does not mention is that the court of appeal's ruling is 
itself at this point being appealed by Mr. Figueroa and we do not 
yet know whether those parts will be reinstated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be my interpretation that in fact Madam Justice 
Malloy's interpretation was correct and the government lawyers 
were in fact quite unreasonable in their understanding of the 
relevant parts of the constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In dealing with responding to the court's ruling, the court of 
appeal instructed the government to produce legislation to deal 
with the unconstitutionality of parts of the law within six 
months.  It in fact complied, shy one day of six months, by 
producing this law, Bill C-9, which gives the narrowest 
conceivable interpretation to the court's decision and to the 
rights protected by the court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, the government appears to have put in a number of very 
vindictive provisions designed to ensure that small parties—not 
its party, not my party, not the Bloc Quebecois or the NDP or the 
Progressive Conservatives, but small parties and 
independents—will not have access to certain rights that are or 
should be extended to all parties on an equal footing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am thinking here of allowing the issuance of tax receipts 
between elections.  I am thinking here of the right to a final 
voters list as opposed to merely a preliminary voters list, and 
that is a significant factor for a party contesting an election, 
for example, in my own riding, which is growing rapidly and where 
the preliminary voters list has unfortunately a very limited 
correspondence to reality by the time of an election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should also mention that free time political advertising is 
restricted for these small parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has reinstated, as best it can, the 
unconstitutional 50 candidate rule, which will of course be 
struck down on appeal eventually after a number of years go by, 
at great expense to these small parties and these private 
citizens.  It will accomplish that temporarily.  It will deprive 
these parties of their rights to freely contest elections.  It 
will deprive people who want to get together in smaller 
groupings, for whatever reason, or who do not have the resources 
to create large groupings, such as the communists and some of the 
other small parties, some of whom contested the election in my 
riding against me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I may not agree with them ideologically, but I think they have 
the right to run against me.  If they can convince the voters 
that they are better representatives of voter interests than I 
am, that is fair.  I should not have an extra advantage.  I 
certainly do not think that the 172 or 173 members on that side 
of the House, whatever the number is, should have any extra 
advantage over these small parties either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I had been told that one day I would be making common cause 
with the communists against Her Majesty's government, I do not 
think I would have believed it, but here we are.  Today I am 
making common cause with members of all small parties in defence 
of an equal, equitable playing field, of fairness for all 
independents and for all people who wish to contest elections, 
and in defence of our constitutional rights.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have only a paraphrase here, but Voltaire, speaking to someone 
with whom he disagreed profoundly, said “I disagree with 
everything you say but I would defend to the death your right to 
say it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the government and this minister unfortunately seem to 
be saying something that is just about the opposite.  It is 
saying it might actually agree with what one is saying, maybe 
even with most of it, but it will happily violate the 
constitution in any way it can think of in order to restrict 
one's right to say it.  That is a shame.  It should be stopped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be opposing the bill.  I encourage all members of all 
parties, including those who enjoy the benefits of this law, to 
fight against it and to ensure that it does not go through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I apologize to the House for failing to give credit to 
the Alliance member for North Vancouver for producing the number 
of 12 MPs which I proposed today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I am not sure that sounds quite like a point 
of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Reid:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
It is my understanding that the member for North Vancouver did 
not in fact introduce the 50 number that is being used for all 
important rights under this law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I think it is apparent that we seem to be in 
an argument rather than on a point of order, interesting as it 
may be.  These are not uncommon in the Chamber. 
<P><A NAME="LINK161"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, let me just say that a dozen is certainly a good, round 
number.  I know that my colleague from North Vancouver proposed 
that, and in fact the government listened.  The government House 
leader just said that it could have been 15, it could have been 
12, but I see that he took the expert and wonderful advice of one 
of my colleagues, my colleague from North Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk for a few minutes today about this 
particular bill.  I am amazed, I suppose, but I probably should 
not be.  The fact that this went to court and had to get resolved 
there is what forced the government to act.  It just seems kind 
of pathetic.  Surely if something is worthwhile changing, it is, 
and dear knows there were more things in the Canada Elections Act 
that the government could have changed other than this one thing, 
but the government always seems to be spurred on by a court 
decision.  Everything is reactive in this government.  It does 
not just think something is a wonderful idea and go ahead with 
it.  The courts act in such and such a way and that triggers a 
reaction to something that the government needs to react to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-9 wants to amend the Canada Elections Act.  My colleague 
for Lanark—Carleton has talked about the numbers and how it is a 
consistent thing anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the number of people that we need in the House 
for a party to be registered or acknowledged or recognized as an 
official party, I know something about it, as you know, Mr. 
Speaker.  I sat here certainly as a proud member of a political 
party and with much machinery around the country, but I was 
treated as an independent here in the House of Commons.  I know 
you were certainly kind to me and I do appreciate that.  You did 
know the rules and regulations, as has obviously now been proven. 
You are sitting in the big chair, as it were.  You provided me 
with a great deal of help.  I remember Speaker John Fraser was 
very kind to me too because he said that after all I had won an 
election fairly and squarely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So I have a vested interest certainly in speaking out on behalf 
of those who belong to smaller political parties.  In fact, I 
remember that when the Reform Party fielded its first candidates 
in the 1988 election several of us ran.  I think we fielded 
candidates in 72 out of the 88 western ridings.  However, until 
we of course got to that magic number of 50, everyone was 
concerned because we were not able to act as if we were a full 
blown political party.  I remember that there was great 
excitement when we got to that number and were able to say that 
we really could be recognized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems passing strange to me that a government would react. 
That seems to be the substance of the government:  only when 
pushed into something does it act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, let us look at some of the issues.  Even though a party 
may field 12 candidates and be a registered party, is it 
registered?  Not really.  We could talk about it, but in fact it 
is just deemed to be a political party, not a registered party. 
If we look at the House of Commons now and at the precedent which 
has been set for some time that we need to have 12 members to be 
recognized, I would have loved to have had that changed when I 
was sitting as an “independent” member here, but the rules and 
the traditions were that a party needed a dozen members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at this law, we see that it moves to a dozen, which 
is a good first step, but the party is still not a “registered” 
political party.  That means it cannot use all the tools that are 
available.  It just seems most unfortunate. 
Even though they have 12 candidates they are not able to obtain a 
final list of electors.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has not even been three months since we have come into the 
new parliament.  The election was less than three months ago and 
when I look around at what all of us went through in the election 
campaign, I would like to tell the House a couple of tales from 
the trail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was in Edmonton North specifically, but I know that this 
happened not just there.  In fact, when I think about this final 
list of electors, whereby we have gone to a permanent 
enumeration, what a nightmare that is for areas of the country 
such as the constituency I represent in Edmonton North, where 
there are new houses being built daily.  Every time I go out door 
knocking there is an entire new subdivision there.  I am not sure 
if it is the same in Kingston and the Islands, but I know things 
are hot in Edmonton North. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our returning officer is Phyllis Basaraba, for whom I have an 
incredible amount of respect.  I appreciated so much the work she 
did.  However, she was not given the tools.  We went into the 
Elections Canada office which she was trying like crazy to get up 
and running because the election came so quickly.  My campaign 
team was going out into new areas of Bellerive and new housing 
developments which were being built so quickly, and they were 
drawing maps.  Elections Canada had no idea of these new places. 
My guys were out door knocking and were drawing physical maps of 
where houses were and where lakes were.  We would then take these 
maps over to the returning office and say “Guess what? There are 
836 houses in this district”.  They would say that they had 
absolutely no idea of these people on the electors list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something is wrong there.  It is not just the smaller political 
parties that would not have access to final voters lists.  Surely 
we need to get proper lists in place.  That is a real deficiency 
I see in the Canada Elections Act and is surely something the 
government could have and should have come up with.  Maybe it 
would have come up with it if it had been taken to court about 
it, but it always has to be reactive instead of proactive.  This 
was something from this last election that was very difficult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obtaining free broadcast time is another difficulty.  Having 
represented a smaller political party in days gone by, I know 
that there is always that battle about free advertising time in 
political broadcasting, which is certainly something that people 
should have the advantage of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, there is the whole idea of issuing tax receipts to donors. 
Again, a legitimate party should be able to issue tax receipts at 
any time of year, not just during a writ period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, someone whom you know and remember well, Elwin 
Hermanson, has left this place and is the leader of the 
Saskatchewan Party now.  In fact, he is the leader of Her 
Majesty's official opposition in Saskatchewan.  You certainly 
know him and remember him well.  He is a fellow who did a 
tremendous job in the House.  There he is out in Saskatchewan 
now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know this may be provincial—it could be federal—but the 
bottom line is that his party was not able to issue tax receipts 
to anyone at any time, even during the writ.  When those people 
ran in the last election about a year and a half ago, there were 
people of goodwill saying “Here is a hundred bucks because I 
believe in the cause”.  I thought not being able to issue tax 
receipts at all was just scandalous.  If these people are going 
to operate as a legitimate political party, they certainly should 
have the right to be able to get those tax receipts issued. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course the NDP in Saskatchewan, I am reminded, had a federal 
wing or cousin, if you will, so it was able to swap receipts back 
and forth or be registered as a provincial party under the 
federal one.  Of course there was no corollary to the 
Saskatchewan Party at the federal level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This seems ludicrous to me.  Of course as we know the 
Saskatchewan Party gave the NDP a good run for its money, even 
without tax receipts, and Elwin is coming very close to being the 
premier of Saskatchewan.  Dear only knows what will happen during 
the next election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look at some of those things I think there really are 
some fundamental injustices.  I am not going to leap to the 
defence of the Communist Party either, but if we do really 
believe in free speech we ought to believe in free speech when it 
is good for us and when it is not so good for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly am not JoJo the psychic, but I do know that there is 
going to be court challenge.  I will bet a loonie that these 
smaller political parties will win, because Figueroa did it and 
someone else is going to do it next.  If it is not the Communist 
Party, it will be some other party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk just for a moment again about the reimbursement of 
election expenses that was provided for under Bill C-2, which was 
a major revision of the Canada Elections Act.  The government is 
making some small and tinkering amendments to it. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1600"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT25"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT25"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1600

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is one that maybe they should have paid a whole lot more 
attention to.  Under this provision, only registered parties, 
those parties that run more than 50 candidates, or now more than 
12, will be reimbursed for election expenses providing they 
obtain either 2% of the national vote or 5% of the aggregate vote 
in their riding in which they endorse candidates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although my party opposes election rebates, we do not believe it 
is fair that only registered parties should be able to do that. I 
agree with my colleague, who said it so well, if people are going 
to vote for those candidates they have every right to do that 
whether I agree with them or not.  I do not think it is fair to 
punish people by not allowing them to be reimbursed for their 
election expenses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about registered parties versus political parties, 
those parties that will not be able to get the benefits of full 
registered parties, I certainly think that sounds like two tier 
democracy.  We all know this government hates to be thought of as 
endorsing two tier anything but we see proof of it all the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at health care, it is just amazing that the 
government stands up and says that it is the champion and the 
saviour of universal health care.  It is not universal.  Many 
times across the country we see that diversity and a real serious 
problem with a government that says one thing and of course does 
another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>HRD grants, immigrant investor loans or something in the 
industry department are other examples where we see that there 
really is a two tier system alive and well with this government, 
and that is unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again today we see evidence that the government believes in two 
tier democracy.  Obviously for members of the government, which 
has a majority and did fairly well in the last few elections, 
they are able to stand up and say that they are tier one.  They 
get all the lists, the free broadcast time and the reimbursement 
of their election expenses.  They can tell us that they are sorry 
for us folks but that we do not get reimbursed.  That is two 
tier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we talk about democracy and the right to free speech, then it 
seems to me that it should be absolutely equivalent for 
everybody.  Let the voters decide that, not the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to make sure that the government is really 
concerned about this issue.  It has to be proactive not just 
reactive, and not take the position that it knows best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the House knows, a party can be in government for a while, 
perhaps a little too long for some of us, but nonetheless, sooner 
or later it will be in opposition again.  That is just as sure as 
God made little green apples.  However, when a party is in 
government it is such an easy thing to assume that it knows 
everything, that it has all the answers and that it really does 
believe in fairness, but it then brings in legislation like this. 
It is a good little start but there are so many other things it 
could have done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What could we do to the Canada Elections Act to make it better? 
How about enumeration?  A little earlier in my remarks I talked 
about the fact that enumeration was just unbelievable.  The 
returning officers across the country were about ready to tear 
their hair out during the last election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we have a shorter writ period.  When I think about the 
last election it amazes me how so many things happened and there 
were such frustrations regarding the enumeration.  The whole idea 
of registered political parties is amazing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk about advance voting.  I would like to comment for 
just a few moments on some of the advanced polling horror 
stories.  I have more tales from the trail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I called into the 1-800 vote number.  It took me some time 
because it seemed to me that no one was ever available there.  In 
the last election I sent people directly to my returning office. 
That was far more successful and they got tremendous answers. Of 
course they could get through on the lines or else just drop in 
to the Northtown Mall where Phyllis Basaraba and her really good 
crew of people were working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, when I phoned the 1-800 number it was like phoning 
someone on a teenage line.  It was almost impossible to get 
through.  When I did get through, this is what happened.  I said 
to the person on the line that my name was Deborah Grey and that 
I was calling from Edmonton North—Deborah being my first name, 
which is not exactly unrecognizable as a woman's name—and I was 
told not once but twice “Just a moment, sir.” 
This was Elections Canada talking to me, a candidate but also a 
member of parliament.  I said my name was Deborah, not Chris, 
Terry, Pat or something like that.  I said that it was Deborah 
Grey calling and I was told “Okay, Sir, I'll be right with 
you”.   This made me nervous right off the bat, as one could 
guess, and I did not, I must confess, have 100% faith in the 
system as it were.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Well it went from bad to worse because the person asked me what 
riding I was calling from.  I told the person I was calling from 
Edmonton North.  I thought that was pretty simple and 
straightforward.  The person then asked me what province I was 
in.  This was a person from Elections Canada.  This was the 
1-800-VOTE where answers were to be given to all our problems. 
Susie Voter could phone in and ask these questions, not that I 
deserve special treatment, but I was the MP, the candidate 
phoning in and I was being asked what province Edmonton North was 
in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is any way that is defensible, I would be really happy 
to hear it.  To me this seems inexcusable from people who are 
supposed to have the answers.  I recall saying that Edmonton is a 
little town out west and the capital of Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I had still been in Beaver River, I could buy that they would 
have a difficult time because who knows where Beaver River is. 
Those of us who live in the area certainly know, but I could 
understand somebody at the other end of the country not having a 
sweet clue frankly of where Beaver River is, but Edmonton North 
is a bit of a hint that it could be the capital city of Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Holy smokes, there are just unbelievable problems in the system. 
It is no wonder Canadians get frustrated with the whole idea of 
whether the electoral system works or whether parliament works 
when the 1-800 number does not even work.  How do we run the 
country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something else I found difficult under the Canada 
Elections Act, particularly with the changes that were made under 
Bill C-2, and something I think the government should be 
addressing in Bill C-9.  If it is going to address amendments to 
the Canada Elections Act under Bill C-9 then it should do it, do 
it once and do it right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the Canadian citizenship idea where someone could ask a 
person if he or she is a Canadian citizen.   Someone could 
respond by saying yes but we would not be able to ask for proof. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just spent a couple of nice weeks in Mexico with my husband. 
When I was asked if I was a Canadian citizen I said, yes, but the 
authorities were not terribly impressed with my charming spirit 
and smile, and the fact that I had said yes, so they asked for my 
passport.  They wanted proof and they had every right to ask for 
proof.  I had my passport and I showed it to them.  I knew I was 
a Canadian citizen.  I knew I had proof and I was happy to 
provide it.  However, here in Canada we are not allowed to do 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If any substantive changes were going to be made to the Canada 
Elections Act that proof of citizenship should have been one of 
them for sure.  I certainly think that it was high time for that 
but there is absolutely nothing in here.  I have flipped 
through all these pages and it is just amazing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the whole idea of democracy and the frustration 
of people we see that they really are kind of tired of voting. 
They do not think it will make a whole lot of difference anyway. 
I find it sad that we had the lowest voter turnout in a great 
while.  Something has to stimulate the excitement of the Canadian 
public for them to believe that it really does matter that they 
participate in democracy.  It is unfortunate when we see that 
democracy itself is pretty unhealthy right now with low voter 
turnout. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chief electoral officer, Jean-Pierre Kingsley, says that 
maybe we should have mandatory voting.  I do not know if that it 
is the answer, although I do appreciate that people are at least 
asking the questions about what we can do to make sure that this 
place becomes a hair more relevant in people's lives, other than 
just in their chequebooks, pocketbooks and pay stubs.  I really 
do think we need to make some serious changes in terms of making 
sure that democracy works better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On page 83 of his book, <I>Straight from the Heart</I>, which was 
written in 1985, the Prime Minister, when he was treasury board 
president, said that in order to keep control the government made 
a lot of political judgments by itself and many decisions were 
reached in conversations in the corridors of parliament.  He also 
wrote that he did not permit a lot of questions and that the 
system gave him a lot of clout.  Is that not something to brag 
about, eh? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not democracy, that is pathetic.  He went on to say on 
page 43 that in his judgment maybe no more than 50 MPs make a 
personal difference in the outcome of their elections.  He also 
said that the rest tended to rely on the appeal of their leader 
and the luck of belonging to the winning party.  He then said 
that the risk was that MPs would become more marginal, more 
expendable and at the mercy of the leadership.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He continues in the book to say that certainly fewer backbenchers 
will be prepared to give their leaders frank advice or tell them 
to go to hell if they know when they can be replaced.  That was 
written by our present Prime Minister in 1985. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just a couple of weeks ago in China the Prime Minister said 
“Ah, all the terra cotta statues.  It is something like being 
home with my backbenchers”.  Is this something to brag about 
democracy?  I hardly think so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Being from the west I just could not let my speech wind down 
without this statement regarding the west which is on page 159 of 
the Prime Minister's book.  He said that the lack of political 
representation was a problem, a vicious circle that we did not 
know how to break.  He said that the less the west was 
represented the more alienated it felt, and the more alienated it 
felt the less it chose to vote Liberal and the less it was 
represented.  There it is.  Is the be all and end all to get 
seats in parliament to say one is in power for the sake of being 
in power?  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us aim to be in power so that we can really make a 
difference, that we can have a vision for moving forward and that 
this place, parliament itself, becomes a little more relevant to 
people right across Canada.  Canadians should be able to say that 
they voted and that they made a difference because Canada will be 
a better place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I see the timid changes that the government is attempting, 
I say that we have to go for it.  Fix it once, fix it right and let us 
make sure that the Canada Elections Act does become a whole lot 
more relevant to all of us.

Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Does the hon. member for

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to take part 
in the debate on Bill C-9, an act to amend the Canada Elections 
Act and the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To begin with, we will be supporting this legislation.  We will 
be doing so because it is consistent with the <I>Figueroa</I> decision 
handed down in Ontario.  It ensures that we conform to the spirit 
of this decision.  I will say, however, that we are not happy to 
be giving the bill our support, and I will explain why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, when one looks at the actual bill and reads it, it 
is clear that it is very brief.  It contains only a few clauses. 
At first blush, it might appear that this is really a relatively 
minor or superficial bill.  It is true that, in terms of content, 
it is brief.  It will not go down in history for its length. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the bill may seem fairly minor and innocuous, what is 
troubling to say the least is the government's attitude. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1615"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that, by its very nature and by its very content, this 
bill reflects the arrogant and cynical attitude of this 
government, which feels that it embodies truth and innate 
knowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have before us today a bill which is evidence of all the 
haste with which the Elections Act reform was carried out during 
the last parliament.  We proceeded precipitously.  And why did 
we?  Because the government waited until halfway through its 
mandate to bring in the amendments it intended to make to the 
Elections Act.  The government was planning, anticipating, a rush 
election. It wanted to move as quickly as possible to pass new 
legislation, so that the chief electoral officer would have the 
time—we are talking six months or so—to implement the 
provisions of the new legislation before the election was called. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that, indeed, the provisions of the election 
legislation rushed through in 1999-2000, if I am not mistaken, 
took effect at the very beginning of September 2000, so the 
government was in a position to call a snap election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of haste, this bill is an illustration, a proof of the 
haste with which the government moved during the last parliament 
in order to get the Elections Act changed, with its bill number 
2, Bill C-2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, Bill C-9, which is before the House today, contains 
provisions intended to ensure linguistic concordance, since it 
appears that the Elections Act, under which the most recent 
federal elections were held, contained linguistic concordance 
problems.  In other words, some provisions did not say exactly 
the same thing in English and in French. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had the government taken the time to properly study Bill C-2 and 
not rushed it through, perhaps we would have had the time to 
catch these little language errors and prevent them from having 
any effect during an election campaign on the interpretation of 
the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Happily—of course the matter is not over yet—it appears that the 
problems of interpretation in linguistic terms did not cause any 
catastrophes in the last election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give an example.  In the bill before us, clauses 18 
and 19 are two provisions intended to bring the French text into 
line with the original English text with respect to the rules 
governing the allocation of free broadcasting time and the 
purchase of air time during the election campaign.  The period 
during which air time is available to the political parties and 
candidates is defined as the period between the time the 
election was called and polling day. 
In French, the text reads “jusqu'à minuit le jour du scrutin”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On closer examination of the English, we find “At midnight on 
the day before polling day”.  They just forgot to say “À minuit, 
la veille du jour du scrutin”.  That makes a fair difference. 
It is not a minor error.  It is a detail, which could have made 
all the difference during the latest election campaign, in some 
ridings, even across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is another example.  Clause 4 of Bill C-9 talks of the 
provisions concerning information to be contained in the 
register of electors. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1620"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT29"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT29"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1620

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It states that it shall contain: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—any other information that is provided under subsections 49(2), 
194(7), 195(7), 223(2), 233(2) and 251(3). 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was simply not noticed that, in Bill C-2, the reference was 
to subsection 195(7) and not, as it was passed in the last 
parliament, to subsection 195(3).  The wrong subsection was 
amended.  The reference is to the wrong subsection.  This is 
another example of haste and sloppy work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example is when the bill refers to generally accepted 
accounting principles, concepts that the Bloc Quebecois 
incorporated in Bill C-2, by the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the generally accepted accounting principles in clause 
21, the government simply forgot to include these provisions in 
subparagraphs 403(<I>b</I>)(i) and (ii).  Could this have made a 
difference?  Of course it could have.  This is another example 
of how Bill C-2 was rushed through, without the time being taken 
to do a proper job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why?  Simply to satisfy the partisan goals of the government. 
This is completely and utterly unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was talking about party politics. 
Is there anything more vital to democracy than an electoral 
bill?  It seems to me that such a bill must be acceptable to 
most if not all political parties taking part in the process. 
Everyone must agree with the process if it is to be accepted by 
civil society in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But, as I said earlier, in the reform of the Canada Elections 
Act during the last parliament, the government's approach was to 
brazenly put party politics and its political interests ahead of 
seeking a consensus with opposition parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen this in several regards.  The government's reform 
of the Canada Elections Act is essentially cosmetic and 
superficial.  Naturally, it has been amended to be more readable 
and logical. 
Of course, some changes were made to comply with previous 
rulings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This reminds me of the comment made earlier by the hon. member 
for Edmonton North, who said that this government is much more 
reactive than proactive. It is true. We proposed all sorts of 
ideas during the review of Bill C-2 to amend the Elections Act, 
so as to make it better for our fellow citizens and so that it 
would reflect more democratic and modern electoral procedures. 
But, as I just said, the government decided instead to make only 
some minor cosmetic changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-2 was not the result of a consensus. It was rammed down 
our throat by the government. Yet, when he launched the 
consultation process, the government House leader, the minister 
responsible for Canada's electoral reform, had said “I want to 
ensure that we can co-operate with federal political parties—as 
has traditionally been the case in Canada—so that this bill will 
reflect a consensus”. Which consensus did this bill reflect? 
None. The government alone voted in favour of Bill C-2.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would even go further. The government was so determined to ram 
this bill through and muzzle the opposition that it went so far 
as to see that, at third reading, only the government's 
spokesperson and one representative of the official opposition 
were allowed to speak to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there anything more despicable than to see the cornerstone of 
democracy, the elections act of a country, debated at third 
reading in the House, at the final stage, by only two political 
parties out of the five represented here in parliament? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's behaviour during consideration of Bill C-2 was 
absolutely outrageous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government pushed that bill through so fast that it had to 
come back to the House and say “Well, there are some minor 
changes we need to do, typos we need to correct. Would you be 
kind enough to let us correct these mistakes?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is using the Figueroa ruling, which basically 
compels us to amend the elections act, to introduce a whole 
series of tiny minor changes, without of course embarking on an 
in depth reform of the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is saying “The system has served us well, let it 
be. We have been re-elected three times under the current 
election system, with three great majorities, do not change a 
thing”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this not the party led by the same man who promised, as 
Leader of the Opposition, that the first thing he would do as 
Prime Minister would be to include proportional representation 
into the system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Well, he was elected and all he had managed to do by the end of 
his second term was to introduce some slight cosmetic changes to 
the Canadian election system, because the system has served him 
well and has worked to his advantage. The government is far from 
willing to propose any significant amendments to the current 
election legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me briefly go over some of the provisions found in this bill. 
Among others, the bill amends the Canada Elections Act to give a 
greater role to the Senate. Previously, if he wanted to carry 
out a pilot project, for example to test an electronic voting 
process, the chief electoral officer had to obtain, under Bill 
C-2, the approval of the Standing Committee on Procedure and 
House Affairs, that deals with electoral matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Believe it or not, under Bill C-9, the one before us today, not 
only will the approval of the Standing Committee on Procedure 
and House Affairs be required, but also the approval of the 
Senate committee that normally considers electoral matters. It 
takes some nerve to give to a committee made up of unelected 
parliamentarians the power to say to the Cyou chief electoral 
officer, “No, you cannot carry out a study on a new way for 
people to exercise their right to vote in an election”, or “Yes, 
you can go ahead, under this or that condition”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not ironic to call upon a committee made up of unelected 
parliamentarians to debate the Canada Elections Act, which 
concerns each and everyone of us as representatives of our 
constituents? This is somewhat embarrassing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main purpose of Bill C-9 is to enable a political party that 
has at least 12 candidates to have its name listed on the 
ballots along with the name of its candidates. 
Members will remember that the number of candidates required 
used to be 50. This bill would reduce the number to 12. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously the Figueroa decision does not specify the number of 
candidates that would be acceptable in constitutional terms. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1630"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT31"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT31"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1630

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So the  government proposed the number 12.  The rational argument, the 
logic behind this government proposal, is this. It takes 12 MPs 
in the House for a party to become a recognized political party. 
Let us use the same figure for recognition of a political party 
on the ballot, even if the number of 50 candidates on a slate 
is still valid for the party to be able to take advantage of the 
tax benefits offered by the Government of Canada.  That said, 
from now on, the number of candidates required before the party 
name would be given on the ballot would be 12. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members might well ask “Why 12?  Why not two, five, or 
ten?”  The government, of course, says “Yes, but a rational 
argument is required, and the rational argument is the rule 
whereby it takes 12 members in the House for a party to become a 
recognized political party”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the briefing session, a most interesting point was raised 
by a colleague from the Canadian Alliance.  He asked “And what 
if Prince Edward Island wanted to try an experiment like the 
Bloc Quebecois did?”  There are only six ridings on P.E.I., so how 
could one imagine the Bloc P.E.I. on the ballet?  It would not be 
possible with only six ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I imagine that this will give rise to a lot of debate on the 
matter, but I find it unfortunate that the government did not 
want to take advantage of the work done on the previous bill, 
Bill C-2, or of consideration of this one, Bill C-9, in order to 
make more substantial amendments to the Elections Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Tuesday, we debated the possibility of striking a special 
all-party committee to examine the merits of various models of 
proportional representation and other electoral reforms.  The 
government clearly indicated its lack of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not be surprised afterward when the people of Quebec and 
of Canada show even less interest in federal politics, having 
seen the lack of interest the government has in bringing in any 
reform whatsoever. 
Let us not be surprised that the voter turnout is constantly 
dropping, constantly waning, election after election, when we 
have a government with such a closed mind and such arrogance 
toward the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise in turn to speak to Bill C-9 introduced by 
the government House leader and entitled an act to amend the 
Canada Elections Act and the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague, the member for Verchères—Les-Patriotes, pointed 
out so well and to avoid being redundant, I will try to raise 
new points regarding our disappointment following the 
introduction of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of our viewers and our colleagues in the House, 
I would simply point out that the Elections Act has to be 
changed as the result of a decision by the Ontario court of 
appeal regarding the identification of political parties on the 
ballots, known as the Figueroa case. 
In the past, a party had to run 50 candidates in a general 
election in order to be recognized and, therefore, to have its 
name appear on the ballot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Ontario court of appeal and the legislation before us 
reduces this number to 12 candidates, which apparently has a 
direct link with the rule of law used by the Ontario court of 
appeal.  This rule provides that, in order to be recognized in 
the House, a party must have 12 members there, the figure 12 
being an acceptable measure in our system.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, our disappointment has to do with the 
fact that nothing in this bill addresses certain points that the 
Bloc Quebecois members consider essential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will try to rise above party politics by saying that I am sure 
that the issues that I will be raising during the time allotted 
to me were a problem for members of all five parties in the House during 
the election held on November 27, 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I think that the government should have taken 
advantage of this bill, which amends the Canada Elections Act, to 
introduce improvements in the electoral process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people get out to vote, they are doing nothing more or less 
than practising democracy.  I am certain, Mr. Speaker, that the 
inhabitants of the lovely Cornwall area and of your riding are 
capable of expressing an opinion on an MP.  That is the purpose 
of an election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of an election is to say “Do we agree with the 
person who has been representing us for the past few years?  Do 
we agree with the person seeking the right to run for office? Do 
we agree with this party's platform?  Do we agree with a whole 
range of things?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The action one takes in leaving one's home, setting out in one's 
car, heading for the polling station and, behind a screen, voting 
for someone, is an eminently democratic one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What governs this democracy?  In Canada, it is called the Canada 
Elections Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois would have expected the government to take 
advantage of this bill to amend certain features of the Canada 
Elections Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event, we know that, following an election, the chief 
electoral officer, Mr. Kingsley, will have to meet with members 
of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs to 
report on his work.  Members of the Bloc Quebecois will have 
certain concerns.  In the short time left to me, I want to share 
just a few of them with the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One is that there are no provisions in this bill for more 
democratic electoral financing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the figures released by Elections Canada on 
party financing, we can see that the six major banks in 
Canada—which have made record profits in 1999 and 2000—make 
contributions to election funds. These record profits made by 
major banks are often accumulated at the expense of ordinary 
people who experience financial difficulties and who tell 
themselves “I have financial problems, I can no longer make the 
payments on my house or on my car”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the time comes to pull the plug, the major banks do not 
hesitate to do so. Nor do they hesitate to pocket billions of 
dollars in profits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parallel I would like to draw with profits is the following. 
When we look at the contributions made to election funds, 
whether it is to the Liberal Party, the Conservative Party or 
the Canadian Alliance Party, we realize that these major banks 
make generous contributions. This is why, following an election, 
the government has no interest in changing the rules on public 
financing in the Elections Act. The government looks at who 
provides the money to fund an election campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not in the government's interest to change the Elections 
Act. When we look at the figures released by Elections Canada, 
we realize that major banks have made generous contributions to 
the old parties, the traditional parties.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We really thought that, when the government introduced a bill to 
amend the elections act, it would have taken the opportunity to 
support the notion of funding by ordinary citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We, in the Bloc Quebecois, because of our public financing 
policy, have had to rely on $2, $5, $10 and $20 donations during 
the last and all the previous election campaigns. But the day 
after an election, we are not beholden to any of the 
multinational companies who contributed hundreds of thousands of 
dollars to our election campaigns. We are funded by ordinary 
citizens who tell us “We think you are doing a great job. Here is 
$2 to carry on”. The day after the election, we are beholden only 
to ordinary citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be in the interest of the government to agree to the 
motion put forward by one of the Bloc members on March 18, 1994. 
We in the Bloc are very consistent. The hon. member for 
Bas-Richelieu—Nicolet—Bécancour brought forward Motion No. 150 which 
said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should bring 
in legislation limiting solely to individuals the right to donate 
to a federal political party, and restricting such donations to a 
maximum of $5,000 a year. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one change we expected to see in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know my time is running out; <I>tempus fugit</I>, as would have 
said my latin teacher at the Séminaire de Chicoutimi. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we expected something about the designation of returning 
officers. 
What we want and what the people we represent want is a 
democratic electoral process that is administered in a more 
transparent fashion. So, there should not be any apparent 
conflict of interest in the appointment of election officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The returning officer, who is the most important election 
official in each of our ridings, is appointed on the 
recommendation of the governor in council. In parliamentary 
terms, it means that cabinet members, the main players, the prime 
minister's henchmen, recommend individuals to act as returning 
officers. In most cases, if we could look closely at the 301 
returning officers, if we had time for such an exercise, we could 
see a clear link to the government party. I think this will be a 
good exercise for my next filibuster in committee. We will look 
at the qualifications of the 301 returning officers in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now, they are all Liberal supporters, but I can assure the 
House 
that, under the Conservatives—and we saw it in the 1993 
election—returning officers were friends of that party. That 
proves what we, in the Bloc Quebecois, have always said: 
Liberals, Conservatives, it is all the same. That is very 
unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not look at how things are done in the provinces? Quebec 
could be used as a model. I presume we do not only do bad things 
in Quebec. 
In Quebec, returning officers are appointed and confirmed 
following an open, transparent, competition in which their 
abilities may be made public, where people may be questioned. 
They are interviewed by representatives of all the political 
parties.  Why could the appointment of returning officers not be 
a much more transparent process? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In connection with the NDP motion earlier in the week, the 
government referred to the Lortie Commission, the Royal 
Commission on Electoral Reform and Party Financing.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A cornerstone of public confidence in any democratic system of 
representative government is an electoral process that is 
administered efficiently and an electoral law that is enforced 
impartially.  Securing public trust requires that the election 
officials responsible for administration and enforcement be 
independent of the government of the day and not subject to 
partisan influence. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can give examples of attitudes seen in the last election on 
November 27, 2000.  Our memory has not been affected in this 
regard by the rigours of winter. 
Our wits are not dulled by temperatures reaching 27 below with 
the wind chill factor.  It may be cold outside, but our heads 
are clear and we can recall the partisan decisions made by 
Liberal appointed returning officers in the last election. We 
could go on listing them until tomorrow morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I almost feel like asking for unanimous consent to continue my 
speech until I have finished listing all the acts or partisan 
action taken by returning officers in our ridings.  There 
were—and I do not have enough time—the polling stations.  In some 
instances they were located in tiny community centres where six 
or seven polling divisions were put together and the people were 
all packed in.  They were voting just about beside each other. 
They could almost see who the person in the next booth was 
voting for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such things are totally unacceptable.  Although there was a 
recreation centre nearby, people were sent five or six 
kilometres away from their community.  I regret to inform hon. 
members that not everyone owns a car.  Then there are the 
seniors.  It was not exactly mid-July weather last November 27, 
hon. members will recall.  There had been freezing rain.  It was 
icy.  Seniors were not able to exercise their right to vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Examples like these illustrate that there truly was partisanship 
as far as the returning officers were concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having spoken of physical locations, I could now go on to the 
last-minute additions to the voters' lists.  At one point, only 
three days before the election, there were 7,000 or 8,000 new 
names on the list.  These were people that had never been 
enumerated.  No one knew where they came from.  You can imagine 
Mr. Speaker—I hardly need say imagine, for you know, having 
yourself been elected in a riding—how that can complicate the 
election machinery to have to add 5,000 to 6,000 names three or 
four days before voting day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could also talk about the voting cards. Elections Canada 
provided people with a kind of voting card. 
In buildings with 64 apartments, voter 
information cards were left in the lobby, just like any ad-bag, 
newspaper or flyer from Canadian Tire or Pharmaprix. Some people 
were literally going to every apartment building picking up those 
cards. I have seen some people with 300 to 400 cards in their 
possession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sorry, but I still feel very bitter about the last 
election. Many members on this side of the House, but also on the

would like to direct the House's attention, if I could, to 
relevance.  The hon. member has dealt with everything from 
freezing rain to voter cards.  We are dealing with party 
recognition on a ballot. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I believe this is more a point of debate 
than a point of order. Relevancy is not always obvious. In the 
little time they are given, members may put forward arguments to 
try to get their point across. In this case, I find the arguments 
still sufficiently relevant for us to continue with the debate.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am almost tempted to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Leader of the Government in the House of Commons what he is 
afraid of. Is he trying to hide something? Should we look a 
little deeper into what has been going on in his riding? I know 
it hurts. There are things we would rather not have to hear. But 
I was about to say that some of us on this side of the House were 
hurt by the work of some overly partisan returning officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the member interrupted me, I was going to say that I 
talked with some colleagues on the other side of the House who 
are not satisfied either with the application of the Canada 
Elections Act in the last general election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the member for Hull—Aylmer is nodding in approval. This 
is not meant to be a partisan comment. I simply want to say that 
I am disappointed in the fact that the government did not take 
the opportunity provided by Bill C-9 to correct some problems in 
the Canada Elections Act, in the electoral process which is the 
democratic process through which people choose their 
representatives. That is the only message I want to convey. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say, in conclusion, that we will have the opportunity to 
come back to this issue when we hear the chief electoral officer

hope the government will agree to undertake a detailed, in-depth 
and non-partisan study of this bill and to hear, if need be, 
members from all parties in the House, not only those nasty 
members of the Bloc, but also members of all the other parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk to each other as parliamentarians. We may have different 
opinions, but we have the opportunity to exchange our views. I 
shall not reveal the nature of informal discussions I had with 
certain colleagues from other parties, but I can say that the 
Canada Elections Act was applied in a very twisted way in the 
last general election. We should look at it closely and think 
about amendments we could bring to ensure that democracy really 
exists in Canada and in Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  It is my duty pursuant to Standing 
Order 38 to inform the House that the question to be raised 
tonight at the time of adjournment is as follows:  the hon. 
member for Vancouver Island North, the Coast Guard. 
<P><A NAME="LINK163"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I wish to say a few words in support of Bill C-9 which 
is before the House at second reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill, as my colleagues have said, comes out of an Ontario 
Court of Appeal ruling on March 10, 1999, almost two years ago. 
It suggested that parliament violated the charter of rights when 
it made a decision in the old elections act that before a name 
could be listed on the ballot, a party had to have at least 50 
candidates.  Now there has been a recommendation to change that 
from 50 candidates to 12 candidates, reflecting the ruling we 
have in the House of Commons that to be an official party of the 
House of Commons it must have 12 members in its caucus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We certainly agree with that.  We think it is the right way to 
go.  In terms of the elections act, anything we can do to 
democratize the process, to make the process more inclusive and 
more empowering for as many Canadians as possible, is the right 
way to go.  That is what this is doing in a very small way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I go on I want to say, Mr. Speaker, that I am splitting 
my time with my colleague from Palliser. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding inclusiveness, one thing struck me about the debate 
today.  I wonder if anyone from the Canadian Alliance wants to 
comment on this when I sit down. 
A few days ago in the House, one of its members introduced a 
private member's bill that would go in exactly the opposite 
direction.  That was the member for Saskatoon—Humboldt.  His 
private member's Bill C-273, would amend the Parliament of Canada 
Act in terms of recognizing official parties in the House of 
Commons. The bill says: “This bill will provide that in order to 
receive official party status, a political party would at least 
have to have 10% of the seats in the House of Commons and members 
of parliament from at least three different provinces”.  In 
other words, the Alliance bill would not recognize the Bloc 
Quebecois as an official party.

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know my good friend from Vancouver is a very progressive 
member of the Alliance Party, so I am not surprised he opposes 
this private member's bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, maybe the party could clarify its stance.  This bill, 
sponsored by the member of the Alliance Party, would exclude the 
Bloc Quebecois as an official party of the House because it only 
has MPs from one particular province.  It would exclude the NDP 
because it does not have 10% of the membership of the House.  It 
would exclude the Conservative Party because it does not have 10% 
of the membership of the House.  That means it would exclude 63 
MPs, so we would have 63 independents.  Is that democracy?  Is 
that inclusiveness?  The three parties together received the 
votes of roughly one-third of the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the minister for financial institutions is scandalized by 
this kind of lack of democracy across the way.  I would like to 
have the Canadian Alliance clarify where it stands on this very 
exclusive bill that has been put forth by the member from 
Saskatoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill we have before us today goes in the opposite direction. 
It says we should recognize an official party's name on the 
ballot that has at least 12 candidates recognized by the chief 
electoral officer.  That is the way to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The goal is to have an electoral system in our country that is 
more inclusive, that is more democratic, that is more 
transparent, that is more available and that is more egalitarian 
to each and every single citizen regardless of who we are and 
where we come from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, it is very strange to hear the Alliance Party criticize 
the Canada Elections Act for being tough on so-called third party 
advertising.  Third party advertising should be regulated. 
Political parties represent different points of view and have 
strict spending guidelines at the national and the local levels. 
We must adhere to those guidelines and stipulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we have the Alliance Party advocating a wide open 
season, depending on how deep one's pocketbook is for special 
interest and lobby groups that want to get out there and spend a 
lot of money in fighting various political parties and political 
campaigns.  Once again, this shows that it is not really 
concerned about basic and fundamental democracy which is so 
important to the ordinary citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman:</B>  Because you lost the support of the big 
unions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, once again, I know the 
member from Vancouver who just interjected would not agree with 
his party on this.  He is more progressive than most of the sort 
of Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble people who populate that 
particular caucus.  That is an important issue.  Some of them, 
not necessarily the ones who are there now, but some with cowboy 
hats sit right behind him during question period.  That is the 
stance of that party.  It pretends to be democratic and populist 
right across western Canada but it says and does exactly the 
opposite things when it comes to the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be very interested during questions and comments to hear 
whether or not the Alliance members will support the member 
for Saskatoon—Humboldt's private member's bill which would 
effectively deny the democratic rights of 63 members of 
parliament, representing one-third of the population, to be 
recognized as political parties.  On the other hand, they get up 
in the House and say they would support this bill that would 
reduce the number of candidates needed to have one's name on a 
ballot from 50 to 12. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other items we have to deal with when it comes to 
elections.  One is the whole question of the voters list.  There 
were about a million people left off the voters list in the last 
campaign.  Primarily, they were people from low income areas and 
younger people.  We need legislation on that as soon as possible. 
We had a commitment on that from the government House leader, who 
was in charge of the Canada Elections Act in the House of 
Commons, about a week or so ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final point I want to make is we should do what the Canada 
Elections Act says we can do.  We should look at a different 
method of voting.  If we look under clause 2 of the bill before 
us, it says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chief Electoral Officer may carry out studies on voting, 
including studies respecting alternative voting means—

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we said on our opposition day on Tuesday, we should be 
striking an all party committee to look at incorporating some 
elements of proportional representation into our voting system 
like most countries in the world.  Almost every country in the 
world with 8 million or 9 million people has some PR in the 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning we heard from the prime minister of Great Britain, 
the mother of our parliamentary system.  In the last few years 
Great Britain has incorporated some PR into the Scottish 
parliament and into the Welsh parliament.  It elects all its 
members to the European community in Brussels through 
proportional representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Jenkins commission, which was set up a few 
years ago to look at electoral reform, the British parliament 
will probably adopt very soon a method of PR, if not in the next 
election, in the election that is coming in about five years 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the mother of parliaments can do that, we should be 
modernizing our system as well by moving toward a system of 
proportional representation that will allow the votes of every 
citizen to be treated as equal: all votes would be equal; all 
votes would carry weight; people could empower themselves; and 
there would no wasted votes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The irony of the present system is that often Canadians do not 
vote for their first choice.  Canadians often vote for one 
candidate to stop another.  A good example is my friend, the 
right hon. member for Calgary Centre.  Thousands of Liberals, New 
Democrats, Green Party supporters and progressive people voted 
for him to stop the Alliance in Calgary Centre.  They did so 
because he was more progressive.  Obviously he is more 
progressive.  I recognize that fact.  He is a very progressive 
member of parliament.  He is a red Tory.  He is a progressive 
Tory, a very progressive person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we had a system of proportional representation we would have 
a system where people could vote for their first choice, vote for 
their philosophy, vote for the ideology.  If it were a German 
type of system they would have a vote for their local MP and then 
a vote for their party preference in terms of a parliamentary 
list provided by each of the political parties.  They could be 
voting for their first choice.  Their first choice and vision 
would be part of the Government of Canada and the Parliament of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be looking at this as one of the possibilities in 
terms of passing the bill.  The chief electoral officer could 
look into various systems of voting, different alternatives of 
voting and strike a committee to do just that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the bill at second reading.  The other parts of the 
bill are largely technical.  Part of it is just making sure that 
the English version coincides with the French version and vice 
versa.  We will be looking at some of those in more detail in 
committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK164"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I ask the member to refer back to the private member's 
bill of the member for Saskatoon—Humboldt of the Canadian 
Alliance Party.  I have a copy of it and it says that the bill 
would prevent fringe parties, such as the Progressive 
Conservative Party and the NDP, from having seats in the Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think of us as a fringe party, either the NDP or the 
Conservative Party.  We perform a valuable service.  We represent 
thousands of people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I read that my immediate thought was that we should refer 
to the Alliance Party as the fringe benefit party.  Its members 
ran on promises.  If they were elected their leader would not 
move into Stornoway, for example.  They would turn it into a 
bingo hall.  If we check who is living there now, we will find 
that the leader of the Alliance Party lives there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also said that they would not take a car for the leader. 
Their leader would not accept a car, and he has one now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ultimate flip-flop was the pension issue.  I know candidates 
who ran in the 1993 election and lost their seats.  They were 
hammered because righteous Alliance Party members said that they 
would never take a pension.  Good candidates were defeated on 
that one issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now they say they have families to look after.  What about the 
families of the others that were misled, defeated and maligned? 
We should call it the fringe benefit party or the flip-flop party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the hon. member think we could attract more people to 
vote?  How could we re-establish credibility with the voters and 
the electorate?  There was a very low turnout in the last 
election.  It was shameful that so few people felt motivated to 
vote.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the hon. member to address how we could present a 
better package, not as a party but as a group of politicians. How 
could we attract more voters? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think the best way of 
doing that is by practising what we preach, by being true to our 
word, true to our commitment, true to our principles and true to 
our promises in a campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member summed up the Alliance Party.  Its members said they 
would never move into Stornoway and they did.  They said they 
would never take a pension and they did.  They said they would 
never eat in the parliamentary restaurant and they do.  They said 
they would never travel business class on an airplane and they 
do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They think all voters should be equal, all people should be 
equal and all provinces should be equal.  Then they introduce a 
private member's bill in the House which says that parties should 
not be equal, that the Bloc, the NDP and the Conservatives should 
not be official parties.  Those parties represent one-third of 
the Canadian people and 63 members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous leader of the Alliance Party, the member from 
Calgary, used to go across the country talking ad nauseam about 
the equality of the provinces and the equality of people being a 
fundamental value.  He said he believed in the fundamental 
equality of the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet when it comes to putting its preaching into practice in the 
House of Commons, the Alliance comes up with a private member's 
bill that does not treat the people equally.  If people vote for 
the Bloc, the NDP or the Conservatives, they will not be treated 
the same as those who vote for the Liberals or the Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could we justify that?  I have been challenging Alliance 
members to explain why they would breach their all important 
promise of equality for the people, but they are afraid to rise 
in the House to defend this private member's bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Canada should realize what they said, that no 
party in the House should be recognized as official unless it has 
at least 10% of the seats.  That would mean 31 seats for the NDP 
instead of 13, or 31 for the Conservatives instead of 12.  They 
also said that the party should have members from three 
provinces.  That would exclude the Bloc Quebecois, unless the 
Bloc elects somebody in Vancouver, Calgary and Yukon or somewhere 
else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Alliance Party is supposed to be a populist, grassroots 
party of the people where everyone is equal.  That is the kind of 
party and vision its members said they had.  That is one reason 
people are turned off by politics.  They have another political 
party which, more than others, is old style and old fashioned. It 
practises old politics where it says one thing in the campaign 
and once elected does exactly the opposite.  That is why people 
are cynical about the process.  I want somebody from the Alliance 
Party to respond to my question.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to participate in the debate this 
afternoon.  I have listened to the debate throughout and was 
intrigued by the comments of the government House leader 
indicating that they were relatively minor amendments.  The 
member for Regina—Qu'Appelle has dealt with the suggestion of 12 
candidates in order for a party to be considered official. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was more intrigued by the commitment of the House leader that 
he would be open to much more significant changes to the Canada 
Elections Act following Jean-Pierre Kingsley's report to the 
appropriate 
parliamentary committee having an opportunity to discuss his 
findings regarding the recent election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All members of the House of Commons would want to pay close 
attention to that report and to what Mr. Kingsley, the chief 
electoral officer, and Elections Canada find as a result of the 
November 2000 election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should like to associate myself with some of the remarks made 
by the member for Edmonton North.  It was a difficult election 
campaign with the permanent voters list that has now come into 
play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the member for Edmonton North referred to brand new 
subdivisions that were springing up overnight and to the 
difficulty of keeping up in her riding, the situation experienced 
in the riding of Palliser was quite a bit different.  We found 
that low income people and people who moved a lot, probably 
because they are low income people and students, were being 
discriminated against as a result of the national registration of 
voters.

and then in the November 2000 election we were into an update. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was argued at the time that it would be much more effective 
to use computers, et cetera, so that people could be tracked.  We 
are finding that a lot of the information is not available or not 
able to be placed into an updated voters list because of our 
privacy laws.  This is why Mr. Kingsley's comments will be so 
important when they are made.  I will give the House an example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was door knocking in my riding I noticed Elections Canada 
flyers on certain doorsteps advising that one or more of the 
residents in the household had reached the age of 18 and was 
therefore eligible to cast a ballot if he or she would fill out a 
form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems passing strange to me that those names are not placed 
automatically on the ballot, but apparently our privacy laws 
prohibit that.  If the privacy laws are that strict, and there 
are good arguments not to change them, we really need to consider 
seriously going back to a system of enumeration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague pointed out, one million people were left off 
the voters list in the last election.  We had one of the lowest 
turnouts in history.  In my riding of Palliser the vote was just 
over 62%.  I make the point again that it was primarily low 
income people and people who tend to move around a lot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One can get on the voters list.  It is easier to get on the 
voters list on election day than it used to be, but one still 
requires identification or must be sworn in by a friend.  A lot 
of times genuine low income people do not have an abundance of 
personal ID.  It is difficult for them to find someone to go with 
them, hold their hand at the polling booth and say this is Jane 
Smith or whomever.  I think we must look at the whole area, and I 
am pleased the government House leader has made a commitment on 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time I want to be critical of Mr. Kingsley for 
suggesting the answer to low voter turnout was compulsory voting. 
A lot of our problems have to do with the transition to the 
permanent voters list from the enumerated list.  We need to tidy 
that up and make it more effective.  If we cannot tidy it up we 
should revert to the enumeration system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Edmonton North also noted the situation in 
Saskatchewan, which has not had a political tax credit at the 
provincial level, and the need to remedy it.  I suspect she knows 
a bill has already been passed but not yet proclaimed in that 
legislature.  I have been given assurances the problem will be 
remedied in Saskatchewan's new session of parliament which 
probably begins in a month or so.  Then there will be political 
tax credits in all 10 provinces.  We have had a federal tax 
credit in Canada since the mid-1970s.  We look forward to that 
progressive change in Saskatchewan's legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another item which deserves to be raised and to which my 
colleague alluded  was the question of third party advertising. I 
too very much support strict limits on third party advertising 
during election campaigns.  The political parties that 
participate in campaigns have very rigid spending limits that 
must be followed.  It would be patently unfair for people with 
deep pockets to be able to subvert or buy their way into the 
media to effect changes that the political parties do not have 
the budget to do.

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize, and I think the government recognizes, through the 
legislation it has endeavoured to bring in over the last number 
of years, that third parties should be able to advertise during 
election campaigns.  However they should spend only a finite 
amount of money on advertising, less than what political parties 
are able to spend, because an election campaign is a contest 
between all the parties, big and small, and not the folks with 
the big bank accounts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We align ourselves in the New Democratic Party very much with 
finite limits on third party advertising, unlike the lead 
spokesperson in the debate for the Canadian Alliance Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, I would encourage colleagues who are interested to 
look at a document entitled <I>The National Register of 
Electors</I>, which raises questions about the new approach to 
voter registration in Canada.  It would take only about 10 or 15 
minutes to read through the booklet.  It was written before the 
results were tallied, so it says in effect that the November 27 
election serves as the litmus test for the national registration 
of voters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It wonders whether the move to a permanent voters list from the 
enumeration system was done as a cost saving venture.  I hope 
that when Mr. Kingsley and the parliamentary committee studying 
the legislation looks at this fundamental change to the act, 
tough questions like that will be asked by the parliamentarians 
who serve on the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see my time is drawing to a close.  I will conclude by saying 
that we in my party are supportive of the minor technical 
amendments in the bill.  Far more importantly, however, we are 
interested in the fundamental changes that the government House 
leader alluded to when he led off the debate this afternoon. 
<P><A NAME="LINK166"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to take part in the debate and to note that 
this is an important piece of legislation.  It is, in essence, 
the rules of engagement that apply to those who seek public 
office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the bill has some rather particular aspects to it that 
are addressed in the overall scheme of things, I think it is 
timely, given that we have recently resumed this session of 
parliament and come through an election, that we look at how 
elections are conducted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill, as has been noted, would amend the Canada Elections 
Act and the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act.  It is a bill 
that, as I indicated, deals substantially with two aspects that 
came out of a court case in the province of Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I begin my remarks by saying that it is good to see.  I say with 
some sarcasm that the government has not changed the way it deals 
with legislation such as this in parliament.  It is good to see 
that it has remained consistent and predictable.  The government 
has treated this legislation, like many other pieces of 
legislation of this type, by not consulting.  That is to say that 
it did not go to the effort of prior consultation with political 
parties in order to gain consensus, which was always the practice 
when it came to bills of this nature.  It is disappointing and 
yet, as I indicated, it has become somewhat an expected attitude 
and approach on the part of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current Speaker, the member for Kingston and the Islands, 
served with great distinction on a special committee on electoral 
reform between 1991 and 1993 when he was a member of the 
opposition.  A committee that was chaired by Mr. Jim Hawkes, the 
Progressive Conservative member from Calgary at that time, 
studied many of the same issues that we see before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That committee, in coming to its conclusions, stated quite 
emphatically that it would not report to the Chamber unless the 
recommendations were endorsed by all three political parties in 
existence at that time.  There was an effort to recognize that 
consensus on issues such as this are extremely important. 
My, how times have changed. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1720"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in regard to this particular piece of legislation, the 
electoral act, changes have come before the Chamber since 1994 
time and again without prior agreement, without consensus as to 
the content.  That very much puts the government and this 
legislation, sadly, on shaky ground in terms of its legitimacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last legislation of this type that came before parliament, 
Bill C-2 as it then was, was subjected to time allocation, which 
is of course again a practice that we have seen far too often in 
the past number of years.  In fact, the trigger-happy government 
House leader has now used time allocation 69 times.  Again, my, 
how times change.  When the government House leader was a member 
of the opposition, it was so offensive to him and such an affront 
to democracy, yet a different attitude now prevails. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Turning back to the bill itself, I must admit that the changes 
now before us are reasonable in their content.  They are changes 
that result from a court case that came out of the Ontario court 
of appeal.  It bears noting that these changes will, I believe, 
enhance the current legislation, although I was hoping that in 
this parliament the first encounter we would have on a bill such 
as this, the first opportunity we would have to address this 
issue, would be met with perhaps a different attitude so that we 
would be able to deal with this problem of encountering each 
other in a different fashion.  That does not appear to be the 
case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the major problems, which was apparent to all Canadians 
and all parliamentarians, in the last election was the difficulty 
with the permanent voters list.  We have heard a litany of 
stories of constituents who found that when they went to vote, to 
exercise their democratic right, a very important right and one 
that we all encourage in this legislation, their names were 
absent or there was some anomaly like not being listed at the 
appropriate polling station. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all have to be very diligent.  I hope this legislation in its 
final draft will address some of the problems surrounding the 
application of the permanent voters list.  There is a huge 
frustration, as one can appreciate, whether it be a member of the 
voting public from Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough or from any 
constituency in the country, when individuals make that important 
statement of going to cast their ballot and arrive at a polling 
station only to find that for one reason or another their names 
are not listed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that when the bill goes to committee we will have an 
opportunity to delve into it in greater detail.  That is not to 
say that this is not the proper forum to discuss some of the 
problems and some of the changes that could occur, but I hope 
that at that time in particular we will have an opportunity to 
pose questions to the chief electoral officer and his staff 
regarding some of these issues that arose during the last 
campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From these problems and this experience, we might get some idea 
from Mr. Kingsley, the chief electoral officer, of the cost of 
creating this permanent electoral list, of the attempts that will 
of course follow to keep it up to date, and of the safeguards 
that ensure it is accurate, for this in and of itself has to 
be the fundamental purpose of having a permanent voters list, a 
list that reflects the eligible voters of the various 
constituencies around the country.  It appears, in its current 
form at least, to be flawed.  This is an opportunity to change 
that, to improve upon this permanent voters list and the efforts 
that were made to put this in place in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The overall amendments to the current legislation as compared to 
the last parliament's appear to be fairly straightforward in 
nature.  Bill C-9 responds to the Ontario court of appeal case 
known as Figueroa.  This case dealt with a submission on the part 
of the Communist Party of Canada, an argument that many of the 
provisions of the Canada Elections Act in its current form 
benefited larger political parties and therefore, by virtue of 
the same method, discriminated against the smaller political 
groupings.

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the identification of candidates and political 
parties on the ballot, the court held that provisions of the 
Canada Elections Act limit identification of candidates' party 
affiliations on the ballot to candidates that were endorsed by 
organized political parties which supported 50 or more candidates 
in a general election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was found in the ruling by the majority on the court that 
this would infringe the charter.  By virtue of its decision, the 
court did, as is often the case, give the Parliament of Canada an 
opportunity to address the issue, the anomaly, and to fix the 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The court felt that there was no justification, as it wrote in 
the ruling, for bringing the 50 candidates limit in relation to 
this matter or for having that in place.  It discriminated 
against smaller political groups and was thus, in the court's 
opinion, not justifiable under the charter.  It did not meet what 
has become known as the Oakes test. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was a common sense judgment in my view, and the way in 
which it has been handled is the way that it should have been 
handled, that is, it is now back in the place where legislation 
is to be drafted and produced.  It is back in our hands for us to 
do just that job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The court put in place a time period to rewrite the applicable 
portion of that legislation.  It set no particular guidelines in 
its findings with respect to the 50 candidates rule.  It did not 
say it was too high but it did not set a bottom number either, so 
the current legislation produces the number of 15, which may be 
arbitrary.  That is again something that will be examined by the 
committee.  It is interesting to note that the number of 15 is 
that which was recommended by a royal commission on electoral 
reforms that was established after the 1988 general election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us does in fact recommend that political parties 
can have their names printed under the name of the supported 
candidate if the nomination of 12 candidates of that party is 
confirmed by the chief electoral officer at the close of 
nominations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the committee I or a representative of the Progressive 
Conservative Party will look forward with great interest to 
listening to the reasons for picking this number and why it is 
that the government feels it is the particular number that would 
be defensible and charter proof in any future challenges.  That 
is something we have to bear in mind when we put this final 
number in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make a brief passing reference to the issue of Bill 
C-273, which was in my view quite meanspirited and a bit 
inflammatory in its reference to fringe parties in this Chamber. 
I think it is disrespectful and trivializing to introduce 
legislation of this sort and is purely political posturing. 
However, that said, I think the hon. member for 
Saskatoon—Humboldt, with some humility, might consider 
withdrawing this particular bill because of its inflammatory 
nature, and I think that good faith on his part might be 
forthcoming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do look forward to dealing with this particular bill when it 
gets to the committee and looking at the possibility of fine 
tuning some of the amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the other particular amendments that come out of this 
legislation deal with the advertising blackout period, which is 
important because of the vastness of the country, because of the 
time change that occurs not only on election night but in the 
periods before the campaign.  This is also an important 
consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the adjustment of expense limits for candidates should 
there be differences in the total number of voters between the 
preliminary electoral list and the revised list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are important rules of engagement to be governed by the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event, the committee will have an opportunity to look at 
these matters in greater detail.  The committee will have an 
opportunity to hear from the chief electoral officer.  In fact, I 
am sure the government House leader, who has carriage of this 
bill, will be an able and apt participant in those discussions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see that the parliamentary secretary to the government House leader is 
present too, and I am very hopeful that the indication that the 
government is very forthcoming and forthright about electoral 
reform also applies to parliamentary reform.  I want to refer 
briefly to an occasion where there was an opportunity to bring 
about some political reform too.  That was to have—

Bill C-254, an act to protect human health and the environment by 
oxygenating automotive fuels and eliminating the gasoline 
additive MMT, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I would like to introduce at second 
reading Bill C-254, which is an act to protect human health and 
the environment by oxygenating automobile fuels and eliminating 
the additive MMT. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sad to say that due to the constrictions of our system this 
so-called debate will end today in one hour and this bill has not 
been declared votable, which I am very sad about, considering 
that just yesterday the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change, the highest authority regarding climate change, stated 
that in this century there might be a climate change rise, that 
the seas might rise between one and even eight metres.  Here we 
are in the House not being able to debate important issues such 
as transportation fuel, which accounts for 25% of greenhouse 
gases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the objective of my bill is two-fold:  first of all to 
oxygenate gasoline or diesel fuel by at least 2.7% in weight, 
which is roughly equivalent to 8% oxygenation by volume, and 
second, to phase out the additive MMT, which would then not be 
required, by July 2005, to give time for this to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principle behind oxygenation of gasoline or diesel fuel is 
very simple.  The more oxygen you put in fuel, whether it is 
gasoline or diesel fuel, the less toxicity there is.  I have a 
chart drawn by one of the foremost experts in fuel which shows 
there are several problems with gasoline or diesel fuel: carbon 
monoxide, hydrocarbons, volatile organic compounds, nitrogen 
oxides, particulate matter, carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide. 
In addition, because we use unleaded gasoline and we are trying 
to phase out benzene, we have to further refine gasoline to the 
nth degree to permit these things to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are trying to do instead of using piecemeal solutions to 
nitrous oxide or carbon monoxide or other problems with fuels is 
to use one holistic approach, because what we can do by 
oxygenating fuels is to use ethanol, which is a pure, natural 
substance.  The more we refine gasoline or diesel, the more CO2 
and toxic carcinogens take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ethanol has the highest octane, the highest oxygen and the 
highest CO2 fighting properties of any alternative fuel available 
today. In addition to it being a natural fuel, it can be produced 
out of coal or biomass such as buffalo grass or trees.  It can be 
produced out of sugar cane and it can even be produced out of 
solid waste from municipal dumps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Being a natural substance, it produces a lot of oxygen.  If we 
could use 100% ethanol in our automobiles it would be equal to 
35% of oxygen within the fuel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are so far behind the United States, it is not funny.  The 
United States started to talk about oxygenation of gasoline way 
back when in 1990, when it amended the U.S. clean air act to 
force oxygenation of gasoline in wintertime in certain targeted 
large cities which had a particular pollution problem.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year 28 states of the United States were legislating on 
oxygenation.  This year it might be all the 50 states.  My bill 
used the state of Minnesota as a model which legislated 
oxygenation four years ago.  It now has 10 ethanol producing 
plants which produced 869 million litres of ethanol, three times 
what we are producing in the all of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Chicago area oxygenated gas or oxy-fuel is the only 
gasoline or diesel fuel one can buy.  It produces 2.25 billion 
litres of ethanol.  Here we are still in the dark ages because we 
do not want to debate the issue.   We do not want to legislate 
it.  We go by piecemeal solutions without legislation to back it 
up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to give an example of what is done in the United States. 
By the spring of 2001 there will be 1.2 million vehicles fuelled 
by what is known as E85, which is 85% ethanol.  In Canada, we 
have 25 vehicles that are run by the Ministry of Natural 
Resources.  Our buses run on 10% ethanol but our cars do not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why can we not legislate it?  Why can we not be like the United 
States?  Why can we not be like Sweden where ethanol is available 
from north to south and where the Scania buses run on 100% 
ethanol which is 35% oxygenated fuel? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not even want to discuss it here.  My bill is non-votable 
because as private members we are not supposed to have smart 
ideas.  We are not supposed to know.  Meanwhile, 28 states of the 
United States debated legislation last year and perhaps up to 50 
states will debate it this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should we also ban MMT?  I know we have had debates on this 
subject where the Canadian Alliance and the Bloc Quebecois fought 
hard for the Ethyl Corporation.  I ask for one good reason why we 
in Canada should be the silly guinea pigs, the only industrial 
nation on earth using MMT. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not used in Sweden, Norway, Finland, England or Germany. 
It is not even used in the United States, the home of the Ethyl 
Corporation, because it is manganese, a chemical that has 
toxifying properties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Scientists not only in the United States but in Europe and 
elsewhere, and certainly the two leading scientists on manganese 
in Canada, Dr. Mergler at the University of Quebec in Montreal 
and Dr. Zayed at the University of Montreal, have shown in their 
studies a connection between manganese and motor impairment in 
human beings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the studies are not conclusive.  I know our health 
ministry is conducting another multi-year study.  Surely we as a 
country should sign the real precautionary principle which says 
that if there is a threat perceived to human health and the 
environment then let us not use the substance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My bill was designed to oxygenate gasoline and to phase out MMT 
by 2005 because it is not needed and it is a toxic agent. 
Unfortunately my bill will die in one hour at the date when we 
are supposed to be fighting climate change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say in presenting this bill that I am at the same time 
saddened.  I hope we will use these opportunities to reform our 
system, to give private members a chance to debate ideas whether 
they are right or they are wrong in front of all their peers, not 
in front of a little committee of five or six people that decides 
in secret whether it is good or it is bad.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, that was a very interesting presentation by the hon. 
member.  As he suggested, we have been around and around this 
debate for many years in the House.  He has not changed his mind 
and I have not changed my mind.  Certainly the bitterness that he 
expresses over the length of time he gets to debate the issue, 
his grievance is not with the opposition, our party, but with his 
own government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We came back to this place, presented proposals and advocated 
change to the parliamentary rules that govern this place.  We 
presented proposals to change how this place works and how it 
could be more democratic so that members like himself could have 
more say in what goes on around here and have a better chance to 
debate ideas from the backbenches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, at the same time, I do not see the hon. member, who 
did the complaining a minute ago, standing and voting against his 
government to help that process change.  It is disappointing that 
did not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aside from that, I will now go to the bill at hand.  I have a 
problem with a couple of issues in the bill, one being the MMT 
issue and the other being oxygenation.  I essentially agree with 
what the member said.  If we could oxygenate to the levels he 
suggested, the octane enhancing additive would not be necessary. 
However, to do that it would require an enhanced refining 
process, thereby adding to the cost of refining a litre of 
gasoline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have not built any refineries for many years but the demand 
for gasoline has increased tremendously.  We are at a point where 
the balance between demand and supply is very tight.  If the 
demand rises much more, or we enhance the refining process and 
slow down the time it takes to put a barrel of crude oil through 
a refinery and the production of gasoline at the other end is 
extended, then we will have domestic shortages in supply of 
gasoline.  That has to be a concern.  The idea sounds viable and 
has merit but we have to look at the supply and demand side of 
the situation too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the whole issue of MMT, the member opposite and I have argued 
on this many times before.  I do not necessarily disagree with 
his point of view that it would be a good thing to remove the 
additive MMT from gasoline because of the potential harm that 
manganese could do to human beings. I have a far greater concern 
with his position than to argue the merits of manganese in 
gasoline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I argued when we had this debate before was that 
Health Canada researched the issue and reported back that the 
amounts of MMT or manganese that is added to gasoline to enhance 
octane has no harmful effect on human health.  Yet he and other 
members of his caucus have argued that it is deadly dangerous 
stuff, that it is killing people or has the potential to kill 
people and that we should ban it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should ban it, of course, on the precautionary principle, but 
Health Canada said that it looked at it from the precautionary 
principle and that it rejected banning it simply because it could 
not see that it was harmful to human health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members of the government are saying that Health Canada is 
not protecting the health of Canadians, that it is not ruling 
wisely and using precautionary measures to ban this substance, as 
the members seem to be intimating, then I think we are in really 
big trouble.  If Health Canada is not protecting the health of 
Canadians on this issue, how many other issues is it not 
protecting the health of Canadians on? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not stand here and rave about the evils of MMT.  Let us 
fix the system so that Health Canada will be able to do the job 
that everyone hopes it is doing in order to protect Canadians. 
When it does a study and reports that a product is not harmful to 
our health, then members, such as the one who just spoke, can 
have confidence and be comfortable that in fact is the case.  I 
have to believe it is. 
I cannot stand here and think that Health Canada would endanger 
all of us, for whatever reason, from incompetence or influence by 
Ethyl Corporation or any of the other things that have been 
suggested.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is much bigger than what the member suggests.  He is a 
member of the government that has been in power now for some 
seven years.  He had better work on his government to fix the 
problems, not only with how private members' bills are debated, 
but on how government agencies like Health Canada work to protect 
Canadians.  Those are such important issues that he needs to 
argue with his ministries and his government, not with the 
opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of ethanol, he indicated how other parts of the 
world, particularly the United States, were so far ahead of us in 
the use and production of ethanol.  I do not argue that ethanol 
is a much cleaner burning fuel.  It would be a good idea if we 
had more ethanol, but Canadians have to know that without an 8 
cent excise subsidy on ethanol production it is not economical in 
Canada.  Without the 8 cent subsidy, we simply would not have 
that industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have real concerns because the Minister of Natural Resources 
suggested in the House today that the government's position is to 
greatly increase the production of ethanol and to enjoy all the 
benefits that come with it.  Creating an industry that cannot 
exist without that level of subsidization is not good economic 
policy.  Somewhere the house of cards will come crashing down and 
we will pay the price.  Whether it is the government through the 
use of taxpayer dollars that pays the price or whether it is the 
consuming public at the pump, somebody has to pay the price and 
will do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of all the rhetoric around climate change, the horror 
stories about what might or might not happen because of climate 
change around the world, Canadians generally have not shown a 
real willingness to pay the price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few moments ago I came from a briefing with the Conference 
Board of Canada where the government commissioned a study on the 
price of gasoline.  There were some members of the government at 
the briefing.  I have heard them a number of times raging about 
the rip-off in the gasoline market and in gasoline prices.  There 
was huge outrage last summer when gasoline prices in parts of 
Canada were spiking at 90 cents a litre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member is suggesting that Canadians are willing to pay 
the price, be it 8 cents a litre for more ethanol or be it for 
more intensive refining to reduce tailpipe emissions, the 
government has a big job ahead of it to convince Canadians that 
it needs to be done and they should be willing to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I listened in my riding and elsewhere all across the country, 
Canadians were outraged and members of the House seemed to be 
outraged at the level of gasoline prices last summer.  If we do 
the things the member wants to do then we had better get used to 
those gasoline prices.  We will again see even higher gasoline 
prices this summer than we saw last summer.  Some would suggest 
that gas will spike at $1.28 a litre when we hit the peak driving 
season this summer in some parts of Canada.  Again we will hear 
that outcry from one side of the country to the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are really serious and if we think we should do what the member 
suggests then we have a big selling job. 
I do not have a big selling job.  His party is the government. It 
has a big selling job to do in Canada.  The government better get 
started on it right away if it is going to win that argument.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a great pleasure for me to rise today and talk about this 
issue.  I was a car dealer for 18 years prior to the career I 
have now.  I was very involved when the very first pollution 
devices came in.  The environment became a subject that we talked 
about every day from the factory level to the dealer level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This whole debate brings forth a lot of questions which have 
been raised by several members of the House.  We raised questions 
about the process of how private members' bills work and how 
effective they are and could be.  Questions have been raised 
about the confidence that people have in Health Canada.  We had 
the actual issue raised by the member for Lac-Saint-Louis about 
helping the environment by removing MMT from gasoline and 
increasing the oxygenation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to compliment the hon. member for bringing this 
forth.  It takes a great deal of effort, stamina, confidence and 
research to produce a bill like this and to see it through the 
procedure, which can be very discouraging.  However, the hon. 
member has followed through and has shown his usual diligence and 
ability to overcome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about this today, although not in the way he 
would like.  He would like it to be a votable issue.  He would 
like it to go to committee.  That is what should have happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are so many questions on so many aspects of this that we 
really have not had the chance to scrutinize the issue.  We have 
not had a chance to do the homework on it.  We have not had the 
examination on it or heard from witnesses.  Now we never will 
because it was determined that it would not go to a vote.  We 
lost that opportunity which would have helped a lot of us 
understand the issue better than we do, or at least better than I 
understand it now.  We have missed an opportunity and I think it 
is a shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has certainly raised the bar on standards for 
environment and health.  By bringing this forth he has shown 
initiative and courage.  It is interesting that his government 
has not had an environmental piece of legislation of any 
consequence for the eight years it has been here.  Yet the member 
brought forth this bill.  We should move a motion to make him the 
minister, then I am sure we would have some really interesting 
environmental bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any case, if MMT is poisonous or if it is a hazard to our 
health and the environment, it can do a great deal of damage. An 
incredible volume of gasoline, diesel and other fuels now use 
MMT.  I honestly do not know whether MMT is a dangerous substance 
or not.  I probably will not know now that we will not have a 
chance to take this to committee and hear from witness who do 
know and who are experts in the field.  However, if it is as 
dangerous as he fears it is, then I we should be taking steps to 
do what he wants to do, which is to have research provided from 
other sources than Health Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with Health Canada and have a great deal of respect for it 
as well.  However, there are still a lot of other bodies that 
question the potential damage that MMT can do.  Health Canada is 
a respectable outfit but there are other respectable outfits that 
are just as respectable.  They also say that MMT poses a serious 
health and environmental hazard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think it deserves more research, more debate in the House and 
more from experts.  I hope the hon. member does not give up with 
the way the bill has gone through in a non-votable fashion.  I 
hope he will keep on pressing the issue. I hope he will keep 
bringing it forth at committee or at every opportunity he has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree with the concept and with the principle.  However, I do 
not have the information to work with and I do not feel 
comfortable with the information that is available.  It is kind 
of like the national missile defence system.  The government said 
it would make a decision when it had the information.  For me, I 
do not have the information at the level with which I feel 
comfortable.  I probably will not get it now because it will not 
go to committee and we will not have the opportunity to get that 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I do want to commend the hon. member for bringing it 
forth and for his diligence and determination.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia—Lambton, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I too, in following along with our last speaker, would like to 
congratulate the member for Lac-Saint-Louis for bringing this 
matter back to the House.  I know that the member has a 
commitment to private members' business and to the environment. 
As a result of that he has brought this bill back.  After having 
said all that, however, I could not support this bill if it were 
votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to remember a number of things in the House.  I heard 
the critic from the fifth party refer to the science of this 
issue.  We have to read the bill and go back to recent history, 
recent history being 1995, 1996 and 1997, when a debate was held 
in this place on this very topic, specifically with respect to 
MMT.  At that time a lot of preposterous things were said about 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it was said that MMT was not used in third world 
countries such as Colombia, Venezuela and all sorts of other 
places.  That is very true because in those countries leaded 
gasoline is used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it was said that MMT was prohibited in the United 
States.  That is absolutely false.  This is the same as saying 
Canadian money is prohibited in the United States or vice versa 
or that we do not use American money in Canada and what is wrong 
with that.  The real point is the Americans had a much different 
process of licensing additives.  That process has worked in the 
United States.  In 1995 or 1996 the American EPA licensed MMT and 
today it is used in about 30% of gasoline sold in that country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many things have been said around this topic, which I would 
characterize at the level of grade nine science, that are not 
correct.  Look at the bill and remember back in history as to 
what occurred in this very place under a government bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about the environment, yet clause 4 of this bill issues 
a prohibition to import a product.  How can we use an ostensibly 
environmental bill as a trade bill?  The answer is quite simple. 
There is no evidence whatsoever that MMT is detrimental to the 
environment or one's health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The argument was made before the American EPA that MMT brought a 
lot of positive attributes, one being it reduces NOx emissions. 
It lowers such things as sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide and 
carbon dioxide emissions in the refining process. MMT boosts the 
octane rating of gasoline so less crude oil is used.  There are a 
number of positive attributes.  Canada has been using it since 
1977 and has reaped the benefits of MMT usage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go back to recent history.  In 1995 a great crusade 
started in this place to ban MMT importation.  This is what 
clause 4 of Bill C-254 would do.  However, we really do not have 
any reason for doing it.  If I go back to 1997, that bill became 
law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In June of 1997 an interprovincial trade tribunal ruled that the 
bill which was passed in this place, in the Senate and received 
royal assent, was in contravention of interprovincial trade.  The 
environment officials, who so vehemently defended the bill before 
House and Senate committees and who said they were following the 
political lead of doing the right thing, were forced to do a 180 
degree turn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In June of 1997, just as the dog days of summer were about to 
begin, the then minister of industry and the minister of the 
environment issued a press release and attended a press 
conference at which time they did three things.  First, they said 
mea culpa, they were wrong.  They apologized to the manufacturer 
Ethyl Corporation. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1800"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT48"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, they said that law could be of no force or effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, they were required to issue a cheque to Ethyl Corporation 
for about $18 million Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a pretty remarkable series of events done on the eve of 
summer.  They had to do that because, first, what they did was 
wrong, and second, they would not listen.  They would not listen 
to the science.  It was Grade 9 science they were listening to. 
They would not listen to their provincial counterparts.  Quebec, 
Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Alberta objected to the bill. They 
thought it was a good product and did not want to be deprived of 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The end result of that little exercise was that the Canadian 
taxpayer forked out $18 million and the Ministers of Industry and 
of the Environment said to Ethyl Corporation “We are sorry and 
we made a mistake and we will not do it again”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are and we are doing it again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that basis I would like to apply what is called the prudence 
principle:  that is, it is prudent not to do what we know is 
against laws, mainly laws of interprovincial trade and under 
NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a couple of final points.  We have heard a lot about the 
precautionary principle and we have heard reference to the Rio 
convention and all other international accords entered into by 
Canada.  If one assumes that the precautionary principle is to be 
applied in the face of lack of any evidence—in fact the evidence 
is quite to the contrary, but at that time, of course, the 
government would not allow a third party scientific panel to get 
involved and do an assessment—I would make the same suggestion 
that we could probably outlaw Tim Horton's doughnuts because if 
we eat enough of them they are bad for us.  If we eat bacon every 
morning, it will probably kill us.  The precautionary principle 
in the absence of any scientific evidence is not what Rio 
intended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to make a couple of comments with respect to the 
addition into the argument of the use of ethanol.  I would concur 
a great deal with what the member for Athabasca had to say about 
that point, and that is this:  yes, in the United States ethanol 
is used extensively, however, we have to look at why that is the 
case.  The case is that in the United States a number of highly 
populated cities were having problems with CO2 emissions.  The 
end result is that ethanol usage will decrease CO2.  Of course it 
ups the NOX, but it is a bit of a balance of both.  The Americans 
decided that they would use ethanol to cut smog.  There were 11 
centres in the U.S. where ethanol was mandatory at 10%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do they do it?  The senators in some of the midwestern 
states got about to subsidizing corn production in a big way.  If 
we want to subsidize corn farmers, and I am not making an 
argument against that, let us just say so.  Or as the member for 
Athabasca has said, let us explain to Canadians why the price of 
gasoline is going up.  Part of it is the price of crude, 
absolutely, but a bigger factor in all of this is what occurs in 
places right here and in provincial capitals where, as we saw 
last year, sulphur requirements were imposed upon the industry 
without its co-operation:  we are seeing that the price of 
gasoline will rise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, I say that this is once again bringing in something 
that ought not to be declared a law, and it is not likely to be 
under the circumstances.  Second, we have to be a little more 
frank and open with people when we start going on crusades in 
this place about gasoline prices.  There have been 12 federal 
inquiries and one provincial inquiry in Ontario and what did they 
prove?  Absolutely nothing.  They proved that we are a 
contributing factor to the high price of gasoline.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Comartin (Windsor—St. Clair, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I want to echo some of the comments some of the other members 
have made with regard to the member for Lac-Saint-Louis.  It is 
to his credit and his long term commitment to the environment 
that he has brought forth this bill today.  It is unfortunate 
that it is a non-votable one.  Perhaps as this draws more 
attention, the government may see its way clear to meeting some 
of the commitments it made over a period of time and dealing with 
some of the fiasco that has occurred around the use of the MMT. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to re-emphasize a number of points that have been made by 
the member for Lac-Saint-Louis.  The reality is that most of the 
industrialized world does not use MMT in gasoline.  It is banned 
in a number of states in the United States and, in fact, 85% of 
the U.S. refineries do not use MMT.  I think everybody in this 
debate recognizes that there is a concern with regard to the use 
of the MMT in terms of a serious potential risk to human health 
and a risk to the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically with regard to the environment, there is no debate. 
The scientific evidence on this is clear: the use of the MMT does 
inhibit and in fact in a lot of cases renders useless emission 
control devices in automobiles, resulting in a number of toxins 
being released into the atmosphere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>MMT was initially banned in the U.S. because of concerns around 
hydrocarbon emissions, but there were further studies and there 
has been some reference made to them today.  Again, there is no 
debate within the health and scientific communities that high 
concentrations of manganese can cause neurological damage.  The 
debate is about at what level it is safe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to that and there being no evidence, as alleged by 
some of the other members in this House, I want to quote from a 
study that was done by the neurotoxicologist Donna Mergler at the 
University of Quebec.  This was an EPA sponsored study of a 306 
residents in Quebec.  The results suggest that even low levels of 
manganese can have deleterious affects.  She is quoted as saying: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In large concentrations, airborne manganese does pose a risk. 
What we don't know is at what level does it not pose a risk...We 
should know a lot more about it before we use it. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to spend a few minutes with regard to the whole farcical 
history of how MMT has been treated by the government, the 
embarrassment that Canada has been put to and, to some extent, 
the shame of having to pay that $18 million plus to an American 
corporation when in fact in a number of states in the U.S. it is 
already banned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, because I think it is more important to deal with the 
health and environment issues and not so much with the trade 
component in this issue, let me go back a bit.  In 1992 Canada 
committed to applying the precautionary principle.  In fact we 
have not had a very good history of doing that.  The NDP has 
strongly advocated that the federal government abide by this 
commitment and apply the precautionary principle.  To my mind, 
this is one of the clearest cases where we should in fact be 
doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters:</B>  Health Canada said they did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Comartin:</B>  Health Canada:  I support your position 
that it really has to be looked at.  Health Canada has a very 
high standard of tolerance for manganese.  Dr. Mergler, I think, 
would clearly set a lower one. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1810"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT50"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be very nice if this matter could be referred to 
committee and if more evidence could be brought forth.  The 
Mergler study was done in the middle part of 1998.  I would 
suggest that more studies have been done since then wherein we 
might find more clear evidence in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me go back to the precautionary principle.  In the bill, the 
member for Lac-Saint-Louis has specifically invoked it.  I again 
want to commend him for that.  The preamble states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And Whereas on the basis of the precautionary principle, it is 
imperative for the Parliament of Canada to take immediate action 
to protect human health and the environment by banning these 
harmful or potentially harmful automotive fuels; 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is very much what the precautionary principle is all about, 
a principle that not only Canada but all the world has adopted. 
To suggest that we treat MMT in the same category as Tim Hortons 
doughnuts is ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me conclude by encouraging the member for Lac-Saint-Louis to 
pursue his cause in this regard.  We certainly intend to support 
him.  Hopefully other members of the House, government members in 
particular, will see their way clear to in effect push this 
legislation through and ban MMT. 
<P><A NAME="LINK175"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Redman (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the 
Environment, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, first of all I would like to 
applaud the motivations of the member for Lac-Saint-Louis in 
bringing forward a bill that aims at improving the environmental 
performance of vehicles.  The government, with the support of 
members like my hon. colleague, has taken and will continue to 
take strong action on air pollution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The particulars of this bill, however, including some of the 
environmental as well as economic consequences, make it 
impossible for the government to support it.  We are, however, 
moving forward with programs that have equivalent or even better 
environmental results than the ones intended in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 19 the minister announced a 10 year regulatory road 
map for cleaner vehicles and fuels which will give Canadians 
cleaner air to breathe and will better protect their health from 
airborne pollutants.  These actions follow a significant clean 
air event of 2000, the negotiation of and the signature to the 
historic ozone annex to the 1991 Canada-U.S. air quality 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ozone annex is a major accomplishment in the transboundary 
field.  Studies show that up to 90% of the smog we see during the 
summer months in central and Atlantic Canada comes from the 
United States.  Clearly pollution does not need a passport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ozone annex contains commitments for action by both 
countries and will deliver clean air to up to 16 million 
Canadians in Ontario, Quebec and Atlantic Canada and millions 
more in the 18 American states as they apply the commitment to 
reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides and volatile organic 
compounds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reaching an agreement in 2000 on the ozone annex was an 
opportunity Canada did not want to miss.  The government's 
implementation plan for the annex is a major step forward in 
capturing opportunities.  The plan represents $120 million of 
investment from the Government of Canada for cleaner, healthier 
air. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the ozone annex commitments and benefits are targeted at 
Ontario, Quebec and Atlantic Canada, the regulatory and other 
initiatives unveiled on February 19 will benefit all Canadians. 
Over 30 million Canadians will benefit.  These are national 
benefits because, clearly, clean air is a national issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Science tells us that more than 5,000 Canadians die prematurely 
each year because of air pollution.  Hundreds of thousands suffer 
from aggravated asthma, bronchitis and other respiratory 
illnesses.  Now we are learning that air pollution affects our 
health at levels lower than we previously believed.  The people 
most vulnerable are children and the elderly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our election platform and in the Speech from the Throne, the 
Government of Canada promised opportunities for all. 
Opportunities come in all shapes and sizes.  If a smog warning 
prevents a child with asthma from playing outside, that is a 
missed opportunity.  If an elderly person becomes a virtual 
shut-in during a heat wave, that too is a lost opportunity.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This investment focuses on action in two key areas, 
transportation and industrial sectors, backed up by better air 
quality monitoring of air pollution and an improved and expanded 
reporting system so that Canadians can follow our progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transportation is the biggest cause of air pollution in Canada. 
For that reason, our 10 year regulatory plan of action contains 
stringent new low emission standards for passenger cars, light 
duty trucks, sport utility vehicles and new standards for the 
fuels that power them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this package, nitrogen oxide emissions, a key ingredient of 
smog, will be reduced by 90% for vehicles of the year 2004 and 
beyond.  However there is more.  The package of regulatory 
initiatives will also apply to the off road sector which includes 
diesel engines for construction vehicles and farm vehicles, and 
gasoline utility engines for snow blowers, lawnmowers and chain 
saws.  These handy household recreational vehicles and tools 
account for approximately 20% of the transportation sector's smog 
inventory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition we are also looking at new measures to reduce 
sulphur in residential and industrial fuel oils, as well as 
taking action on the gasoline additive MTBE. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is understood that a major tenet of Bill C-254 is the support 
for clean, renewable, biomass based fuels such as ethanol.  To 
this point the government has recently increased its support to 
ethanol production through the action plan 2000 to address 
climate change.  We have committed an additional $150 million in 
loan guarantees for construction of biomass to ethanol plants to 
be delivered through the Farm Credit Corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is expected there will be five additional world scale 
production facilities commissioned in Canada, producing 
approximately 750 million litres of ethanol per year as a direct 
result of the loan guarantee program.  Additionally, $3 million 
has been earmarked to support the promotion of ethanol blended 
gasoline and increase consumer demand for this environmentally 
friendlier gasoline.  We will continue to support ethanol 
production through the excise tax relief program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These actions are in keeping with the government's desire to see 
clean, renewable fuel ethanol expand and thrive upon solid 
footing in a response to normal market forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Minister of the Environment unveiled in the 10 year 
plan is a major step forward in bringing cleaner air to 
Canadians, but the federal government's job is far from finished. 
The government wants to engage more Canadians in direct actions 
that they can take and to empower them to hold governments to 
account to meet clean air commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our search for scientific understanding for the sources of air 
pollution and the solutions we take must continue.  The 10 year 
plan for cleaner vehicles and fuels is another step along the 
road to cleaner air and healthier Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I see that my own government does not want my bill.  In 
any case, the bill has died so the government must be quite 
happy.  I listened to all this panoply of wonderful measures the 
government would take.  I did not see anything that contradicted 
my bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the government this.  How come the 28 states of the 
United States produce ethanol?  How come in Minnesota alone 
produces more ethanol then we would produce with our 10 year 
plan?  It is because they have legislated oxygenation of fuel. 
It is that simple.  If we oxygenate fuel and legislate it, then 
the oil companies are bound to do it.  It sparks a tremendous 
production of oxygenated fuels in the land. 
In answer to the member from Prince George, I never said that MMT 
kills.  I never said anything like that.  I said a lot of studies 
show that it is an impairment on the motor systems of human 
beings.  There is lot of evidence to support this.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Sarnia disappointed me most of all.  He is a 
loud speaker for the oil industry from Sarnia.  He said we were 
comparing manganese with Tim Hortons doughnuts in applying a 
precautionary principle.  He was not there when Rio was created. 
He was not there for the discussions about chemical toxins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will mention a number of experts who say manganese is a toxin 
and is dangerous to human health.  Two famous scientists in 
Canada, Dr. John Donaldson and Dr. Frank Labella have done 
extensive studies. They have appeared before the 
Western Psychiatric Institute 
of the University of Pittsburgh, and the health and environment 
committee of the U.S. congress on this issue.  They appeared 
before the U.S. house of representatives in 1990 which had 
extensive hearings on MMT. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also other doctors, Dr. Kimberley Treinen, Dr. Tim 
Gray of England, Dr. William Blazak, who was cited by my 
colleague from the NDP, Dr. Donna Mergler, who is carrying out a 
study for the U.S. EPA at the University of Montreal and Dr. 
Joseph Zayed, who showed that manganese was not good for us and 
that it affected the motor system of human beings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary told us how the government is going 
to marvellously clean the air but it does not want to address the 
MMT issue.  By legislating oxygenation of gasoline, we then force 
the oil companies to produce natural additives such as ethanol. 
It lessens the need for MMT.  We are the only industrialized 
nation to use MMT. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Sarnia mentioned Venezuela, as a developing 
nation, uses MMT.  He is not correct.  I never mentioned that.  I 
said that industrialized nations that use unleaded gas today do 
not use MMT.  We are the only guinea pigs in the world that do. 
He mentioned that MMT is not used in 30% of the gasoline in the 
United States.  I got a letter from the U.S. EPA last year.  It 
said that it used MMT in .002% of all gasoline in the United 
States.  This officially came from the U.S. EPA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why my bill never contradicted all the various measures 
that the government has taken on clean air.  On the contrary, we 
rejoice about more money being put into the environment.  What is 
the contradiction between this and discussing a bill which will 
oxygenate gasoline and force it by legislation?  I do not see 
any. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the contradiction between what the government is going 
to do and saying that by 2005 we will get rid of MMT.  We had 
many debates in the past on MMT while the legislation was before 
us.  The only reason it was thrown out was because of trade 
reasons.  It was not thrown out because of environmental and 
health reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that in 1994 our health ministry decided that it was 
not harmful to human health when used as an additive.  Now the 
health ministry has decided to recant itself.  It has ordered Dr. 
Mergler and other famous scientists in Canada, who are 
specialists in manganese, to review the whole issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a multi-year study being carried out by Health Canada 
today on manganese.  If it felt that the 1994 study was so 
conclusive, it would not have ordered this new study.  It is 
because time after time scientists are saying “beware”.  I do 
not say that the proof is conclusive.   At the time the battle 
over lead was going on, Ethyl Corporation, the purveyors of lead 
and the same purveyors of MMT, was telling us how good lead was 
for us.  It was the same kind of debate.  Lead is wonderful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that we have banned lead in Canada, thank the Lord, what do they 
do with the lead?  It is sold to developing nations and the poor. 
People who are using it in their gasoline are being poisoned by 
lead.  It is the same people today who sell us MMT and tell us 
how great MMT is and how good manganese is for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Manganese is not doughnuts at Tim Hortons.  It is far more 
serious.

<P><A NAME="LINK179"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, last Friday during question period I 
asked a question of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.  The 
question was taken by the Deputy Prime Minister.  My question was 
in regard to maintaining the rescue diving capability of the 
Vancouver based coast guard rescue centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The possible cancellation of this program had been a news story 
on Vancouver television for five nights running.  Yet the Deputy 
Prime Minister had to take the question under advisement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans announced the end of the 
program that very same day and informed me by letter, because of 
the lack of response I had received during question period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then early Sunday morning Paul Sandhu ended upside down in his 
car in four feet of water in the Fraser River right across from 
the coast guard station.  They were on the scene within a minute 
of being called.  The coast guard crew were only allowed to 
provide lighting because the rescue diving program had been 
cancelled.  The car containing the body of Mr. Sandhu was pulled 
out by the RCMP one half hour later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much has happened since then.  The minister stated to me in the 
House of Commons on Tuesday that services would continue to be 
provided by the Department of National Defence.  It is now clear 
that it will not work to drop the coast guard rescue diving in 
the Vancouver area and substitute DND from Comox or Esquimalt on 
Vancouver Island to do the rescue diving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Vancouver coast guard rescue diving program record over the 
last six years demonstrates that the vast majority of calls were 
responded to within 20 minutes.  For example, mobilization and 
flight time for DND from Comox is one and a half hours and it is 
worse on nights and weekends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is saying that these are equivalent services when 
they are so obviously not.  Then on Wednesday the minister issued 
a statement that his department would review all of the facts 
surrounding the response to the tragic accident that occurred on 
Sunday.  Until this review is complete and a final decision is 
announced, the rescue diving pilot project will remain suspended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decision to cancel the rescue divers has all the earmarks of 
bureaucratic bungling and bad advice to the minister.  I have 
been here before with the coast guard initiative to de-staff all 
light stations on the B.C. coast.  This was finally overturned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is now in a face saving posture.  He must respond 
to public pressure to reinstate the rescue diver program.  He 
does not want to alienate those few in his department who gave 
him the bad advice he used to authorize this ill-conceived 
decision.  None of this is a valid enough reason to expose the 
public to further risk by maintaining suspension of service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me back full circle to where I was on Friday when I 
asked if the minister would stop this wrong headed, bureaucratic 
initiative now.  While a review is under way, the common sense 
approach would be to reinstate coast guard rescue diver 
capability rather than leave the opportunity for another tragedy. 
Every day is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like an explanation as to why the minister will not 
reinstate the program immediately, even though the review is 
pending.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John O'Reilly (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
his question and his interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to speak today about rescue diving.  Before I 
continue I certainly wish to state that it is unfortunate that 
the automobile accident in Richmond, British Columbia, resulted 
in a death on February 18. 
My heartfelt sympathies go out to the victim's family and 
friends.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members today may recall the announcement in 1995 which 
preceded the commencement of a two year rescue diving pilot 
project at the coast guard hovercraft station at Sea Island in 
British Columbia.  The pilot project was to determine the 
effectiveness of rescue diving as a complement to Canadian Coast 
Guard search and rescue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997, after two years of operating the pilot project, the 
project was extended so that more information could be collected 
by the coast guard to determine the effectiveness of providing a 
rescue diving capability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In November 2000, after reviewing available information, the 
coast guard, primarily out of concern for the safety of the 
divers, engaged in the very high risk operations inherent with 
these activities, suspended the pilot project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An evaluation of the pilot project has indicated that the risks 
inherent in diving activities were high and that the risks 
inherent in rescue diving were even greater.  The rescue diving 
operations were usually conducted in poor to bad visibility, 
rough weather and involved a high degree of uncertainty and the 
presence of wreckage in the water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An analysis of the dives during the six years of the pilot 
project indicated that approximately 2,000 dives took place.  Of 
these, only about three dozen were actual rescue dives.  The 
remainder of the dives were to conduct underwater hull 
inspections and to work on marine navigational buoys.  As a 
result of the rescue dives two individuals were rescued alive. 
Tragically, one of them died of his injuries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To return to the recent accident on February 18, it is currently 
too early and perhaps impossible to determine whether the 
life of the individual involved in this accident could indeed 
have been saved had the coast guard deployed 
divers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members are probably aware, the hon. Minister of Fisheries 
and Oceans has announced that he has personally asked his deputy 
minister and the commissioner of the Canadian Coast Guard to 
review all the facts surrounding the response to the tragic 
accident that occurred on that Sunday in Richmond, British 
Columbia, as well as the rescue diving pilot project in Richmond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's priority is to continue to work with its 
partners and with its own resources to provide efficient, safe 
maritime search and rescue services to Canadians.

of<BR> 
The Right Honourable Tony Blair,<BR> 
Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of<BR> 
Great Britain and Northern Ireland<BR> 
to<BR> 
both Houses of Parliament<BR> 
in the<BR> 
House of Commons Chamber, Ottawa<BR> 
on<BR> 
Thursday, February 22, 2001 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>The Right Honourable and Mrs. Tony Blair were welcomed by the 
Right Honourable Jean Chrétien, Prime Minister of Canada, by the 
Honourable Dan Hays, Speaker of the Senate and by the Honourable 
Peter Milliken, Speaker of the House of Commons.</I> 
<P><A NAME="LINK182"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Peter Milliken (Speaker of the House of Commons):</B> 
Order, please.  I would like to call upon the Right Hon. Jean 
Chrétien, the Prime Minister of Canada, to now make his remarks. 
<P><A NAME="LINK183"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
hon. senators, judges, members of parliament, ladies and 
gentlemen, it is my very great pleasure to introduce the Right 
Hon. Tony Blair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prime Minister, you are about to address the 37th Parliament of 
Canada, men and women of diverse backgrounds and sharp 
ideological differences, people who have a very hard time 
agreeing on anything, but you need not worry about our manners 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think I can speak for all of my colleagues when I say that any 
leader whose resumé includes winning the largest parliamentary 
majority in over 60 years can expect our undivided attention. 
Your historic 1997 election victory was, for many Canadians, 
their first introduction to Tony Blair, but it was really just 
the most spectacular result of the skilful leadership you have 
shown in remaking your party and in redefining the terms of 
political discourse in Great Britain and throughout the liberal 
western democracies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In common with so many of us who have gone into politics, Mr. 
Blair trained to enter the law.  And the law is in his family as 
well.  Madam Cherie Blair, who is with us, is an accomplished 
barrister in her own right and, by the way, she is the only woman 
I can call chérie without my wife giving me that look. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beginning with his election in 1993 as a Labour member of 
parliament, Mr. Blair has shown a keen commitment both to the 
welfare of his constituents and to addressing the broader issues 
that challenge government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>His considerable eloquence and his mastery of issues are widely 
known and respected.  His ability to project the modern vitality 
of Britain on the world stage has become a personal trademark and 
his steadfast commitment to peace in Northern Ireland has earned 
him international praise.  It is a cause in which Canada has been 
pleased to play a role. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prime Minister Blair also played a key role in the development 
of a political movement we know now as the third way, a way that 
is open to all progressive governments in the context of the new 
information—and knowledge-based global economy, a middle way 
between total confidence in market forces and heavy dependency 
on state interventions, a way that seeks to encourage the spirit 
of initiative and prosperity, while ensuring that the benefits 
of economic growth are shared and no one is left out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister and I often share the same views in this 
area.  I have presented to him what I call the Canadian way, and 
he in turn has explained to me how his government successfully 
creates truly made-in-Britain solutions to the challenges it 
faces.  I am sure our dialogue and exchanges of views on this 
will continue during this visit. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is just a 21st century example of the common ground that 
has long characterized the relationship between our nations, 
common ground embodied by this honourable place and our embrace 
of the Westminster tradition; by our willingness to shed blood 
together in the defence of freedom and justice; by our 
co-operation on so many issues at the UN, in NATO, at the WTO and 
in the Commonwealth; and by our resolve to renew and revitalize 
our transatlantic relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prime Minister, in addressing this special joint session, you 
join a distinguished company of British prime ministers of the 
modern era, a company that was led off by the Right Hon. Winston 
Churchill.  If I could borrow from the master of words: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many in Canada who listen to the debates of this 
honourable House and wonder that so much could be said by so many 
but understood by so few. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, we welcome the opportunity for some well chosen words 
from a worthy successor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ladies and gentlemen, a dynamic leader, an accomplished 
statesman and a very great friend of Canada, I present the Right 
Hon. Tony Blair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>Applause</I> 
<P><A NAME="LINK184"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Tony Blair (Prime Minister of the United Kingdom 
of Great Britain and Northern Ireland):</B>  Mr. Speaker, Mr. 
Speaker of the Senate, Mr. Prime Minister, hon. members of the 
Senate and members of the House of Commons, thank you so much for 
that kind reception.  I can truthfully say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
that is the only time I have ever been in a House of Commons and 
got a polite reception. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>May I also say to my good friend and colleague, Jean Chrétien, 
thank you for that most generous, too generous introduction.  If 
I can repay the compliment to you, you have been not just a good 
friend to my country but you are someone respected throughout the 
entire free world.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>You mentioned my large election victory.  Well, I think there 
are a few lessons people can learn from you as well, but that is 
the last comment of any sort I will make on elections today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>May I say too that it is a rare honour to be invited to address 
you here where the common bond between our two nations is 
symbolized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course I think it is important to point out that ours is not 
a relationship built only on shared history and sentiment. I know 
that Canadian investment in Britain has grown by something like 
50% in the last six years, making you the fourth largest investor 
in our country.  Britain is the second largest investor in 
Canada.  Last year alone, British companies committed more than 
$13 billion Canadian here.  The country Voltaire likened to 
“quelques arpents de neige” and Edward Gibbon to ancient 
Germany, is today for Britain, for us as we look at you, a high 
tech hub of the global economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You are deservedly world leaders now in the new economy, but of 
course there are ties deeper than commerce alone can ever be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have just seen the famous photograph of Sir Winston Churchill 
in Mr. Speaker's office and he resolved for me, incidentally, one 
of the great puzzles I have always had with that very famous 
photograph.  I always wondered why Churchill looked so stern and 
why he was leaning forward in that way.  He has resolved this 
difficulty for me.  Apparently when Karsh was taking the 
photograph of him, Churchill was smoking a cigar and was not 
paying attention.  He would not pay attention to what was 
happening around him and finally Karsh leaned forward and 
snatched the cigar out of his mouth, which is how he got the look 
of Churchill looking stern and disciplined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was almost 60 years ago that Churchill addressed this 
parliament in Europe's darkest hour.  What shines through that 
speech is his absolute conviction that at that dark hour, 
Canada's support would be unwavering.  It was not for nothing 
that Churchill called Canada the linchpin of the English speaking 
world.  Some things change, but some things remain constantly 
with us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can pay Canada no greater compliment than this.  All nations 
have their reputations.  As Prime Minister I deal with many 
crises, often of an international nature, but I know, and I bet I 
speak for most of the prime ministers of my acquaintance in 
Britain and abroad, that when we are told the Canadians are in on 
the act, whatever the forum for decision, there is a sense of 
relief, the clouds part a little and the confidence grows. People 
know that your word is your bond and, what is more, what you do 
you do well.  It is not a bad reputation to have.  Well done. 
Keep it for always. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was, I guess, the Atlantic that brought Britain and Canada 
together and gave us a maritime history.  Trade was its common 
thread. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The story of our two nations began in 1497 when Henry VII funded 
an Italian adventurer to open a trade route to Asia by sailing 
west and instead he landed, as you know, in Newfoundland.  The 
following centuries were a tale of exploration and new frontiers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For Britons down the centuries, Canada has been and remains a 
great land of opportunity.  By 1870 British Canadians accounted 
for 2.1 million out of a total population of 3.6 million. British 
engineers and investors helped build the canals and railways that 
helped link Canada east to west. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1867 the British North America Act brought Canada and 
Canadian provinces together in a Confederation:  the first 
dominion and the first federal constitution in the British 
Empire.  Britain and Canada still share a sovereign and the best 
traditions of parliamentary democracy.  Our new human rights act, 
for example, echoes the charter of rights and freedoms that you, 
Jean, pioneered as Pierre Trudeau's justice minister, but perhaps 
it is our shared experience of defending our freedom and our way 
of life that forms the strongest bond.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The British will never forget that Canada stood by our side 
throughout both world wars.  Nearly 10% of the total Canadian 
population served in the first world war:  Ypres in 1915; the 
Somme, where the brave Newfoundlanders lost 730 out of 801 men in 
30 minutes; and Vimy Ridge in 1917. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the second world war Canada's record is no less crucial. Over 
a million Canadian men and women served in the armed forces on 
the frontline in the liberation of Italy, France and the Low 
Countries.  Two Canadian battalions were lost in the defence of 
Hong Kong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that both Canada and then Britain, following 
your example, recently announced compensation schemes to honour 
our Far East Prisoners of War.  Roosevelt and Churchill signed 
the Atlantic Charter on a warship in Newfoundland bay, and 
Mackenzie King hosted the two crucial Quebec conferences in 1943 
and 1944 on the war and the shape of the peace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The presence of Canadian and British forces in continental 
Europe helped win the cold war.  They have served together in 
Korea, Cyprus, Bosnia, Kosovo, East Timor and even Sierra Leone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, it took a Canadian general to win the confidence of both 
sides in Northern Ireland over the most sensitive issue of all, 
the issue of arms decommissioning.  I would like, if I might, to 
pay tribute to General John de Chastelain for what he has done 
and what he and other Canadians, including your Prime Minister, 
Jean Chrétien, continue to do for peace in Northern Ireland. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the days of the British Empire, Great Britain and Canada 
have changed.  Canada has incorporated two great European 
civilizations into a bilingual country enriched by the 
contributions of other cultures, firstly, obviously, by those of 
its aboriginal nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada today is turning increasingly not only to the west but to 
the east as well, to the Pacific and to Asia, the origins of 
half of Canada's immigrants in the past decade.  Great Britain 
too has diversified. 
Our democracies are changing and adapting, utilizing the 
tolerance characteristic of them to create multicultural and 
dynamic societies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shared objectives have arisen from the values we hold jointly. 
Yesterday, I read last month's Speech from the Throne and the 
reactions that followed it in the Commons.  I was struck by the 
similarity of our political debates: technology in the age of 
information and education, the environment, increased growth and 
more jobs. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We share something else.  You are that part of North America 
closest in values and traditions to Europe, and we are that part 
of Europe closest to North America.  We both are part of and we 
strongly support the transatlantic alliance, Europe and North 
America together.  I wish to speak about that to you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a belief, formed in theory but now far more powerfully 
reinforced after four years' practical experience as Prime 
Minister, that where the two sides of the Atlantic stand together 
the world is a more secure, stable and prosperous planet.  We 
have our disagreements, of course we do, but they simply 
evaporate in importance when put alongside our common interests 
and values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that what binds us together is a common belief in the 
values of institutionalized democracy, the benefits of the rule 
of law, the primacy of the market as the engine for growth, the 
belief in a strong and inclusive society to correct the market's 
injustices, the creative power of individualism and the ultimate 
need to protect human rights.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the core package, if you like, of our political canon, 
what we believe in.  What separates us from others is that we 
believe in the whole package.  We do not believe that you can 
have the market without society, or human rights separated from 
the rule of law, or anything less than all the attributes of 
democracy.  Our experience tells us too, does it not, that when 
people are given the opportunity freely to choose, this model of 
political organization is the one that they choose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we stand together, both sides of the Atlantic, either in 
situations of conflict, or of trade or in trying to regulate the 
vagaries of global finance or indeed in issues of human rights, 
we most often prevail and we do so on the basis of what is right 
and what is just. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet despite the evidence of history and our own present 
prosperity, some will question this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak to you first and foremost as the Prime Minister of the 
United Kingdom.  British, proud to be so, truly ambitious for 
Britain, determined to see its potential fulfilled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak to you as a committed Atlanticist.  I speak to you also 
as a European, unshakeable in my view that Britain's future is as 
a leading player in Europe, a powerful force for good and a force 
for reform inside the European Union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are those in my country who say it is not possible to be 
all those things.  You can have Europe or you can have North 
America but you cannot have both.  Britain has to choose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an article of my political faith that I refuse point blank 
to do so.  We will have the best of both worlds.  We will give up 
neither relationship.  We will make them both work, and we will 
make them work not just for Britain but for the sake of the 
transatlantic alliance itself.  That alliance is of course most 
clear in defence and our commitment to NATO is fundamental. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had the good sense to adapt NATO to 21st century 
security tasks.  The threat to our own territory may have all but 
disappeared.  But the threats, as you know, to our interests 
persist, from turmoil within nations such as Yugoslavia, from 
terrorism, and from the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and 
biological weapons.  NATO is our organization of choice for 
dealing with these threats.  No organization is stronger, no 
military alliance more integrated.  Nothing surpasses NATO's 
strength or its effectiveness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today Canadian and British peacekeepers work side by side in the 
Balkans, sometimes under a Canadian Commander and sometimes under 
a British one, within NATO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is NATO that reversed the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo and set 
in train the events which led to Milosevic being ousted and has 
given the prospect of a decent peace accord.  On our own, Europe 
could not have achieved that.  It took the combination of Europe 
and North America, acting together in NATO, to deliver on that 
goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The initiative on European defence should be seen in that 
context.  It is limited to crisis management, peacekeeping and 
humanitarian tasks.  It requires the sovereign decision of each 
nation to participate in each operation, as indeed with the 
United Nations.  It is not therefore a standing army.  There will 
be no separate EU military planning structures, and it applies 
only where NATO has chosen not to act collectively. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1055"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT61"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT61"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1055

<A HREF="#LINKT60"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has, however, two potential benefits.  First, it allows 
Europe, for example, in crises on or within Europe's border, to 
act where the U.S. does not wish to.  Bosnia from 1992 to 1995 is 
such a case in point.  Second, it puts pressure on Europe to 
increase its defence capability, something long desired by our 
allies in North America.  Done right it will strengthen NATO and 
NATO will remain the cornerstone of our collective security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other crucial area for the transatlantic alliance is trade. 
Around the world there is simultaneously the desire for greater 
local autonomy and nations coming together for their own common 
good.  Those two things happen almost simultaneously.  In the 
U.K., for example, we have found a way through devolution to 
create a new partnership for the U.K. between England, Scotland, 
Wales and Northern Ireland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet at the same time, as greater devolution occurs within 
nations, countries are voluntarily coming together to form 
regional groups.  The EU may be the most integrated, but in North 
America you have NAFTA; in the South, Mercosur; and in Asia, 
ASEAN, APEC and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view these two trends are healthy and go together: devolve 
where possible, integrate where necessary.  The key, however, is 
to ensure that these regional blocs do not become inward looking 
or closed to other parts of the outside world.  If we simply 
exchange the darker side of nationalism for conflict between 
regional blocs, we will have gained nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The EU and NAFTA are the world's largest trading blocs and the 
world's biggest free traders.  NAFTA is the European Union's most 
important trading partner.  In 1999 EU exports to NAFTA were £137 
billion and imports from NAFTA were £121 billion.  Yet relations 
are not as they should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Proposals for a transatlantic free trade area in 1996 came to 
nothing.  The Transatlantic Economic Partnership of 1998 has not 
been the success we all hoped for at the time.  Despite ever 
closer economic links our trade relations, as you all well know, 
have become bedevilled by disputes over issues like beef and 
bananas, and damaged both our interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now have an opportunity for a new start, however.  The 
European Union is engaged in a radical program of economic 
reform, and not before time.  We are committed to opening up 
markets, reducing the burden of regulation, and encouraging 
enterprise and new technologies.  In March at the summit in 
Stockholm we will take this a step further forward.  We want to 
work more closely with our partners on this side of the Atlantic, 
including the new U.S. Administration, to promote free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe, therefore, that we need to take steps to improve 
greatly the EU-NAFTA relationship, and I propose the following. 
First, we should agree to an EU-NAFTA political declaration of 
intent on trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ninety-eight per cent of our trade is trouble free.  We cannot 
allow the remaining 2% to sour trading relations in the way it 
has.  We should aim to break the logjam by the June EU summit in 
Gothenburg.  We will pursue this as Britain with our partners and 
the Commission, and we will discuss at Stockholm in March how we 
achieve this by that June summit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This should then be reinforced by an EU-NAFTA commitment to go 
further within the WTO framework to break down non-tariff 
barriers as well.  In areas like insurance and professional 
services, but also others, liberalization is massively, I 
believe, in our joint interests on both sides of the Atlantic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At Gothenburg we should also agree to a statement of principles 
as the basis for launching a new WTO round at Doha in November. 
It is time that we move.  We should agree to a joint commitment 
to remove trade barriers for the least developed countries. 
That means duty free and quota free access for everything but 
arms.  It is frustrating, and it is wrong, that it is taking so 
long within the European Union to bring this excellent initiative 
to fruition.  Those developing countries need our help and we 
should give it to them.  We should consider how we improve 
radically the forum for solving future transatlantic trade 
problems before full blown WTO litigation sets in.

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally on trade I just want to say this last point.  It is time 
I think that we started to argue vigorously and clearly as to why 
free trade is right.  It is the key to jobs for our people, to 
prosperity and actually to development in the poorest parts of 
the world.  The case against it is misguided and, worse, unfair. 
However sincere the protests, they cannot be allowed to stand in 
the way of rational argument.  We should start to make this case 
with force and determination. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the transatlantic link must not be limited to 
security and trade.  There are other challenges: organized 
crime, terrorism, the environment, population movements.   We 
are all affected by the issues, good or bad, that concern our 
planet.  A more effective transatlantic alliance will help us 
find better solutions.  It is up to us to see to it. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friends, my apology for my French pronunciation.  There is a 
story about that which is a bit naughty, so I suppose I had 
better not tell it to the Canadian parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>A Voice:</B>  We want to hear it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Tony Blair:</B>  Well, okay.  I invited Lionel 
Jospin, the French Prime Minister, to my constituency one time 
and we did a joint press conference live on television.  I was 
asked the question in French whether I was envious of Lionel 
Jospin's success and policies.  I meant to reply that I was very 
envious of the magnificent positions he had taken on different 
policy issues.  Instead, I informed the startled French public 
that I decidedly know Jospin in many different positions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we will do most of our press conference in English, if 
that is all right.  It was quite hard to recover my reputation in 
France after that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The strength of our relationship, Britain and Canada, may 
originate with our history, but what I want to say to you from 
the depth of my heart is that it does not depend on our history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are present, real and substantial bonds of mutual interest 
and endeavour that unite our nations.  If these bonds deepen 
still further, as I believe they should and could, it does not 
impact on us alone.  It is greatly to the benefit of all.  The 
world we live in today moves ever closer together.  At least for 
the most developed nations, prosperity and opportunity have never 
been greater, but the global threats are also growing: nuclear 
proliferation, environmental degradation, fundamentalism and the 
potential for financial collapse in one continent to trigger 
collapse in another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My message to you is very simple, and it is this.  In that new 
world, more dangerous, moving closer together under the threats 
and also the possibilities of globalization and technology, both 
of us with the U.S., both of us with Europe, both of us in the 
Commonwealth, both of us also with the Pacific and Asia, occupy a 
special place.

believe the world's.  It places a heavy responsibility on us.  It 
is one that I believe we can justly discharge with pride.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The visit recognizes and reinforces the remarkable bond that 
exists between our countries.  Our relationship is a longstanding 
and particularly important one.  The trust and understanding 
between our countries are supported and sustained, as you have 
observed, by our trade, family ties, culture and our common 
practice of democracy.  In this context I observe that of special 
interest, in particular to many in the Senate, has been your 
government's initiative, as you mentioned, to devolve its power 
and to bring about changes in the House of Lords. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our relations have always been marked by great mutual trust. 
And, particularly in the last century, during wars and through 
numerous diplomatic missions, we have supported each other. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>]

remind ourselves not to take it for granted and to remember just 
how important it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a representative of Alberta, I know well of our co-operation. 
The United Kingdom has been a source of investment needed to 
develop our natural resources, and in recent times the United 
Kingdom has in turn received Canadian investment and expertise in 
the development of its natural resources in the North Sea and on 
shore.

Britain was our history, and many of your country's traditions 
are still maintained in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The model for all parliaments, Westminster, continues to make 
its presence felt among us today, not just in our procedural 
system, but more tangibly in the form of the Speaker's chair. 
This chair was a gift from Great Britain, a reproduction of the 
one in Westminster.  Its dais, decorated with the Royal coat of 
arms, was sculpted from a single block of oak taken from the 
roof of Westminster Hall, which dates back to 1397. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we are ever mindful of our shared history, I believe that 
the friendship between our two countries now rests on our shared 
present. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although your address to parliament today was certainly a very 
special event, Prime Minister, it is but one of the myriad 
contacts taking place today between the United Kingdom and 
Canada.  Not only are our nations regularly involved in formal 
economic, cultural, technological and parliamentary exchanges, we 
also like to stay in touch on a much more basic level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are constantly listening to each other's music, watching each 
other's television programs and visiting one another.  Visits are 
less frequent in the winter.  While I can only assume that “Cool 
Britannia”, as I have heard today's United Kingdom dubbed, is 
more a cultural than climactic commentary, I must applaud your 
hardiness, Prime Minister, in visiting Ottawa in February. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the former president of the Canada—United Kingdom 
Parliamentary Association, I often had the honour to visit 
Westminster, accompanied by many of my colleagues, in order to 
learn more about your parliamentary procedures.  I hope that 
these exchanges will continue in the future. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, please accept my thanks on behalf of all members of 
the House of Commons for having spoken to us today.  We will long 
remember your presence here, and we hope that you will return 
soon for another Canadian visit.  Merci beaucoup.
