	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have two petitions to present this morning.
<P>
	The first petition that I have the duty to present is signed by 
quite a number of constituents from the communities of 
Meadow Lake, Loon Lake, Rapid View, Makwa, St. Walburg, 
and Dorintosh in The Battlefords-Meadow Lake constituency.
<P>
	The petitioners draw to the attention of the House that the 
majority of Canadians are law-abiding citizens who respect the 
law and that the majority of Canadians believe that physicians in 
Canada should be working to save lives, not to end them. 
Therefore the petitioners call on Parliament to act immediately 
to extend protection to the unborn child by amending the 
Criminal Code to extend the same protection enjoyed by born 
human beings to unborn human beings.

	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
The second petition I have today, Mr. Speaker, is signed by 
Canadians who live in the town of Wilkie and the area 
surrounding the town of Wilkie in northwest Saskatchewan in 
The Battlefords-Meadow Lake constituency.
<P>
	The petitioners note that the subject of pornography is a very 
controversial and complicated one, which poses a great threat to 
family life in Canada through negative images of women, men, 
and children, and note that the violent behaviour depicted by 
various media such as killer cards and video games have the 
potential of negatively affecting the attitudes and behaviour of 
children.
<P>
	The petitioners call upon Parliament to take action toward 
ending pornography in all its various forms and call upon 
Parliament to pass legislation that contains clear definitions 
reflecting the advanced technological and rapidly changing 
nature of Canadian society and reflecting local community 
standards of tolerance.

	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 36 I wish to present a petition that 
has been circulating across Canada.
<P>
	This petition originates from the Surrey and Delta regions of 
Canada. The petitioners would like to draw to the attention of 
the House that managing the family home and caring for 
preschool children is an honourable profession, which has not 
been recognized for its value to our society. They also state that 
the Income Tax Act discriminates against families who make the 
choice to provide care in the home for preschool children, the 
disabled, the chronically ill and the aged.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call upon Parliament to 
pursue initiatives to eliminate tax discrimination against 
families who decide to provide care in the home for preschool 
children, the disabled, the chronically ill and the aged.

	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of

Speaker, the following questions will be answered today: Nos. 
137 and 191.
<P>
[<I>Text</I>] 
<P>
Question No. 137-<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>How many full time and part time staff are involved in and what is the total 
cost of administering the current firearms laws and regulations for all of 
Canada and what share of the costs is borne by the three levels of government: 
Federal, Provincial and Municipal?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> 
The federal cost of administering the current firearms control 
program is borne mainly by the Department of Justice Canada 
and the firearms registration and administration section of the 
RCMP. Federal expenditures and the number of staff in 
1993-94, the last completed fiscal year, are shown in the 
following table. The provincial and territorial governments and 
the municipalities should be consulted directly in order to obtain 
their cost information.
<P>
	1. Department of Justice Canada
<P>
	Staff (Full time and term employees)-10
<P>
	Operating budget (including salaries)-$5.7 million
<P>
	Money transferred to provinces-territories pursuant to 
financial agreements-$8.4 million
<P>
	(2) Firearms registration and administration section, RCMP
<P>
	Staff (Full time and term employees)-47
<P>
	Operating budget (including salaries)-$1.4 million
<P>
	Total federal cost-$15.5 million
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>1. This figure includes certain one time only cost. Approximately $2 million 
were invested in the development of the Canadian firearms safety training 
course: a 1.2 million grant to provinces and territories to initially set up their 
safety training program and $1.4 million was spent on the development and 
implementation of the automated system for firearm acquisition certificates 
and accompanying forms.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>2. This amount represents the compensation to provinces and territories for 
1993-94 as per new agreements.</BLOCKQUOTE>
Question No. 191-<B>Mr. Hanger (Calgary Northeast):</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Of all the people travelling in their country of origin and referred by airlines 
to Canadian authorities abroad for the purpose of document verification in 
1994, how many, in each country where such document verification took place, 
were, (<I>a</I>) permanent residents landed in Canada as convention refugees, or (<I>b</I>) 
persons residing in Canada after having made a refugee claim?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Canadian authorities abroad do not 
routinely maintain statistical information on the number of 
persons referred by airline companies for the purpose of 
document verification, although it is true that certain individual 
missions abroad may choose to compile figures in order to audit 
their own workload, where such verifications constitute a 
significant proportion of mission immigration activities.
<P>
	Consequently, the government is not in a position to provide 
country by country figures on the number of referrals involving 
convention refugees or refugee claimants in their countries of 
origin.
<P>
	However, we can say that referrals either involve persons 
whose documents are subsequently found to be inauthentic and 
who are attempting illegal travel to Canada, or involve persons 
about whose documents there are doubts for one reason or 
another but who are later confirmed to be properly documented 
travellers. This latter group includes foreign visitors, foreign 
students, permanent residents and Canadian citizens. While 
some of those who are confirmed to be permanent residents are 
persons who were landed as convention refugees or are persons 
who had earlier made refugee claims, others are persons who 
were landed as independent immigrants, business immigrants or 
members of the family class. In addition, it must be appreciated 
that persons holding Canadian permanent residence documents, 
whatever the category of landing, are also referred for other 
reasons altogether, for example to establish whether following 
an extended absence from Canada they are still entitled to 
Canadian resident status.
<P>
	We have no reason to believe that the numbers of referrals 
involving persons who were landed as refugees or who had 
earlier made refugee claims are in any way disproportionate to 
their share of the overall immigrant movement.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> I note that Question No. 137 stands in the name 
of the hon. member for Yorkton-Melville. I know that he has 
been very anxious to get this reply before consideration of third 
reading of Bill C-68 is complete. I am very pleased that I am 
able to comply with his request and provide the answer today. I 
recognize that it is late, but we wanted a thorough, complete, 
and accurate answer for the hon. member.
<P>
	While I am on my feet, I ask that the remaining questions be 
allowed to stand and I ask for consent to revert to tabling of 
documents for the purpose of tabling answers to certain 
petitions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on 
a point of order. I would like to thank the parliamentary 
secretary for that information. I look forward to receiving it. It 
may be a little late for the debate today, as I see that Bill C-68 is

	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-68, an act 
respecting firearms and other weapons, be read the third time 
and passed.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, this morning we embark on the final 
stage of a process begun over a year ago by which members of 
this House of Commons have studied and debated questions 
dealing not only with the regulation of firearms but questions 
that in a broader sense touch upon the kind of country we want 
for ourselves and for our children.
<P>
	It is little wonder that the debate about firearms has at times 
been spirited, often clamorous, and sometimes divisive. There 
are many voices that want so much to be heard: the farmers, the 
ranchers, who must be permitted to continue to use their 
firearms as the tools of their trade; the hunters and the target 
shooters, whose choice of sport demands our respect; the 
outfitters and the townsfolk whose livelihood depends on the 
success of the hunting season; the sustenance hunter, who feeds 
a family with a firearm; the police, who like all law-abiding 
Canadians want the means to deter, to detect and to punish those 
who would use guns in crime; and Canadians everywhere, who 
want the government to preserve the civil character of our 
society and strengthen the values that have always set us apart as 
a nation, Canadians who have watched the American experience  
with sadness and who want our national government to chart a 
different course for our future.
<P>
<B>(1015 ) </B>
<P>
	I sincerely believe Bill C-68 now before the House has 
fashioned an instrument that will ensure a future in which we 
can preserve those unique Canadian values while respecting the 
legitimate interests to which I referred while also dealing 
effectively with the use of guns in crime.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The government believes that the primary objective of 
regulating firearms should be to ensure that Canada remains a 
peaceful and civilized country. Canadians firmly intend to 
safeguard and strengthen the exceptional civility which has 
always been their hallmark. Our policies attest to this 
government's commitment to this objective.
<P>
	The components of Bill C-68 that we will be focussing on 
today are as follows: firstly, strict measures to counter the 
criminal use of firearms; secondly, specific penalties to punish 
those engaged in the smuggling of firearms; and thirdly, broad 
measures to define what constitutes the lawful use of firearms in 
a manner that poses no threat to public safety.
<P>
	In the case of each component, universal firearms registration 
is a fundamental requirement for achieving the stated 
objectives.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The government has been consistent throughout in its defence 
of Bill C-68 with respect to the core principles of the 
legislation. We have made changes to reflect our response to 
constructive criticism when it has arisen and to respond to well 
founded concerns.
<P>
	May I today express the gratitude I feel toward members of 
the Liberal caucus who have through their efforts reflected 
concerns in their communities and have caused us to make many 
constructive changes to this proposed legislation. May I also 
acknowledge the hard work done by every member of the justice 
committee of the House of Commons. Colleagues from all 
parties in their painstaking work examined clause by clause 
every aspect of this bill and brought their own scrutiny to bear. I 
am very grateful for and admire the work they did.
<P>
	We have made many changes along the way. We have created 
a new Firearms Act to take the process of regulation out of the 
Criminal Code to respond to the concerns of firearms owners. 
We have changed the rules with respect to the use and 
disposition of those firearms that are prohibited either as 
handguns or otherwise so they can be traded within the class of 
existing owners.
<P>
	We have phased in the process of licensing and registration 
over eight years to minimize inconvenience for firearms 
owners. We have changed the nature and effect of the penalty for 
the first time a person inadvertently fails to register a firearm 
under the scheme. That will only become compulsory in 2003.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13686"> 13686 </A></B>
<P>
	We have changed the inspection powers to respond to those 
who saw room for abuse. We have provided for relics and 
heirlooms to be passed down from generation to generation and 
kept in families for their sentimental or historical value.
<P>
	The core principles of this legislation have remained 
constant: stiff criminal penalties for those who would use guns 
in crime; the longest mandatory minimum penitentiary terms in 
the Criminal Code for those who use guns in any one of 10 listed 
serious crimes; cracking down on smuggling by reinvigorating 
our efforts at the border, by investing in means to reduce 
smuggled firearms coming into this country; taking handguns 
out of circulation that have no place in legitimate sports and 
target shooting; providing for renewable licences for those who 
own firearms; and the mandatory universal registration of all 
firearms. We have done this so that as a nation we might have 
some meaningful control over guns while respecting the 
legitimate uses of firearms for traditional purposes.
<P>
<B>(1020 ) </B>
<P>
	It is the registration of firearms which has attracted the most 
intense controversy. Many criticisms have been levelled, 
unfortunately too often without foundation in fact. It is said that 
before we proceed with such a measure the government must 
satisfy a heavy onus of proving beyond a shadow of a doubt that 
mandatory universal registration will reduce the crime rate, that 
we must establish how many lives will be saved by such a 
measure.
<P>
	I reject that false premise. I say it applies no more to this 
proposal than to any other. The government has by the evidence 
it has proffered to the committee, to the Commons and to the 
public, met any reasonable standard of proof required to justify 
legislation which would regulate the conduct of human affairs.
<P>
	We tender the evidence of the chiefs of police. We rely upon 
the views and the opinions of the Canadian Police Association. 
We put forward the convictions of the Canadian Association of 
Police Boards. We stand with the victims of violence who have 
lost family members to crime. We stand with the physicians in 
the emergency rooms of this nation, with the trauma doctors, 
with suicide therapists, all of whom contend with one voice that 
mandatory universal registration of all firearms is nothing more 
than common sense in the regulation of property in this country.
<P>
	There are those who attack the concept of mandatory 
universal registration by trafficking in fictions, and those 
fictions must be addressed. It is said that registration means 
nothing because criminals will not register to which I respond: 
That is the very point. Criminals will not register and by that act 
will identify themselves. When universal mandatory 
registration is fully in place as a seamless system for the 
registration of firearms, the criminals will be identified by 
exception.
<P>
	I refer to an anecdote described to me by my colleague, the 
hon. member for Waterloo. He spoke last  week in his riding 
about an incident where police entered a place on a raid because 
they had reasonable grounds to believe there was criminal 
activity going on inside. They found long arms and they were 
unable to tell whether those long arms were possessed 
unlawfully or whether they were lawfully in the possession of 
the people who were arrested. With registration the authorities 
will have the means to determine just that.
<P>
	I call to mind the jury in the inquest into the death of Jonathon 
Yeo who was implicated in the shooting death of Nina de 
Villiers, the young woman whose life was tragically taken in her 
youth by crime. At inquest the jury heard months of testimony 
about those events. Among its many recommendations for 
strengthening the system to prevent such tragedies in the future, 
that jury recommended the mandatory registration of all 
firearms including rifles and shotguns.
<P>
	While they are trafficking in fictions, those who oppose 
registration contend this is an effort to solve an urban concern 
about crime on the backs of the rural part of Canada. I point out 
that time after time it has been shown that the fatality and injury 
rates from firearms are significantly higher in rural areas in this 
country than they are in the cities.
<P>
	The majority of the people in this country, when they die by 
firearms, die at the hands of someone they know. 
Preponderantly firearms are used as the weapon of choice when 
there is death in the context of domestic violence. On average a 
woman is shot to death every six days in this country, almost 
always in her home, almost always by someone she knows, 
almost always with a legally owned rifle or shotgun.
<P>
	What has that to do with registration? The police tell us that 
with a mandatory system of universal registration in place over 
time they will have the means to enforce court prohibition 
orders made against people who have shown a propensity for 
violence. Lives will be saved if those guns are collected in that 
kind of situation.
<P>
<B>(1025 ) </B>
<P>
	Those who would oppose this system traffic in fictions by 
pretending that the cost is an impediment. They throw around 
numbers like $1.5 billion to establish the system, $100 or $300 
per rifle to register. They are trafficking in fictions.
<P>
	Someone on the west coast did a study for the Fraser Institute 
pretending that the cost of registration would be $1.5 billion 
because the cost to register a handgun under the existing system 
is on average $82. Factoring in the present antiquated system 
and individual police inquiries about the background of the 
applicant, it works out to $82 per handgun on average.
<P>
	That person has taken that number and applied it directly to 
the six or seven million long arms in the inventory existing in 
Canada today. However, he has overlooked the fact that in the 
registration of the existing inventory of long arms we are going 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13687"> 13687 </A></B>
<P>
to ask only that the owners mail in a card to identify themselves 
and their  firearms. There will be a simple CPIC check to ensure 
that there is no order prohibiting the owner from having firearms 
and then he or she will be licensed and registered. This will cost 
nothing like the $82 which this man pretends is going to be the 
cost of registration in Canada. This is trafficking in fictions and 
not meeting the point on the merits.
<P>
	It is also said by those who oppose registration that the system 
has been tried in New Zealand, Australia and elsewhere and has 
been found not to work. That is not so.
<P>
	In New Zealand the registration system was established in 
1920. It was carried out through handwritten cards. It was 
abandoned in the early 1980s when the volume overwhelmed the 
system. In any event, New Zealand does not sit on the border of 
the world's most gun preoccupied country. It does not have to 
deal with the challenges we face in Canada. The system in New 
Zealand was rejected for reasons that have nothing to do with the 
merits of the argument in Canada.
<P>
	As for Australia, five of the eight states and territories have 
mandatory registration of long arms now. In 1990 a national 
committee on violence recommended it be extended to the 
whole of the country. Those are the facts. It is time we stopped 
trafficking in fictions.
<P>
	Testimony before the House justice committee established 
that in those European countries where mandatory registration 
of all firearms is in place, the accident, injury and death rate 
from firearms is lower compared to countries where that is not 
the policy.
<P>
	As to confiscation, those who oppose registration allege that 
it is the first step to confiscation. To them I respond that in 1940 
the government of this country introduced mandatory 
registration of rifles and shotguns as part of the war effort. There 
was compliance and no confiscation. To those persons I say that 
in 1977 when the present system of firearms acquisition 
certificates was introduced, the voices again were raised that 
confiscation would be the inevitable result, but there was no 
confiscation. This is the position of the people who have run out 
of real arguments against gun control. They are trafficking in 
fictions.
<P>
	I would like to spend just a moment on those who have made 
themselves conspicuous in this House by their opposition to this 
bill. I speak of course about members of the third party. I bear in 
mind as I do so that the third party came into this House 18 
months ago as the party of the people insisting that the positions 
its members took, the policies they supported and the views they 
expressed would reflect the values and views of Canadians in 
general.
<P>
	I well recall the days sitting in this place when hon. members 
of the third party would rise in question period to put questions 
that were inspired by members of the public. They wanted so 
much to reflect the views of Canadians in the work they did in 
this House of Commons.
<P>
	Some of the members of the third party have stuck to those 
principles and are going to stick with them. They are going to 
vote for this bill because they know the majority of the people in 
their riding support it. To those members I offer my 
congratulations for their consistency in their principles.
<P>
	However, the third party, the party of the people, the party of 
law and order, the leader of this third party and the majority of 
its members have said they will vote against this bill and against 
what the majority of Canadians want. As recently as two weeks 
ago a poll showed that 74 per cent of the people in British 
Columbia, 58 per cent of the people in Alberta, and 72 per cent 
of the people in Ontario support registration. Two weeks ago an 
Angus Reid poll demonstrated consistently that the people of 
Canada want Parliament to pass the legislation.

<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> I call on the third party to stand with the 
government, with the police, with the emergency room 
physicians, with the victims of crime, and support this bill in the 
name of the people of Canada.

	Mr. Speaker, today we have the opportunity, on behalf of the 
Parliament of Canada, to speak out on the kind of Canada we 
want for ourselves and for our children and on the efforts that we 
are prepared to make to preserve the peaceful and civilized 
country in which we take pride, and to show just who exactly 
controls firearms in Canada. Is it the groups who support 
firearms or Canadians in general?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Today, June 13, I have two little boys who are turning eight 
years old. They join with their 10-year old sister in wanting to 
grow up in the kind of country we enjoyed in our youth, a 
country that is safe, a country that is civil. Those qualities can 
slip away so easily. They slip away incrementally over time. 
They require constant reaffirmation of our basic principles as a 
nation if we are going to keep that unique quality that sets us 
apart. We must always focus on what is the predominant value 
for Canadians.
<P>
	In Bill C-68 we have just such an opportunity to focus on 
those values. The bill is respectful of the legitimate interests of 
those who use firearms, but its predominant purpose is to 
preserve what is uniquely ours. My children, all of our children 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13688"> 13688 </A></B>
<P>
and our grandchildren deserve nothing less for their future in 
Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is not every day that a bill before the House 
generates the kind of public debate that we have seen in the past 
few months, a debate that will end with the vote scheduled for 
the end of our proceedings today.
<P>
	This bill has prompted a public debate because it brings into 
focus the values that we hold as a society. Before I go any 
further, let me say-and I am certain there will be no 
disagreement-that our society is undergoing rapid change, and 
not always the kind of change we want to see. Violence is on the 
rise.
<P>
	This debate is taking place because we are cognizant of the 
fact that danger threatens our society at every turn. Danger is not 
a problem found only in cities. It affects people everywhere. It is 
a problem observed not only here in this country, it also touches 
our neighbours and friends to the south. In the United States, 
increasing social problems have led to an upsurge in violence 
and we are now beginning to witness the same phenomenon 
here. This is not a trivial matter that we are discussing, nor 
something that should leave us indifferent. It is an extremely 
important issue, both for the present and for the future.
<P>
	Violence can manifest itself in many ways. The use of 
firearms is not the only factor associated with violence. Very 
serious social problems can lead to a sense of frustration which 
in turn, can breed various forms of violence. Psychological, 
domestic, personal and community problems can all lead to the 
use, among other things, of firearms.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	However, there is nothing trivial about firearms. They 
represent one of the most significant ways of manifesting the 
violence to which I alluded. I think we would all agree on this, 
regardless of the party to which we belong, that a society such as 
ours which claims to be reasonable, vigilant and civilized, has a 
responsibility to ensure that the use of firearms is better 
controlled.
<P>
	So far, so good. I do not believe that even our friends in the 
Reform Party would oppose legislation that gives the state the 
ability to control violence and to intervene to stop its spread. If 
they would oppose it, I am certain that they will let us know. In 
any event, I would be surprised if the Reform Party opposed 
some control over firearms, given the social context. In a society 
such as ours, it is essential that the state be allowed to step in and 
assume its responsibilities in the area of gun control.
<P>
	The bill now before us is a reflection of the government's 
vision of gun control. What course of action is the government 
advocating? The key feature of its proposed legislation is 
firearms registration. Many of the bill's provisions relate to 
registration. Some reforms were introduced in 1992, primarily 
to ban certain types of assault, prohibited and military weapons. 
Some administrative controls regarding storage and so forth  
were also introduced. This series of reforms will complete the 
cycle of government action in this field. The central element of 
the reform is the universal registration of all firearms, 
essentially those used for target shooting, hunting and so forth, 
since other kinds of weapons are already prohibited.
<P>
	The debate has, without a doubt, been controversial, since 
very opposite views have been voiced. I do not think that we can 
accuse anyone of failing to understand the validity of the other 
party's arguments. Clearly, we are dealing with a clash of two 
different value systems. On the one hand, we have an 
overwhelming majority of citizens who are concerned about 
violence in society and recognize the need to control guns, one 
of the instruments used to commit violence. On the other hand, 
we have those who perceive the intervention of the state and 
additional restrictions as an unnecessary attack on individual 
freedoms.
<P>
	We cannot dismiss the reaction of the second group lightly. 
Honest citizens own firearms. The fact that they own guns does 
not make them any less honest. I would even venture to say that 
the vast majority, if not virtually all, of the citizens who own 
guns, who use them for sporting purposes and who have done so 
for generations, are upstanding citizens. The introduction of 
these measures has made them somewhat uneasy. They are upset 
to see the state interfere once again in their affairs and this has a 
great deal to do with their attitudes.
<P>
	Although this country has existed for several hundred years, 
ours is still a young society, still close to its roots, to the time 
when vast territories had to be conquered and people had to 
tame, colonize and settle this vast land. Obstacles had to be 
overcome. Wild animals roamed the landscape and people 
needed to defend themselves. Trapping and hunting were 
important survival tools.
<P>
	It is well known that beaver trapping was a very important 
activity in Canada. It was the basis of the country's economy. In 
other words, the country's origins are closely linked with 
firearms. To many, firearms symbolized-and I would imagine 
this still holds true today-freedom and man's dominance over 
an often hostile environment. The issue speaks to 
long-standing, profound values. Then there is the issue of 
hunting. The hunting instinct is one of the first known to man. 
Had men and women not been hunters, humankind as we know it 
would not have survived to this day.
<P>
	Therefore, this issue is complex and it is understandable that 
the debate has been controversial and quite emotional. Another 
reason why opponents have reacted so negatively and have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13689"> 13689 </A></B>
<P>
expressed outrage from the moment the bill was tabled in the 
House is because the state has already intervened a great deal.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	Individual freedoms have already been restricted 
considerably by the administrative and bureaucratic actions of 
the state, so much so that many citizens are quite fed up with 
what they view as government harassment and red tape.
<P>
	Some dream of returning to the free, somewhat bucolic 
society of yesteryear in reaction to the excessively large public 
service and the systems and networks springing up everywhere. 
The bureaucracy has exploded, particularly in the last 20 years. 
People are very leery about more government intervention, 
particulary now when they feel that their civil liberties are been 
affected.
<P>
	Moreover, many people live on large tracts of land or own 
farms. That was true of my ancestors and of my father. I myself 
was born on a farm. These people accept that there is a 
government, a country and law enforcement agencies, but their 
farm is their domain. When they are at home on their farm, they 
cannot fathom that someone should be able to interfere and 
restrict in any way their right to do whatever they want on their 
own property, their right to use firearms to hunt and so forth.
<P>
	Along comes this bill which challenges long-standing beliefs 
and deep-seated cultural reflexes.
<P>
	Here we must appeal to reason. It is alright for those who 
oppose the bill to say so. While the vast majority of people 
support the bill, the Bloc Quebecois included, we must try to 
convince those who are against it, particularly the hunters who 
are directly affected by its provisions. We must try to convince 
them to accept the government's intervention in this area for the 
sake of higher principles. The citizens of this country are all 
reasonable people and they will reflect upon this and 
understand. However, it still comes as a cultural shock.
<P>
	When the use of seat belts in automobiles became mandatory, 
I remember clearly my reaction to this announcement. I was a 
young man at the time, driving my first automobile. All of a 
sudden, I was required to buckle up. As a young man, owning my 
first car symbolized freedom. Everyone remembers how 
important their first car was, what colour it was, how much it 
cost, and so forth. Not everyone was pleased, myself included, 
to see the government legislate seat-belt use.
<P>
	However, I had to learn to live with the law. I have to admit 
that occasionally, in a moment of weakness, I neglected to 
buckle up. However, I have been using my seat belt for many 
years now and it has now become a part of our everyday habits.
<P>
	This decision was initially viewed and dismissed by many 
people as government interference. Over time, seat belt use was 
accepted because it was proven to be in the common interest. 
Large fines were also imposed.
<P>
	The same will be true for firearms registration. Registration 
as such is not something new. People are accustomed to 
registering their automobiles, their bicycles, even their dogs. 
They may not have been too pleased the first time that had to get 
a license for their bicycle-imagine, a teenager having to get a 
license for his bicycle-but they accepted it.
<P>
	People have come to accept many things because it is in the 
common interest and I am confident that this is one such issue. I 
am confident that the government will work hard to convince 
people to go along with registration. I have no doubt that the 
minister, who is an intelligent individual with a good 
understanding of society, will see to it that these measures are 
implemented properly, by appealing to people's sense of reason, 
not by using a strong-arm approach. I am confident that he will 
proceed in a civilized fashion and be respectful of individuals 
who have different opinions.
<P>
	Registration may well be a bother, but fundamentally, this is 
not a transcendental debate. There are no fundamental 
principles at issue. The resulting inconveniences will be very 
minor. After all, people will only be required to register the 
firearms they own once in their lifetime. Only once! 
Furthermore, the process will only begin in three years' time. 
Therefore, we have three years to think about this, three years to 
discuss the matter, three years to calm down, three years to 
analyse the situation, listen to others and try to understand the 
reasons behind this decision. Once the process begins, people 
will have five years to register their firearms.
<P>
	In my opinion, this will facilitate the implementation of the 
legislation and give people time to accept psychologically these 
measures.
<P>
	Having said this, I do not believe and our party does not 
believe that the bill is perfect. On the contrary, we would have 
preferred something different.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	We would have liked to have greater power of persuasion over 
the minister, in order to make changes we thought were required. 
However, I must acknowledge that some changes we requested 
were accepted.
<P>
	We in the Bloc Quebecois tried not to address the issue from 
an ideological point of view, not to make it a debate on principle 
or a debate on religion because, in religion, everyone is right and 
everyone is wrong. We tried to address it from a pragmatic point 
of view and to make a party contribution, through the 
parliamentary process, to bringing in a balanced piece of 
legislation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13690"> 13690 </A></B>
<P>
	We are in agreement with government intervention, and with 
registration, and we wanted-or at least we tried-to bring a 
certain balance to the bill tabled by the government.
<P>
	We were successful with some amendments, including one 
essential matter, one essential aspect of the bill: 
decriminalization. We think this aspect is important, because it 
is essential that good citizens, the vast majority of hunters, for 
example, not have the perception that the law lumps them 
together with criminals.
<P>
	It is important for honest citizens to be sure that the 
government does not treat them like criminals, and that hunting 
and using firearms for sports activities do not make them 
criminals or people who are reprehensible in the eyes of the 
government or of society. This is a fundamental right which, to 
this extent, must be respected.
<P>
	That is why we thought the government had to be persuaded to 
make a distinction between people who use firearms to commit 
crimes and people who use them to behave like normal citizens, 
for sports like hunting. That is where we got the idea of not 
making failure to register a firearm, in the case of a first offence, 
a crime as such. We have never claimed that there should be no 
penalties. We have never claimed that there be no sanctions, that 
the first offence of failing to register a hunting firearm, for 
example, should not make someone liable to punishment. That 
act had to remain something against the law, a reprehensible act 
to be punished under criminal law. But there is quite a 
distinction between criminalizing and penalizing that has not 
always gotten through to the public.
<P>
	We would have liked the first offence, someone who fails to 
register for the first time, to be prosecuted-that is summary 
conviction procedure-and convicted if guilty, but fined. We 
would have wanted a first offence not to be a crime within the 
strict meaning of the Criminal Code, but to lead to a 
considerable fine, say, from $500 to $1,250, confiscation of the 
firearm, and a requirement to register it within seven days: 
briefly, something reasonable and severe-quite severe-, but 
something that indicated this distinction between a crime as 
such and an offence to be penalized.
<P>
	The government did not accept the Bloc Quebecois vision but, 
on the other hand, it did take a step in the right direction. It made 
a first offence a new, special offence, ensuring that people will 
be prosecuted under a statute and not under the Criminal Code; 
the summary conviction procedure will be used, but the first 
offence will not be a crime as such-although it is not clear what 
will happen with the criminal record. There will not be a 
criminal record in the traditional sense, but it does seem that 
there will be a register in which offences, even first offences, 
will be noted. Still, this flexibility is welcome, since I believe it 
will also give the Crown an option when prosecuting. If a person 
who has not registered a firearm is a habitual criminal, it is not 
the same thing as if the person were an ordinary hunter; the 
Crown can prosecute under another statute. There is discretion 
that could make it possible to eliminate the aspect we criticized.
<P>
	Another amendment we proposed has to do with that 
prohibition on a person who wanted to obtain a firearm licence, 
if the person was an associate of some other person prohibited 
from possessing firearms. There, the problem with the initial 
bill was quite far-reaching, since it had to do with association.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	Basically, it was a problem of guilt by association. As soon as 
you were ``an associate''-as defined, an extremely vague, very 
elastic expression that could have led to witch hunts-of a 
person who had been prohibited from possessing firearms, you 
could be prohibited from owning them as well.
<P>
	So, what we proposed was to keep the expression ``an 
associate'', of course, but to specify an associate living under 
the same roof. If you live in a house where someone prohibited 
from possessing firearms lives, it would be rather stupid and 
irresponsible for you to be given a firearm, when the other 
person living there, in the same house, could have practically 
the same access to the firearm as you do-even though 
elsewhere the bill prohibits that person from possessing 
firearms. The government accepted this amendment.
<P>
	By means of amendments we proposed two days before the 
government's amendments, we also persuaded the government 
that there should be a grandfather clause, that is, a clause 
recognizing firearms handling courses people have already 
taken. We know that Quebec in particular has had a system of 
firearms handling courses, as a prerequisite for firearms 
licences, for quite some time now. So these courses that people 
had taken had to be recognized. We must not require people who 
have already taken courses in Quebec-very well-designed 
courses, by the way-to take them again. So the federal 
government agreed to recognize these courses and not require 
people to take them again under the bill.
<P>
	We also requested an amendment to tighten up the bill in order 
to limit the government's former discretion to make regulations 
allowing the purchase of non-prohibited ammunition starting in 
the year 2001, during the transition period. The government 
agreed to tighten up the bill and make those regulations much 
stricter.
<P>
	Another aspect to which we drew the government's attention 
was the power of inspection contained in the first version of the 
bill. We were not the only ones to make this point; in our society 
and in all regions, a great many worries and complaints were 
expressed about the excessive extent of the power the bill 
conferred on police officers: they were given practically the 
power to search and seize, without being required to follow the 
procedures that limit the action they take in other  situations, 
such as the requirement to obtain from a judge a warrant citing a 
reasonable ground for carrying out a search. Now, in the bill, no 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13691"> 13691 </A></B>
<P>
warrant is required, but police officers' power is limited to 
places other than dwelling-houses, strictly to places where there 
is reason to believe that there are 10 or more firearms, and the 
ground must be a reasonable ground, not just an opinion a police 
officer might have before taking action.
<P>
	But there are other amendments with which we were not 
successful. We regret that, although those amendments are not 
as significant; the issue of fees is an example. We would have 
liked the government to provide a legal control, a guarantee of 
its political commitment to act reasonably and not raise fees 
unduly. We therefore proposed an amendment adding to the bill 
a mechanism limiting increases to registration fees. We know 
that the government is in power and we know the present 
minister's intentions; but there are the public service, the 
apparatus of government, circumstances and changes in the 
situation. In five years, who is to say that a deputy minister will 
not convince a minister to double registration fees? There is no 
legal guarantee. We would have liked there to be one in the bill. 
The minister is showing the best of intentions. We hope they will 
be repeated, but we really would have liked there to be this kind 
of control; one possible way of providing it would have been, 
say, to index changes in registration fees to the consumer price 
index. But the government did not want any such hindrances, 
and we regret that that was the case.
<P>
	We also proposed something we think made a lot of sense: a 
requirement to lock, to install a locking mechanism on, any 
firearm manufactured or sold in Canada, so that if you are a 
hunter and you show up in a firearms store to buy a .12 or a .20 or 
a .22 rifle, you will automatically be sold a firearm on which a 
locking mechanism has already been installed, for greater 
safety. We hear that there is nearly consensus on this point, and 
that even many organizations representing hunters agreed with 
it. The government did not agree to this request, and we wonder 
why not. Would the manufacturers' lobby have been that 
powerful? We do not know. It would have been advisable for this 
amendment to be accepted, but it was not.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	We consider that another aspect of the bill raises an issue of 
principle, a much more important one: the legality of law 
enforcement. By means of this bill, the government is giving 
itself an arbitrary power to make regulations that would allow it, 
for example, to exempt aboriginal people from respecting the 
bill and from the constraints the bill imposes on other citizens.
<P>
	I am not saying that the government will avail itself of that 
power and exempt aboriginal people but, since the bill includes 
express mention of this point, we fear that inequitable treatment 
of citizens under the same law will  be set up. It would be a real 
shame, and terribly irresponsible, to do that.
<P>
	I do not see how aboriginal people are threatened by the 
enforcement of this bill. If the bill is acceptable for other 
citizens, it is acceptable for them, too; they, too, have the right 
to ensure their safety. The problems of violence exist in their 
communities, as they do in ours. I do not see how the 
government can give itself that power. Why is the government 
giving itself that power?
<P>
	That point makes me think-in a much less significant 
vein-of the debate that took place during the referendum on the 
Charlottetown Accord, when it looked as though the Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms would not apply in aboriginal 
communities. I remember that even Mr. Trudeau-on that point 
alone, I must admit-agreed with the Quebec sovereignists who 
were saying that made no sense.
<P>
	We agreed that, under the rule of law, as is the case in Canada, 
where we favour law enforcement that is equal for everyone, 
there simply had to be equitable treatment of all citizens, and 
that it was inconceivable that we could accept that outrageous, 
incredible, irresponsible concession made by Mr. Clark and Mr. 
Rae in particular, excluding aboriginal people from the 
application of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. We have 
somewhat the same thing here.
<P>
	If this bill is so important, if it is so deeply rooted in respect 
for citizens' rights and obligations, why would aboriginal 
people be exempted from its enforcement? We were not 
successful on this point, but we do count on the government, and 
on the minister, to reassure us and tell us that citizens will be 
equal under this bill, as they are under any law, as is appropriate 
in any democracy.
<P>
	Lastly, we would have liked to have another amendment 
passed, and we are very worried that it was turned down. We are 
really upset about that amendment; it raised considerable debate 
within the Bloc Quebecois. People in caucus took very strong 
positions on this point, and we understand them. This point is 
the requirement that any court impose a minimum four-year 
sentence on any offender who commits a crime with a firearm: a 
four-year minimum.
<P>
	I consider that the minister has lapsed into political 
correctness and let himself be swept along by the lobbies that 
have sometimes gone too far. We are going to vote for the bill, 
but we, too, have been buffeted by headwinds. Outrageous 
things have been said by both lobbies. The pro-gun control 
lobby itself has sometimes gone too far.
<P>
	I feel that, in this instance, the minister may not have 
maintained a balance. I feel that the minister should have 
resisted those excessive pressures, which are not at all 
progressive, which will fill up the penitentiaries with 
18-year-olds with no chance of rehabilitation and, further, 
which will introduce inequity and disparity in sentencing.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13692"> 13692 </A></B>
<P>
	Let us take the example of an 18-year old committing his first 
offence. We do not know what incites an 18-year old to hold up a 
corner store-we are not justifying it, it is completely 
unacceptable, serious things happen in those situations-but we 
do know that often these young people are grappling with drug 
problems, are in withdrawal, are in fact very well brought up-it 
happens everywhere-; for the first time in his life he goes and 
uses a firearm to hold up a corner store, and automatically gets 
four years in prison.
<P>
	There is no possibility of the judge looking into the case, 
making distinctions, taking circumstances into account, or 
trying to give that young man a chance. When you are 18, you 
can be rehabilitated after a first offence and become a very good 
citizen. But with this bill, I tell you, I hesitated before taking a 
position. I deeply regret that the minister, who appears to be 
progressive in all respects, has made this abusive lapse, which 
will mean automatic prison sentences.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	Incarceration becomes the only means of rehabilitating young 
offenders, of reintegrating them in society. That is serious. That 
smacks of a philosophical conception which worries me a lot. I 
am surprised that the gun control lobby would have steered the 
minister in that direction. I am truly astonished because I 
believe that the forces which impel us to adopt this bill are 
progressive forces, but not in this case. In this case, there is 
something absolutely deplorable and senseless, there are things 
that defy comprehension.
<P>
	For example, if a sharp 12-inch dagger is held to the throat of 
a convenience store clerk to commit the same crime, the 
offender will get the minimum, not four years. I do not see the 
difference between a dagger and a gun-the clerk might not 
have his throat cut. It is the same thing with rape. These are 
dreadful acts. What is the difference between using a dagger or a 
gun to commit rape on a young woman? The two acts are 
absolutely abominable. And yet, in one case, it will be four 
years, automatically, and in the other not.
<P>
	It seems to me that the minister in charge of developing the 
Criminal Code could have had a common sense reflex. It is not 
too late, by the way. I sincerely believe that this is something 
that should be fixed.

	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> I know that opponents have their arguments, I 
have heard them many a time. All members of this House have 
been submitted to intense discussions with the lobbyists, but I 
do not think a bill has ever been better scrutinized, analyzed in 
such depth.
<P>
	I know the arguments, for example those of the lobbyists. The 
arguments of those who oppose this bill are not all ridiculous, 
but I believe they can be refuted. For example, there are those 
who say that it makes no difference whether firearms are 
registered or not because criminals are not forced to use a 
registered gun to commit their crime. But there are criminals 
who can use  registered guns too. A sawed off twelve-gauge 
shotgun becomes an extraordinary assault weapon. If the 
weapon is registered, it is that much easier for the police to 
conduct their investigation.
<P>
	Do not tell me that police will not be helped by the fact that 
weapons are registered, that the owner can be identified, that his 
name can be instantly retrieved in the central registry, in the 
computer. This will obviously be a powerful tool in the hands of 
the police when investigating crimes committed with registered 
weapons.
<P>
	Unregistered weapons are already banned. It is just a matter of 
putting in place the means of stopping the illegal importation 
and sale of prohibited weapons in Canada. To the extent that 
there are millions of legal firearms, let them be registered. And 
if, as happens so often, they are used to commit crimes, their 
registration will greatly increase the effectiveness of police 
investigations. That argument does not hold water.
<P>
	All the more so since habitual criminals are not the only ones 
who commit violent crimes with firearms. We all know that in 
the case of family violence, acts of desperation, etc., legal 
weapons are used most often, weapons that are found in the 
house. Some will say that it makes no difference whether they 
are registered or not.
<P>
	I believe that registration will have an extremely important 
educational value. If, after this great public debate, the bill is 
passed, there will be an immediate result in that people will no 
longer be able to take firearms for granted, to treat them as if 
they were commonplace objects like a slingshot. The attitudes 
toward weapons will not be the same, the perceptions will be 
quite different. People will know that the State treats weapons as 
dangerous instruments.
<P>
	Indeed, contrary to cars and bicycles, for example, weapons 
are made to kill. Except for the few of us who practise shooting 
as a sport, a firearm, if we keep one at home, is used essentially 
to go hunting, to kill and it is very efficient at that. It is 
practically the most efficient way to kill.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	One must realize that a firearm-and people will become 
more conscious of this fact, especially if they have to register 
it-is not an ordinary household object but a dangerous weapon 
which can easily be used to commit a crime or a violent act.
<P>
	It is therefore false to say that ragistration will accomplish 
nothing. Indeed, if such was the case, then why did the powerful 
lobbies make so much noise? We also heard about costs which 
would be too high. We have here estimates provided by the 
minister. There is no reason to question them or to doubt that the 
minister and his department did their job carefully. The numbers 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13693"> 13693 </A></B>
<P>
might vary slightly, since mistakes are always possible. But we 
are talking here of an average of $24 million a year over five 
years, for a five-year total of about $119-120 million. Once the 
registration system is in place and rolling, it will obviously cost 
less to manage.
<P>
	Yes, it will cost, but its price does not seem disproportionate 
to its significance for society, compared to other initiatives 
which cost much more and amount to very little. Moreover, I 
was always a bit surprised by the intense opposition, given the 
benefits for individuals. Let us think about what this act means 
to an individual, a citizen, for someone who, for instance, goes 
hunting once a year or keeps three or four firearms at home, 
maybe a .12, .22 or .20 caliber shotgun. This worried citizen, 
perhaps made anxious by all the commotion raised by the 
lobbies, should know what will happen, what this act means.
<P>
	If the act were passed tonight, what changes does it entail for 
this person who keeps three firearms at home? There will be 
absolutely no changes for three years, nothing in 1995, 1996 or 
1997, right up to 1998. Then, starting in 1998, that person will 
have five years to register up to 10 arms all at once, for $10. Now 
tell me, is it worth putting a country to fire and the sword? There 
has been much exaggeration. Canadian citizens are used to 
dealing with much bigger complexities and to co-operate much 
more with government. This is not a case of undue harassment. 
This is within reasonable limits, in my estimation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This debate has pitted people against each other in good faith. 
Without that, very important principles were at stake, collective 
principles: the need to address the issue of violence in Canada 
and in Quebec and, on the other hand, the propensity to protect 
individual rights. Those are very legitimate questions. All those 
people are very honourable people and they defend and protect 
quite legitimate values.
<P>
	We have to make a judgment, an assessment of those values. 
In last resort when we think it over calmly and quietly as good 
citizens, we will have to conclude that it is the right law, the 
right move to make. It is not the best law. Many things could 
have been done to improve it. We tried. We succeeded in certain 
cases; we did not succeed all the time. On the whole there is a 
balance. If we want to protect our society against the rise in 
violence we have to do something like that.
<P>
	For private citizens the negative effects will not be very great. 
It means that an individual who has three, four, five or ten 
hunting rifles at home will have nothing to do for the next three 
years. Starting in 1998 he will have to think about the fact that he 
will have to register his arms. He will have five years to do it 
from 1998. Once it is done it will be for life and it will cost $10.
<P>
	I do not think there is a need for the kind of debate that we 
have on many other issues in Canada. There will be a much 
harsher debate this fall. It would be good practice now to accept 
this as a reasonable question to settle before addressing much 
more important questions.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is not entirely satisfied with the act, but 
its members believe that respect is a matter of striking the right 
social balance and that, in the common interest, they must vote 
in favour of the act. This is what we intend to do tonight.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we sat here 
until eleven o'clock last night and voted on the final 
amendments to Bill C-68. In less than 24 hours we are into our 
final debate, third reading of the bill. It did not really give us 
much time to assess the consequences of the amendments which 
are now part of the bill. It reminds me a little of what happened 
in the clause by clause amendments that were hurried upon us 
with such short notice after the final witnesses before the 
committee had concluded.
<P>
	I begin my address by telling the House and the justice 
minister of a firearms court case that was heard in Alberta. The 
judge was a man by the name of Judge Demetrick. In his 
decision he said that the definition of a firearm as contained 
presently in the Criminal Code was so convoluted as to be legal 
fiction and twice removed from reality. When I read that I was 
absolutely amazed that the Parliament of Canada was producing 
legislation that our courts are now declaring to be twice 
removed from reality. I am satisfied that we cannot have 
legislation that is twice removed from reality unless we have 
thinking behind the legislation that is twice removed from 
reality as well.
<P>
	The present gun control bill is really not a gun control bill at 
all. It is not going to control guns; it is simply going to register 
them. When I looked at the bill I realized that it was not an 
aberration from the good sound thinking that has run the country 
for the last 25 years. It is not unlike Judge Demetrick pointed 
out. What has been guiding the country for the last 25 years? 
When we examine the debt, the Young Offenders Act, the parole 
system or the judicial system, and some of the disparities in 
those systems we wonder whether or not the thinking behind 
them is twice removed from reality.
<P>
	How can we be in a situation where we are $600 billion in debt 
if the thinking behind our fiscal and monetary policy is not twice 
removed from reality? How can we have a Young Offenders Act 
when the justice system cannot deal with young offenders under 
the age of 12 for their criminal misconduct? How can we have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13694"> 13694 </A></B>
<P>
that unless the thinking of the creators of the legislation is 
completely removed from reality and the people it will impact?
<P>
	Let us look at the parole system, the latest victim of which is 
Melanie Carpenter. The prime suspect in her murder, Mr. Auger, 
was paroled, was released, by way of statutory requirement after 
serving only two-thirds of his sentence, even though the 
officials felt that it would be a danger to release the individual 
into society. We have to ask what kind of thinking has produced 
that kind of legislation. Judge Demetrick told me a bit about that 
kind of thinking when he suggested that it was twice removed 
from reality.
<P>
<B>(1115 ) </B>
<P>
	This bill is not an aberration from the reasoning that has 
guided Parliament over the last 20 or 25 years. It is simply a 
continuation of thinking that is far removed from the impact it 
will have on the people. I often think the justice minister and his 
officials do not know what they are doing.
<P>
	It is an attempt by the government to create the impression it 
is getting tough on crime and criminals. Yet when the justice 
minister had an opportunity to vote either for a safer society or 
against first degree murderers when a private member's bill 
came up to eliminate section 745 from the Criminal Code, 
everyone knows he voted in favour of the first degree murderer 
and against a safer society, in favour of the first degree murderer 
and against the Melanie Carpenters of this country. We should 
study carefully the motivation behind this legislation.
<P>
	We have heard the minister speak today of things such as 
trafficking in fiction. I have the talking points sent from the 
Prime Minister's office to members of the Liberal Party on Bill 
C-68. The first item reads: ``The government has reached an 
agreement with the official opposition to allocate time for 
debate on Bill C-68, gun control, and Bill C-41, sentencing''. Is 
that not nice? They got together and decided to terminate any 
lengthy debate that would give an opportunity to all members to 
express the concerns of their constituents on these two very 
contentious bills.
<P>
	The second item says: ``Any reasonable person would have to 
agree that there has been extensive consultation and debate on 
this legislation''. Let us examine this whole business of 
consultation for a moment and see who is trafficking in fiction.
<P>
	In response to questions in the House the justice minister 
stated that he had been in continuous consultation with the 
attorneys general of the provinces. That has been directly 
refuted by the testimony of the attorneys general who appeared 
before the standing committee. In particular, I refer to the 
Attorney General of Manitoba. When we asked her, she 
commented that there was extremely little consultation with the 
justice minister and officials on the gun control legislation.
<P>
	We heard from the Attorney General of Alberta. The Attorney 
General of Saskatchewan led a delegation made up of the 
Liberal leader, Lynda Haverstock, as well as the Conservative 
leader. They also refuted the whole concept of consultation. The 
Attorney General of Alberta indicated exactly the same thing.
<P>
	We heard from the justice ministers of the Northwest 
Territories and Yukon. They refuted the whole idea that they 
were involved in any significant way in consultation with the 
justice minister in the development and creation of this 
legislation.
<P>
	People like the president of the Olympic handgun competitors 
claimed there was no consultation whatsoever. This statement is 
supported by the fact that when the justice minister brought in 
his proposals before Christmas of last year he had such little 
knowledge of handguns that he was banning those used in world 
cup competitions. When we asked him if he would consider 
exempting the .32 calibre handgun, which is one of the handguns 
used in world cup competition, the record tells how much 
consultation really went on between himself and those groups of 
people.
<P>
<B>(1120 ) </B>
<P>
	He stated he would certainly not consider exempting the .32 
calibre. Why? The barrel length was under 105 millimetres and 
those short barrel firearms are inaccurate and are made only for 
killing. That is basically the reason to justify the banning of 58 
per cent of the legally held and purchased handguns.
<P>
	When we talk about trafficking in fiction, who is trafficking in 
fiction? I ask the justice minister who really is trafficking in 
fiction? To carry on with this whole idea that the justice minister 
has consulted broadly, widely and in depth with people, groups 
and organizations involved with firearms is a little ridiculous. 
These consultations did not take place with the justice ministers 
of the territories or at least with the attorneys general of the 
provinces.
<P>
	Several groups of native peoples also appeared before the 
committee. The James Bay Cree were represented. 
Representatives from the Yukon Indians appeared before the 
committee. Ovide Mercredi and a delegation from the Assembly 
of First Nations appeared. A group represented by Mr. Borin 
appeared. They all deny that there was any in depth consultation.
<P>
	I have a copy of a letter which was tabled with the committee 
from Mr. Ovide Mercredi to the justice minister dated February 
17. I will just quote from this. It states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Once again your government has acted in a manner that shows a complete 
disregard for the rights and interests of the people I represent. Your 
introduction of the gun control legislation without prior consultation with First 
Nations is a violation of your responsibility as Minister of Justice to uphold the 
fiduciary trust obligations of your government for all First Nations.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In imposing your plan for firearms registration and regulation, you are 
breaching our treaties with the crown. You promised a consultation process 
with First Nations in our meeting on November 14, 1994. Where is that 
consultation process?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13695"> 13695 </A></B>
<P>
	He ends by saying:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For God's sake, respect our rights.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is what the Grand Chief of the Assembly of First Nations 
wrote the minister.
<P>
	During the committee meetings I asked if there had been 
consultations in the prescribed manner according to what 
amounts to the appendages to the Constitution with regard to the 
agreement that was made with the James Bay Cree. It was called 
the James Bay Cree and Northern Quebec Agreement. I also 
asked if there were consultations with the Yukon Indians who 
recently signed an agreement for self-government. The ink is 
hardly dry on that agreement. The officials of the department 
assured me and the committee that consultations had taken place 
in accordance with the constitutional requirement.
<P>
	When I asked Mr. Mosley, the assistant deputy minister, to 
table with the committee evidence of such consultations, he 
agreed to do so but did not. When he next appeared before the 
committee I asked him about the agreement and the undertaking 
he had accepted to table documents from the department that 
would substantiate the claim that substantial consultations, in 
the prescribed manner, had been undertaken with the James Bay 
and Yukon Indians, he said that the minister would be tabling 
those documents when he appeared on the last day that witnesses 
were to appear before the committee on May 19.
<P>
	When the justice minister appeared he tabled a half inch stack 
of documents. That did not give us a chance to examine them so 
we could prepare questions for the justice minister.
<P>
<B>(1125 ) </B>
<P>
	When I did have a chance to examine the documents they did 
not show evidence of consultation at all. It was evidence, at best, 
of letters of notification to the 630 bands that these proposals 
had been presented before Christmas. There was no evidence of 
consultation.
<P>
	When the justice minister talks about broad consultations 
throughout the country with the various groups of people and 
organizations on which the legislation will impact, I ask, who is 
trafficking in fiction? There is no doubt in my mind who is 
trafficking in fiction. It is certainly no one from this caucus 
when it comes to these kinds of issues.
<P>
	How in the world was it possible for the justice minister to 
overlook the requirement to consult with the aboriginal peoples 
of the country? How could he do that? He understands the law as 
well as any of us. As stated in the letter by Mr. Mercredi to him, 
he understands the constitutional requirements to abide by the 
consultative requirement when legislation is going to impact on 
the  treaties or constitutional rights of aboriginal people or any 
other Canadian.
<P>
	I am satisfied that the reason the justice minister and his 
officials did not first consult with the aboriginal people is 
because the aboriginal people would have told him exactly what 
they told the committee with regard to the gun control bill. They 
would reject the vast majority of it, particularly the licensing 
and the registration requirements.
<P>
	Had he gone to them first they would have set the standard for 
all Canadians. That would not go far enough for the minister 
because he wanted to impose the restrictions and licensing 
requirements on law-abiding gun owners. He knew if he went to 
the aboriginal people first, as he ought to have done, he could 
not have refuted them and come forward with the kind of 
legislation he has brought forward today.
<P>
	Had he gone to the aboriginal people first, they would have set 
the standard, the benchmark for all Canadians with regard to the 
manner in which their rights would be interfered with by 
legislation. He did not want to do that because he knew the 
aboriginal people would not accept it, as Ovide Mercredi said in 
his letter.
<P>
	I refer again to his letter where he said when talking about his 
own people: ``I know that they will not comply with any 
legislation that violates their treaty and aboriginal rights and I 
will encourage this non-compliance''. That is the Grand Chief 
of the Assembly of First Nations telling the justice minister that 
they will not comply with these kinds of regulations.
<P>
	The justice minister of the Northwest Territories told us as 
well that many gun owners in the Northwest Territories today 
are not complying with the firearms acquisition certificate 
requirements. He and his delegation explained in very 
straightforward and understandable terms why they are not. It is 
so impractical for them. He talked about isolated communities 
where there is no facility to obtain the passport photograph 
required to obtain an FAC.
<P>
	Therefore, the present laws are not being abided by in those 
isolated communities. We heard the Grand Chief of the First 
Nations say that he will encourage his people not to comply.
<P>
<B>(1130 ) </B>
<P>
	There was no in depth consultation before this bill was tabled, 
because he would have heard the same thing. He did not want to 
deal with them before the fact; he wanted to deal with them after 
the fact. How is he going to do it?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13696"> 13696 </A></B>
<P>
	Last night the justice minister put forward an amendment in 
Motion No. 5. That amendment states: ``For greater certainty, 
nothing in this act shall be construed so as to abrogate or 
derogate from any existing aboriginal or treaty rights of the 
aboriginal peoples of Canada under section 35 of the 
Constitution Act, 1982''.
<P>
	What does that mean? It means that through section 110(t) he 
is going to be able to go back to the aboriginal people by way of 
regulations and orders in council and provide whatever 
exemption he wishes to provide. It is going to result in not all 
Canadians standing equal before this law. I heard the official 
opposition leader address this as well. It appears that we may 
have a two-tier system where there is one set of laws for the 
aboriginal people and a different set for the non-aboriginal 
people.
<P>
	I submit that had he gone forward and obtained the 
consultation and the input from the aboriginal people first, then 
based upon those considerations we would all be happy and we 
could all support that legislation. But it would not have gone far 
enough for the minister, because he does want to register, he 
does want to license, he does want to impose those restrictions 
and those interventions upon the people of Canada.
<P>
	He has put the cart before the horse and he is trying to finesse 
this whole thing by going back and saying that through the 
power of the regulations he has in this act he will be able to 
consult with aboriginal peoples and address their concerns on 
their treaty rights and their constitutional rights when it comes 
to hunting, trapping, and food gathering.
<P>
	What is emerging here-and I hope I am wrong-is evidence 
that we are moving toward a two-tier system as far as gun 
legislation is concerned in this country. I regret that very much. 
If the minister had consulted with the aboriginal peoples in 
depth according to what I believe are their constitutional rights, 
this would not have happened. Now we are going to find 
ourselves perhaps in a situation where there are going to be 
constitutional challenges on the basis of discrimination. That is 
unfortunate. It ought not to be.
<P>
	My own personal point of view is that in this case the 
aboriginal people are on the right track when it comes to the 
control of firearms. They are on the right track. The standard 
they are saying they want for the use, ownership, and the giving 
and lending of their firearms ought to be applicable for all 
Canadians. If that were the case a vast majority of Canadians 
would agree with it and support it. We should have started with 
the aboriginal people, used their needs and their requirements as 
the benchmark for all of our legislation in this bill. I submit that 
respectfully.
<P>
	I want to touch on a couple of other points. I want to deal with 
this whole area of smuggling. I sat in the justice committee 
when the Canadian Police Association delegates were there. I 
listened to them carefully. They had basic support for a majority 
of the contents of the bill, but I remember very clearly what the 
president of  the Canadian Police Association, Mr. Neal Jessop, 
said. He pointed out that the strength of this bill will be based 
upon the ability of the government to stop smuggling in Canada.
<P>
	I have a document here that was produced by the MacKenzie 
Institute called ``Misfire: The Black Market and Gun Control''. 
They did an eight-month survey into firearms smuggling in 
Canada. They talked to police officers, aboriginal peoples, 
smugglers, taxi drivers, the whole host of people involved in the 
milieu of gun smuggling and illicit firearms trafficking. They 
concluded that if Bill C-68 goes through there is going to be an 
explosion of smuggling in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	When I compare this to the report submitted from the justice 
department on smuggling, their report is a hollow whitewash 
compared to the information contained in this document. I will 
not take time to go through it, but it is here. It is here for anyone 
who wants to look at it.
<P>
	We have real problems, not with the law-abiding gun owner 
but with the extent of gun smuggling and the smuggling of illicit 
firearms, prohibited firearms, these so-called assault weapons 
into Canada. We have a real problem. The authors of the 
MacKenzie report are saying that it is going to explode if this 
bill goes through. I just mention that.
<P>
	I want to touch on the polls and the support. I do not place 
much support in polls because they go up and they go down, 
particularly on a bill like this, where the people who are being 
contacted really do not know the extent to which the guns are 
controlled now by way of legislation.
<P>
	We have over 60 pages in the Criminal Code dealing with the 
ownership, acquisition and use of firearms. The legislation 
dealing with firearms in this country is very extensive. So when 
we have a 124-page document adding to that and we ask people 
on the phone what they think about gun control, adding more 
laws to the gun control bill, I am not sure how well informed 
they are when they respond to that.
<P>
	I do know that if I received a phone call and someone was 
telling me the government was moving in a direction to extend 
greater control over guns, I would say that sounds to me like a 
good thing to do, because it is going to make the homes and 
streets and communities safer in Canada. If that were my belief, 
if I were led to believe that from the question asked, Mr. 
Speaker, you bet I would support it. I would support it today if I 
could see it in the bill, but I cannot see it. I can understand why 
the polls vary, depending on the questions and depending upon 
the extent of information they have at their disposal about the 
bill.
<P>
	We can see very clearly that as more and more information 
gets to the people, not just about the gun registration but what 
appears to be the possible violation of civil rights, the extension 
of police powers in order to inspect or search and to seize and so 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13697"> 13697 </A></B>
<P>
on, we see a  broadening concern over this legislation and a drop 
in the support for the bill.
<P>
	I might add that the clearest indication in terms of polling has 
to be the result of an election where gun control is an issue. We 
have had two provincial elections recently. I would like to 
mention at least the one in Manitoba, where the government 
headed by Premier Filmon publicly rejected the gun registration 
portion of this bill, as did the NDP in that province. The Liberal 
Party embraced it. It is interesting to note that a few weeks 
before the writ came down in that province for the election call 
the Liberals were very, very close in the polls to the Tories, the 
government, and it looked like they could form the government. 
We saw what happened. They lost over 50 per cent of their seats 
and the Liberal leader lost his seat.
<P>
<B>(1140 ) </B>
<P>
	I have an item in the paper here that quotes one of the Liberal 
candidates. He states that the Liberal campaign was badly 
damaged by unpopular federal decisions like gun control and 
budget cuts. He went on to say that it infuriated him to hear the 
justice minister say after the election that gun control had 
nothing to do with the Manitoba Liberals' poor showing. ``He 
has his head in the sand'' is what this defeated Liberal candidate 
from Manitoba said.
<P>
	When we hear the justice minister talk about support and 
trafficking in fiction, we should examine it carefully. I wish the 
debate would be made on facts. We can look at the polls, but let 
us be honest about it and look at the real polls. In this country we 
now have at least five provinces whose premiers have concerns 
about this bill. We have the Saskatchewan, Alberta, and 
Manitoba premiers who are concerned about this bill. We have 
had the Liberal premier from New Brunswick express concern 
as well about the registration system. Now we have the new 
premier of Ontario, and I would like to hear further from him. I 
would like him to have a good look at this bill so that we hear 
from the premier of the most populated province in Canada. I 
would like to hear what he has to say now about this bill and 
whether there will be support from the province of Ontario for 
the registration system.
<P>
	I want to end by discussing the cost. Members were accused 
on this side of trafficking in fiction when it comes to the cost. 
Let us look at the cost for a moment. The justice minister is 
indicating $85 million to set up the registration system. That is 
just to set up the registration system. We first have to register the 
three million gun owners. We have to license them before we can 
register a single gun they own. If they are not eligible to hold a 
licence, what is the point of registering their firearms? They will 
have to give up their firearms if they are not able to be licensed. 
What will it cost to license an individual?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Ten bucks for ten guns.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Ten bucks for ten guns, if we talk about 
trafficking in fiction. I am talking about licensing the owner, not 
about registering the firearm. If we look at the cost to license 
three million gun owners, we can estimate the cost per 
individual by looking at what the cost is now to process an FAC, 
a firearms acquisition certificate, because the requirements are 
similar.
<P>
	Under clause 5 of this bill, the chief provincial firearms 
officer is going to have to conduct a review of the criminal 
record of the individual, a mental health record, and perhaps a 
neighbourhood background check to see if there is any history of 
violence. That is not unlike the requirement for an FAC. They go 
through a similar background check.
<P>
	The Metro Toronto Police Board analysed the cost to process a 
single FAC in 1994, and it was $185. That might be high, 
because it is in Toronto, where the costs are high. But if we take 
that figure and multiply it by three million gun owners who have 
to be licensed, what do we get? We certainly do not get $85 
million. We get about $550 million. If there are six million gun 
owners, as some estimate, then it will be well over $1 billion 
using those figures.
<P>
	If the Metro Toronto Police Board cost for the application of 
an FAC is the highest in the country, and we level it out to $100 
per FAC across the country and take that as an average-I do not 
think we can label that as trafficking in fiction-we can get an 
idea of what the enormous cost is going to be to someone in this 
country, whether it is the gun owner, the taxpayer, or whoever. 
That is before a single gun is registered and we come in with the 
$10 cost to register 10 firearms. What can we register today for 
$10? It may cost me $10, but what does it cost the taxpayer? 
What does it cost the organization? What does it cost for the 
manpower?
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	I do not know what it will cost, but I am convinced it will not 
be $10. I do not know what can be processed today in that form 
for $10. My licence costs me more than that. The registration for 
my car costs me more than that. It cost me $5 to register my 
children's bicycles and I did all the work. I took it down to the 
police station where it was filed. That is what it cost me. I do not 
know what it cost the police to file it, process it and record it.
<P>
	When it comes to the cost, $85 million may be a fair 
representation of what it will cost to set up the registration 
system, but it is not anywhere near the overall cost to set up a 
full-fledged universal registration system where individual gun 
owners will have to be licensed and have to bring in their 
firearms to have them registered. There is absolutely no way. 
When we talk about trafficking in fiction, who is trafficking in 
fiction?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13698"> 13698 </A></B>
<P>
	The government has not provided a common sense 
justification for the registration of rifles and shotguns. I asked 
witness after witness who appeared before the committee how 
the registration of rifles and shotguns would reduce the criminal 
use of those firearms, and they were not able to answer. I have 
never heard a straightforward answer from the justice minister 
although I have asked him that question.
<P>
	We have a handgun registration system that has been around 
for 60 years. We know it has not reduced the criminal use of 
handguns, because the handgun is the weapon of choice for the 
vast majority of street criminals. We see that it has been 
ineffective in this area and we ask why the justice minister 
would want to expand a failed system to include rifles and 
shotguns.
<P>
	We have spent considerable time on the bill, but is it enough 
time? I say absolutely not. There was not enough time. When 
members are denied the right to express the concerns of their 
constituents in the House, those who want to express them, there 
is something wrong with the system.
<P>
	I do not think we have had enough time either at the 
committee stage or at second reading stage. Time allocation was 
utilized. A deadline was placed on the number of days to hear 
witnesses. We went immediately from there into clause by 
clause study. We did not even have time to examine the 
testimony of witnesses on a day to day basis, because the time 
lag from the time they testified to the time we received the 
written testimony was four days. We did not even have time to 
fully draft our amendments, go over them with legal counsel and 
present them in proper form. The bill has been rushed and I ask 
why. If it is not to become mandatory for eight years, what is the 
big rush?
<P>
	I make reference to a wonderful set of speaking points. At the 
bottom the Prime Minister said to his Liberal colleagues:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Reform Party says it needs more time to debate gun control, but cops on 
the beat say they need gun control now.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is very disturbing that Reformers are prepared to put the safety of police at 
risk in order to satisfy the gun lobby.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	Talk about trafficking in fiction. I have not talked to a street 
police officer who has supported the bill although their political 
masters do. I have talked with colleagues all across western 
Canada. I have been all across the country from Kamloops in the 
west to St. John's, Newfoundland, in the east. I have talked with 
people who say that the bill is nonsense anyway.
<P>
	My point is that if the cops on the beat need the bill now, why 
are we waiting eight years before bringing it in? It is not the 
Reform Party that is saying we should wait eight years; it is the 
government that is saying eight years.
<P>
	As I said the other night, if guns are really dangerous and if 
this is not a hysterical response from people who do not know 
anything about guns and fear them, why are we leaving 58 per 
cent of the handguns that are supposed to be dangerous in the 
hands of the people? Why are we leaving them where they are?
<P>
	In conclusion I would like to move the following motion:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the word that and 
substituting the following therefor:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``Bill C-68, an act respecting firearms and other weapons, be not now read a 
third time but that it be read a third time this day six months hence''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The amendment is in 
order. We will resume debate on the amendment and go to the 
next stage of debate where members will have an entitlement of 
20 minutes and 10 minutes for questions and comments.
<P>
	I ask members to indicate to the Chair if they will be splitting 
their time.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Liberal speakers will be splitting their time.
<P>
	I am proud to rise in the House today in support of the bill. I 
believe gun control legislation will make our communities safer 
and will preserve and help Canada to evolve as a civilized nation 
where we can walk the streets and drive our cars with greater 
safety. It says a great deal about the kind of society we want to 
create for the future. Quite simply the bill seeks to prevent the 
killing of human beings.
<P>
	There has been a great deal said about values in the debate. I 
have been concerned and have expressed my concern about the 
rhetoric of American values that seems to have permeated the 
debate. Let me give an example. Recently a survey was done in 
the United States among school children. When asked how they 
should respond if somebody tried to take something that 
belonged to them, the majority of American children said: ``Kill 
them''. When asked how they should respond to an insult, the 
majority said: ``Shoot them''.
<P>
	An American senator on national television not too long ago 
suggested his mother should take out her gun and shoot if an 
intruder broke into her home, obviously not aware that in the 
majority of cases where that is the response to an intruder 
breaking into a home the home owner and not the perpetrator 
ends up dead.
<P>
	As I said, the bill is about preventing death. Reformers have 
provided the strongest opposition to the bill yet their response is 
contradictory. They also say they are in favour of greater crime 
controls and greater punishment for criminals. Those are in the 
bill as well.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	Let me just tell the party that says it is so concerned about the 
victims of crime what Steve Sullivan, a spokesperson for the 
Canadian Resource Centre for Victims of Crime, says. He 
believes better gun control  laws would prevent similar 
accidents, for example the deaths of two young children from 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13699"> 13699 </A></B>
<P>
shotgun wounds which took place in his community not too long 
ago. Mr. Sullivan said that many of the cases his organization 
heard about were crimes committed by ordinary people in nice 
communities rather than by criminals.
<P>
	That is one main thought I want to leave with people this 
morning. While the bill is about crime control, it also deals with 
the fact that the vast majority of deaths by guns do not occur 
during the commission of a crime. They do not occur because a 
criminal, a stranger, shoots and tries to take something from 
someone or tries to perpetrate some other crime. The majority of 
gun related deaths and injuries happen in the home and are by 
someone known to the victim. That is the side of the legislation I 
want to address.
<P>
	Let me give some facts. In this community in the last six 
months seven people have died at the hands of a family member: 
five of the deaths were caused by guns and two were school aged 
children. Five of the seven deaths were gun related yet probably 
less than 20 per cent of homes in this urban area have guns. That 
tells me a great deal. Of the 1,400 deaths in the last year caused 
by guns, 1,100 were suicides. That reflects in large part the 
accessibility of a gun to commit suicide.
<P>
	Over 200 of the 1,400 deaths were homicides and the 
remainder were accidents. The majority of homicides, 86 per 
cent, are committed by family members, friends or 
acquaintances. Guns are a particularly serious threat to women. 
Almost half the women were killed by spouses or ex-spouses 
and almost half the women killed by their partners are shot even 
though half the homes in the country do not have guns. Also 78 
per cent of the guns used in these killings are legally owned. The 
problem is not only illegally owned guns. The problem is legally 
owned guns, which is what the legislation tries to address in 
part.
<P>
	Domestic and other intimate assaults are 12 times more likely 
to result in death if a gun is involved. I was serious when I said 
the bill is about preventing the deaths of human beings. We have 
significant evidence that a large number of offenders act 
impulsively, suggesting that the simple availability of a gun 
determines whether a homicide will or will not occur.
<P>
	We cannot forget our children. Since 1970, 470 children have 
died in accidents involving firearms. If we truly believe in the 
value of our children we should do all we can to protect them, 
and this is one measure to do so.
<P>
	The most contentious issue in the legislation is the 
registration of guns. Seven million firearms are held by 
approximately three million Canadians. We have no way of 
knowing how many guns are in the country at any one time, who 
the owners are, and whether or not the guns were legally or 
illegally acquired. Registration is designed to change that.
<P>
	I realize I have very little time in the debate this morning. 
Crime control is important and the bill addresses that. It is also 
important to control legally owned guns in the hands of their 
owners, because those are the guns that are responsible for the 
majority of gun related homicides and deaths in the country.
<P>
	A constituent who wrote to me said quite simply that she 
believed we should go ahead with the legislation and that it was 
important for people who owned guns to be accountable and 
held responsible for the use of those guns. Is that not what good 
citizenship is all about, accountability and responsibility as well 
as rights and privileges?
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	I urge all members of this House to consider the large number 
of deaths that occur in this country every year. Consider the role 
that legally owned guns play in those homicides. I urge members 
to consider whether they do not want to be part of making this a 
safer society.
<P>
	The justice minister referred earlier to how important he feels 
this legislation is for his children. I want to make the same 
personal comment. Later this afternoon I am going to the airport 
to pick up my daughter and my six-week old grandson but I am 
not going home to have dinner with them. I am coming back here 
to vote for this legislation. I am doing it for my daughter and I 
am doing it for my grandson. I am doing it for the kind of society 
I want him to be able to grow up in.
<P>
	In Canada, we have never believed either as a nation or as 
individuals that settling our problems by violence and by power 
is the way we develop. That is why Canada has become a nation 
that symbolizes around the world a peaceful resolution of 
problems. It is why we have evolved a reputation that has made 
our flag, which we will celebrate again in just a few weeks, a 
symbol to the world of how people can live in harmony.
<P>
	It is because we have had a different sense of values than those 
more American values I have heard expressed in this debate. We 
have not felt we have to rely on weapons to evolve a civilized 
society. By peaceful means, by peaceful resolution, by 
collectively agreeing on control of the criminal elements in our 
society and by creating a safer environment we will have the 
kind of country we want to live in and that we want to leave to 
the next generation.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to ask the hon. member for Ottawa West why her 
party decided to change the status quo, stipulating that, in the 
future, the restricted firearms safety courses mentioned in 
subclause 7(2) of the bill on firearms will have to be approved 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13700"> 13700 </A></B>
<P>
by the federal minister? The way things are now, the attorney 
general of each province approves the courses. That is how 
things currently work in Quebec, for example, and I suppose that 
that is the way things must be working in other  provinces. Since 
latitude was given to one province, it must have also been given 
to the others.
<P>
	What I would like to point out to you is that, in Quebec, these 
courses are very well structured. Of course, I am still talking 
about restricted firearms safety courses. Our courses in this area 
are extremely focused. Some are specifically for target shooters. 
Others are specifically for security guards. The first course is 
3.5 hours long; the second, 6 hours. They are really quite 
specific and have been very successful, up to now.
<P>
	Therefore, we wonder why the government would not accept 
the amendment we proposed to have the attorney general of each 
province continue to approve these courses on the handling of 
restricted firearms.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not know the bill inside and 
out. I did not have the privilege of discussing the issue for 
several weeks in committee, as did the hon. member opposite.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	It is very important, in my opinion, that this act contain 
provisions which apply uniformly across the country. For this 
reason, I feel that it is acceptable and important for the federal 
government to set the regulations, so that we know that they will 
be the same everywhere in Canada.
<P>
	I hope that another hon. member from our party will be able to 
give a more detailed answer to the hon. member's question.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
many other members on that side of the House have stated a 
number of times, the member stated she surely did not want to be 
like the Americans south of the border.
<P>
	Many of my relatives live in various parts of the United 
States. Some live in areas where guns are completely prohibited 
and some live in areas where the only gun law is simply that no 
guns are allowed in school or in court. The variance in violence 
does not seem to make much difference across the country where 
these relatives of mine live. The violence is there regardless of 
what the gun situation is.
<P>
	I would like to know where you get the information that would 
enable you to stand in this House and say-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. I would remind all hon. members to 
please address the Chair rather than each other directly. Could 
the hon. member rephrase his question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I apologize for that, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	Where does the member receive her news about the violence 
that occurs in the states? Where does she get her information 
that things are so terrible throughout the U.S. when I know for a 
fact that in many places they are not?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is perfectly true that many 
places in the United States are not the same. However, for 
anyone who has spent any substantial amount of time in an 
American city, I know people who have come from the United 
States to live in Canada who are thrilled by the fact they can 
walk around a city at night. It was something they had never 
done before in their entire lifetime. Guns were an important part 
of that. The fact is that the rate of deaths by guns in the United 
States is 10 times what it is in Canada. In general, the right to 
own guns is sacred in the United States and is reflected in the 
laws.
<P>
	There has also been substantial international research by the 
International Association of Police Officers. It shows quite 
clearly that the more stringent the gun control, the much lower 
the death rate from homicide and the much lower the rate of 
violent crime. I will be happy to provide the member with that 
research.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. parliamentary secretary to the 
minister of Indian affairs is going to address the House next.
<P>
	I wish to inform the House that the hon. parliamentary 
secretary is going to address the House in his language. I was 
apprised of this and there is no impediment to using a language 
other than the two official languages in the House. The hon. 
member has taken care in this sense and has provided the 
interpreters with a complete translation of what he is going to be 
saying to the House. The hon. member has informed me that he 
will be strictly adhering to the text.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	Therefore, I see no impediment to this, providing that all the 
steps have been taken so that all of us will know in either of the 
two official languages what is being said to the House.
<P>
	With that I recognize the hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Iyerak Anawak (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, 
Lib.):</B>
<P>
	[<I>Editor's Note: Member spoke in Inuktitut, translated as

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak on 
third reading of Bill C-68, an act respecting firearms and other 
weapons.
<P>
	The proposals contained in this bill have generated a lot of 
discussion throughout the country. A lot of misinformation is 
out there. I will use my time to dispel some of that misinforma-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13701"> 13701 </A></B>
<P>
tion, particularly as it affects my  constituency and the people I 
represent. I will tell this House what I have been telling the Inuit 
hunters in my constituency.
<P>
	No hunter is going to kill one less caribou or one less seal on 
account of this bill. I know that. The ability and right of the Inuit 
to hunt will still be there under the provisions of this bill. It will 
always be there.
<P>
	No piece of legislation can take away the Inuit way of life. 
This bill does not take away the Inuit way of life, nor can 
anything else unless the Inuit themselves choose to let it go. 
That way of life is protected in the Nunavut land claims 
agreement and in the Constitution of Canada.
<P>
	The Constitution of Canada is the supreme law of the land and 
all the other laws of Canada have to be consistent with the 
Constitution. Section 35 of the Constitution states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>35. (1) The existing aboriginal and treaty rights of the aboriginal peoples of 
Canada are hereby recognized and affirmed.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(2) In this act, ``aboriginal peoples of Canada'' includes the Indian, Inuit and 
Metis peoples of Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(3) For greater certainty, in subsection (1), ``treaty rights'' includes rights 
that now exist by way of land claims agreements or may be so acquired.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, the aboriginal and treaty 
rights referred to in subsection (1) are guaranteed equally to male and female 
persons.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Article 2 of the Nunavut land claims agreement is clear on the 
constitutional status of the agreement. It states: ``The agreement 
shall be a land claims agreement within the meaning of section 
35 of the Constitution Act, 1982''.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, the most basic aboriginal and treaty rights are 
the rights to hunt, trap and fish for sustenance. While there are 
many disagreements between aboriginal peoples and 
government on the exact scope and content of all aboriginal and 
treaty rights, there is at least agreement on harvesting rights. 
There is no question that aboriginal and treaty rights include 
hunting, fishing and trapping rights. Even the courts have said 
so.
<P>
	Harvesting is central to the aboriginal way of life. It is at the 
heart of our being, who we are, who we have been, and who we 
want to be. We do not want to lose our connection with the land. 
It has sustained us for thousands of years. It has kept us alive. It 
sustains us still.
<P>
	Most Inuit and most other aboriginal people who live in 
remote communities still make a living from the land. It is a 
proud thing and an honourable thing for us to go out on the land 
and come home with food for our families and neighbours. That 
is why there is such worry in aboriginal communities about this 
bill. There is a deep fear that the bill is affecting our core 
identity and will take away our ability to buy, possess and use 
firearms. Some people have been exploiting that fear. I want to 
address this issue now.
<P>
	The government is well aware that aboriginal and treaty 
hunting and trapping rights exist. Some very specific provisions 
exist in these agreements concerning these rights.
<P>
<B>(1215 ) </B>
<P>
	For example, the Nunavut land claim agreement has a whole 
chapter on wildlife. That chapter recognizes that Inuit are 
traditional and current users of wildlife and that the legal rights 
of Inuit to harvest wildlife flow from their traditional and 
current use.
<P>
	Under the Nunavut land claim agreement a wildlife 
management system has been created that reflects the 
traditional and current levels, patterns and character of Inuit 
harvesting and avoids unnecessary interference in the exercise 
of the rights, priorities and privileges to harvest. Subject to the 
terms of the chapter, an Inuk with proper identification may 
harvest up to his or her adjusted basic needs level without any 
form of licence or permit and without imposition of any form of 
tax or fee.
<P>
	In addition, the agreement states that where there is any 
inconsistency or conflict between any federal, territorial and 
local government laws and the agreement, the agreement shall 
prevail.
<P>
	Those provisions in the Nunavut land claim agreement offer 
protection. Other land claim agreements offer similar 
protection.
<P>
	It will be necessary for the government to work out with 
aboriginal peoples an accommodation between existing 
aboriginal and treaty harvesting rights and the provisions of Bill 
C-68. There must be discussions, there must be consultations. 
There must be a dialogue so the various provisions can be 
reconciled and integrated. The government knows this and 
intends to carry out these essential discussions.
<P>
	For this reason, the government put section 110(t) into Bill 
C-68. Section 110(t) says the governor in council, or cabinet, 
can make regulations, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Respecting the manner in which any provision of this Act or the regulations 
applies to any of the aboriginal peoples of Canada, and adapting any such 
provision for the purposes of that application.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This section recognizes that the government and aboriginal 
peoples have to work together to implement this bill in ways that 
are respectful of and sensitive to aboriginal and treaty rights. 
These discussions will occur. There will be opportunities for 
aboriginal peoples to have a say in implementation.
<P>
	By the way, aboriginal peoples should know that both the 
Reform Party and the Bloc Quebecois tried to remove this clause 
from the bill during the committee hearings.
<P>
	During the committee hearings on this bill, aboriginal 
representatives asked for something more than section 110(t). 
Some groups, like the Inuit Tapirisat of Canada and the Grand 
Council 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13702"> 13702 </A></B>
<P>
of the Crees of Quebec, specifically requested the inclusion of a 
non-derogation clause.
<P>
	I am very pleased to say that the minister and the government 
responded positively to this request. The minister has brought in 
an amendment to Bill C-68 that adds a non-derogation clause to 
the bill. It reads like this:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For greater certainty, nothing in this act shall be construed so as to abrogate or 
derogate from any existing aboriginal or treaty rights of the aboriginal peoples of 
Canada under section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	While the government's position is that the bill does not 
abrogate aboriginal and treaty rights, this non-derogation 
clause has been included in the bill to provide greater 
reassurance. I pushed for this amendment and I thank the 
Minister of Justice for responding.
<P>
	The minister and the government have also made another very 
important change to Bill C-68. It is a change that I also pushed 
for and it affects the lending provisions of the bill.
<P>
	When the bill was drafted initially, it stated that when 
someone loaned a firearm to another person the registration 
certificate for the firearm had to be loaned along with the 
firearm. I expressed my concerns to the minister about this 
provision. Both aboriginal and non-aboriginal groups who 
appeared before the justice committee also raised the lending 
provision as an issue. They talked about the impracticality of 
lending a registration certificate along with a firearm when 
someone is out on the land hunting for food.
<P>
	Again, the minister and the government responded to the 
concern. The amendment made to the bill by the minister 
removes the requirement to transfer the registration certificate 
along with the firearm when the firearm is being loaned to 
someone who will be hunting for sustenance purposes.
<P>
	This is a practical change. The government is acknowledging 
a way of life in rural and remote communities. Lending firearms 
is a common occurrence in the north, where I come from. 
Lending your firearm in the north is as common as lending a 
lawnmower to your neighbour or borrowing a cup of sugar from 
your neighbour in the southern parts of Canada. In northern 
communities, when your neighbour needs something you have 
in order to put food on the table, you help out in whatever way 
you can. Sometimes you lend your skidoo, sometimes gas, and 
sometimes your gun.
<P>
	The change the minister has made to the lending provisions of 
the bill responds to the very real circumstances of all sustenance 
hunters, aboriginal and non-aboriginal. It is a positive change 
and I welcome it and I thank the minister for his consideration.
<P>
<B>(1220 ) </B>
<P>
	There are some other issues related to the bill that will need to 
be addressed and worked out between the federal government, 
the government of the Northwest Territories and aboriginal 
peoples.
<P>
	The firearms safety training course has to recognize northern 
circumstances. In the north it must reflect and be adapted to the 
northern reality. Accommodation should be made for the 
aboriginal languages. I encourage both the federal and 
territorial governments to continue working on this matter.
<P>
	The issue of traditional gun giving is also one I am sure will be 
addressed in discussions between government and aboriginal 
representatives.
<P>
	I am confident these issues can be worked out satisfactorily. 
Reasonable people working together in a spirit of good will can 
sort these things out.
<P>
	I support this bill. It is better now following the committee 
hearings and report stage. Many changes have been made to the 
bill to improve it.
<P>
	I had some concerns, which the minister has gone a long way 
to address. Protections for the Inuit way of life are contained in 
the Nunavut land claims agreement and the Constitution of 
Canada. The bill contains a clause that says the government will 
discuss with Inuit how the bill is to be implemented in Inuit 
communities. Our communities will be able to have their own 
firearms officers. Sustenance hunting is recognized in the bill 
and we are doubly protected now with the addition of the clause 
that says that nothing in the bill can take away or limit 
aboriginal and treaty hunting rights.
<P>
	I have never had any problem with the principles of this bill. I 
have no problem with gun registration. I am a hunter. I am an 
aboriginal hunter. I am not afraid of registering my firearms. I 
may experience some inconvenience with registration, but I 
support the principles underlying it.
<P>
	The overriding objective of gun registration is public safety. I 
am prepared to do my part.

	<B>The Speaker:</B> During the question and comment period I 
would ask if the hon. member would consider that in whatever 
official language the question is asked, he would consider 
answering in one of the official languages.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to thank the hon. member for Nunatsiaq for his 
comments.
<P>
	I notice that he spent his time reassuring his constituents that 
the bill would not be too harsh on them. I know that even the use 
of his language was an effort to better communicate that to his 
constituents.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13703"> 13703 </A></B>
<P>
	I also have made an effort to consult and to try to get the 
feelings from my constituents as well. I had a town hall meeting 
to discuss this bill in an open forum. I could not get a 
representative from the justice department to present the 
government side. No one would come. I could not get anyone 
from the police chiefs to come to put their spin on it. I just could 
not get them. I could not get a representative from Wendy Cukier 
and her gun control group. They would not come. Frankly, I 
could not get anyone to come to defend the bill in a public 
forum.
<P>
	A dentist got up at this public meeting and said that he wanted 
to shoot recreationally. He said that he wanted to shoot a 
handgun. He was pretty nervous. He said: ``This is my first ever 
public presentation, but this is what I have to go through already. 
I decide that I want to take the course and it takes me a year to 
get a handgun. I have to get an FAC. I have to go through the 
course. I have to spend money. I have to have a background 
check. I have to allow them to question my neighbours. They do 
a criminal check on me. When I finally get a firearm, I can only 
transport it in the trunk of my car. Any other guns I might have 
are locked up; they have a trigger lock and the ammunition is 
separate.''
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	This is already the case in Canada. In Canada we do not allow 
sawed off shotguns; we do not allow automatic weapons; we do 
not allow machine guns. This just is not allowed. People 
watching should know these things are already not allowed. The 
gun owners by and large say they are willing to go through the 
hoops, that it is a pain and they question its effectiveness, but 
they are willing to do it because they are law-abiding citizens. 
But they also say that there comes a time when they do not know 
what they are going to do any more: ``I can't do more than I'm 
doing. I am not the problem''.
<P>
	The constituents of the member for Nunatsiaq are not the 
problem. The problem is the criminal element. This bill does 
very little to clamp down on the criminal misuse of firearms. 
This dentist who gave a speech and the other gun owners I have 
talked to say that when we find a criminal misusing a firearm, 
using it in the commission of a crime, we should throw them 
away for the rest of their lives: ``I don't care, because they're not 
part of us. They're not law-abiding citizens, so throw the book 
at them''. The problem is this bill is primarily concerned with 
the law-abiding citizens.
<P>
	My question to the member is how will the universal 
registration portion of this bill make my constituent, this 
dentist, feel any safer? He has already jumped through a full 
year's worth of regulations trying to be a totally law-abiding 
citizen. Now he finds out that is not enough. He is exasperated, 
and I share his exasperation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anawak:</B>
<P>
	[<I>Editor's Note: Member spoke in Inuktitut.</I>]
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, do you know what the problem is? The problem 
is we are too much of a me, me, me society, rather than we, we, 
we. We should be looking after the interests of Canadian people 
as a whole. Instead, what is happening with the gun control 
lobby is ``You're going to take away my right to have a 
firearm''. This is not a right; it is a privilege to have a firearm.
<P>
	A little bit of inconvenience in registering a rifle should be no 
big deal. I really do not have a problem with the registration.
<P>
	By the way, I should also thank the House for its indulgence in 
allowing me to speak Inuktitut earlier.
<P>
	It is too much of a me, me, me society, rather than one that 
considers what is good for the country. I would like the members 
from Reform to support us on the issue of a non-derogation 
clause. Yesterday they did not support us after the hon. member 
for Crowfoot said: ``I find it unacceptable that the government 
will make agreements with our aboriginal people and then 
violate those agreements. This is unacceptable. What's the 
purpose of the agreement and where is the honour in the 
agreement if it's simply going to be violated? No wonder the 
aboriginal people come forward. I admire your patience. I can't 
get over your patience in the face of this kind of treatment''. 
This was from the member for Crowfoot. Then last night he 
voted against a non-derogation clause, which recognizes our 
rights under section 35 of the Constitution.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
everyone has an opinion on Bill C-68. From Lutselk'e in the 
Northwest Territories to Blanc-Sablon, the bill has been 
discussed in our homes, in our communities and especially in 
this House. The debate continues down into the last stretch. 
Yesterday again we talked about it for hours in this House.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	The main source of controversy in Bill C-68 is undoubtedly 
the proposal for a national registration system.
<P>
	This universal registration system will consist of a 
computerized registry listing the names and addresses of 
firearms owners and a description of the firearms in their 
possession. The system will be operated by the RCMP.
<P>
	Firearm owners have to apply for the new ownership licence 
starting in January 1996 and will have until 2001 to register. 
Firearms will have to be registered starting in January 1998, and 
owners will have until 2003 to do so.
<P>
	Reform Party members, the pro-gun lobby and several 
Liberal colleagues of the Minister of Justice are pleased about 
the fact that the minimum sentence for using a firearm in the 
commission of an offence has been increased and that existing 
owners of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13704"> 13704 </A></B>
<P>
firearms have a grace period of nearly eight years to comply 
with the  national registration system proposed by the minister 
in Bill C-68.
<P>
	I am convinced that registration of firearms plus ownership 
licences will have a positive impact on homicide and suicide 
rates and on controlling the number of firearms in circulation.
<P>
	We cannot ignore the statistics on deaths caused by the use of 
firearms. Guns are used in more than one third of homicides in 
Canada. In the past ten years, the majority of homicides were 
committed using shotguns or hunting rifles.
<P>
	In their presentation to the Standing Committee on Justice 
and Legal Affairs, the Conférence des régies régionales de la 
santé et des services sociaux du Québec gave a telling summary 
of the situation in Quebec, and I quote: ``In Quebec, firearms 
claim at least one victim per day or 420 deaths annually, of 
which 7 out of 10 are suicides. During the same twelve-month 
period, 400 people in Quebec died of AIDS, 400 died due to 
accidental falls, 900 in car accidents, 100 by drowning and 80 of 
accidental poisoning. The number of deaths caused by firearms 
is comparable to many other health problems that have raised 
the concerns of the public, the media and government. The 
annual economic cost of the wrongful use of firearms has been 
estimated, in 1993 Canadian dollars, at $6.595 billion in Canada 
and $1.659 billion in Quebec alone. The vast majority of deaths 
caused by gunshots occur in the home, with legally acquired 
rifles''.
<P>
	These are the depressing facts, and we cannot ignore them. 
Gun control is necessary in a society that wants to curb violence 
and enhance public safety.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is in favour of gun control that does not 
however, discriminate against those who use guns responsibly. 
The Bloc Quebecois and 90 per cent of the people of Quebec 
support firearms registration. That is the kind of society we 
want.
<P>
	The bill is well received by Quebecers who are looking for 
ways to keep our society peaceful and secure and to combat 
smuggling more effectively. Like women across the country, 
women in Quebec support stricter gun controls. This is not 
surprising since they also have the highest rate of deaths due to 
gunshot wounds.
<P>
	In all opinion polls, women and the more highly educated 
were 88 per cent in favour of a registration system for all 
firearms. On the other hand, men in general were only 78 per 
cent in favour of gun registration.
<P>
	I have upset some people by saying that gender had a lot to do 
with this debate on the future of our society. The statistics show 
I was right, for the following reasons: The first is obvious; the 
statistics speak for themselves as regards women's support for 
gun registration. The second is that men are generally the 
aggressors, while women are more often than not at the other 
end of the barrel.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	Even the Minister of Justice agreed with me, when he cited 
disturbing statistics. On the average, a woman dies through the 
discharge of a firearm every six days in Canada. Three times out 
of four, the murdered wife was shot with a rifle or a shotgun. 
Firearms control, whether we want to admit it or not, is a matter 
of gender: that of the victims and that of the women who support 
Bill C-68 by an overwhelming majority.
<P>
	For reasons I set out earlier, I believe the establishment of a 
national registration system is a positive step. I must repeat, 
however, my considerable regret that the Minister of Justice 
yielded to the gun lobby.
<P>
	By spreading the registration of owners and their weapons 
over eight years, the minister is making it clear that he does not 
want the system implemented while he is around. He should 
have shortened the registration period for firearms by two years. 
The system would have been in place next year.
<P>
	There is no justification, either logistic or political, for 
firearms registration not to begin at the same time as licensing 
for ownership. Registration could have begun on January 1 next 
year and ended December 31, 2000.
<P>
	We must remember that firearms are registered only once in 
the owner's lifetime. The certificate need not be renewed. The 
operation is a very simple one, requiring little of owners.
<P>
	Lives could be saved if all firearms were registered quickly. 
What are we waiting for? I have chosen to live in a responsible 
society, and I hope my colleagues will make the same choice.
<P>
	Allow my to express my delight at the end of fruitless debates 
and of the ineptitudes of the Reform Party. Bill C-68 will soon 
become a law that all Quebecers and Canadians will have to 
observe.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice received a passing grade, barely, in 
this examination. His marketing operation proved a complete 
failure.
<P>
	I have been interested in the matter of firearms since 1989 and 
I have never looked back. From the first, I fought for tightened 
gun control. As early as 1989, I asked that firearms sold in 
Canada be equipped with a safety locking device. I participated 
in the debate on Bill C-17 until it was passed in 1991.
<P>
	Thank God, Reform members did not take part, and the 
pro-gun lobby had to find other allies in this House.
<P>
	I am happy that the firearms bill will be adopted today. 
Although flawed, it represents a kind of social reform toward the 
safe and peaceful society I want.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13705"> 13705 </A></B>
<P>
	Whatever Reform members may say, legislation on gun 
registration is not limited to New Zealand and Australia. If the 
Reform Party likes to use these examples, it is because the 
experience was a difficult one for these two countries. New 
Zealand had an obsolete, manual system that had been 
introduced after the first world war.
<P>
	Like Canada, Australia is a federal state, but gun regulations 
come under the jurisdiction of the states and territories. It seems 
difficult to standardize a national registration system, when it 
comes under the jurisdiction of states with different sets of laws.
<P>
	In any event, for the information of my Reform colleagues, I 
would like to talk briefly about other countries in the world that 
have introduced gun control measures. I welcome the idea that 
we will soon be part of this responsible community.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	In China, a non-professional hunter can obtain a licence 
allowing him to own a weapon, but he cannot own more than 
two.
<P>
	In the Czech Republic, an applicant must specify the reasons 
why he wants a licence and attach recommendation letters as 
well as a medical certificate vouching for his physical and 
mental health. The licence is valid for a three month period only. 
After obtaining his licence, the potential gun buyer must receive 
authorization from the district police. He must then, in the 
following days, take the gun he bought to the district police for 
registration.
<P>
	In France, the registration data includes the buyer's name, 
place of residence and birthplace. Firearms must be registered 
with the gendarmerie. In France also, certain individuals are not 
allowed to purchase firearms, for instance those convicted of a 
crime or sentenced to prison for more than three months; those 
who are mentally disabled; those on probation; and finally, 
violent alcoholics.
<P>
	In Germany, manufacturers and gunsmiths are required by 
law to apply various procedures, such as record keeping, 
labelling and notifying. These procedures are designed to help 
the authorities keep accurate records on firearms and 
ammunition belonging to private or business interests.
<P>
	In Great Britain, anyone who has a firearm, whether they own 
it or not, must register it and get a licence.
<P>
	In Greece, to be eligible to hold a licence, applicants must be 
21 years of age and substantiate their need to have a firearm for 
personal safety, guarding a public building or target shooting. 
Firearms registration is mandatory and the licence to possess 
firearms must be renewed every three months.
<P>
	These are a few countries around the world where firearms 
control was a societal choice. India, Israel, Sweden, South 
Africa, Poland, the Netherlands, Mexico, Malaysia, Japan and 
others also have similar legislation.
<P>
	As you can see, contrary to what the third party would have us 
believe, responsible governments are not only found in Western 
Canada.
<P>
	In addition, Bill C-68 as amended by the Standing Committee 
on Justice recognizes, in clause 7, long gun safety courses 
approved by the provinces. In Quebec, safety courses were 
approved by the Minister of Public Security in 1969 and have 
been offered ever since.
<P>
	Quebecers who have undergone training in firearms handling 
in recent years should not have to take the course again to 
comply with the new legislation. Therefore, the Bloc Quebecois 
supports clause 7, as poorly worded as it is, since people who 
have already taken the safety course will not be compelled to 
take it again.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to thank the Standing Committee on 
Justice and the 70 organizations and individuals who have 
travelled to Ottawa to express their views on Bill C-68 at the 
committee hearings.
<P>
	Let us bear in mind that every major social project has raised 
controversy. Bill C-68 is one of those. Our efforts will not have 
been in vain.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to ask a couple of questions and make 
a couple of comments on the member's statement.
<P>
	I am not sure what suppositions she starts from but I would 
like to comment on two or three. She mentioned that if we 
register weapons we must register guns because often rifles are 
used in suicides, murders, domestic disputes or whatever. I do 
not see how registering them makes any difference. If a person is 
crazy and is going to shoot somebody, does it matter if it is a 
registered weapon or an unregistered weapon hanging on the 
wall? I do not see how it really makes any difference. If someone 
is crazy enough to shoot somebody, he or she will do it anyway.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	I want to show it is not the registry that controls crime but 
other factors that can help to control crime. For example, 
Florida relaxed its gun laws in 1987. The murder rate has fallen 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13706"> 13706 </A></B>
<P>
20 per cent and is now lower than the American national 
average.
<P>
	Great Britain introduced tougher, more restrictive laws in 
1988 which lowered the number of guns by 22 per cent and its 
violent crime rate has doubled.
<P>
	The hon. member mentioned, for example, Israel, 
Switzerland and Sweden, that have firearm registration. I am not 
that familiar with them except to say that in Israel every 
able-bodied male of military age has an assault rifle in his 
house, not just a shotgun. He has a weapon with which to go to 
war.
<P>
	For my relatives in Sweden every single man must go through 
military training and keeps the gat right in the House. 
Registering them is not a factor. It is other things and what we do 
to prosecute and persecute those who are involved in the 
criminal use of firearms.
<P>
	Concerning the suicide argument, in Japan for example 
virtually no guns are allowed. They are banned in Japan. The 
suicide rate is much higher than Canada's. Just banning guns 
will not necessarily do away with suicides or domestic violence.
<P>
	It is a horrible thing but men, not that we take any comfort in 
it, are assaulted at probably 10 times the rate of women by other 
men. Men glory in shooting other men too. Some people are 
crazy and we cannot legislate against that. Registering weapons 
will not do away with those people. We need an absolute 
clampdown on the criminal misuse of firearms.
<P>
	I had a case in my riding. A guy sneaked across the American 
border in Columbia valley. He had with him a totally 
unregistered firearm, a .357 magnum, shoved in his jacket. He 
was stopped by a police officer. He knocked the police officer 
down. He stuck the muzzle of the gun in the female officer's 
mouth and said: ``I'm going to kill you''. He had plastic bullets 
which are only used for destroying people.
<P>
	Thankfully someone intervened and was able to talk him out 
of this incident, although he threatened to kill two people. He 
had two firearms because he stole the police officer's firearm as 
well. He stole the police vehicle, took it up into the mountains 
nearby and torched, to the tune of about $40,000.
<P>
	He had committed illegal entry. He had an unregistered illegal 
firearm. He had assaulted a police officer. He had threatened to 
murder two people. He had some drugs on him. On and on it 
went. Finally they tracked the guy down and caught him. What 
did he get? They dropped the firearms offences and for all of the 
incidents he got 15 months in jail.
<P>
	That guy should have been thrown in jail for 25 years. That is 
how we should handle misuse of firearms. That guy will be on 
the streets by June, I suppose with a totally unregistered illegal 
firearm waiting to threaten to kill the next person.
<P>
	My question for the member is this. Is it not true that what we 
need in Canada is not more control of law-abiding citizens but 
stricter control and stricter sentences against those who misuse 
firearms?
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Venne: </B>Mr. Speaker, I would like to give an answer to 
the member who asked why firearms should be registered, since 
it will not serve any purpose, etc. We heard his speech. I want to 
tell him that the purpose of registration is, first and foremost, to 
make people realize that a firearm is something designed to kill. 
It is not a toy.
<P>
	Some may claim that westerners are born with a gun in each 
hand, the fact remains that these guns were made to kill. This is 
the message being sent to the public right now. People must be 
aware that a firearm is dangerous. Once they realize that, they 
will give more thought to registering their guns, since the 
registration process requires that some steps be taken, through 
the mail or otherwise. People will ask themselves: Should I keep 
that firearm in the house? Is it necessary? Do I really need it, or 
am I just keeping it in some corner without taking real care of it, 
without being concerned about it and about the fact that anybody 
could use it to commit an offence?
<P>
	So, people will ask themselves if they need a firearm. I 
personally have firearms in my house. I am a hunter, but I have 
not gone hunting since 1992. As you know, the hunting season is 
in the fall. In 1992, we had the referendum on the Charlottetown 
Accord. In 1993, the federal election took place. In 1994, a 
provincial election was held in Quebec. And in 1995, we will 
have a referendum in our province. I had to give up hunting over 
the past few years, and I now wonder if I should keep my guns.
<P>
	I discussed the issue with my spouse and he agreed that, 
indeed, if we do not go hunting any more, then we should 
consider getting rid of these guns. I should add that, this year, 
my name was randomly selected to go goose hunting in 
Cap-Tourmente. This is an exceptional opportunity but, of 
course, I will not be able to make it because something more 
important will take place in Quebec, that is the referendum, and 
I will have to be there of course.
<P>
	So, we have to consider whether we want to keep our firearms 
at home, since we no longer use them. Do we really want to keep 
hunting? Can we still go hunting? Do we still have time for that 
activity? The fact that we need a license to own a gun, and that 
we have to register guns, makes us think about the whole issue 
and, as far I am concerned, promoting this kind of awareness is 
the purpose of that legislation. The other goal is of course to 
make our society safer, but the primary purpose is to make 
people aware of the fact that a gun is something that kills.

	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, although there is so much to add to what has been 
said already, I will keep my remarks very specific and short.
<P>
	The hon. member talks about awareness. I would like to bring 
to the attention of the House some other information and ask for 
her support at the same time.
<P>
	The hon. member was here earlier in the day when the member 
for Ottawa West commented that later today she was going to 
drive to the airport to pick up her daughter and grandson and 
return to the House to vote.
<P>
	If we can believe the statistics that have been collected, if the 
hon. member for Ottawa West or any other member were to drive 
to the airport in Saskatchewan, the chances of being injured or 
killed on the way to or from the airport or on the way to or from 
any community in the province would be much higher than 
being injured or killed by a firearm.
<P>
	According to statistics collected regarding the Trans-Canada 
and Yellowhead highway in Saskatchewan, let me briefly put 
three statistics on record. The number of accidents, injuries and 
fatalities over five years in the province of Saskatchewan, 
average per year accidents are 1,026 injured; 389 fatalities; 24 
on the highway.
<P>
	Firearm statistics: the five-year average in the province of 
Saskatchewan gives number of accidents with firearms, 18; 
number of injuries, 16; number killed, 2.6.
<P>
<B>(1255 ) </B>
<P>
	The third statistic, five-year average, the total number of 
homicides in the province of Saskatchewan are 28.2. The 
five-year average, number of homicides involving guns, 5.4. 
The average number of people killed on the highways in 
Saskatchewan average 24 a year. The average number of people 
killed in gun related homicides, 5 per year.
<P>
	This year the federal government has withdrawn all support 
for the national highways program. There is no commitment of 
federal funds to support the upgrading of highways in the 
province of Saskatchewan yet it is imposing increase costs on 
the people of Saskatchewan for safety reasons, to register 
firearms.
<P>
	I wonder if the representative of Canada's official opposition 
can tell us in the interests of safety whether she is as committed 
to national highways funding as she is committed to the national 
gun registry?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Venne:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be very brief. The member 
wonders what difference there is between a car and a firearm. It 
is very simple: A car is used for transportation purposes, while a 
firearm is used to kill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to share 
my time with another government member.
<P>
	Bill C-68, as drafted, has certainly raised a great deal of 
interest throughout Canada, particularly in the western 
provinces. One thing we can say is that this bill does in fact have 
the approval and support of a large number of Canadians.
<P>
	First of all, let us be clear that almost 80 per cent of Canadians 
are in favour of this bill, including 90 per cent of Quebecers, and 
I have also learned that 68 per cent to close to 80 per cent of 
Albertans back the government's gun control bill.
<P>
	Throughout this debate, we have listened to the opposition 
describe for us their vision of Canadian society. It is not a vision 
I share, particularly the vision of the members of the third party, 
who accuse us of daring to compare Canada and the United 
States. They would have us believe that the Canadian 
government wants to limit the rights of its citizens. Their 
allegation that the Canadian government, and especially the 
justice department, is violating the most fundamental rights of 
Canadians, is simply not true.
<P>
	I would also like to tell you that I come from a small 
community where rifles and hunting are part of everyday life. 
My grandfather was and my own father to this day is an avid 
hunter. With him, I explored the forests of this country, 
especially those in the Gaspé area. My father also taught me how 
to handle a firearm and I can only say I am most grateful. He did, 
however, instill in me a certain respect for firearms and the 
danger they can represent for society and for the individual.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is important to make the statement that never did the 
government ever intend to withdraw the right to hunt. That is a 
fundamental right we all share. However, it is the view of the 
government to make sure that people understand that owning a 
gun is a privilege. It is an item, a tool which we use that requires 
a lot of respect, requires some amount of control.
<P>
	I will not on any further about my personal experiences. A 
number of people testified in committee over the course of the 
past few months and without any doubt there is a definite need 
for gun control.
<P>
<B>(1300 ) </B>
<P>
	There are all kinds of reasons; social reasons such as health 
and safety which require some kind of control in order to 
maintain the Canada we know, the kind of society that 
regrettably some of us might take for granted.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13708"> 13708 </A></B>
<P>
	We were also told through allegations made by the opposition 
that the registration of guns would cost approximately $300 
million. That is absolutely false. We have to make it very clear 
to all Canadians that the registration of guns will basically cost 
$10 up to a maximum of 10 firearms.
<P>
	We are not confiscating weapons. We are asking Canadians to 
register their guns. We register dogs and automobiles and all 
kinds of things. It is very important to underline the cost and not 
to pursue the exaggerations put forward by the third party.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice said the cost of this program will be 
approximately an $85 million disbursement over the next five 
years. However, having listened to the testimonials from various 
health groups we were also told we would probably save $100 
million a year in various incarceration costs because there 
would be fewer Canadians either murdered or facing justice, 
fewer Canadians in the courts. The cost savings are quite 
incredible.
<P>
	Health officials from Quebec and other provinces estimated 
that in terms of lost productivity, economics, trauma care, the 
general cost to society once one has been either a victim of crime 
or a family member of a victim, close to $6 billion a year is lost 
in total Canadian productivity. Six billion dollars is an 
incredible amount of money. These stats which were brought to 
our attention we must use in order to demonstrate to the 
opposition and to the Canadian population that in the end with 
the registration of guns we are actually saving Canadians money 
and we are also obviously saving lives.
<P>
	Other aspects of the bill I find most interesting. Violence 
seems to be more and more of a preoccupation of the general 
public, and with reason especially in terms of guns. It was well 
explained to us by the opposition this morning, by the hon. 
member from Saint Hubert, but I think it is worth repeating. A 
statistic provided to us by a number of our witnesses states one 
stands twice the chance of being injured or killed by a firearm in 
rural Canada compared with any other urban area. One stands 
twice the chance because of the prevalence, the existence of 
firearms in these communities.
<P>
	We are also told according to the New England <I>Journal of 
Medicine</I> that with the presence of a gun in a home there is five 
times the chance of someone committing suicide. With the 
presence of a gun in a home there is three times the chance of a 
homicide.
<P>
	We also know guns are often the weapon of choice in domestic 
violence. Let us discuss domestic violence. I think it is a 
preoccupation shared by all parliamentarians regardless of their 
political stripe. We are told 87 per cent of victims of violence 
know their aggressors. We also learned 84 per cent of victims 
are women. Sixty-one per cent of the weapons used were long 
guns legally acquired. There is obviously a certain correlation 
with a weapon in a home and violence in the family. We must 
address that.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	I could go on and speak more about the police who would like 
to know when they go to a home following a call on conjugal 
violence what they will face. Does a police officer not have the 
right to know what is in the home, 12 gauge, a .22, whether there 
is a history of conjugal violence? Is the person in possession of a 
gun at a certain address posing a problem to his family and does 
he have a history of causing problems to society? Those are 
legitimate questions which police officers must ask every day. 
We are not only doing it for them, we are doing it for the 
families. We are doing it for the victims, for society as a whole. 
These are the questions we must ask.
<P>
	I would like to conclude on a positive note but regrettably I 
cannot. I am thinking of my brother who was at l'École 
polytechnique in December of 1989 and tells me the story of a 
young women he knew very well. She was in her late twenties. 
She had the courage to return to school and was on her way to 
write her final examination. My brother had bade her farewell, 
wishing her the best of luck in her work, in her new career. On 
that dreadful day in December of 1989 he was to learn a few 
hours later that she was the victim of one of the most cruel 
crimes ever committed in Canada.
<P>
	The passage of this bill will keep in mind the victims and will 
keep in mind those who regrettably could have been protected 
had such a law existed. I am hoping to pass this law for the 
victims of l'École polytechnique and above all to make sure 
fewer crimes and fewer deaths will result in the years to come.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, all of Canada heard it from this hon. member and 
the hon. member for Nunatsiaq who preceded him. Let it be 
known the Liberal government has made a statement today on 
two occasions that it is not a right to own a firearm but rather a 
privilege. Liberal members have made the judgment that a 
citizen is privileged to own property. Will they extend that 
philosophy to the right or privilege of Canadians to own cars, 
houses, boats, to go on a vacation, to vote freely? Is it a right or a 
privilege?
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to stand in the House, look right 
into the television camera and tell every aboriginal person it is 
not a right for them to own a gun but a privilege.
<P>
	The member said that in rural Canada a person has twice the 
chance of being injured by a firearm, that where firearms are 
present there is five times the chance of suicide and that where 
firearms are present there is three times the chance of homicide. 
We have asked the government time and time again during this 
debate and I ask this member now to give us one substantive, 
specific piece of evidence that if a firearm were registered these 
statistics would be different.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13709"> 13709 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1310 ) </B>
<P>
	We have asked the government on many occasions and it has 
not supplied to the House one substantive piece of evidence to 
support its claim that registration of firearms will cut down on 
accidents, crime or suicides. Registration will not affect this.
<P>
	I have talked to many law enforcement officers across the 
country specifically about officers attending the scene of a 
domestic disturbance. They have told me to the number that any 
police officer who attempts to enter a residence where there is a 
reported domestic disturbance and who does not first and 
foremost assume automatically there could be a firearm in there 
will not be on that beat tomorrow.
<P>
	The member told about this grand plan that the police officers 
would know in advance whether there is a firearm there. Now 
they automatically assume there is a firearm and have been 
doing that for many years. Many of police officers have told me 
the reason they are staying alive today is they assume and take 
precautions which is part of their training.
<P>
	I ask the member to stand up, face the cameras and tell all of 
Canada including aboriginal peoples that owning a firearm is a 
privilege extended to them by the Liberal Government of 
Canada.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I caution the hon. 
parliamentary secretary that he has only one minute remaining 
to respond. I ask members to be aware that when members are 
speaking for only 10 minutes there are only five minutes of 
questions and comments. Accordingly, if a member uses the 
entire five minutes there will be virtually no time to respond.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, in the United States one has the 
right to bear arms. In Canada it is peace, order and good 
government. This is what we are attempting to do.
<P>
	We will defend the right to hunt but like anything else 
sometimes there are privileges and owning a gun is one of them. 
This is not the United States. This is Canada. We are Canadians. 
We have lived and abided by this philosophy. One thing the bill 
will certainly prove is that the rule of law will prevail.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is not a right to own a firearm in the United States 
either. The Supreme Court of the United States stated the second 
amendment to the U.S. constitution giving the right to bear arms 
applies to state militias in their wish to defend against an 
arbitrary national government. That was the point of view of the 
amendment, not to give individuals the right to bear arms. This 
is a misunderstanding many Americans and certainly a great 
many Canadians have. However, the subject is not the United 
States.
<P>
	Bill C-68 is at third reading now. We wanted to create a bill 
which will be fairer to lawful gun owners and which will offer 
additional protection to Canadian citizens and reduce crime.
<P>
	Members opposite ask how we will reduce crime and how 
many lives will we save. I have to agree there is no common 
denominator that is going to give us that figure. Certainly with 
the information available from witnesses who appeared before 
the committee we have every reason to believe a good many 
lives will be saved.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	I want to talk about what we are going to require from a 
firearms owner who has 10 or fewer long guns. We are going to 
ask that person to register his or her firearms. The registration 
will take place between January 1, 1998 and December 31, 2003. 
The cost for registering the firearms will probably be nothing to 
begin with or for the most part will be $10. One will also be able 
to register 10 firearms for the amount of $10. Toward the end of 
the five year period that figure may go from $10 to as high as $18 
for the registration of 10 firearms.
<P>
	For someone who has 10 long guns there will not be an 
inspection of that person's home. If there are 10 or fewer 
firearms there is no inspection whatsoever for safe storage. If in 
any case an inspector requires verification of a serial number or 
other information, that verification would take place outside the 
home or perhaps the owner could be requested to bring his or her 
firearm to the inspector's office.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Or they might 
come to the home.
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacLellan:</B> They do not go inside the home. If it is more 
beneficial for the individual to have the inspector come to the 
home, the inspector could wait outside the door while the 
individual brings the firearm for verification. There is no right 
of that inspector to go into the home.
<P>
	We are saying it will cost a maximum of $18 but more likely 
$10 for the registration of 10 firearms for life. Those firearms do 
not need to be registered again unless they are sold to someone 
else. That is the situation.
<P>
	If an individual wants to gain a possession licence then that 
registration will take place beginning January 1, 1996 and will 
continue for five years until December 31, 2001. The cost of the 
possession licence will not be anything to begin with. There will 
be a fee after the system has been in operation for a while during 
the five year period. For those who want to renew their firearms 
acquisition certificate and gain a possession licence toward the 
end of the five year period, it could be as much as $60. That 
would give the person a possession licence for five years.
<P>
	There is going to be a training course for those who want to 
purchase a new firearm. This requirement is in place at the 
present time. However, if someone wants a possession licence, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13710"> 13710 </A></B>
<P>
already has firearms and has no  intention of buying new 
firearms, then the training course will not be required.
<P>
	There is nothing here that is going to dreadfully harm the 
lawful gun owner. Sure there is going to be an inconvenience and 
there are going to be other things in the regulations which may 
be an inconvenience.
<P>
	The member for Saint-Hubert talked about trigger locks. The 
regulations are going to require that new firearms purchased at 
retail dealers have a trigger lock on purchase.
<P>
<B>(1320 ) </B>
<P>
	That is not going to be a major inconvenience. It is going to be 
a safety factor. What we want to do is to create safety in the 
homes, to ask for and require safe storage, not to unduly 
interfere with the rights of the individual. By registration and 
requiring safe storage, we hope people will realize what a 
firearm can mean in the hands of someone who would use it 
improperly, whether that is someone who steals the firearm from 
the home or someone who is intending to commit suicide.
<P>
	We have heard time and again in this House and in committee 
that in Canada on average there are 1,400 people killed by 
firearms every year. Approximately 1,100 of those are suicides. 
If the gun is not readily available, the chance of that suicide 
taking place has diminished. If there is a locked door, even if it is 
a glass door, and the key is somewhere else, it is going to be 
somewhat of an effort to find that key. If the ammunition is 
somewhere else, it is going to be a deterrent.
<P>
	Many people have told us that some people fail to plan a 
suicide well in advance. Sometimes it is an instant decision. 
Some people decide they want to use firearms. If they do not use 
a firearm, they will not use anything else. Psychiatrists have told 
us that in committee.
<P>
	We made very important amendments to this bill in 
committee. I think personally it is a much better bill now than it 
was before it went to committee.
<P>
	We have taken the first offence for the non-registration of 
long guns out of the Criminal Code and put it in the firearms act. 
We have changed the inspection provisions, an example of 
which I gave earlier.
<P>
	For those who are veterans, those who have heirlooms and 
relics, handguns which would otherwise be prohibited and only 
sold to those who have similar firearms, they can pass them 
along to members of their family. These handguns are 
mementoes of a very important time in some people's lives, 
perhaps when they served overseas. This is extremely important 
and is the sort of thing we want to do. We did it because we heard 
witnesses and because the members of the committee worked 
together.
<P>
	This bill is going to be a good act. It is not going to be a perfect 
one but it is going to be a good one. Along with the other things 
this government hopes to do, it will reduce crime in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very interested to 
hear the hon. parliamentary secretary is already changing the 
bill. It has not even been passed yet. I wonder if this comes under 
section 110.
<P>
	Bring the guns to the door indeed. We know better than that. It 
is not in the bill and the hon. member should not say things like 
that.
<P>
	He talks about the right and privilege question again. I 
wonder, when did the common law die in North America if what 
the hon. member says is true. I believe the hon. member is a 
lawyer. I hope he has read his Blackstone. If he has not, I might 
refresh his memory.
<P>
	Blackstone's chronicles state that any Englishman has the 
right to possess personal weapons. Without those personal 
weapons, no other rights of Englishmen are effective. They are 
void. That is very clearly spelled out. It is a long and ancient 
tradition in the English speaking world.
<P>
	Now that it has been declared by the Liberal government that 
firearms, a piece of property, are something we are privileged to 
own, what other types of property does this government intend 
to declare a privilege, seditious literature perhaps? Where do we 
go from here?
<P>
	The hon. member mentioned the question of veterans and 
their heirlooms. I do not know how many letters I and other 
members have received that begin with words: ``I carried a gun 
for my country for three years and now my country does not trust 
me with a gun. What is happening to my country?'' I would like 
to hear the hon. parliamentary secretary's comments on that. 
That is a very common observation I have run into. In fact the 
most vociferous opponents to this legislation or gun control 
legislation in general actually are the veterans.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacLellan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will deal with the last point 
first with respect to the veterans who have a lot of firearms. In 
Atlantic Canada a great many of the veterans have Enfields. 
That is a long gun which is neither prohibited nor restricted now, 
nor will it be after this bill is passed. It will not be restricted in 
any way. It will have to be registered but it can be utilized as it 
was before. It can be passed on by the owner to anyone he or she 
wishes. Other than registration there is no further change in the 
ownership for that individual. The firearm will have to be 
licensed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> That is the point.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> What about the 600,000 you are taking away?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13711"> 13711 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. Clearly this is a 
serious matter the House is deliberating. All interventions must 
be made through the Chair. We are certainly feeding on each 
other's time. With the little time left for the hon. parliamentary 
secretary I would ask him to be succinct.
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacLellan:</B> The only difference will be that there will be 
registration, the possession licence for the owner and a 
registration certificate for the firearm. Nothing else will change.
<P>
	With respect to the owner of the firearm coming to the door to 
show and give pertinent information to an inspector, that is 
exactly what can happen with an agreement between the two 
parties. That is not a difficult situation.
<P>
	With respect to the right to bear firearms, the hon. member is 
talking about the bill of rights in the U.K. which was passed in 
the 17th century and gave the right to bear arms. He will also 
note there has been very meaningful gun control in the United 
Kingdom. If it applied to the right of every individual to have 
any kind of firearm he or she wanted, then certainly that gun 
control would not have taken place.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the rest of the Reform 
speakers will be dividing their time.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I am pleased to have the opportunity to present my arguments 
regarding Bill C-68. I would like to begin by reading excerpts 
from a letter which was read in the House in 1976 during the 
debate on Bill C-83.
<P>
	I quote: ``The proposal to give bureaucrats the authority to 
determine who may or may not possess a firearm is an alarming 
example of the philosophy that ``all that is not compulsory must 
be prohibited''. If this measure is to become law, it is not 
difficult to predict that within a few years firearms in Canada 
will be restricted to a privileged few and that these arms will all 
be registered with their serial number. Subsequently it would be 
easy for a megalomaniac government to seize all rifles under the 
pretence of emergency measures and therefore secure the 
submissiveness of the people. If you think that the present 
government's policy is indeed very moderate and my fears 
exaggerated and unjustified, or even paranoiac, let me remind 
you that fascism is like cancer: if they are not restrained from 
the very beginning, they can completely destroy our system.
<P>
	``There is no proof that firearm control can effectively reduce 
the rate of crime except in a totalitarian state. Of course, with a 
total lack of freedom and with the support of relentless police 
forces there is not much violent crime''.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	``But having lived and worked in some of those peaceful 
paradises I do not hesitate to take the moderate risks and 
responsibilities involved in living in a free society even if it is 
armed.''
<P>
	``If my government is not afraid of me, in return I will have no 
reason to fear that same government. If this moderately 
repressive measure becomes law, I will start to become 
alarmed''.
<P>
	I wrote this letter and Réal Caouette, the hon. member for 
Abitibi, read it. Things have not changed: the Liberals are still 
proposing repressive laws and I am still defending the rights of 
individual citizens.
<P>
	I am, I always have been and I always will be opposed to the 
registration of firearms used for hunting, searches without 
warrants, the confiscation of private property without 
compensation and a minister being invested with the power to 
issue regulations without the approval of Parliament. A reform 
government would put an end to all of this; we promise.
<P>
	Currently, Quebecers in rural areas and in the north-farmers, 
lumberjacks, trappers, etc.-are not being represented by their 
MPs.
<P>
	Liberal, Conservative and Bloc members all refused to 
support the hundreds of thousands of members of a seven-group 
coalition from Quebec who are opposed to Bill C-68. 
Ultimately, the Reform Party decided to represent their interests 
in Parliament.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Réal Caouette knew that I was not one of his supporters, but 
he presented my letter here for the same reason that we 
Reformers are representing the people of rural Quebec. He was a 
genuine populist and he despised the unnecessary heavy hand of 
government.
<P>
	We here are all aware of the threats to civil liberty in clauses 
99 to 112 of Bill C-68, even with the feeble conciliatory 
amendments made in committee. These clauses have been 
discussed in detail, both in the House and at scores of 
information meetings and mass rallies throughout the country. 
And they were at least partly reflected in the recent landslide 
won by Ontario politicians who came out and strongly opposed 
Bill C-68.
<P>
	Instead of further addressing those clauses, I would like to 
draw the attention of the House to some little-known historical 
information. I have been studying the weapons laws of pre-war 
Germany, and they are very closely parallel to existing and 
proposed laws in Canada. I will read a couple of examples. 
``Firearms acquisition permits must only be issued to persons of 
undoubted reliability, and only upon proof of need''. Here is 
another: ``Firearms can only be professionally sold or otherwise 
transferred domestically if they bear the manufacturer's or 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13712"> 13712 </A></B>
<P>
dealer's company name or registered trademark and a 
consecutive manufacturer's serial number''.
<P>
	The legislation also provided for confiscations without legal 
action and without compensation, for the prohibition of certain 
types of weapons, and for arbitrary changes in regulations and 
fees.
<P>
	In fact, the justice minister could have saved a lot of money by 
dismissing his high-priced legal help, getting a copy of the 
Reichtag legislation and running it through a photocopier, 
except that this document contains no search and seizure 
provision. Of course, outside of the English-speaking world 
search warrants are of as little consequence as they are to our 
Minister of Justice. And the penalties for non-compliance were 
much lighter than those proposed in Bill C-68. O Canada.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	Some friends have suggested to me that I should not talk about 
these matters because by drawing attention to the recent past I 
am going to somehow destroy my credibility as an opponent of 
gun control by being too strident, too extreme. I disagree. After 
all, I am only the messenger drawing attention to irrefutable 
historical fact. Anti-gun people, above all others, should not 
shoot the messenger.
<P>
	The laws are essentially the same. What I want people here to 
understand is that governments often chip away at civil liberty 
little by little by little. A common destination can be reached by 
many different roads. I am certainly not suggesting that the 
self-righteous authoritarianism of this government places it on 
the same level as the Third Reich. In fact I am satisfied that 
everything the Liberals and Conservatives have done and 
propose to do regarding guns reflects a sincere belief that gun 
control will somehow reduce violent crime.
<P>
	The fact that this is not logical and has not worked anywhere 
else where it has been tried does not deter them, because they are 
driven not by logic but by their elitist prejudices. And prejudice 
is a very weak foundation on which to build the laws of a nation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have been listening to the debate now for the last 
couple of hours and I find it very, very interesting to listen to the 
doublespeak and the doubletalk and all the rhetoric that has been 
going on.
<P>
	I listened to the first speech given by the justice minister, and 
he made a statement that I think all of Canada ought to know. It 
is one of the most ridiculous statements I have ever heard. He 
said that criminals will identify themselves because they will 
not register their guns. Criminals will identify themselves. I am 
not taking that statement out of context. If that is not 
doublespeak, if that is not one of the most ridiculous things I 
have ever heard! By targeting law-abiding citizens, he said we 
will somehow flush out the criminal element.
<P>
	The people of Canada ought to know what debate is taking 
place here today. He says the cost will be minimal. He says that 
we have too many guns in society and this will simply be a minor 
inconvenience. The contradictions are there. We have too many 
guns in society. We have to get rid of them, but this will only be a 
minor inconvenience. It will not really restrict law-abiding gun 
owners. Right there are the contradictions. They are talking out 
of both sides of their mouths. I have a difficult time sitting here 
calmly listening to this debate.
<P>
	One of the things they say is that it will make society safer, 
and then they go on to explain how they are going to tie up the 
police and all of our resources. How does that make society safer 
when you are dealing with 99.99 per cent of the people who are 
not a problem and you are going to tie up your police behind 
their desks dealing with these law-abiding citizens rather than 
being out on the street dealing with the criminal element? That 
defies logic. That is speaking out of both sides of your mouth. 
That will never work.
<P>
	They are going to increase our taxes. They are saying it will 
not cost very much, $10 for 10 guns, et cetera. Who is going to 
pay for it? The finance minister has admitted that the increase in 
taxes is destroying jobs. If they destroy jobs in this country, the 
first people who are going to suffer are the young men of this 
country. Do not tell me that is not a risk or will not increase 
crime in this country. They cannot have it both ways. They are 
actually doing the opposite of what they are leading us to believe 
in their speeches. This is really a problem.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	We have repeatedly stated that the registration system will 
provide information to the wrong people. It will fall into the 
wrong hands. A senior RCMP officer admitted that. He said 
there is no way we can prevent criminals from obtaining the 
information. We have a problem.
<P>
	They talk about Great Britain and how much safer it is there. 
In Great Britain 59 per cent of the attempted burglaries are 
committed while someone is at home and the lights are on. In the 
U.S.A., less than 9 per cent of burglaries are committed when 
people are at home and the lights are on. Why? Because a 
criminal will not put himself at risk. I do not have time to go 
through the whole argument, but research shows that victims of 
attempted robbery and assault are less likely to be injured if they 
can defend themselves.
<P>
	There are so many statements that contradict themselves. For 
example, the government proposes to ban .25 and .32 calibre 
handguns and handguns with barrel lengths of less than 4.14 
inches, implying that will make society safer. What does that 
do? Does that restrict the criminal element? No. They will 
simply go to the guns that are larger and more effective.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> More killing power.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13713"> 13713 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Yes, they will have 
more killing power, as my colleague has suggested.
<P>
	This is convoluted logic. He says that over 500,000 handguns 
are dangerous and they need to be banned, but they are not 
dangerous if they leave them in the hands of their owners right 
now. There is a contradiction in what they are doing.
<P>
	I wonder if my colleague would like to comment on some of 
the doublespeak, some of the contradictory statements we have 
been hearing today that somehow this will improve public 
safety. I rather doubt it will.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I do not doubt that the 
hon. colleague would like to respond, but the member has used 
up the entire five minutes for questions or comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, what is the alleged purpose of Bill C-68? To listen to 
the Liberals, Bill C-68 is somehow magically supposed to keep 
our homes and streets safer. However, simply put, Bill C-68 will 
not prevent the criminal misuse of firearms.
<P>
	There are two principal parts to the bill to which many people 
object. The first is the registration of rifles and shotguns. 
Criminals will not register their guns. Even the Liberals admit 
that. Therefore, the legislation will do nothing to prevent 
premeditated crime. Criminals do not rob banks with hunting 
rifles. If shotguns are used they invariably use a barrel that has 
been sawed off, which makes it illegal and not registrable. 
Consequently, Bill C-68 will not effect any positive change.
<P>
	The second part involves the banning of hundreds of 
thousands of currently legal sports firearms. I speak of .25 
calibre, .32 calibre, and handguns with barrel lengths of 105 
millimetres or less. According to the minister, the reason for the 
ban is the fact that these firearms are inaccurate and ineffective 
and therefore there is no justification for owning them. What is 
really inaccurate and ineffective is the minister's research that 
came up with this whole rationale.
<P>
	The .32 calibre is the World Cup and Olympic calibre. Canada 
has won many cups and medals with this so-called inaccurate 
and ineffective firearm. Linda Thom, who used a firearm 
proposed to be banned under Bill C-68 to win a gold medal for 
Canada in an Olympic competition, said that she represents the 
minister and stated that the firearm she used was so inaccurate 
and ineffective that her winning that medal for Canada must 
have been a fluke.
<P>
	Many people who have never used a gun assume that 
recreational shooting involves only buying a gun and a box of 
ammunition, going to the range, pointing at the target and 
pulling the trigger. If that were true it certainly would suggest 
that there is little sport involved in the activity. The truth is that 
real recreational and competitive shooting involves much more. 
The firearm itself requires much consideration and work, both in 
the selection and refinement of its use. Purchasers must  
consider barrel length, sighting radius, the type of sight, type of 
action, type and fit of grips, trigger pull, as well as many other 
considerations. Many of these items require changes and 
modifications to suit the type of shooting gun as well as the style 
and ability of the individual.
<P>
<B>(1345 ) </B>
<P>
	Ammunition is rarely bought at the store but instead is custom 
loaded by the individual. Custom loaded ammunition is much 
more accurate than store bought. The actual loading is a 
specialized activity in itself. Each firearm shoots differently and 
the development of the best ammunition is an activity that 
requires time and dedication to the sport.
<P>
	When one gets down to shooting, it involves much more than 
pointing at the target and pulling the trigger. Each club 
competition is rigidly controlled for both safety and enjoyment. 
The objectives of each shoot are designed to be both challenging 
and enjoyable. Participants compete against both their own 
abilities and those of other competitors.
<P>
	Shooting involves the development of a series of skills, a 
great deal of practice and friendly competition, just like any 
other sport. Stereotyping of the sport of competitive shooters is 
not justifiable. Enthusiasts range from labourers to office 
workers, mechanics to doctors, men and women.
<P>
	The minister claims, in rather vague terms, that registering 
rifles and shotguns will prevent crime and thus save lives. A 
total of 1,354 people died from firearm related incidents in 
1992. This includes suicide, homicide, accidental death and 
legal intervention. The minister has not given any figures on his 
projections of lives to be saved as a result of the legislation or 
even demonstrated that any lives will in fact be saved. At the 
same time, he implies this is the principal reason for his action.
<P>
	Many of the current supporters of the legislation do so with 
the rationalization that if it saves any lives at all then it is worth 
whatever it costs. Let us have a look at these costs. In doing this, 
I am going to use the minister's own figures despite the fact that 
I believe them to be inaccurate and misleading.
<P>
	According to figures tabled by the minister at the justice 
committee it will now cost $118.9 million to set up the 
registration system. This is up from the original estimate of $85 
million. What the minister avoids talking about is the actual cost 
of registration.
<P>
	All handguns are registered now so we know the cost to the 
system to register a firearm. That cost is $82 per firearm. The 
minister and his advisor, Wendy Cukier, have estimated the 
number of rifles and shotguns in the country to be about six 
million, which is curious given the auditor general puts the 
figure around 18 million. Using the six million figure and the 
known cost of registration, puts the actual cost of registration at 
$492 million. If the true amount is halfway between the two 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13714"> 13714 </A></B>
<P>
estimates on the number of firearms then there goes another 
billion dollars in bureaucratic spending.
<P>
	Somehow I think that if we really worked at it we could find 
something better to spend that money on.
<P>
	One in nine women will develop breast cancer during their 
lives. This year alone 17,000 women will be newly diagnosed 
with the disease and over 5,400 of those will die of breast cancer. 
If cancer of the testicles had statistics like this the men on the 
other side of the House would cross their legs and pass $500 
million worth of funding for research and prevention before the 
end of a single day. They would tell the women on their side of 
the House how to vote as is the Liberal procedure.
<P>
	However, as it stands now, they would rather spend $118.9 
million setting up a registration program for rifles and shotguns 
without any evidence that it will save a single life.
<P>
	I have done some research into the use of $118.9 million for 
the detection and treatment of breast cancer. The results were 
very interesting. This $118.9 million could double detection 
screening of women in the appropriate age group. Experts tell 
me that this would prevent about one-third of the current deaths 
from this dreaded disease. That amounts to 1,710 women a year. 
That is more people than the total number of firearm's related 
deaths and we have not heard one single word of evidence that 
even a single life would be saved through following the 
minister's ill-conceived legislation.
<P>
	There would be those who would point out that this 
expenditure for breast cancer treatment would be an annual cost 
whereas the setting up of the registration system is a one time 
cost. Ignoring the fact that setting up the registration system 
does not include the cost of registration itself, which is many 
times the initial cost, I looked at what a one time funding of 
$118.9 million would do for the problem of breast cancer in the 
long term.
<P>
<B>(1350 ) </B>
<P>
	As we all know, each disease has an associated health care 
cost. The cost of a terminal breast cancer patient for hospital 
time, chemotherapy and other expenses averages about 
$100,000. This does not include the human cost of the victim or 
her family. If we could prevent the death of 1,710 women a year 
with an associated health care savings of $100,000 each we 
would reduce health care expenses by $171 million.
<P>
	Although the initial $118.9 million spent on the real saving of 
lives versus the minister's wild fantasy of forcing his values on 
others would be a one-time expenditure, 70 per cent of the 
health care system's savings would provide this amount each 
year while continuing to save the health care system an 
additional $52 million a year. In light of this, the minister's 
fantasy does not seem very supportable.
<P>
	We are at a very troubled time in our country's finances. The 
government is talking about many cuts in federal spending. The 
cuts are necessary but it means the government has to learn how 
to set priorities in order to preserve the quality of life while 
addressing the financial problems we face.
<P>
	It seems the government, particularly the Minister of Justice, 
has some very mixed priorities. It is time to tell the minister that 
restricting the activities of law-abiding citizens is not a priority. 
Its legislation is a waste of the taxpayers' money at a time when 
we have none to waste.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to enter the debate on this matter.
<P>
	I was here this morning when the Minister of Justice gave his 
presentation. He talked about the members of the third party 
trafficking in fiction. If the member who just spoke had been 
here he would have been the beneficiary of some of the 
information, in particular the cost of registration.
<P>
	The minister was very clear in pointing out we cannot 
compare the registration cost of handguns to long guns because 
with handgun registration there are police investigations, et 
cetera involved which makes it much more expensive.
<P>
	We also had the member for Wild Rose telling the House there 
is no difference in crime rates between the United States of 
America and Canada. Let me tell the Reform Party that is 
trafficking in fiction and Canadians will not buy that line.
<P>
	Members of the Reform Party say we have had registration of 
handguns which has not lowered the crime rate. Let me suggest 
to them that when a police officer arrests an individual who is 
carrying an unregistered handgun and he does not have a permit 
to carry that gun, the police officer can now arrest that 
individual for the possession of a restricted firearm. He can take 
him to the police station and no doubt the investigation will 
reveal that many crimes have been committed.
<P>
	Let me also use another example that was cited by the 
Minister of Justice this morning. It relates to an incident where 
police officers can raid a motorcycle club where they will find 
20, 30 or 40 long guns. Under the present legislation there is no 
way for the police to determine whether those are illegal guns.
<P>
	It is important to get all the facts. This legislation is trying to 
move toward maintaining the kind of society Canadians have 
come to accept. We do not believe in mirroring the Americans 
and their crime rate.
<P>
<B>(1355 ) </B>
<P>
	On Tuesday, June 6, an article Second Opinion appeared in the 
Kitchener-Waterloo <I>Record</I>. The author of this article was John 
Dadds of Kitchener who was an OPP police officer for 20 years 
<P>

<B><A NAME="13715"> 13715 </A></B>
<P>
and previously was with the metro Toronto and London, England 
forces.
<P>
	This former police officer took aim at the Ontario Handgun 
Association which produced an 84 page booklet called ``Politics 
of Panic''. In his article he says that what he wanted to do was to 
make sure that the police have the ability to control the spread of 
guns, the police have the ability to control the use of guns and to 
make sure that the United States does not become a model for 
this country.
<P>
	In closing, I have a question for the member. We have heard 
often enough from members of the Reform Party about 
commissioned 1-900 calls to hear what their constituents have 
to say. With the exception of three members who are a bit more 
enlightened than the rest, when are they going to come clean and 
actually start listening to their constituents and not say to us, as 
was said earlier on by the member for Crowfoot, that they do not 
believe in polls. You guys promised to represent-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. Thus far we have 
had a good vigorous debate, meeting all the criteria of good 
parliamentary debate. I hope that will continue after question 
period. I would caution also all members that all interventions 
must be made through the Chair, otherwise we know what can 
happen.
<P>
	With one minute remaining, the hon. member for Kootenay 
West-Revelstoke because the Speaker will want to get on with 
members' statements.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> Mr. Speaker, in response to the direct question 
that the hon. member finally asked, I sent out a questionnaire in 
my riding. The question was: ``Do you support the mandatory 
registration of rifles and shotguns, as expressed in the 
government's Bill C-68?'' It is a fair and honest question. The 
result was 84 per cent no; 16 per cent yes.
<P>
	As far as the hon. member suggesting that the Reform Party, 
the national opposition party, is trafficking in myths, I would 
suggest to him that he might look to his own party when he talks 
about cardboard registration. The government is going to keep 
the cost of registering rifles and shotguns down by giving 
everybody a simple card to fill out and mail in and the firearms 
will be registered.
<P>
	I suggest to you, Mr. Speaker, that if the government is 
actually stupid enough to do that, we are going to have 
neighbours registering other neighbours, enemies registering 
enemies, pro-gun people registering people opposed to 
firearms. Everybody in the world will have an Uzi because that 
is the way those cards will be filled out.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It being 2 p.m., we will now proceed to 
Statements by Members.

	<B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Lincoln, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, recently I 
attended the annual Stoney Creek battle re-enactment in my 
riding of Lincoln. For all of us the war of 1812 was a war we 
learned about in history books. There are no pictures, videos or 
films of the battle.
<P>
	Therefore the annual re-enactment of the battle of Stoney 
Creek takes on an even greater significance, not only as an 
educational experience but more important it portrays the 
realities of war and the struggles suffered by our countrymen.
<P>
	Many who attended the re-enactment voiced their concern 
over provisions of Bill C-68 which might jeopardize future 
re-enactments. The British North America Living History 
Association presented a brief to the Standing Committee on 
Justice. I am sure committee members have taken into 
consideration the points made to ensure re-enactments can 
continue unobstructed.
<P>
	The Stoney Creek battle re-enactment is a community event 
and a source of pride for the city. The quality and performance of 
the re-enactment has earned Stoney Creek praise throughout 
North America. Let us not lose the opportunity to continue to

environmentally and socially destructive megaprojects, 
measures to reduce multinational debt and the end to structural

House that this week is Canadian occupational safety and health 
week, a week designated to focus public attention on the 
importance of preventing injury and illness in the workplace.
<P>
	This year's slogan, ``Communicating: Open the Channels'', 
stresses the need for co-operation. The importance of 
prevention is clear when we look at the figures. In 1993 alone 
733 Canadian workers were killed and nearly 830,000 were 
injured while at work. This translates into more than 15 million 
work days lost with direct and indirect costs of more than $10 
million.
<P>
	I commend the people trying to reduce these numbers by 
increasing awareness of the problem. I urge all members of the

economic and political integration.
<P>
	In this climate of global change we are witnessing the 
dismantling of barriers to commerce regionally, continentally 
and globally. This coupled with the changing nature of 
federalism in this country offers the maritime provinces the 
opportunity if not the necessity to redefine their role within 
Confederation.
<P>
	For too long the common concerns of maritimers have been 
diluted on the national stage by far too much local parochialism. 
If the maritime provinces are to re-establish their economies in 
the context of the national or international marketplace strong 
leadership must be shown now to arrive at a true economic and 
by extension political union of the maritime provinces.
<P>
	I call on the maritime political, business and economic 
leaders to take up the challenge to place the maritime provinces 
in the position to succeed as Canada continues to undergo

	Another idea is to call on the Deputy Prime Minister on behalf 
of Shady Acres retirement homes. Tell her an amount is still

the past ten years.
<P>
	To continue to add to the burden of a generation that has 
already undergone great hardship is just plain cruel. The 
minister must withdraw his proposal and stop attacking the 
young.

	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
tonight's vote on Bill C-68 will be a decisive moment in Ontario 
politics. Ninety-seven Liberal members will have an 
opportunity to represent the views of their constituents. We will 
have a chance to see if last week's lesson in populism renews the 
desire of all members to do what is right for their ridings and 
their province.
<P>
	Time allocation may speed some bills through the House but 
Ontario members know the final vote on this issue will take 
place in 1997 on the gun bill, on pensions, on sexual orientation 
and employment equity. Liberals must choose between 
supporting their party or supporting their constituents. Will it be 
Liberal, Tory, same old story? Do not allow your decisions to be 
Mcleoded. Vote with your constituents.

<P>
	Just as we faced some tough questions on the bill, it is time for 
the other side to answer one or two. We know who they are, the 
new politicians, the great populists, the members who came here 
to represent the folks back home; the wundekinders who will 
ignore special interests and stay true to their constituents.
<P>
	I think their whip said it best when he said a few minutes ago 
to vote the will of your constituents even if it bucks the party 
line. The member from Simcoe-Centre was telling us the same 
thing. In the face of a clear consensus, in the face of the clear 
wishes of the constituents in Calgary, their leader is kowtowing 
to the gun lobby, turning his back on his constituents and bowing 
to the will of his caucus-some populist.

``Between the Lines'', an information kit on literacy and crime 
prevention which points out ways in which we can make a 
difference in reducing crime in our modern society.

	The answer to crime does not lie only in building more prisons

by everyone in reducing and eliminating the social inequalities 
and injustices that contribute to crime in the first place.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="UNEMPLOYMENTINSURANCEREFORM">UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE REFORM</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, with its UI reform, the federal government is 
preparing once again to substantially cut eligibility and UI 
benefits. According to today's <I>Globe and Mail</I>, Quebec will be 
the principal victim of the additional cuts to the unemployment 
insurance plan, which will amount to $1.6 billion.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Would he confirm that, 
as usual, Quebec will bear the cost of the additional cuts of $1.6 
billion in unemployment insurance, since it will assume 40 per 
cent of the cuts for a total of $605 million as compared with only 
$255 million for Ontario?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I said it yesterday and I will repeat it today: the 
government has reached no decision yet. The Minister of Human 
Resources Development is currently conferring on the matter. 
There will be a reform of all social programs in the fall to enable 
us to put funds at the disposal of those who want to work and 
take training courses.
<P>
	This is our focus-we want to enable workers to find jobs and 
recover their dignity. The specific program will be announced 
once consultations have been completed. At the moment, no one 
can claim that one party or another in Canada is forced to 
contribute more than the others.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in other words, if we unscramble the Prime 
Minister's answer, we may conclude that no decision has been 
made, the project is in the works and the <I>Globe and Mail</I> was 
right to refer to it today.
<P>
	I would ask the Prime Minister if we are to understand that he 
and his government want to put off a decision until the fall, that 
is after the referendum on Quebec sovereignty, so that the 
announcement of the cuts, affecting the unemployed in Quebec 
primarily, will follow afterwards?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first I am pleased to hear that there will be a 
referendum. We are looking forward to having one.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> I hope that the question will 
be clear, that they will say ``we want to separate from Canada'' 
and that they will not try to trick people into thinking that the 
intent of the referendum, is anything other than separation.
<P>
	As for us and our UI program, reforming all the social 
programs requires consultation with the provincial 
governments. The minister is consulting them now. The papers 
can only speculate at the moment. This is not the first time 
articles have appeared in the papers, with the results of the 
federal government programs differing entirely from what the 
<I>Globe and Mail</I> saying. This is usually exactly what happens.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I see that the Prime Minister seems willing to talk 
about the referendum. He told us that he is looking forward to 
the referendum and to a straightforward question. Quebecers 
know full well that the only thing the Prime Minister can offer 
Quebec is the status quo, the same old unfair cuts, and that his 
only objective is to finish the job started in 1982.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Hear, Hear.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> Since he wants to talk about the referendum 
and wants a straightforward answer-because the answer will be 
as straightforward as the question-, does the Prime Minister 
admit that, faced with the decision made by a sovereignist, 
clearly sovereignist Quebec people, he, as the Prime Minister of 
Canada, will then have to sit at the table and negotiate on a 
one-to-one basis with the Quebec government?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first of all, we would really like to know what the 
question is. They came up in December with a scheme that the 
people very quickly got wise to. This whole scheme was nothing 
but smoke and mirrors. They then tried to change directions, so 
that the December program was already over by March. 
Quebecers will probably get wise to the new June scheme by 
October. Everyone will understand that the opposition leader's 
question is purely hypothetical, because I know that if 
Quebecers are asked, ``Do you want to separate from Canada?'', 
they will always vote to stay in Canada. I am convinced of that.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.

<HR>
<B><A NAME="13720"> 13720 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister uses the word ``scheme'' to 
refer to what is the clear and straightforward expression of an 
economic responsibility initiative in the mutual interest of the 
people of both Canada and Quebec. He himself will have to take 
note of that after Quebecers vote Yes to sovereignty.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> I ask the Prime Minister, who is one of the 
champions of federalism without any ideas, any thoughts or 
anything else to offer, how he can claim to be addressing 
Quebecers' desire for change, when he and other federalists 
have nothing to offer Quebec but the status quo, the federal 
system that has always been denounced by Quebec federalists, 
as well as resignation and increasing encroachment on Quebec's 
areas of jurisdiction?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition rose in the House today to 
explain to Quebecers: You will vote for sovereignty, but you will 
keep Canadian citizenship, the Canadian currency, the Canadian 
passport, the economic and political union with Canada. The 
only thing missing in his bag of tricks is what I said in 
Trois-Rivières: ``We in the Parti Quebecois and the Bloc 
Quebecois will keep the name ``Canada''. You can find another 
one for the rest of Canada, because Canada is so great that we 
want to keep the name `Canada` for ourselves''.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I will take the next two questions.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Interesting.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> Mr. Speaker, perhaps the Prime Minister is 
not interested in what happens to the economic interests of 
Quebec after sovereignty. I want to ask him whether, if only for 
the sake of the economic interests of Ontario and the rest of 
Canada and the need to maintain trade relations between the 
parties, he would not feel obliged as Prime Minister to sit down 
and negotiate with Mr. Parizeau who would have a mandate from 
the people of Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am willing to meet Mr. Parizeau at any time to discuss 
the concerns of Quebecers: job creation, economic growth, and 
improving the situation with regard to public finances. That is 
what people want to discuss. I only hope that the Leader of the 
Opposition will tell Quebecers that their proposal is about 
separation. That is what they want.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	They would have Quebecers believe that once they have 
separated, they will still be part of Canada. This is a mirage, a lot 
of smoke and mirrors and shows a lack of intellectual honesty.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker. Let the 
Leader of the Opposition rise in the House and tell Quebecers 
and Canadians what he told the Americans: ``Please realize I am 
not a sovereignist, I am a separatist''. Let him repeat that to all 
Quebecers, and he will lose his referendum.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, with respect, I deplore the fact that the Prime 
Minister should dismiss as intellectual dishonesty the wishes of 
a people that for 300 years has been working towards the 
culmination of its destiny as a nation and will do so 
democratically and lawfully.
<P>
	I want to ask the Prime Minister, when this fall the votes are 
counted on the evening of the referendum and Quebecers, as I 
hope they will, vote yes, on the basis of our present mandate, I 
want to ask him how he sees his responsibilities as custodian of 
the economic interests of the part of Canada he will still 
represent?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my position has been known to all Canadians for a long 
time. I am a federalist, and I believe in a united Canada where 
Quebec will feel at home.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am not the one who has to do some virage to try to find words 
to hide the truth from the people who will be voting. I know the 
people of Quebec want to stay in Canada. All the polls say that. 
Mr. Parizeau came with his astuce in December. That was a flop 
by the month of March. Then came the Leader of the Opposition 
who tried to hide the truth. He made a virage. Today the virage is 
back to square one. He is a separatist and he does not have the 
guts to say that to the nation.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to change the subject to the separation of 
one of the government ministers from the cabinet.
<P>
	When we first raised the issue of the heritage minister's 
dollars for contracts dinner, we were told that it was merely a 
routine fundraiser to pay off the minister's campaign debts. This 
was the story of the organizer, Richard Gervais, and was 
confirmed by many of the guests who attended the dinner.
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
	Now we learn from Elections Canada that the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage had no election debts to pay. In fact his 
receipts and reimbursements minus his expenses left him 
$25,000 ahead. The dinner was held, therefore, for other 
purposes, which will go undisclosed until the government 
releases all the information surrounding the minister's dinner.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13721"> 13721 </A></B>
<P>
	My question for the Prime Minister: Will the government 
table the complete list of who was invited to the heritage 
minister's dinner and who contributed the money for what 
purposes? The Prime Minister knows full well that Elections 
Canada documents will not provide the information.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, whether the Minister of Canadian Heritage had debts or 
no debts is irrelevant.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> We used to have debt, but we 
do not have debt any more. For the last eight years I raised 
money to pay the debt. When we raise money it is to pay the debt 
and to have enough money for the next election. The minister 
raised money for the Liberal Party that will be used in the next 
election. That money will compete with the money the leader of 
the Reform Party is raising when he has his own private dinners 
around the country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister's obsession with protecting a party 
loyalist is clouding his judgment.
<P>
	The heritage minister violated the federal code of ethics, not 
once, not twice, but three times. He targeted departmental 
clients for donations. He rewarded some with heritage contracts 
and appointments, placing himself in direct conflict of interest. 
Now there is the question of raising money under cloudy 
pretences to pay off debts that did not exist. Canadians are right 
to wonder what kind of example this sets for other ministers.
<P>
	My supplementary is to the ultimate arbiter of government 
ethics. Since the Prime Minister is unwilling to discipline the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage, does this mean that other 
ministers are free to hold similar fundraising dinners that target 
departmental clients?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, ministers are advised as I am that they have an 
obligation, like any other member of Parliament to help to raise 
money for the next election of the Liberal Party. They have to do 
it according to the rules, and the rules are very clear by Elections 
Canada. Every contribution has to be made public if it is more 
than $100. That is exactly what ministers are instructed to do 
and they are doing it. It is known by the public.
<P>
	I had great success in the city of Calgary. Many of the friends 
of the leader of the Reform Party came, paid, and were happy 
with the speech.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, according to Mitchell Sharp, the government's original 
ethics adviser, the heritage minister's dinner may be just the tip 
of an iceberg.
<P>
	Mr. Sharp said yesterday the government's code of ethics was 
clear and tough but that some cabinet ministers are not 
following it. He went on to say that business should be separate 
from fundraising to eliminate the appearance of conflict of 
interest and that cabinet should receive a refresher course on the 
code of ethics.
<P>
	Since the Prime Minister has personally assumed the role of 
ethics counsellor, which other ministers are not following the 
government's guidelines? And will they be invited to an ethics 
summer course, which Mr. Sharp advises?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Mr. Sharp advises me and ministers when we need 
advice. He is correct when he tells every one of us to be prudent. 
Being prudent is to make sure that every contribution is paid, a 
receipt is made, and it is published under the Canada Elections 
Act. That is exactly what happened in this case.
<P>
	Every contribution has been above the table and according to 
the laws of Canada. Unless we pass a law in the House that all 
political party expenditures are paid by the nation, we will have 
to raise money according to this law. This law permits ministers 
and members of Parliament of all parties to raise money as long 
as they give receipts in accordance with the Canada Elections 
Act.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, according to Statistics Canada, net job creation over 
the past six months has been zero, although the Minister of 
Finance's budget predicted job growth of three per cent in 1995. 
In addition, economic growth has literally gone flat in the first 
three months of 1995, with an annualized growth rate of 0.7 per 
cent, yet the Minister of Finance forecast in his budget that the 
rate of growth would hit 3.8 per cent this year.
<P>
	Since everything points to the fact that the minister's 
predictions will not come true this year, will he acknowledge 
that zero economic growth will not generate any new jobs and 
that he is going to have to review his budgetary forecast 
regarding the deficit?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister

<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.

	I would like to point out to the hon. member that over 200,000 
private sector jobs were created in the past eight months. This 
trend even applies in Quebec, where over 50,000 jobs were 
created in the past year.
<P>
	There is no doubt that the economy is slow, due to a slowdown 
in the American economy and to the fact that the economic 
recovery was based mostly on our capacity to export. This 
having been said, most economists predict that the slowdown 
that everybody was expecting next year will hit us this year and 
that next year, we can expect a recovery.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, instead of spinning yarns, the Minister of Finance 
would be well advised to take a real look at his balance sheet 
since coming to office.
<P>
	Mortgage rates, for example, have increased by 30 per cent, 
the growth rate for exports dropped 90 per cent over three 
months and there has been no net job creation over the past six 
months. That is the real balance sheet of this government, of the 
Minister of Finance. Therefore, he should have given me real 
answers and real figures instead of making it all up.
<P>
	I would like to ask him the following question: Will he 
acknowledge that a growth rate of close to zero confirms the 
failure of his economic strategy, which has not enabled us to 
create any new jobs or to offer Quebecers and Canadians the 
hope of dignity through employment, which the Prime Minister 
keeps on repeating?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have no idea 
where the hon. member gets his figures. Maybe from the ``Just 
for Laughs'' festival. Please allow me, Mr. Speaker, to give you 
the real figures.
<P>
	The unemployment rate in May of this year was 9.5 per cent, 
compared to 10.4 per cent in May 1994; shipments in the 
manufacturing sector were 17 per cent higher this month than in 
May 1994; the trade balance surplus hit an all-time high of 
$23.2 billion in the first quarter of 1995; the deficit in Canada's 
current account, which is normally around 4 per cent, is 
currently at 2 per cent. We are very proud of our

just three months. An orderly withdrawal started now would 
take about that time to be completed.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister end his chronic waffling and

<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr.

extremely useful role. We have decided to extend our mandate 
for another six months. We will make a decision at that time. We 
have to finish the job we started. We will not quit in mid-term. 
We said we were to be there for six months, and Canadian 
soldiers and the Canadian people are the kind of people who do 
the job they say they will do. If we decide to go it will be decided 
in accordance with our commitments and with our partners in 
this situation.

<B>(1440) </B>
<P>
	I have to say to the House of Commons that when we look 
objectively, before the UN troops arrived there were 
approximately 200,000 people killed in one year, and it was 
reduced to 3,000 last year. This means the presence of the UN 
troops there has saved thousands and thousands of lives. The 
Canadian soldiers and the others in the UN force have done a 
very good job.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, talking about 
Bosnia, the Prime Minister stated in this House: ``We are very 
far away from this part of the world and in many ways it is 
somewhat more of a European problem than a Canadian 
problem''.
<P>
	If the Prime Minister actually believes what he said, will this 
be the position the government will take at the G-7 summit?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, of course I said it is more of a European problem than a 
Canadian problem. But peacekeeping around the world has been 
a very proud policy of the Canadian government.
<P>
	We have had peacekeepers around the world. We initiated 
peacekeeping during the Suez crisis when Mike Pearson created 
that solution to solve that very difficult war with Great Britain 
and France versus Egypt.
<P>
	Since that time Canadians have always been present at 
peacekeeping operations. We have been in Cyprus; we have been 
in the Golan; we have been everywhere there has been a need for 
Canadian soldiers. There is nothing more satisfying for me when 
I am travelling to meet with the leaders of other countries than to 
have them tell me that Canadian troops are always the best.

	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my

people in low-paying jobs. The situation has continued to

per cent in 1989 to 16.5 per cent in  1994, an increase of nearly 
50 per cent in five years. In Quebec, more than one out of every 
three unemployed workers are young people.
<P>
	When we realize that young people are usually in low-paying 
jobs, how can the Minister of Finance expect to give them any 
hope, when he has no job creation policy to offer and on top of 
that, limits their access to unemployment insurance by making 
them work for at least six months to qualify for unemployment 
insurance benefits for the first time?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, we are very 
concerned about the unemployment situation among young 
Canadians. We have always been very concerned about this, 
even before the economic downturn we are experiencing today. 
That is why at the beginning of our mandate, the Minister of

provide incentives for them to go back to work or start a career.

more young unemployed workers are on welfare?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member looked 
at the figures he would see that the unemployment rate for young 
people is now at its lowest point since 1990 when the recession 
began.
<P>
	The job creation measures have helped to bring down the 
youth unemployment rate by three or four points to its lowest 
level. In the meantime, to recognize the special importance of 
young people, in this last year we have increased the direct 
investment for youth training and youth employment programs 
from $193 million to $236 million, a net increase in this one year 
alone. At a time when budgets are very limited and we are facing 
real fiscal restraint we have increased the investment for young 
people by $43 million. That means this year we will have 15,000 
to 20,000 young people enlisted in various forms of internship 
programs, the youth service corps and other youth-related 
programs.
<P>
	Our commitment to young people admits of no question from 
the Bloc Quebecois. We are committed to helping our young 
people get back to work.

	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Liberals' February budget based its revenue projections on a 
GDP growth of 3.8 per cent. The actual growth in  the first 
quarter of 1995 was less than 1 per cent. There is little prospect 
of improvement in the second quarter. The budget did not plan 
for a recession.
<P>
<B>(1445) </B>
<P>
	Is the Minister of Finance willing to admit that his budget 
forecasts are wrong and that his deficit targets are being 
threatened?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, our deficit targets 
are not being threatened. At the time we made them we made it 
very clear that we have brought in both prudent assumptions for 
growth and for interest rates. We also put in place substantial 
contingency reserves. I can assure the hon. member that we are 
on target in terms of the deficit.
<P>
	The hon. member knows as well that a majority of economists 
projected strong growth for this year with a decline in growth 
next year in the United States and consequently in Canada. The 
view today on the decline that was projected, I believe, is that it 
is going to occur earlier than expected and that it should lead to 
an increase in growth next year.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is 
speculation certainly in that answer. I do not think the minister 
can downplay the current poor economic conditions. A lot of 
Canadians are very concerned. They are concerned about their 
jobs. They are not buying houses as they did a few months ago. 
They are not buying cars. Consumer purchasing is down.
<P>
	Reform has told the minister that the one thing government 
could do to restore consumer confidence is to lay out a plan to 
eliminate the deficit. The minister and the government have not 
taken our advice.
<P>
	My supplementary question is for the same minister. What is 
the plan of the government to restore consumer confidence and 
avert a recession in the country?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member 
knows that consumer confidence is not dependent on whether 
the government provides, as we have decided to do, rolling two 
year targets in deficit reduction or a longer target.
<P>
	The member also knows that the credibility of long term 
targets by Canadian governments has not been all that great. We 
are the first government in a long time to not only hit its target 
but to do substantially better. This is the realization of a 
<P>

re-establish confidence in the country. I am very confident.

	Yesterday, Gallup polls found that the Canadian people had 
more confidence in the government's handling of the economy 
than any government in the last 22 years. That is confidence.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Prime Minister. Last weekend, the 
Bosnian President tried to meet the American President, Bill 
Clinton, to have the embargo on arms to Bosnia lifted. In the 
American Senate, a majority of Republicans and Democrats 
voted in favour of lifting the embargo, but the President is 
maintaining it for the time being.
<P>
	Given the importance of maintaining the embargo, did the 
Prime Minister reiterate the need to maintain it to the President 
of Bosnia when they met?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I did exactly that on my trip to Sarajevo last June. 
Speaking on behalf of the French and the English, who knew I 
was going there, I told the Bosnian Prime Minister himself, in 
Parliament in Sarajevo, that, for us to maintain our troops there, 
it was vital the embargo not be lifted.
<P>
	Our position of last year remains unchanged, and I am pleased 
to see that the President of the United States respects it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
while the Prime Minister's position is clear on the embargo, how 
does he explain the fact that, 48 hours before the start of the C-7 
Summit, Canada has yet to decide on its participation in the 
rapid reaction force, which is to be debated at the G-7 Summit in 
Halifax?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr.

that we are not keen to take part in this new initiative. We have 
said so to our partners. We are still looking at the proposal.

<P>
	The government has been restoring hope and prosperity by 
fulfilling commitments made in the red book. One of those 
commitments on page 22 involves replacing and eliminating the 
GST.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Finance outline the progress that has been

Minister.
<P>
	As the member knows, there is tremendous support for 
harmonization among consumers and among small business. 
Already there are tremendous savings from greater efficiency.
<P>
	The problem has been that a number of the provincial

glad to say that we have had a number of very fruitful meetings

realized. We have all seen the public statements of premier elect 
Harris to the effect of his interest.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Roy MacLaren (Minister for International Trade,

Helms bill came before the U.S. Congress.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13725"> 13725 </A></B>
<P>
	At that time, we made our objections clearly known to the 
United States government. Since then the administration has 
questioned the terms of the bill in such a way as to suggest it will 
not go forward in the way that was first anticipated.
<P>
	On the more specific question the member raises, I have asked 
our embassy in Washington to inform us of the details of the 
U.S. treasury's proposed action. We do not have all the details 
yet. However, I can assure the member opposite we will do 
everything to make certain Canadian companies have the full 
opportunity to participate, as they are now doing, in the Cuban 
economy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
reassuring to know we do not have Jesse Helms setting Canadian 
trade policy. However Canadian companies like Lantic, Redpath 
and B.C. Sugar may be targeted as early as tomorrow because 
they buy raw sugar from Cuba.
<P>
	What is the minister doing to protect these interests today? 
These are interests that have to be looked after at this very 
moment.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roy MacLaren (Minister for International Trade,

	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Agriculture.
<P>
	According to an Angus Reid survey, three out of four 
consumers are concerned about the use of BST. Even the dairy 
industry is against it. The Dairy Council, which represents 
processors, rejects this product, deeming it unnecessary and 
undesirable, while dairy producers have demanded that the 
minister extend the moratorium.
<P>
	Does the minister admit that neither the dairy industry nor 
consumers want BST on the market and that they all want the 
moratorium to be extended?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when concerns were first raised 
about the potential use of rBST, a synthetic product, in the 
spring of last year, the House of Commons agriculture 
committee undertook a very useful  examination of a number of 
issues surrounding that question.
<P>
	It produced a report. That report recommended a number of 
things, including a delay period during which a task force could 
be structured to bring forward further information which would 
be of assistance to producers, processors, consumers and others 
that are interested in the question.
<P>
	Over the course of the last year this process has gone forward. 
The delay period has been in place and remains in place until the 
first of July. The task force has completed its work. A great deal 
of useful information has been brought forward which will be 
helpful to all of those interested in this question so they can 
understand and appreciate all of the issues and all of the 
arguments, pro and con, with a little more detail.
<P>
	The key question is one of health and the efficacy of this 
product, which is being studied as is required by law by the 
regulatory and scientific officials within the Department of 
Health. Unless and until the Department of Health issues a 
notice of compliance, the use of this product is governed under 
the controls of the Food and Drugs Act.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, less than 
19 days before the moratorium expires, the Minister of 
Agriculture must admit that both the public and the dairy 
industry expect him to act quickly. Does the minister undertake 
today in this House to extend the moratorium on the use of BST?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I understand that many in the 
dairy industry have expressed the concerns to which the hon. 
gentleman has referred. There are others in the dairy industry 
who have advanced the other point of view.
<P>
	The existence of the moratorium or the delay is not the critical 
issue, quite frankly. The critical issue is whether this product 
has a notice of compliance issued to it by the legal regulatory 
authorities in Health Canada. No such notice of compliance has 
been issued. Therefore the sale and distribution of this product 
in Canada remains illegal.

	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there have been two 
blockades in B.C. in the last month: Upper Nicola and the one at 
Adams First Nations.
<P>
	The blockade at Upper Nicola, as the hon. member knows, is 
down. The other is up. It is more sensitive than Upper Nicola 
because it was fish and this is an archaeological site. Artefacts 
have been found which the province has designated. The 
developer gave an undertaking that he would do an 
archaeological study, which he has not done. The province has 
sent him a letter under the B.C. heritage conservation act 
demanding that he do the study and cease the work. That has not 
been done.
<P>
	Reformers said we were going to have three Okas there, which 
meant military force, if we did not follow their instructions. I 
would like to point out to the House that two men came forward 
at Upper Nicola. Their names were Stanley and Belleau. They 
went to the chiefs, talked to them with dignity, and the blockade 
at Upper Nicola came down. They were RCMP officers and a 
proud tradition did the job. Also, they were aboriginal RCMP 
officers and I want to commend them in the House.

remove two cattle guards eliminating all vehicle access as of 
June 15. The RCMP have advised residents to form an 
evacuation plan. We are talking about private property here.
<P>
	What recommendation would the minister of Indian affairs 
make to the Adams Lake residents regarding the evacuation plan 
which his continued inaction has created?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern

provincial. I have worked well with Mr. Cashore out there.

	<B>Mr. Irwin:</B> It is off reserve and it is clearly on provincial 
property. As hon. members were told last week the RCMP are 
under contract to the B.C. government and it is their call. If 
requested we will go in and facilitate.

efforts the member of Parliament noted on behalf of our

immigration programs to try to assist some of the citizens of the 
former Yugoslavia.
<P>
	The first has been a family class program that has had its 
criteria relaxed so that people can be reunited with families 
living in Canada. As a result of that program, over 7,200 
individuals have been reunited with their loved ones in Canada. 
The second program has been to try to focus on some of the 
refugee relief work in that troubled area. To date the results 
indicate that over 8,200 private and government sponsored

	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am now ready to rule on the question of 
privilege raised by the hon. member for Saint John on May 30, 
1995. For providing me with the relevant facts and documents 
related to this matter and for their contributions to the 
discussion, I would like to thank the hon. member and the hon. 
Minister of Health.
<P>
	In her presentation, the member brought the House's attention 
to a photograph of her used in an expert panel report entitled 
``When Packages Can't Speak''. The report concerning plain 
and generic packaging of tobacco products had been prepared at 
the request of the Department of Health.
<P>
	The member claimed that the unauthorized use of her picture 
in a visual impact study included in the report had violated her 
privacy, was an assault on her dignity as an individual and as a 
member of the House, had opened her up to ridicule and had 
stereotyped her in a manner that misrepresented who she was 
and thus could impede her ability to perform her duties as a 
member of Parliament. She therefore requested a public apology 
from the Prime Minister and an explanation from the Minister of 
Health as to how her picture could have found its way into this 
expert panel report.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	On June 1, 1995, the hon. Minister of Health responded to the 
matter. In her intervention, the minister explained that she, 
members of the expert panel and representatives of the private 
company charged with selecting the photographs, when 
informed that the picture used was one of the hon. member, had 
immediately issued a letter of apology to the member. The 
minister then tabled a copy of a letter to the hon. member 
explaining how her picture had been selected.
<P>
	This matter has troubled me and I have looked into it 
carefully. I believe that it is important that I give the House a 
chronology of certain events which preceded the raising of this 
question of privilege, for the panel report in question is part of a 
larger study in which the House, through one of its committees, 
has been directly involved.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	On June 21, 1994 the Standing Committee on Health 
presented its first report entitled ``Towards Zero Consumption: 
Generic Packaging of Tobacco Products''. Pursuant to Standing 
Order 109 the government was requested by the committee to 
table a comprehensive response. On November 18, 1994 the 
Minister of Health tabled the government response to the 
committee report. In responding to the standing committee's 
recommendations the government noted that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-an expert panel, comprised of specialists in marketing, package design 
and consumer behaviour, and chosen in collaboration with provincial and 
territorial partners in the National Strategy to Reduce Tobacco Use, has 
established a study framework designed to determine what relationship may 
exist between generic packaging and the taking up of smoking by youth.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Government response also noted that Health Canada 
would thoroughly review and analyse the evidence assembled 
by the expert panel and would take into account the study and 
conclusions of the Standing Committee on Health. Thus, the 
standing committee could be said to have been anticipating the 
opportunity to give detailed study to the panel report.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The report dated March 1995 was released to the media and 
the public on May 19, 1995. To ensure that the committee was 
familiar with its contents, that morning Health Canada held an 
informal briefing for the committee attended by members, staff 
and researchers. Copies of the report were also distributed to all 
members of the House in the usual manner.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Photographs of members of Parliament and images of the 
House of Commons and the Parliament buildings are seen 
everyday on television and in newspapers and magazines. These 
images form part of the media coverage of Parliament that we 
have come to expect. They may be used in a straightforward 
manner or satirically, but their focus is ultimately on the work of 
Parliament and parliamentarians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is possible however that these same images of members and 
of the institution of Parliament may be misrepresented. In our 
history there exist examples of cases where the symbols of 
Parliament have been used inappropriately. In each instance 
objections have been raised in the House.
<P>
	As examples, I would refer members to Speakers' rulings 
regarding the Sperry and Hutchison Company, as found in the 
<I>Journals</I> of February 16, 1960 at pages 156 to 158, and the 
Steelworkers of Hamilton Council as found in the <I>Journals</I> of 
March 23, 1965 at pages 1159 and 1160. In both cases, 
documents meant to look like <I>Hansard</I>, a publication carrying 
with it the image of the House of Commons, were published and 
distributed by non-parliamentary bodies. The Speaker ruled 
both matters to be prima facie cases of privilege.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As members are aware, <I>Erskine May's 21st Edition</I>, at page 
69, defines privilege as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Parliamentary privilege is the sum of the peculiar rights enjoyed by each 
House collectively as a constituent part of the High Court of Parliament, and by 
Members of each House individually, without which they could not discharge 
their functions, and which exceed those possessed by other bodies or 
individuals.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Neverthless, not every matter which is seemingly offensive to 
the House may fall within the strict definition of privilege. As 
May continues:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When any of these rights and immunities is disregarded or attacked, the 
offense is called a breach of privilege and is punishable under the law of 
Parliament. Each House also claims the right to punish as contempts actions 
which, while not breaches of any specific privilege, obstruct or impede it in the 
performance of its functions, or are offences against its authority or dignity, 
such as disobedience to its legitimate commands or libels upon itself, its 
members or its offencers.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Most relevant to our current situation, May further points out 
on page 121 of the 21st edition that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Indignities offered to the House by words spoken or writings published 
reflecting on its character or proceedings have been constantly punished by 
both the Lords and the Commons upon the principle that such acts tend to 
obstruct the Houses in the performance of their functions by diminishing the 
respect due to them.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Reflections upon members, the particular individuals not being named or 
otherwise indicated, are equivalent to reflections on the House.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	My role is to determine therefore whether or not at first glance 
the circumstances of the question of privilege before me fit the 
criteria as described by Erskine May. The question is: Has the 
use and publication of the photograph of the hon. member for 
Saint John constituted a contempt of the House?
<P>
<B>(1515 ) </B>
<P>
	The hon. Minister of Health has explained to the House and to 
the hon. member for Saint John how this incident arose. She has 
also apologized on more than one occasion, as have others 
involved in the production of the report.
<P>
	Based on my research and my understanding of the citations 
found in Erskine May I cannot conclude the member, although 
perhaps embarrassed by this event, has been impeded in 
performing her duties as a member of the House of Commons.
<P>
	In the absence of malicious intent or any other obvious motive 
it is difficult to find that a contempt of the House has occurred.
<P>
	Members of Parliament are public figures and frequently 
appear in the media. Those who interact with government and 
with Parliament must remember the use of a member's 
photograph in a situation totally unrelated to his or her 
parliamentary duties may well lead to  unforeseen difficulties 
and could cause considerable embarrassment.
<P>
	In this case I can only go so far as to remind everyone that the 
House of Commons and its members must be treated with 
respect and dignity first by its membership and also by all 
intervening parties. I hope all members appreciate the 
seriousness and potential dangers of a repetition of a situation 
such as this.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="FIREARMSACT">FIREARMS ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-68, an act respecting firearms and other weapons, be read the 
third time and passed; and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have this 
opportunity to offer my support for this vital piece of legislation 
currently before the House of Commons.
<P>
	I am particularly honoured to offer my congratulations to the 
House on its passage of the non-derogation clause as requested 
by numerous presentations to the justice committee.
<P>
	Unfortunately I am faced with the irony of the Reform Party 
which in its presentation in debate and through question period 
attested to the valid and warranted requests by aboriginal people 
for their treaty of aboriginal rights to be respected in this matter. 
Yet it voted against this clause last night in an effort to continue 
to try to discredit what we as responsible parliamentarians are 
privileged to support.
<P>
	Why have we created this clause? Since the government's 
action plan on firearms control was tabled in November of last 
year aboriginal people throughout the country expressed their 
concerns about the impact of the legislation on constitutionally 
protected aboriginal and treaty rights to hunt and trap. 
Submissions were made to the Standing Committee on Justice 
and Legal Affairs by several organizations including the 
Council of Yukon Indians, the Assembly of First Nations, the 
Grand Council of the Cree, the James Bay and Northern Quebec 
agreement hunting, fishing and trapping co-ordinating 
committee, the Métis National Council and the Inuit Tapirisat of 
Canada. Submissions were also received from the governments 
of the Northwest Territories and Yukon.
<P>
	The federal government recognizes the need to take into 
consideration these concerns. The government has moved this 
motion to address such concerns and has thereby ensured 
aboriginal treaty rights are respected when this new law is 
implemented throughout Canada.
<P>
	The legislation will help protect the aboriginal treaty rights 
and the aboriginal people of Canada. We will see these rights are 
<P>

<B><A NAME="13729"> 13729 </A></B>
<P>
reconciled with the highest standards for public safety which is 
in this firearms act and part III of the Criminal Code.
<P>
	We must challenge ourselves as people who are wiling to do 
the best for our country and our fellow Canadians. We have 
acted responsibly in showing Canadians that in a number of 
instances we have heard their concerns with respect to this 
legislation and have acted on them. I am proud we are 
accomplishing that in the House.
<P>
	I am a bit disappointed with the Reform Party. It says it is the 
party that will listen to the people, but it will not. When three of 
its members will eventually support this legislation I will not 
mock out of respect because I respect parties and people who 
keep their word. Reformers said they would listen to the people 
but they will not. They said they would allow free votes in their 
party but they are not adhering to that. They ran on the issue of 
safe streets but they have forgotten that promise. They said they 
want to come to Parliament and address fiscal responsibilities 
but they obviously do not know the difference between a bond 
and a bullet.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it has been an experience in the House today 
listening to Liberal members trying to defend this indefensible 
gun control legislation, Bill C-68.
<P>
	We in the Reform Party, the hon. member would be surprised 
to know, understand the recognition of aboriginal rights 
contained within the Constitution. We certainly can read 
although he may doubt that sometimes.
<P>
	Recognizing that in the Constitution hunting, fishing, 
trapping and gathering rights are protected for aboriginal 
people, the Constitution does not specifically refer to methods 
of hunting, trapping or fishing. We are not talking about 
entrenched treaty rights in the application of Bill C-68 to 
aboriginal people. We are talking about the use of an implement 
to carry out their hunting, fishing and trapping rights.
<P>
	This same instrument is used by many non-natives in 
northern hinterland areas. I assume these non-natives who hunt 
for sustenance enjoy the same or similar hunting rights as 
aboriginals. I find it questionable that the government in its 
amendments to this bill has not recognized hunting for 
sustenance activities of non-natives who live in remote northern 
areas.
<P>
	I ask the hon. minister of Indian affairs whether his 
government specifically sees a difference between a remote 
residential aboriginal hunting for sustenance and a 
non-aboriginal who lives in a remote district of Canada and 
hunts for sustenance. Why would one under the proposed 
legislation be required to comply with all the regulations of Bill 
C-68 and yet a special provision might be given to another?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Irwin</B> Mr. Speaker, in broad terms we have populations of 
aboriginals in Winnipeg, Toronto, Kenora and other areas as 
high as 60,000 to 65,000. Within these areas aboriginal people 
are more at risk to violence by all facts right now. It is in their 
best interest to look at our policies of safe streets, knowing that 
we are not attacking gatherers or hunters or tourism or farmers, 
all things the Reform, I thought, stood for.
<P>
	The hon. member says I would be surprised by some things 
Reform does or says. Nothing surprises me when it comes from 
the Reform.
<P>
	There are provisions in the act having nothing to do with 
being Indian or not. If you are under 18 and a gatherer there is an 
exemption. You can use your gun if you are a gatherer of food.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	The member talks about methodology, and I have said over 
and over again this does not free any person on methodology. 
Surely using the test of reasonableness under the treaties no 
aboriginal person can go hunting with a Sherman tank. By any 
test of reasonableness we can control and legislate on 
methodology.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Before we resume debate I understand 
the hon. Secretary of State for Financial Institutions wishes to 
table a motion.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-68, an act respecting firearms and other weapons be read the 
third time and passed; and of the amendment.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13730"> 13730 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. Clair, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to rise on third reading of Bill C-68 
on the final day of debate on this fine bill.
<P>
	I am very proud to rise as a member of this caucus because I 
am proud not just of our position on this bill but also of the 
strength of our caucus in standing up to criticism which, 
although many times unfair and certainly very emotional, has 
been strong and relentless. I am also proud of the Prime Minister 
and particularly of the justice minister who has seen this 
legislation through from beginning to end.
<P>
	I am proud also because I know I am representing the views of 
my constituents in Windsor-St. Clair. We have heard a lot of 
the importance of representing the views of our constituents 
today. We heard a lot from the third party about that. There are 
some very specific reasons the people of Windsor-St. Clair 
want me to vote for the bill.
<P>
	In Windsor we enjoy a great deal of American tourism. We are 
less than a mile from the United States. When thinking where to 
go for lunch one can actually factor in restaurants in Detroit. 
One can go there and get back on one's lunch hour. That is how 
close it is. We have clean, safe streets. We have tremendous 
cross-border shopping in reverse and we have a casino which 
attracts 17,000 visitors a day, 90 per cent of whom are 
American.
<P>
	People who are active in the tourist industry in Windsor, 
hoteliers, people at the casino and others, tell us one of the great 
reasons for the attraction of our community is that it is in Canada 
and people feel safe there. They tell us clearly and 
unequivocally that when they canvas their customers, when they 
talk to the patrons at the Windsor casino, gun control is a factor.
<P>
	This bill in a very specific economic sense is good for my 
riding. The people of my riding appreciate it, understand it and 
want it. That is not my only reason for supporting it and 
certainly is not the only reason my constituents have for 
supporting it.
<P>
	It is my view and the view of the majority of my constituents 
that the bill is not just about crime control. The people of 
Windsor-St. Clair and I as their representative suggest the bill 
is about the kind of Canada we want for the future, in our 
retirement for our children, for our grandchildren. It is about the 
values we share as a country.
<P>
	There is no constitutional right to bear arms in Canada. There 
is no right to pack a pistol on one's hip or to hide one in one's 
car; nor should there ever be. On the other hand as a society we 
value hunting, sport shooting and aboriginal rights and we 
struggle to find the balance between those seemingly competing 
interests. In Windsor we know this very well. We also know 
what happens when firearms as a commodity go out of control.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	As I said, we live less than a mile from a country with a very 
different view of this commodity, a country where firearms are 
indeed out of control. We watch the Detroit news in Windsor, 
and every night purposeful criminal shootings and accidental 
shootings are displayed on the air as though they were car 
accidents or as though they were just another fact of life. In 
those American cities they are.
<P>
	I worked in Windsor in the criminal courts as both a defence 
lawyer and a prosecuting lawyer. Every Monday morning in bail 
court-court room number three, for those of you who are 
listening in Windsor-there would be a parade of American 
visitors to Canada who came into the country, passed that great 
big sign that says that firearms are prohibited in Canada, came 
across the border and had their firearms seized. Why? They 
would tell us they had forgotten they were in the car. They would 
be under the front seat, loaded, or in the glove box loaded or in 
the trunk loose and loaded, sometimes carelessly stored, 
sometimes kept loaded and right on hand.
<P>
	Very often these same people would be offended by our laws 
and highly indignant, all of them feeling that they have a 
God-given right to carry a gun, and in spite of the warning at the 
border they were going to continue to carry it. Why do they feel 
that way? They feel that way because their culture is different 
from ours, but also because many of them feel a need to carry 
that gun. They feel they need protection. This is not the society 
or the culture the vast majority of Canadians want to live in.
<P>
	I enjoy Americans very much. I like going to the United 
States. There is much to admire about their culture, their 
industry, their enthusiasm, their protection of individual rights. 
There is much to recommend in their democratic system. Yet 
last February the President of the United States came to this 
House and spoke to a joint sitting of the House and the Senate, 
and what did he talk about? He talked about our efforts to control 
firearms in our society. What did he talk about when he was 
introduced to our justice minister that evening? Both he and 
Mrs. Clinton wished him well in his struggle to control this 
commodity.
<P>
	My friends opposite like to talk about democracy and about 
the need for us to represent our constituents. They like to talk 
about the importance of representing the folks back home in this 
House. I believe that is what I am doing. I believe that the 
constituents of Windsor-St. Clair support me, support this 
government, support the Prime Minister and the justice minister 
in this effort to control this commodity. I believe as well that the 
vast majority of the constituents of the members of the third 
party feel the same way.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened very carefully to the speech the member 
made. I know she has spent some time on this.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13731"> 13731 </A></B>
<P>
	I feel very frustrated in trying to communicate to the 
Canadian people all of the things that are contained in this 
128-page bill, so I took it upon myself for the last year and a half 
to regularly inform them through news releases. I think I have 
sent 31 or 32 news releases out informing them as to the contents 
of this legislation.
<P>
	We have also promised that if it proves to be ineffective we 
would repeal it. We are quite confident that it will not meet the 
high expectations this government has put forth in this 
legislation.
<P>
	My question for the member is simply this. Why did she 
oppose my amendment to have an independent auditor review 
this legislation after fives years to see whether it is 
cost-effective and whether it is meeting the goals this 
government claims it will meet? If they are so confident that it is 
going to make our society safer, why did they oppose that 
common sense amendment?
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	I also have another comment with regard to the comments 
made by the previous speaker.
<P>
	I have many native people in my community and I regularly 
visit with them. They are strongly opposed to Bill C-68. And 
even with the amendments that were introduced yesterday, they 
are still going to be opposed to it, because they say they do not 
want more provisions in Canadian law that give them special 
status. They would like to see us move toward equality. They are 
not appreciative of what the government is doing by trying to 
tinker with C-68 to make it more palatable for native people. 
They are very concerned about that.
<P>
	In light of the events of last night, I should review them for the 
people who are watching on television. Last night we sat here for 
hours and hours simply going over all the amendments that were 
made at the last minute, many of them by the government, to fix 
up this flawed legislation to make it a little more workable in 
their eyes.
<P>
	Would it not make sense to postpone this, in light of the fact 
that it will not take full effect until the year 2003 anyway? 
Would it not make sense to postpone it a few more months to 
make sure it is workable? Because we have pointed out many 
flaws in it.
<P>
	Would the member object to those two amendments? We feel 
it is really important to look at these things. I would like some 
good answers from the government. Maybe the member can 
address those two questions.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Cohen:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think there were basically two 
questions asked. The first was the question of whether I would 
agree with my hon. friend that there should be an audit of the 
situation in a few years.
<P>
	I think the hon. member is confused about the nature of the 
bill. This bill is about cultural values, crime, and a variety of 
issues, none of which are capable of being dealt with in a 
financial audit. It is not an economic bill.
<P>
	With respect to the second question, about postponing the 
legislation, the people of my riding do not want the legislation 
postponed. They want us to get on with it and get on with our 
agenda.
<P>
	I would suggest to my hon. friend this his constituents 
probably have concerns other than guns as well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I did not mention specifically the costs of the bill. It is a 
significant factor, but the member is trying to portray it as 
simply a cost item.
<P>
	I am asking whether she would agree to an independent audit 
to see if it would be cost-effective, but also whether it was 
meeting the targeted government claims that it will reduce 
crime. That is the question I asked.
<P>
	I also asked if she would agree to postpone it for a few more 
months. It does not even begin to take effect until 1996, so why 
rush it through now? If there are this many amendments coming 
at the last minute, we have a serious problem in the justice 
department. If they have to propose this many amendments and 
all the things that need to be addressed, would it not make more 
sense to wait and get it right the first time? I think this is 
something she should address.
<P>
	I would like to make another comment. We have listened to all 
the rhetoric coming forth from the government. I would like to 
remind the Canadian people that we heard exactly the same 
rhetoric before the Young Offenders Act was introduced. So the 
same people who brought us the Young Offenders Act are now 
bringing us this gun control legislation, the same people who ran 
up the debt.
<P>
	This bill is going to be a horrendous cost. I wonder if the hon. 
member would rather spend the money on crisis centres or 
counselling for families at risk, rather than on this legislation? 
Would it not make more sense? We are running further and 
further into debt. I do not think we need more legislation like 
this.
<P>
	The same government that is giving criminals more rights 
than victims is also bringing us legislation that will put a heavy 
burden on law-abiding gun owners rather than criminals. I 
cannot see how we can accept that.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	I would appreciate the member looking at and fairly dealing 
with the questions that I have. Let us wait a bit. This time line 
does not mean that we have to pass it today. Would it not make 
more sense to wait? That is the amendment we are debating 
before the House. Maybe she has forgotten that.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Cohen:</B> Mr. Speaker, in response I would say that I did 
answer the hon. member's two questions before, but apparently 
he did not like the answers.
<P>
	We have never sold this as a bill to reduce crime by reason of 
its existence in Canada, although it is being used as such on a 
faulty basis for argument by the opposition. This bill will 
provide the tools to law  enforcement agencies and the cultural 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13732"> 13732 </A></B>
<P>
basis that will enable us to have less crime in the future. There is 
a substantial difference.
<P>
	Also, with respect to the issue of delay, the hon. member 
should give his head a shake and realize that the people of 
Canada want us to get on with the business of governing. The 
people of Canada are not obsessed by guns. The people of 
Canada are worried about jobs and unemployment. Equating 
money for gun control with money for crisis centres is unfair, 
particularly coming from a party whose members tried to turn 
down summer grants for those very services in their ridings.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the debate, at third 
reading, of Bill C-68, the gun control legislation. My short 
experience as a parliamentarian has made me more familiar with 
the whole enactment process, and also more aware of the 
importance of lobbies.
<P>
	There is a lobby in favour of gun control and one opposed to it 
but, in my opinion, the only lobby that really matters is my 
constituents. Consequently, my position on this issue, which is 
also that of the Bloc Quebecois, reflects the discussions which I 
had with my constituents. I am thinking in particular of the 
residents of Saint-Médard, in the Rivière-du-Loup area, the 
community health department official who came to my office to 
discuss the impact of that legislation, and also those 
representing shooting clubs and firearms merchants. This is not 
a black and white issue.
<P>
	In this case, I believe that the approach is very different from 
the one used with the social program reform, when the 
government tried to impose a UI reform on the backs of the 
unemployed and seasonal workers. In that case we had no choice 
but to oppose such measure.
<P>
	This is the first time in 18 months that I have had to really 
weigh the government's intentions and the real impact of its 
legislation, including in rural areas, which have the highest rate 
of accidents related to the use of firearms, even though the use of 
such firearms, including by hunters, is generally much more in 
compliance with the legislation.
<P>
	In terms of its purpose, this bill seeks to reduce the number of 
deaths and injuries related to firearms, as well as to ensure 
legitimate, controlled and prudent ownership of such weapons, 
even though it will not prevent certain uncontrollable, impulsive 
reactions leading to tragedies. The objective is no doubt very 
laudable. However, is universal registration the solution? Given 
the increasing number of acts of violence in today's society, it 
seems that we have to use a curative approach and see if we get 
good results.
<P>
	My philosophy regarding this bill is the same as the one which 
prevails in the occupational safety and health sector.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	The basic principle we must consider is that in order to 
prevent crimes or accidents involving firearms, an effort must 
be made to eliminate the problem at the source, as with any 
accident at work.
<P>
	Take noise, for example. In certain cases, we can completely 
eliminate the noise made by a firearm with a silencer or another 
similar device, and, when that is not possible, people can wear 
earplugs to protect their hearing. Using this model, the question 
in the case of firearms is how to cut down on the number of 
deaths.
<P>
	The first approach that I think is important and that is not the 
focus of this bill, but should be taken into consideration, is to 
eliminate problems at the source. We must have information 
about the kinds of accidents that are associated with the use of 
firearms, how criminals go about smuggling firearms, how, in 
cases of domestic violence, one of the spouses uses a gun with 
results that are irreparable and final, how many hunting and 
other accidents take place. This is how we can reduce the 
number of mortalities from the outset, by eliminating the 
problem at the source.
<P>
	This is an area in which Western society has not been too 
successful. We have an increase in violence, a very high rate of 
unemployment, a growing need for the services of psychologists 
and too much violence on television. These are all significant 
factors that require a systemic approach.
<P>
	With particular respect to firearms, we have a situation where 
we cannot solve the problem at the source, but we must try to 
reduce the negative effects of firearm use. We can say that the 
purpose of the bill should be to ensure that firearms are not 
available to someone wishing to take an irreparable step.
<P>
	In order to achieve this goal, and that is the purpose of 
registration, we must know who possesses firearms. Are they 
legally entitled to do so? We must ensure that people with 
firearms are honest people, in so far as possible, and that they 
are capable of using those firearms correctly. Will the method 
proposed, registration, be effective? We shall see.
<P>
	Plenty of time has been allowed for implementation. There 
will be no change for three years. After that, there will be a five 
year period, taking us to the year 2003, during which 
registration can be carried out. That is when we will see whether 
values have changed in our society, because that is really what 
this bill is proposing, a change in values. Because our society 
views violence differently, a long established practice needs to 
be changed to ensure adequate control over firearms.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13733"> 13733 </A></B>
<P>
	We will see whether or not this goal is achieved in concrete 
terms. I will remind you that success will have to be determined 
by taking into account all the actions taken. Last week, I learned 
that additional resources will be allocated to the RCMP to fight 
smuggling. Will these resources be enough? I do not know. This 
measure must be part of an action plan and I think this is an 
interesting idea.
<P>
	On the other hand, as you solve one problem, you want to 
make sure you are not creating new problems in the process; in 
the case in point, this means not making life impossible for 
honest citizens who use firearms correctly. In that sense, it is a 
shame that the government did not see fit to incorporate some of 
the amendments proposed by the Bloc Quebecois, particularly 
with regard to having the legislation apply equally to everyone.
<P>
	It says that the First Nations, aboriginal peoples can be 
exempted by cabinet decision from the application of any or all 
provisions of the act. It seems to me that creating two classes of 
citizens like that is unfair.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	With respect to cost control, we were assured that it would not 
cost more than $10 to register up to 10 weapons per owner and 
that this registration would be good for life.
<P>
	We, however, put forward a proposal to ensure that, for 
example, the next government would not suddenly be tempted to 
do what was done in many other registration systems like those 
in the auto industry and other sectors, to turn this into a cash cow 
for the government through very substantial cost increases. I 
think that this would be inappropriate and that the government 
would have to be accountable for its actions should it do so in the 
future. We would have liked this to be included in the bill, but it 
was not.
<P>
	Another amendment called for a minimum four year sentence, 
provided for in the bill, for crimes committed with weapons. We 
think that this will create a double standard and that judges will 
have a hard time implementing this provision because crimes 
committed with firearms will have to be treated differently from 
those committed with other tools or instruments. I think that the 
government should have spent more time considering this.
<P>
	In the debate on the firearms bill, the Bloc Quebecois's policy 
has always been to ensure that we have a balanced bill at the end 
of the day. Will it be sufficiently balanced for us to vote in 
favour? In this regard, the amendments deliver a number of 
gains.
<P>
	For example, with regard to decriminalization, converting a 
Criminal Code offence to a statutory offence, which does not 
involve fingerprinting, mug shots, and entry into the police 
electronic network for first time offenders, is an interesting 
gain, because those who forget to register during the five year 
period would not be considered to be criminals but simply 
citizens who  forgot to do something and who must rectify the 
situation.
<P>
	Another element on which gains were made is the decision to 
issue licences. We do not rely only on reports from other people, 
we take into account the place of residence of the person. A 
person will not be kept from owning a firearm on the ground that 
he or she is in contact with a specific individual. Rather, the 
decision will be related to that person's place of residence, and 
whether interdictions apply to other individuals in that 
residence. That is, in our opinion, a valuable gain.
<P>
	Another important issue raised by several hunters is the fact 
that the firearm handling courses which they took under the 
Quebec legislation were not recognized. Again, an important 
gain was made regarding this issue and the situation will now be 
more acceptable to Quebec hunters. That change is a good one. It 
does not go against the principle which underlies gun control, 
but it eliminates the frustrations experienced by hunters who use 
firearms for an honest purpose, their hobby.
<P>
	I also want to point out that, after a few years, only those who 
have a valid license will be allowed to buy non-prohibited 
ammunition. This will surely help avoid accidents which occur, 
for example, when young people go out and buy ammunition. 
Indeed, this type of situation often results in accidents, and that 
is unacceptable.
<P>
	We are dealing with a bill which, in my opinion, is not perfect, 
a bill which has been the object of numerous debates. This 
legislation led us to examine the pros and the cons of an 
interesting principle, a principle which is aimed at reducing 
violence as well as the number of accidents and tragedies which 
we hear about on the news, including violence against one's 
spouse. This is not to say that all accidents and tragedies will be 
eliminated. People will still be able to use other means of 
violence.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	We have witnessed this recently, but the use of a firearm has 
such a devastating and often definitive effect that we hope that 
implementing this bill will have positive effects.
<P>
	I would like to conclude by saying that I drew my reflections 
on this bill today from personal experience, and I tried to see the 
bill's everyday implications. I still remember a story I was told, 
like the one about one of my uncles who died in a hunting 
accident years ago. At the time, no training courses were given 
to hunters to inform them regarding the proper use of firearms. 
Courses were introduced to try to remedy this situation. I could 
also talk to you about one of my friends who was in a corner 
store when suddenly, in came a gang of robbers. I hope that this 
law will correct situations of this kind.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13734"> 13734 </A></B>
<P>
	The most obvious goal for me is preventing people from using 
a firearm to commit suicide. Often, access to a firearm is the 
definitive, deciding factor on the outcome of the situation. 
Although the Firearms Act will not directly help people who are 
contemplating suicide to deal with their crises, it will at least 
save some lives by barring access to firearms in cases where 
people are refused licences for justifiable reasons.
<P>
	In conclusion, I believe that this law is not the best firearms 
bill we could have introduced, but that it is better than none at 
all. I want to ask those people who have been long-time regular 
users of firearms to calm down and consider what the actual 
impact will be on their daily lives.
<P>
	As I said earlier, for three years there will be no impact as 
such. After that, a person has five years to register his firearm. 
We will have plenty of time to find out whether there will be any 
negative impact.
<P>
	If firearms registration is done properly and if in eight, ten, 
fifteen or twenty years we as a society are able to show that our 
statistics on the number of accidents, the type of accidents and 
the number of suicides have gone down, then it will have been 
worthwhile. From this point of view, aside from the constraints 
on lawful users of firearms, I wish they would think about that 
other aspect and realize that, in the best interests of our society, 
it would be advisable to support this bill and provide for 
adequate supervision.
<P>
	For instance, the amendments proposed by the Bloc 
Quebecois, which were defeated, made provisions for Cabinet to 
use its regulatory authority with respect to aboriginal people. 
We need practical applications to ensure that the department is 
sympathetic to certain needs and to ensure that the bill passed in 
this House makes our society different from other societies 
where there is a lot more violence and, in the process, ensures 
that we have a quality of life and a social model that is far 
superior.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there is one statement my hon. colleague from Quebec 
has made that I strongly disagree with. He said that the bill was 
flawed but it was better than no bill. That is one of the problems 
in the country. Bad laws are worse than no laws.
<P>
	Why can he not agree with the amendment we are debating 
this afternoon to wait for at least six months and work on it to 
make it not such a bad law?
<P>
	My first question is not the most important of my two 
questions. I have been working with the Senate; I have been a 
watchdog for a year and a half. Would he agree that we should 
allow the Senate to examine the matter very closely, to be a 
chamber of sober second thought? Does he feel that the Senate 
has a legitimate role to play in the legislation? Would he like to 
see a Senate that would be truly representative of Canada, all 
provinces,  create equality and play a legitimate role in checking 
out the legislation?
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	My second question is the key question. I cannot figure out 
why the Bloc is not opposed to legislation that so clearly 
infringes on areas of provincial jurisdiction, such as education, 
requiring federal education courses to be taken in the provinces; 
regulation of private property, clearly in the Constitution as an 
area of provincial jurisdiction; and licensing, increasing 
provincial taxes.
<P>
	I understand the Quebec government is looking for $300 
million in compensation to implement the bill and the minister 
says it will only cost $85 million. How can the member go along 
with a bill that so clearly infringes on areas of provincial 
jurisdiction?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will answer generally first on the 
matter of the Senate. I believe the Senate is outdated. The other 
House is an outmoded institution, which reflects the view of the 
19th and earlier centuries that elected representatives lacked 
sufficient education and therefore needed the opinion of wiser 
individuals, advisers.
<P>
	Today, with the quality found in the House of Commons, the 
Senate has become more of a political reward for those who have 
contributed in some way or other to the party in power. I hope 
elected officials will have control over this sort of legislation. If 
voters, in the end, had to decide on the basis of legislation we 
passed, they would decide on the situation as a whole.
<P>
	However, as regards the six-month delay, I myself believe 
and I think the Bloc caucus agrees, I cannot speak for the other 
caucuses, that we have been very well informed on the entire 
question of firearms. Lobbying has been very strong from all 
sides, I daresay even exaggerated at times. We had to examine 
all of it. I met many groups of voters in order to form an opinion 
about what should be in the bill and I think I have all the 
information I need.
<P>
	As for the matter of training, the bill provides that training 
courses given by the Government of Quebec will be accepted by 
the federal government and that hunters who have taken the 
courses will not have to take them again. In this regard, the Bloc 
has won a major point by protecting the lives of ordinary people 
from disruption, and this is one of the amendments that leads me 
to believe the bill is balanced enough for me to vote for it and 
promote it. With the support of the vast majority of Quebecers 
for gun control, this amendment, among others, serves the needs 
of the rural population, which I represent here, and which I 
believe will enjoy long-term benefit from this new bill.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Hon. members, perhaps I may draw 
your attention to Standing Order 18 which says we do not have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13735"> 13735 </A></B>
<P>
the right to criticize the other House. I  realize very few people 
are aware of this rule, but I do want to point this out.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened very carefully to the comments on the bill by 
the hon. member across the way. The important discussion that 
is going on today has been going on for nearly a year now. I 
heard him mention the various things he has done in his area to 
garner input from all factions.
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member a question from his 
perspective in the area he represents in Quebec. Knowing full 
well that Quebec has many hunters and many people who enjoy 
outdoor sports, especially in the wooded and northern regions of 
Quebec, has he received input from various groups that makes 
him believe the bill will impact on responsible firearms owners, 
owners of rifles and shotguns who are legitimate hunters in 
Quebec? Does he believe the legislation will impact on them, 
impede them or cause them any particular hardship in carrying 
out their sports and their competitions as target shooters as they 
have in the past?
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, when I met the people in my riding, I 
also spoke to members of the hunting community and people 
from the department of public health who argued in favour of the 
legislation. In the case of hunters and all people involved in 
outdoor activities who use firearms, there will be some changes 
that will be frustrating. That is quite true.
<P>
	First of all, they will have expenses they did not have before, 
and they will have to understand the new rules and how these 
affect them. In this area, we have to deal with people's 
perceptions of the bill as well as with the bill itself. In fact, I 
hope that thanks to the timeframe provided under the bill, the 
first three years and then another five years to register, the 
government avoids what happened to the previous legislation, 
which was never operational mainly because the government at 
the time did not take the trouble to inform the public and make 
the legislation acceptable to all voters, to all citizens. I think this 
is a legitimate change that will require sensitive enforcement of 
the legislation.
<P>
	I recall the amendment we proposed regarding 
criminalization and a number of other aspects, where we wanted 
to ensure that the minister would be flexible-I am thinking of 
the minimum sentence of four years. I think the minister will 
have to give this some serious consideration and perhaps, in the 
years to come, a number of technical amendments might be 
considered, because people may end up in the penitentiary 
system and become criminals as a result of a single misstep.
<P>
	This morning the Leader of the Opposition gave the example 
of the young person who breaks into a cornerstore with a gun and 
as a result will get at least four years. Under the Young 
Offenders Act as applied in Quebec, under the previous 
legislation, he would have had a good chance of being 
rehabilitated. If he is sent to the penitentiary for four years, 
chances are he will acquire some bad habits before he comes out 
and by that time it will be too late. So there should be some 
flexibility on the part of the government to ensure the legislation 
is enforced correctly.
<P>
	As for hunters who will have to change their habits, I think we 
have to look at the benefits to society as a whole.
<P>
	We also have to be very clear about what the government 
intends to do about smuggling. If the money people spend on 
additional registration is used to cover the cost of the system, 
that is all right, but these people will need tangible evidence that 
they are not the only ones who are paying and that further action 
is being taken in society, so it is not just a matter of plugging one 
hole but making sure all the holes are plugged, like smuggling 
firearms into Canada across what is perhaps the longest border 
between two countries. The government has already announced 
significant initiatives, but I think that we will have to ensure that 
they are enforced because hunters will be most frustrated if they 
are forced to pay fees when, ultimately, all of the other measures 
end up not achieving their intended results.
<P>
	We come up against the same things in this sector as we do in 
the environmental sector. The way I see it, to all intents and 
purposes, the real effects of a law are more evident 8, 10, 15, 20 
years after the fact than they are immediately after its 
introduction. It is important to realize this. We are bringing in 
legislation today for the sake of future generations. We cannot 
talk about a piece of legislation like we talk about next year's 
budget, which can be corrected the year after.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	This was one of the considerations which got me thinking and 
strongly defending the arguments put forth by the inhabitants of 
rural regions on the issue. All of this notwithstanding, I think 
that this legislation will allow us to distinguish ourselves, as a 
society, from the American model, for example, where violence 
is so widespread that certain states have decided to permit 
almost anybody to carry a firearm. I am not interested in this 
model. If I have a choice between the two, I would much rather 
choose the model proposed here.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as chair of the justice committee which intensely and 
thoroughly examined the bill for over seven weeks, I should like 
to report more fully to the House of Commons.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13736"> 13736 </A></B>
<P>
	After the bill was sent to the committee on April 24, we held 
52 meetings lasting until June 5. In that time we heard 70 
witness groups.
<P>
	While I am and always have been a strong supporter of gun 
control and a supporter of Bill C-68, I took the position as chair 
of the committee that I would bend over backward to 
accommodate those groups which opposed the bill, to 
accommodate those members of Parliament and parties who had 
concerns about or opposition to the bill. I did this because I think 
the credibility and integrity of the parliamentary system take 
precedence over partisan views and behaviour. As a result, 
approximately two-thirds of the witnesses who appeared before 
the committee were in opposition to the bill and 61 amendments 
were made.
<P>
	Further amendments were made last night at report stage. Of 
course not all amendments were accepted, which is normal in a 
democratic society where there are opposing views. Some of the 
amendments would have cut out the essential elements of the 
bill, and therefore they were opposed. Other amendments which 
were directed to major and minor improvements in the bill were 
not convincing to the majority on the committee.
<P>
	Now I should like to take off my committee chairman's hat 
and put on my House of Commons hat and show my support for 
the bill. Ever since I was elected in 1965 I have been a strong 
supporter of gun control. Nearly all the elements in this bill and 
in Bill C-17 from 1992 were contained in one or other of my 
private member's bills from the late 1960s and early 1970s. 
With this bill nearly all the proposals I made 30 years ago will 
have been legislated.
<P>
	Over and over again, before the committee, witnesses 
opposing the bill said there was no evidence that the licensing of 
gun owners and the registration of guns would reduce crime. 
That is not correct. There is overwhelming evidence that where 
guns and gun owners are more strictly controlled there is less 
crime with guns.
<P>
	If we examine the situation in western Europe where in nearly 
all countries guns are registered, they have a much lower rate of 
crime with guns. In Canada, where we have had the registration 
of handguns for many years, we have had a lower rate of crime 
with handguns than in the United States where handguns or no 
guns are registered at all.
<P>
	Some people might refer to some of the states of the United 
States that have very strict gun laws, but we cannot really 
consider them because in the United States there is no border 
control between the states. For example, if one is in New York 
State one can very easily travel to a neighbouring state where 
guns are easily available. Therefore the strict gun laws in one 
American state do not have very much impact on the control of 
crime with guns.
<P>
	However, in Canada, as I say, we have had very strict control 
on handguns which have been restricted weapons since 1934. In 
Canada 53 per cent of our crimes with  guns are with long guns, 
whereas only 17 per cent of crimes with guns are with handguns. 
It is interesting to note that in the United States the statistics are 
exactly the opposite where two-thirds of its crimes with guns 
are with handguns. This demonstrates that where we control 
handguns we have a much lower rate of crime with handguns. 
Because we have no control on long guns most of our crimes 
with guns are with long guns.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	The purpose of licensing is to screen out irresponsible, 
imbalanced reckless persons who might acquire guns, to screen 
out people who have problems with alcohol or narcotics. The 
licensing system in the bill is merely an extension of what we 
have already had for several years with firearms acquisition 
certificates.
<P>
	The registration system will require more responsibility from 
gun owners and provide police with more tools for crime 
prevention and crime detection. The purpose of both of these 
measures is public safety. The bill requires no more of gun 
owners than we already have in varying degrees for 
automobiles, boats, aircraft, ski-doos, dogs and bicycles. In 
other words, the measures in the bill with respect to licensing 
and registration are for preventive policing, the approach of the 
police these days, to prevent crimes than after the crime 
applying a harsh penalty. It is much better to prevent the crime 
by keeping guns out of the hands of dangerous, irresponsible 
people than to punish them after they have committed the crime.
<P>
	Furthermore, I want to make absolutely clear there is no 
intention at all by me or anybody else in government to ban all 
guns or ban hunting or competitive shooting.
<P>
	This is my fourth gun bill debate since I came here in 1965. On 
those four occasions this fear was raised by opponents of those 
bills. It never happened. We have as many or more hunters today 
than we had in 1965 when we first started introducing bills to 
control guns.
<P>
	On the other hand, while there has been no real reduction in 
the number of hunters or competitive shooters there has been a 
gradual reduction of crime with guns. In 1974, 47.2 per cent of 
homicides were with a firearm. In 1976, we passed a law that 
brought in a certain restriction on firearms. That was the year we 
brought in the firearms acquisition certificate. By 1980 only 
32.9 per cent of homicides were committed with a firearm. In 
1992 we had Bill C-17 with further restrictions and further 
controls on firearms. In 1993, the last year for which we have 
statistics, only 30.6 per cent of homicides were with firearms.
<P>
	In that period homicides have declined as well. The highest 
rate for homicides in recent years was in 1975 when we had 3.02 
homicides per 100,000 population. In 1993 there were 2.19 per 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13737"> 13737 </A></B>
<P>
100,000, a considerable drop after stricter controls on guns and 
as well the abolition of capital punishment in 1976.
<P>
	I will deal with some of the myths raised during the hearings 
of the committee, one being if we control guns more strictly 
only criminals will have guns. Sixty-six per cent of homicides 
are committed by people with no prior criminal record. In other 
words, 66 per cent were law-abiding until they committed 
homicide. Marc Lépine, who killed 14 women at l'École 
polytechnique, had no prior criminal record. Valery Fabrikant, 
who killed four professors at Concordia University, had no prior 
criminal record.
<P>
<B>(1620 ) </B>
<P>
	We will never control professional gangsters or professional 
criminals; they will always get their guns. The great majority of 
our murders are not committed by those people but by people 
who were previously law-abiding.
<P>
	The other myth is that guns do not kill, people kill. That is true 
but people kill more easily and more effectively with guns than 
with other weapons. Guns are the most lethal of weapons. When 
a gun is readily available what might have been an assault 
becomes a murder.
<P>
	There is considerable evidence from Canada, the United 
States and all over the world that where guns are more available 
there are more crimes with guns. The bill will restrict the 
availability of guns to many who might use them criminally. It 
will also put barriers in the way of those who want to acquire 
them quickly and irresponsibly. The bill will reduce crime with 
guns. It will control not only guns but crime.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened very carefully to the hon. member.
<P>
	I find it very interesting how they can look at some of the 
statistics from around the world and twist them to suit their own 
purposes. The member cited statistics from Europe. England 
embarked on a campaign against guns and he is perfectly aware 
that violent crime increased in England as these laws were put 
into effect. I am making him aware that it depends on how one 
twists these statistics.
<P>
	I agree with him when he says we need to get at the root of the 
problem. This is not getting at the root of the problem. We are 
simply seeing someone bleeding on the rug and we are saying 
please bleed over here. Instead of trying to stop the crime, 
instead of trying to stop the problem we are simply shifting it 
somewhere else. We are not targeting the problem of crime.
<P>
	Prevention is the principle. If we are to spend hundreds of 
millions of dollars and save lives, which the government stated 
is the intent of the bill, would it not be better to spend it in some 
other way? Would it not be more cost effective?
<P>
	Why does the member oppose my amendment to have a 
review of this legislation by an independent auditor to see 
whether it is meeting the goals and objectives the government 
has set? I cannot understand why he would object to that.
<P>
	The statistics he quotes beg the question of how many more 
lives could be saved if we would spend the money in other ways. 
Another key question the government has never addressed is 
how many lives will this cost. I presented evidence to the 
government that showed guns have saved many lives.
<P>
	This legislation will tie up our police. How many lives will it 
cost because the police are no longer on the street but are tied up 
with law-abiding citizens registering guns? How many jobs will 
be destroyed because of the increase in taxes this will make 
necessary? What will those people without jobs do? Some of 
them may possibly turn to a life of crime.
<P>
	We as parliamentarians sometimes forget to look at the 
secondary aspects, the secondary effects our legislation has. 
Could the hon. member address those two questions I have 
raised?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allmand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not know what statistics the 
hon. member is looking at. I do not have them here before me 
today but I looked at some this morning because I have to give 
another speech tonight on homicide at another place.
<P>
	The rate of murder in the United Kingdom is less than 2 per 
100,000; less than in Canada where it is 2.19 per 100,000. In the 
United States the rate of murder is 9.6 per 100,000. I do not 
know what the hon. member is talking about. Let us hear his 
figures.
<P>
	The rate of murder in the United Kingdom is lower than in 
Canada and the rate of murder with guns is much lower than in 
Canada and much lower than in the United States.
<P>
<B>(1625 ) </B>
<P>
	The member has not presented us with any facts. I challenge 
him. I will come back to the House tomorrow under a standing 
order and put the facts on record. In all of Europe the rate of 
crime committed with guns is substantially lower than in the 
United States and in Canada. He cannot state otherwise. There 
may have been a slight increase, but the slight increase is 
nowhere near that of the United States which has open access to 
guns.
<P>
	He asked why we do not spend the money on other programs 
which might deal with the causes of crime. I am rather surprised 
by that. Every time the government has put proposals to the 
House in that direction members of his party vote against them. 
Not only do they not approve of the cuts the government has 
made in social programs, they want to cut them even 
further-what hypocrisy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13738"> 13738 </A></B>
<P>
	The people who will pay for the registration system and the 
licensing system will be the gun owners, just like those of us 
who own automobiles have to pay for the registration system 
and the licensing system. The general taxpayer should not have 
to pay for the gun control system. It should be paid for by the 
people who own and use guns, and rightly so. The moneys we 
would use for general social programs to attack the causes of 
crime will come out of general tax revenue. They should not be 
played one against the other.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jean Payne (St. John's West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on Bill C-68, an act respecting firearms and 
other weapons.
<P>
	I congratulate the Minister of Justice on his efforts and 
perseverance in bringing this important and timely matter to the 
House of Commons. More important, I commend the minister 
for his willingness to listen and to respond to the comments of 
all Canadians regarding the bill without sacrificing the major 
goals and initiatives of it.
<P>
	I do not believe any other bill in this session has generated as 
much discussion and debate among Canadians as has this one. 
However, as I have listened to the discussion and the debate 
some of the major aspects of the legislation are being 
overlooked. I will comment on some of the issues I feel have not 
been adequately highlighted.
<P>
	The legislation sends a clear message to criminals, judges and 
the public. If a person uses a gun while committing a crime they 
will be punished. The Criminal Code will be amended to provide 
that when a person has committed one of the ten listed serious 
crimes with a firearm they will be subject to a minimum 
sentence of four years in prison. In many cases the actual 
punishment will be more severe. If a person uses a gun in the 
commission of a crime they will be punished. No matter what 
other mitigating factors are involved, a judge will have no 
choice but to sentence people guilty of these offences to four 
years in a federal penitentiary.
<P>
	The message is clear. The protection of the public must be the 
main goal of our penal system. In addition, people convicted of 
these offences will be banned from owning a firearm for life. I 
believe it is important to reflect on these provisions because 
they highlight the central goal and purpose of the legislation, to 
ensure Canada remains a safe place and that Canadians continue 
to enjoy protection from gun related crime.
<P>
	The provision aimed at tighter border controls was referred to 
earlier by my hon. colleague with respect to the importation of 
firearms. One need only look to the south to see the dangers guns 
pose. It is with great pride that many Canadians compare the 
relative safety of our cities and towns to those of the United 
States. Given the easy availability of firearms in the United 
States it is clear any legislation aimed at controlling the use of 
guns must address the importation of guns.
<P>
	Import-export controls for firearms are presently based on 
the premise that guns are a commodity and therefore are subject 
to the same trade controls as any other commodity. Under Bill 
C-68 changes will be made to provide for a fundamental 
reorientation of the policy toward firearm imports. In particular, 
the legislation will recognize that importing firearms may have 
important consequences in terms of public safety and crime 
control.
<P>
	Under Bill C-68 for every firearm coming into Canada the 
person responsible will be required to have either an import 
permit for commercial use or a customs declaration for personal 
use. Every gun coming into Canada will now be tracked. These 
import declarations and permits will only be issued to those 
individuals and companies who have the necessary permission 
to possess firearms while in Canada. These controls form part of 
the bill's effort to reduce the underground market for guns and 
provide for the accurate tracking of all guns in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	Of course, in conjunction with these new measures, the act 
provides also for penalties for those individuals who do not obey 
the import guidelines. Under Bill C-68, the Criminal Code will 
be amended to provide for a new offence of importing a firearm 
without the proper customs declaration or permit. This offence 
will be punishable by a minimum of one year imprisonment if 
prosecuted on indictment. In addition, the court has the power to 
prohibit the offender from possessing a firearm for up to 10 
years.
<P>
	Again, the theme underlying Bill C-68 is clear in these 
provisions. The theme is the protection of the public and the 
reduction of crime.
<P>
	The bill also recognizes the legitimate use of guns, but at the 
same time it is aimed at limiting the use of guns by those people 
who have no legitimate purpose to do so. This will be done by 
reducing the underground market for guns, the place where 
criminals get their guns, and by increasing the penalties for 
those who use guns for illegitimate purposes.
<P>
	There are other measures which I would like to briefly 
highlight. Any future sale or importation of handguns that have 
a barrel length of 105 millimetres or less will be banned. In 
addition, the definition of firearm in section 85 of the Criminal 
Code will be expanded to include imitation firearms so that 
those who simply use or threaten with a fake gun will not escape 
the penalties under the Criminal Code.
<P>
	I would now like to take a few moments to comment on the 
section of the bill that has by far generated the most public 
debate, the system of universal gun registration. In my 
conversations, letters and meetings with constituents, it is this 
section of the bill that has been the focus of much discussion. 
Before understanding the purpose of universal gun registration, 
one must be cognizant of the other initiatives contained in Bill 
C-68 which I have previously touched upon. I repeat, Bill C-68  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13739"> 13739 </A></B>
<P>
is about increasing public safety and controlling the criminal 
misuse of guns.
<P>
	The universal registration system supports and supplements 
the other provisions of the bill. The registration of all firearms 
enables Canada to control and track the flow of firearms across 
its borders. Without registration, the increased penalties for 
illegal importation would be unenforceable. It enables Canada 
and its police forces to address the issue of criminal misuse of 
guns by helping enforce prohibition orders issued by the courts, 
by helping police to trace stolen guns and guns used in crimes 
and by helping increase compliance with safe storage 
requirements. Registration is the backbone of this bill and it is 
the section upon which the rest of the bill can be effectively 
implemented.
<P>
	Many critics of gun registration have argued that registration 
will not work because criminals will not register their guns. 
Frankly, this misses the whole point. Criminals obtain their guns 
from the underground market which is fed by smuggled and 
stolen guns. Registration will help eliminate two sources of 
supply for this market. It will enable police to accurately track 
the point at which the guns enter the underground market.
<P>
	Police have been calling for a form of gun legislation for 
years. If anyone is in a position to say whether gun control will 
effectively assist in the prevention of crime, I believe it is the 
police.
<P>
	I would like to quote from a letter from Chief Vincent 
MacDonald, president of the Canadian Association of Chiefs of 
Police. Speaking on behalf of the association, Chief MacDonald 
stated: ``We view the registration of all firearms as pivotal to the 
entire package, critical to controlling the illegal gun trade, to 
supporting preventative action and to enforcing the law''.
<P>
	It is for these reasons that the registration system contained in 
Bill C-68 is both necessary and desirable.
<P>
	Many of the concerns with the registration system rest on 
what I believe has been a lack of accurate information. For 
instance, the cost of implementing the registration system will 
be funded 100 per cent through fees charged for licences and 
registration certificates. There will be no drain on existing 
police resources as a result of the implementation of the 
registration system.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	The cost of registration for individual gun owners will not be 
excessive. For owners who wish to register currently owned 
firearms, a registration certificate will cost between zero and 
$10 in the first year of availability. Additionally, a 
non-acquisition firearm licence will cost between zero and $10 
in the first year of availability. The actual process to acquire 
certificates and licences will be straightforward and quick.
<P>
	In addition to my own views on gun registration, like other 
members of the House I have consulted and listened to my 
constituents. I have received many telephone calls and letters. I 
have attended town hall meetings and have spoken personally 
with constituents.
<P>
	I believe in this bill. I support it fully and I am very pleased at 
this time to have the opportunity to say so in the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Beth Phinney (Hamilton Mountain, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I too would like to congratulate the hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce for getting this bill successfully 
through committee and back into the House. As a member of the 
committee I know we worked very hard to make the bill suitable 
for everybody in Canada and easily adaptable to the desires of 
most people.
<P>
	I would like to refer to a letter I received by fax today. This 
letter was sent to the Minister of Justice from the Federation of 
Medical Women of Canada and states: ``The Federation of 
Medical Women of Canada support the gun control legislation 
Bill C-68 now being debated and voted on by Parliament''.
<P>
	The letter goes on to state that in 1990 Statistics Canada 
reported 1,400 deaths per year involving firearms. Research has 
shown that the risk of homicide and suicide is greater for people 
who live in houses with firearms. The federation also states: 
``We view domestic violence as a social and health issue which 
requires an effective preventative approach with a combination 
of education and legislation. As an organization, we recognize 
that we have a role to play''.
<P>
	It is about the role to play that I would like to make a further 
comment. I am pleased that most Canadians are not the source of 
the problem for which the law is geared. This makes Canada 
unique. We have an abundance of law-abiding citizens but an 
additional attribute of Canadians is that even Canadians who are 
not directly affected do share a common sense of responsibility 
for the welfare of others.
<P>
	To those who oppose the bill on the basis that they are good 
citizens and need no laws, I appeal to their higher sense of 
responsibility for they could make true models for all others. 
They could accept the bill as it is, respect it and set a model for 
those who are not law-abiding citizens. I am asking all who 
oppose the bill to act as good citizens and accept their 
responsibility and do what the bill asks.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I do not think there is a question in the 
member's comments. If the member for St. John's West wishes 
to reply briefly she may.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Payne:</B> No, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to participate in what will really be the closing 
debate on the government's controversial gun control Bill C-68.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13740"> 13740 </A></B>
<P>
	My colleagues, under the able direction of the hon. member 
for Crowfoot, have put forward a host of arguments concerning 
the defects of the bill and over 200 amendments to endeavour to 
correct the worst of those defects. I wish to commend each and 
every one of our Reform members for the quality of their 
contributions and the conscientiousness with which they have 
made them.
<P>
	Although these seeds of gun control reform may have fallen 
on barren ground in this Chamber, I can assure the government 
that those seeds are falling on fertile ground in the country at 
large. Within a year they will bring a crop of public discontent 
which will cause the minister and the government to rue the day 
they rammed this ill conceived legislation through their own 
caucus and through Parliament.
<P>
	As the debate winds up, I do not want to dwell any longer on 
the details of the bill but instead on the bigger picture. What are 
the characteristics of a good law and does this bill possess them?
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	The short answer is that a good law must have at least three 
characteristics. It must be within the constitutional competence 
of the government. It must be effective in achieving the 
objective for which it is introduced. Above all it must be capable 
of carrying the judgment of the people who will pay the bills and 
for whose benefit it has been introduced. In other words, a good 
law must pass the test of constitutionality, effectiveness and 
democratic consent.
<P>
	Let us look at the big picture. Will Bill C-68 if enacted be a 
good law or a bad law?
<P>
	First is the test of constitutionality. This bill will be 
challenged constitutionally. It will be subject to constitutional 
challenges to which it would not be subject if the minister had 
carried out more genuine consultations, listened to the advice he 
had received and given greater care to the issue of civil liberties 
when he first conceived and drafted the bill.
<P>
	With respect to potentially damaging constitutional 
challenges, I refer to the following. There is the contention of 
the James Bay Cree and Yukon First Nations that the minister 
did not comply with the provisions of constitutional agreements 
with themselves in framing the legislation. I refer further to the 
fact that several of the provinces consider the onerous 
regulatory aspects of the act an imposition and an intrusion into 
their provincial jurisdictions. They may very well challenge the 
constitutionality of the act once the regulations are proclaimed.
<P>
	Finally, I refer to the concerns of the civil libertarians that 
certain clauses, such as those pertaining to inspection, may very 
well contravene the charter of rights and freedoms, in particular, 
the rights of Canadians to privacy and security of the person.
<P>
	It is with some bitterness I note that when these concerns with 
respect to the intrusion of the bill on civil liberties were first 
raised by ordinary citizens with their MPs, they were completely 
ignored by the government. When they were pointed out again 
by Reform MPs in this House and in committee, they were 
ignored by the government and the media.
<P>
	It was only when more elite groups like the Canadian Bar 
Association or politically correct groups like the Canadian Civil 
Liberties Association also made the same points months later 
that the civil liberties issue was even recognized as a potential 
flaw in the bill by the justice department. I say it is a sad day 
when the civil liberties of a people are taken for granted by the 
government and only judged to be at risk when the elites or 
special interest groups deign to acknowledge the risk.
<P>
	I would also ask how the justice minister in introducing his 
first major complete legislative initiative to this House could 
have managed to get himself on to such shaky constitutional 
ground including potential violations of the charter of rights and 
freedoms. Bill C-68 fails the test of being on sound, and 
unquestionably sound, constitutional ground.
<P>
	A second major test which any government legislative 
measure must pass regardless of whether or not it has sufficient 
support to pass in this Chamber is the test of effectiveness. Will 
it achieve the object, in this case an increase in public safety, 
which is its purported intent?
<P>
	My colleagues have made the argument very effectively that 
Bill C-68 will not achieve the goal of increased public safety 
because it focuses less than 20 per cent on the regulation of the 
criminal use of firearms and over 80 per cent on the regulation of 
the non-criminal use of firearms. To be effective the emphasis 
of the bill should have been exactly the opposite.
<P>
	There is another front on which this bill fails the effectiveness 
test. As all members know, the Criminal Code and a national gun 
registry is a federal responsibility but its administration is a 
provincial responsibility. To be effective a bill of this nature 
must have the full and positive co-operation of the provinces. It 
is becoming increasingly apparent that this is not the case. At 
least five provinces and two territories have indicated their 
profound unhappiness with the bill and the administrative 
obligations it imposes upon them.
<P>
	The Government of Saskatchewan has gone so far as to 
introduce a motion in the Saskatchewan assembly urging the 
federal government to introduce amendments to Bill C-68, to 
allow provinces and territories to opt out of the provisions 
respecting registration and licensing. The attorney general in 
Saskatchewan has called on the federal minister to place higher 
penalties on criminals who use firearms in the commission of an 
offence and to withdraw all the remaining sections of the gun 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13741"> 13741 </A></B>
<P>
control package. He has indicated his willingness to continue to 
oppose this federal legislation.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	The minister has made it clear that he will proceed delicately 
with respect to imposing the administration of this gun control 
legislation on Indian reserves, many of whom are unalterably 
opposed to the provisions. This holds out the unseemly prospect 
of one approach for non-aboriginals, and another for 
aboriginals, in violation of the basic concept of equality of all 
citizens before the law.
<P>
	From a political standpoint, no one in his right mind believes 
that the federal government, in association with the separatist 
government of Quebec, is going to vigorously and actively 
proceed to register every firearm in that province, including 
those on aboriginal reserves, during a period of constitutional 
uncertainty.
<P>
	In other words, even a cursory examination of the practical 
aspects of administering the bill across the country by 
provincial governments, half of whom profoundly disagree with 
it, and on aboriginal reserves, the majority of which disagree 
with it, reveals profound weaknesses in the potential 
administration of the bill, profound weaknesses which will 
render it ineffective in achieving its purpose.
<P>
	The third test of a good law is that it must be capable of 
carrying the judgment of the people who pay the bills and for 
whose benefit it has been introduced. In other words, it must 
pass the test of democratic consent and support.
<P>
	Since the bill was first introduced, the government has 
maintained that it has vast public support, citing various public 
opinion polls in that regard. However, governments, especially 
elitist ones that boast of their ability to spin doctor the issues, 
have a habit of deceiving themselves on the subject of 
democratic support and their reading of the polls, as was 
profoundly illustrated in the country and in the House with 
respect to the Charlottetown accord.
<P>
	Various polls have been conducted which ask the public 
whether they are in favour of gun control, and of course the 
majority answered in agreement. These polls usually fail to 
follow up that question with the more pertinent question: Should 
the focus of gun legislation be on punishing the criminal use of 
firearms or regulating the non-criminal use of firearms? If and 
when that question is put to the Canadian public, I submit that 
the majority favour coming down like a ton of bricks on the 
criminal's use of firearms which is precisely the Reform 
position.
<P>
	Other polls ask whether the public supports the federal 
government's proposed gun control legislation, but fail to ask 
whether the respondents are in any way, shape or form, familiar 
with the federal government's gun control legislation. They 
completely miss the point that as the public gains more and more 
knowledge about this bill, its support for it declines rather than 
increases no matter what the initial level. This was precisely the  
same pattern of declining support which ultimately sank the 
Charlottetown accord.
<P>
	Made in Ottawa solutions to national problems, if promoted 
and promulgated by governments with vast dollars to spend on 
public relations, initially receive a high rating-in the vicinity 
of 60 per cent to 65 per cent-with the public. However, as the 
public gets to know more and more about the legislation, as they 
examine it for themselves, as they discuss it, as they hear the 
perspective of the provincial and municipal politicians, the 
interest groups, the academics and their friends and neighbours, 
the track record is that public support declines in direct relation 
to increased knowledge about the legislation.
<P>
	Any piece of public legislation is subject to declining public 
support, a trajectory which in the case of this bill will mean that 
less than 50 per cent of the public will support its provisions by 
late this fall. That is the sign of a bad law, a law which cannot be 
properly enforced and will not achieve the intent of Parliament 
because it does not carry the judgment of the people who pay the 
bills and whom it supposedly benefits.
<P>
	I therefore submit in conclusion that Bill C-68, if passed into 
law, will not be a good law. It will be a bad law, a blight on the 
legislative record of the government, a law that fails the three 
great tests of constitutionality, of effectiveness and of the 
democratic consent of the governed.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	What should be the fate of a bad law? It should be repealed, 
which is precisely what a Reform government will do when it 
eventually replaces this government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, a point of order. If you would seek 
it I believe you would find unanimous consent that the vote 
initially scheduled to take place at 5.30 p.m. this day be 
rescheduled to 6.30 p.m., immediately after private members' 
hour.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> So ordered.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
very interested to hear the remarks of my hon. colleague, the 
leader of the third party in the House.
<P>
	I listened with interest because I want to tell him that I would 
also listen with interest if I heard those loud cries from the civil 
libertarians in this country. I, for one, would listen to those and I 
am sure members on my side of the House would also listen with 
me and react.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13742"> 13742 </A></B>
<P>
	The loud voices have not been heard by civil libertarians. 
They have been heard by a very vocal gun lobby very much 
supported by the Reform Party, the members opposite.
<P>
	I want to come back to a statement that concerned me in my 
hon. colleague's speech about constitutional law which is 
something that we should be very concerned about.
<P>
	The charter of rights and freedoms is something of which we 
must be very cognizant in every piece of legislation. When a 
minister brings forward legislation he has to sign on that he has 
taken into consideration constitutional and charter arguments. 
The charter, I often hear, is something that gets in the way. Our 
protection in search and seizure provisions comes from the 
charter provisions. That is why Canadians should not be afraid 
of the gun control bill.
<P>
	I also want to talk about constitutionality because my 
colleague opposite raised it. The Supreme Court of Canada has 
already ruled that gun control is a matter of criminal law. It does 
not matter that all the provisions of the Criminal Code offence 
be in the Criminal Code.
<P>
	That the Criminal Code is for crime prevention has been very 
clearly ruled in the appellate court in Alberta and in the Supreme 
Court of Canada. It has been stated by Professor Hogg, who is 
the expert in Canada on constitutional law, that gun control law 
is a criminal control provision, a crime prevention provision, 
and is totally intra vires the Parliament of Canada.
<P>
	What is the hon. member going to say to the Supreme Court 
justices?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member's 
learned legal opinion but she did not address the constitutional 
problems that I raised.
<P>
	I did not argue that the federal Parliament does not have the 
constitutional right to pass gun control legislation. I did raise 
the point that it was aboriginal people who were the first to raise 
the constitutional question about the bill. Their argument was 
nowhere close to what the member was trying to defend.
<P>
	They argued that the constitutional documents which 
constitute the arrangements between the James Bay Cree and the 
federal government and the Yukon First Nations and the federal 
government contained a clause that required a type of 
consultation which was not provided or honoured by the 
minister. This was raised by some citizens, a completely 
different lot.
<P>
	The other arguments that have been raised with respect to 
constitutionality are with respect to specific provisions. As the 
member well knows, the provinces are concerned about the 
clauses that mention ending the right to remain silent, the 
requirement to co-operate with the police, the presumption of 
guilt until proven innocent, the assignment of guilt by 
association, allowing confiscation of property without 
compensation, the provision of search and seizure without a 
warrant. The  suspicion is they violate sections 7 and 8 of the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
<P>
<B>(1655 ) </B>
<P>
	I suggest it is in these specific areas the bill gets on to shaky 
ground. The minister would have been well advised to accept 
amendments and changes in these areas if his interest was in 
getting a bill that would not be on shaky constitutional ground if 
enacted.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> With the understanding the hon. leader 
was sharing his time with another member, the time for 
questions and comments has expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the bill 
before us today concerns gun control. When the debate is 
finished, members on both sides of the House will be asked to 
say yea or nay. Should I vote in favour of the bill as some polls 
have suggested, or if on examining the content of the bill I find 
that on balance it has serious shortcomings not addressed by the 
pollsters' questions, do I then cast my vote against the bill? If I 
do vote against the bill, am I then voting against the wishes of 
my constituents?
<P>
	I do not need to tell the House one of the most fundamental 
principles of my party is that Reform members of Parliament 
vote according to the wishes of their constituents regardless of 
their personal convictions.
<P>
	The question of how a member should vote is worth 
examining in the context of the bill. It is a question that is 
fundamental to the public's perception of our role as members of 
Parliament. It is a question whose time has come because with 
today's technology, members of this place and the public at large 
could vote on any matter before the House without having to 
leave home.
<P>
	What do Canadians expect of their elected officials? Do they 
simply want us to look at the polls or look at the bill? Do they 
want us to vote according to the polls or according to the bill? 
Certainly many polls would suggest Canadians support gun 
registration. However this bill is about more than gun 
registration. It raises important questions about fundamental 
legal rights, about fairness and even handedness in sentencing, 
important questions about the spending of limited government 
resources and basic questions about whether the bill meets its 
stated objectives of making our streets and homes safer.
<P>
	Asking Canadians if they support gun registration and asking 
them if they support Bill C-68 are two distinct questions. No 
poll has adequately addressed the difference between the two. 
That is why Canadians have sent us to this place: to examine 
bills and make the distinctions the pollsters cannot or will not, to 
challenge the self-serving press releases of the government and 
to advance the real concerns of our constituents.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13743"> 13743 </A></B>
<P>
	Canadians expect us to vote on the merits of the bill. I want to 
emphasize I do not have any reservations about gun registration 
as a policy. However I cannot support the bill because I believe 
it is fundamentally flawed. It does not advance the cause of 
justice or the safety of the citizens one iota.
<P>
	I cannot support the bill because it diverts scarce public 
resources and energies to policies which will not truly enhance 
personal and community safety. Members cannot transfer 
support for gun registration to Bill C-68.
<P>
	There is another side of the issue I would also like to address. 
Why has the government not devoted its energies and resources 
to measures that will truly lead to safer communities? Consider 
the tragic case of Christopher Stevenson. Members may recall 
Christopher was an 11-year old Ontario boy who was raped and 
murdered by a psychopathic pedophile and a nine-time child 
rapist, Joseph Fredericks.
<P>
	Recently Dr. Jim Cairns who headed the inquest into 
Christopher's death warned that our children remain targets of 
dangerous sexual predators because governments are not 
moving in a meaningful way to protect them. The evidence 
presented at the inquest was that these offenders cannot be 
treated and the only way to protect society is through indefinite 
detention. Yet the principal recommendation of the Stevenson 
inquiry that repeat child sex offenders be jailed indefinitely has 
not been implemented.
<P>
<B>(1700 ) </B>
<P>
	Why has the government not enacted sexual predator 
legislation which puts the rights of the victim and the protection 
of society above all else? Why has the government diverted 
energies and resources of the Department of Justice and the 
House from addressing real solutions to the problem of violence 
in our homes and neighbourhoods?
<P>
	These are the real questions. These are the questions members 
opposite must answer. These are the questions to which 
Canadians want answers.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is my duty, pursuant to Standing 
Order 38, to inform the House that the question to be raised 
tonight at the time of adjournment is as follows: the hon. 
member for Waterloo-National Defence.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I do not claim to be an expert on hunting and guns but I 
know the hon. member for Delta may be of some assistance. 
How can his party justify not supporting the bill?
<P>
	I will put it in terms of what I understand from hunting. I have 
seen a hunting expedition. I saw the hunters arrive in their 
vehicles in northern Canada, in the Northwest Territories. They 
were in licensed vehicles. Presumably they had stopped at 
licensed gas stations along the way to pick up gas. They got on a 
licensed  aircraft on a licensed airfield and flew to some remote 
lake where they hunted. They had to have a hunting licence in 
order to hunt. I presume the licence was specific as to the species 
of animal they were able to hunt.
<P>
	They got the animal. They then applied for a licence to export 
the horns from the Northwest Territories because they could not 
not export from the Northwest Territories without a licence. 
They got back in their licensed vehicle, having travelled with a 
licensed guide on their hunting trip.
<P>
	If everything else about the sport is licensed except the most 
dangerous part of it, that is the gun, why is there objection to 
proceeding with the licensing of guns? There is no objection to 
licensing game wardens. There is no problem with getting a 
licence to hunt. There is no problem with licensing the guides, 
the aircraft, the cars, the gas station and everything else. Yet 
Reform members have a mental block with respect to licensing 
guns. Could the hon. member enlighten me? I cannot understand 
this attitude.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cummins:</B> Mr. Speaker, the issue of licensing put quite 
simply is that if I have a car that is not used on the highway I do 
not need to register it. If I am not using the vehicle registration is 
not required. That applies to many elements in society.
<P>
	The issue is not about licensing. The issue is about public 
safety. The gun handler is licensed. The legislation requires a 
very stringent test and personal interventions by police 
authorities to ensure that the person can adequately operate the 
weapon and so on. We have given very careful consideration to 
dealing with the issue of licensing.
<P>
	However the issue is not licensing; the issue is public safety. 
We are opposed to the bill because licensing will not advance the 
cause of public safety one iota.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand-Norfolk, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I listened intently to the hon. member's speech when he talked 
about licensing. Yesterday I talked about the importance of 
representing one's constituents here. As I did so members of the 
Reform Party kept yelling at me and telling me that somehow I 
was not representing my constituents by making a decision to 
vote in favour of the bill.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> We all know that you will do what you are 
told.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speller:</B> Do what I am told? Look at the hon. members 
who are falling in line with their leader.
<P>
	Their leader lives in an urban area that is in favour of the 
legislation. All the polls that have been taken across the country 
have clearly shown that. How can the hon. member and members 
of his caucus stand here to say that those of us in Ontario, for 
instance, who are trying to best represent our constituents, who 
have taken polls and have spoken to many constituents, are not 
representing our constituents? His own leader comes  from an 
area of the country where polls have shown that the majority of 
the people are in favour of the legislation. His leader is going to 
vote against it, against the wishes of his constituents. That 
party's key point during the election campaign was to represent 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13744"> 13744 </A></B>
<P>
its constituents and have free votes. How does that align with 
party policy?
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cummins:</B> Mr. Speaker, the issue is whether the question 
the poll has asked can be equated to Bill C-68. In my view 
asking the question ``are you in favour of registering firearms'' 
does not equate to Bill C-68 because Bill C-68 goes far beyond 
that. That is the point. The question that gets answered is the one 
asked.
<P>
	In this instance the pollsters are not asking the right question. 
At best a series of questions would have to be asked regarding 
Bill C-68. Then we as members of the House would have to 
balance it off and ask what would carry the most weight, the 
registration of guns or the violation of the human rights or legal 
rights that we believe are inherent in it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for 
London West.
<P>
	I express my support of Bill C-68 that has been before the 
House for several months now. The Minister of Justice has 
travelled the country in consultation and the bill has been 
scrutinized by the media. It has been studied by the standing 
committee of which I am a member. Over 70 groups and 
approximately 35 members appeared before the committee. The 
time has arrived for the House to act on the legislation.
<P>
	Certain colleagues in the House frequently look to the United 
States to cite examples of public policy which in their view 
should be adopted in this country. I often question whether 
certain members opposite are more familiar with the American 
constitution as opposed to the Canadian Constitution.
<P>
	Canadians have looked to the United States and at its 
pervasive gun culture. One need only watch the nightly news on 
any American station to realize the tragic consequences of the 
pro gun movement, a movement that shares the common beliefs 
of many people and parties in the House.
<P>
	My own riding of Sarnia-Lambton borders on the 
community of Port Huron in the state of Michigan. Last 
September just as children were going back to school two 
individuals who were repairing a roof at a school got into an 
argument. One went out to his truck, got a gun and shot his 
co-worker in full view of the children.
<P>
	In the same city, which is a relatively prosperous community 
of 100,000, there were seven shootings in schools last year. 
Children as young as 12 were bringing guns to school in their 
gym bags so they could settle a school yard dispute. This was all 
happening in a very middle class prosperous community 400 
yards away from  my riding. This is terribly anecdotal material 
but I suggest it draws a distinction between our two countries.
<P>
	Bill C-68 is an opportunity to define and shape the type of 
attitudes we as Canadians have toward the flow of guns, the 
possession of guns and the usage of guns in the country. It is a 
step toward recognition of the type of society based on our 
history and our values, one of which is to let other people speak 
without being interrupted. It distinguishes us absolutely from 
our neighbours to the south. It recognizes that there are 
legitimate uses for firearms and that there are concurrent 
obligations in such ownership.
<P>
	As someone who sat on the committee I can quite safely say 
that the quality of the testimony and the evidence was of great 
concern to me. It was readily apparent that there were doctors 
appearing before the committee who were quite willing to give 
legal opinions and there were lawyers appearing before the 
committee who were quite willing to give medical opinions. 
Many individuals who appeared as members of responsible 
firearms groups or gun owners groups offered advice on 
accounting principles even though they had no background in it. 
They would offer advice on certain belief systems that bordered 
on religions.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	As a result I suggest to those here and those watching that it is 
necessary to weigh the probative value of the evidence of an 
expert, for example in business administration, who because he 
has a doctorate in business administration transfers his advice to 
the National Rifle Association and the Fraser Institute, all the 
time posing as a criminologist.
<P>
	Similarly one would question the opinion of a medical doctor 
who appeared before the committee and formed conclusions 
regarding suicide that fly in the face of empirical research on the 
subject, as well as the evidence of a group representative who 
purports to speak for veterans buried in Europe, victims of the 
second world war.
<P>
	It is safe and true to say that there was a continuum of opinion 
before the committee on the bill, some of which quite frankly 
bordered on the absurd and some of which resembled 
reasonable, objective and logical suggestions.
<P>
	Those who belong-and I would suggest there are some in the 
House-to the show me school, that is those who demand 
mathematical equations empirically setting out reductions in 
murder, accident and suicide rates, are demanding a burden of 
proof that from a logical perspective is false and perverse. We 
are hearing a lot of it tonight. I am referring to those who 
demand no registration but implicitly know that locking up one 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13745"> 13745 </A></B>
<P>
spouse in jail for shooting the other spouse will somehow deter 
others from the same behaviour.
<P>
	If we take the punishment versus prevention logic and follow 
it through to its conclusion, surely punishment would be a 
sufficient deterrent to allow banks to transport money without 
armoured cars. Surely the threat of a sentence for holding up a 
bank employee transporting cash would be sufficient to prevent 
such a criminal act and banks could cut the cost of doing 
business by not spending money on such preventive safety 
measures as armoured cars.
<P>
	We know there are still robberies of armoured cars. The fact 
that banks have taken reasonable measures to prevent acts that 
are reasonably foreseeable is accepted by society as the prudent 
course of action.
<P>
	Similarly we have in the country workplace safety laws that 
require certain steps to be taken to minimize accidents in the 
workplace. Such laws are accepted even though there is a cost in 
implementing safety devices and inspection procedures because 
certain tragedies are preventable, although by no means can 
such legislation eliminate unfortunate accidents and 
occurrences.
<P>
	If the same burden of proof were placed on the 
implementation of workplace safety laws or seatbelt laws such 
as was suggested by members across the way, and if the same 
quantitative mathematical proof were applied to the laws before 
passage, obviously none of the statutory provisions would ever 
exist. We would live in a country without workplace safety laws.
<P>
	I commend to all opponents of the bill who would prefer to 
talk rather than listen the testimony of public health experts who 
appeared before the committee. They recognized that laws such 
as this one create a change not only in the flow of guns, the 
possession of guns and the usage of guns, but more important in 
the attitudes of society toward guns.
<P>
	Many witnesses who appeared before the committee stated 
the tired old maxim that we have heard many times: people kill, 
guns do not. Such simple statements deny the fact that guns are 
inherently dangerous objects and that in possessing these 
weapons certain obligations should be imposed.
<P>
	Is it unreasonable to know who owns the weapons or where 
they are moving in society? Is it in some way an imposition on 
someone's inherent right to have some central registry system 
when the same exists for dogs, cars, houses and securities?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> It stops the dogs that bite and the drunks who 
drive.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gallaway:</B> Nothwithstanding all the talk across the way, 
is it reasonable to conclude from the evidence of the police, 
public health experts, suicide prevention groups and public 
safety experts that the cornerstone of the bill, the registry 
system, will cut the rate of crime and suicides in Canada? The 
unequivocal response is yes, I must acknowledge that there were 
many witnesses who sincerely denied this to be the case. There 
are those who cling to the beliefs of the business administrator 
turned  criminologist. Perhaps these people will turn to their 
accountant the next time they have a medical problem.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member's time has expired. 
Questions or comments, the hon. member for Prince 
George-Peace River.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if the government had not chosen to enact time 
allocation I am sure all of us would have enjoyed hearing the 
remainder of the hon. member's speech on this issue. He can 
thank his own party for cutting him off in that sense.
<P>
	We are talking about effectiveness of this impending 
legislation. Every time we try to raise concerns about it in this 
House we are accused of trafficking in fiction. The government 
says that the people of Canada have to trust it. It will draft these 
regulations. We have not seen what they are yet. We have to trust 
the government that once it gets the regulations in place it will 
effectively address the issues.
<P>
	I want to briefly read into the record the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Registration pertains to things-guns in this case-not people. It records the 
description, serial number and ownership of each item or weapon. For 
extremely lethal and easily hidden weapons such as handguns-which in 
Canada are restricted and of which there are relatively few-it is a workable 
and relatively effective system that screens owners and weapons alike and 
inhibits casual purchase. However, for the ten million long guns in Canada I 
believe that a registration scheme would be unworkable and impractical in 
comparison with its potential benefits.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This quote was from the hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, <I>Hansard</I>, Commons debates, page 
12627, April 8, 1976, the hon. member who currently sits as the 
chairman of the Standing Committee on Justice. This is the very 
hypocrisy Canadians are concerned about, where members seem 
to change their opinion. They are concerned that this legislation 
will be simply one more step in the ongoing erosion of the rights 
of law-abiding firearms owners. I would like to hear the hon. 
members address that concern from Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gallaway:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is perhaps a hallmark of the 
member opposite that he is locked in time and that new evidence 
will not persuade him to change his mind. His mind is made up 
and that is the way it is going to be.
<P>
	The member would like to ask the question and continue to 
talk. I know that the hon. member on occasion appeared at 
committee. I once again commend to him the evidence of the 
public health experts. I would also commend to him the change 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13746"> 13746 </A></B>
<P>
in technology since the hon. member made that statement in 
1976.
<P>
	Would he only deal with a doctor who used technology that 
was locked in time at 1976? I think not. I would suggest to him 
that with the change in information systems today, in 1995, 19 
years after 1976, he might want to re-examine the statement 
made by the hon. member in 1976.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for 
Sarnia-Lambton has been belabouring the Americans again. I 
do not know what that has to do with our gun debate.
<P>
	Since he has raised it, I would like to mention the situation 
where I live in western Canada on the prairie, very close to the 
U.S. border. We have great cultural similarities and great 
economic similarities with the people on the other side. We walk 
back and forth. As a matter of fact, we have more in common 
with each other than they have with drug dealers in New York or 
I have with silver spoon lawyers from Toronto.
<P>
	Is it not interesting that over the last 15 years the homicide 
rate in the four northern states adjacent to the prairie provinces 
has been 16 per cent lower than on the Canadian side? It is 3.1 
per hundred thousand per year on the Canadian side and 2.7 on 
the American side. Is that not interesting? Of all the states in the 
union, these are the four that have the most wide-open gun laws. 
You can carry anything short of a bazooka down there. But it is 
not a great big shooting gallery where they run around shooting 
one another. There is a cultural factor, which this government 
never takes into consideration, and it should.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	I believe the hon. member has a few seconds to respond.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gallaway:</B> Mr. Speaker, I understand why the hon. 
member opposite thought I was only talking about the 
Americans. I was trying to draw a distinction. However, having 
regard to his seatmate, I understand why he could not hear me.
<P>
	It is very easy to take a very localized area and say that the 
statistics are different. We are not talking about a registry 
system that applies in the city of Ottawa or in the city of 
Calgary; we are talking about a national system. It is very easy 
to distort reality with these numbers. For example, in the city of 
Washington, where they have very stringent gun controls, they 
have an extremely high murder rate but a much lower suicide 
rate. How would they explain that? It is because you cannot take 
a localized area-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> They don't live long enough to 
contemplate suicide.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Can you explain that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gallaway:</B> I really appreciate the question and I would 
appreciate an attempt to answer it.
<P>
	They have a localized area and they are trying to extend that to 
a national number. The member opposite knows that is false and 
misleading.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill 
C-68 has one simple objective: to reduce death and injuries by 
firearms. Despite the views of a small and strident gun lobby, 
which I wish to emphasize does not speak for the majority of 
Canadians, this bill does not in any way support a hidden agenda 
on the part of this government to confiscate legally owned 
firearms or to sanction police state actions against the private 
dwelling houses of Canadians.
<P>
	What this act does is limit in some measure access to firearms 
to people who are qualified, responsible, and knowledgeable 
about their proper use and storage. The numbers speak for 
themselves. Nearly 40 per cent of domestic homicides involve 
firearms. Most of the victims are women and children. Where 
firearms are used in homicides, 85 per cent were committed with 
long guns, the vast majority being legally owned.
<P>
	The risk of death from a firearm discharge in Canada is almost 
equal to the risk of death from a motor vehicle crash: 2.37 deaths 
per 10,000 firearms possessed, versus 2.4 per 10,000 registered 
motor vehicles in 1990.
<P>
	The opposition to this bill has been intense. They say that 
guns do not kill, people do. Simply put, people with guns kill, 
and they do so with frightening efficiency. Let us look at the 
suicide stats. Suicide attempts involving guns have a 7 per cent 
survival rate. Where guns are not involved the survival rate rises 
to 65 per cent.
<P>
	The opponents of gun control say that if someone really wants 
to commit suicide they will find a way. However, experts on 
suicide prevention appearing before the committee testified to 
the contrary. Suicide is an impulsive act. Even a short delay will 
often give the person the chance to reconsider, and they often do. 
Therefore, limiting or delaying access to firearms can and will 
save lives.
<P>
	It will come as no surprise that those areas of Canada where 
firearm ownership is highest also displayed the highest rates of 
firearm death and injury. Remarkably, these are the same groups 
that came before committee seeking an exemption from this bill, 
saying that their traditional way of life was threatened. But I 
note that the member for Nunatsiaq said that this bill will not 
result in one less caribou death.
<P>
	It has been argued that firearm homicide is strictly a big city 
phenomenon. In Canada this is simply not true. For instance, a 
study by the Northeastern Ontario Trauma Centre found higher 
rates of gun homicides in rural northern Ontario than throughout 
Ontario as a whole.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13747"> 13747 </A></B>
<P>
	What about the notion of arming for self-defence? The idea 
has been discredited. In fact, studies show that people with guns 
in their homes are 43 times more likely to kill themselves or 
someone close to them than to kill an intruder. An alarming 
study by Dr. Scott of George Washington University shows that 
for every woman who buys a handgun for self-protection, 239 
women are murdered by such weapons, many with their own 
weapon.
<P>
<B>(1725 ) </B>
<P>
	There was a very instructive study by the Swiss professor 
Martin Killias in a May 1993 article in the <I>Canadian Medical 
Journal</I>. Dr. Killias is very clear on one point: gun ownership 
directly correlates with gun deaths and gun injury. Noting that 
27 per cent of Swiss households have guns, about the same 
incidence as in Canada, he writes: ``Contrary to what gun 
organizations claim, Switzerland pays a high price for this. In 
suicide, Switzerland ranks third, just behind Hungary and 
Finland, but far higher than other countries.'' The reason for this 
is ``the unusually high percentage of suicides committed with 
firearms''.
<P>
	Dr. Killias' conclusions are confirmed in a similar 1993 study 
of 18 countries for the United Nations Inter-regional Crime and 
Justice Institute. Countries such as Great Britain and Germany, 
which strictly control access to firearms, have much lower death 
rates by firearms than Canada or the United States.
<P>
	Gun registration is the rule throughout Europe: in Belgium, 
Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Great Britain, Ireland, Italy, 
Holland, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland. Canada and the 
United States are the exceptions.
<P>
	What about public support for this bill? I have over 7,000 
pieces of mail supporting this bill forwarded to me as an Ontario 
member by Wendy Cukier and Heidi Rathjen of the Coalition for 
Gun Control. I especially wish to commend these two 
remarkable women for so effectively giving voice to the 
concerns of such a broad cross-section of groups, including 
police organizations, medical associations, churches, women's 
shelters and transition houses, teachers federations, municipal 
councils, including my own, universities, boards of education, 
labour groups, provincial bars and legal associations and, most 
important, the overwhelming majority of the Canadian people.
<P>
	One of my constituents, Dr. Henry Barnett, the most 
prominent neurologist in Canada, spoke to me about his 
colleagues south of the border, about their hopes for effective 
gun control and about their discouragement and their complete 
inability to effect legislative change in the face of the opposition 
of the National Rifle Association, America's largest and most 
influential lobby group.
<P>
	Let us make no mistake, the American ultra-right are 
watching this debate very closely. This debate involves more 
than guns. It is about our way of life, our freedom.  It is about the 
right of Canadians to say no to guns. It is about our right to 
decide how we want to live.
<P>
	Opposing the bill we have primarily gun clubs, gun sellers, 
gun collectors, hunters and outfitters, native peoples, and the 
Reform Party. To further their own agenda or to protect their 
own economic interest, some groups capitalize on the fears of 
their honest and law-abiding members. These self-styled 
advocacy groups, these so-called responsible firearms groups, 
have engaged in a deliberate campaign of misinformation. 
Every time the government proposes gun control, these same 
groups come out. The same accusations are made: police state, 
confiscation. But the confiscations do not occur. The police do 
not come out in the middle of the night.
<P>
	``Punish the criminal'', they say, ``not the responsible 
law-abiding gun owner''. ``It is just another tax grab''. Let us 
not ignore the real cost of guns. When law-abiding, responsible 
gun owners kill and injure themselves and others, aside from the 
lost lives of 1,400 Canadians there is a very real dollar figure, 
$70 million a year in primary health costs and related public 
services in this country paid for by Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	They complain at the inconvenience of having to register, of 
having to fill out forms. I remember one witness who came 
before the committee whose daughter had been shot dead by a 
long gun recalling her response to a provincial attorney general 
on the subject of inconvenience: ``Let me tell you about 
inconvenience. The death of your child at the hands of a man 
wielding a gun is an inconvenience. Do you know how many 
forms I have had to fill out?'' I will always remember that 
woman's voice.
<P>
	The cost to the gun owner is nominal. It is $10 to register up to 
10 guns, no cost whatsoever to subsistence hunters. Is this an 
oppressive or punitive tax? Does this in any way impede the gun 
owner's right to use and enjoy his weapon? Not in the least.
<P>
	Every time gun controls are brought forward, the same 
argument is heard: ``You will destroy hunting. You will cripple 
our outfitting industry, on which our remote communities 
depend.'' The argument is a red herring. Gun control has no 
effect whatsoever on a hunter's decision to obtain a hunting 
licence.
<P>
	This is Parliament's fourth gun control bill, and our hunting 
and sports shooting community is in fine shape. In fact, it is 
stronger, safer, and more responsible than its American 
counterpart.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	We do have gun clubs but we do not have civilian militias. 
Canadians understand gun ownership is a privilege and not a 
right. The government is prepared to safeguard that privilege 
but only if it is clearly understood privilege demands 
responsibility.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="13748"> 13748 </A></B>
<P>
	Let us be clear the bill falls squarely within the federal 
government's criminal law jurisdiction. It does not admit to any 
exceptions in the application. The government in the interests of 
all Canadians must ensure coast to coast compliance.
<P>
	In fairness, many witnesses did draw attention to provisions 
which if misinterpreted might result in anomalies. In response 
the minister again appeared before the committee to suggest 
amendments regarding among other things bona fide 
inadvertent failure to register, inspection powers and relic 
firearms. These amendments are fully detailed in the committee 
report.
<P>
	I add my voice to the people in my riding and across the 
country who support the principle embodied by the legislation. 
It is my pleasure to give Bill C-68 my unequivocal support and I 
recommend to all members of this House to do likewise.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Pursuant to the order made Thursday, 
June 8, in accordance with provisions in Standing Order 78(2), it 
is my duty to interrupt the proceedings.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Pursuant to the order made earlier today, voting on all matters 
required to dispose of third reading of Bill C-68 will take place

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="PEACEKEEPINGACT">PEACEKEEPING ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from April 27 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-295, an act to provide for the control of Canadian 
peacekeeping activities by Parliament and to amend the 
National Defence Act in consequence thereof, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leonard Hopkins (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to participate in 
second reading of Bill C-295. As members are well aware, the 
government has already stated its opposition to this bill in no 
uncertain terms. Today I will restate the government's main 
objections and explain why the bill must not become law.
<P>
	Canada's support for peacekeeping is a reflection of our 
strong commitment to international peace and security. Our 
impressive record in this field is recognized worldwide. We 
have long argued our experience and skills are unmatched. As 
proof of our expertise Canada is currently at the forefront of 
efforts to improve the conduct of the United Nations' 
peacekeeping operations. We take pride in our peacekeeping 
reputation and we work hard to preserve it.
<P>
	Unfortunately Bill C-295 if it were to pass into law would do 
irreparable damage to this reputation. This is a flawed, 
contradictory piece of legislation that would seriously 
undermine Canadian efforts to contribute effectively to 
peacekeeping operations.
<P>
	The bill goes beyond consultation and seeks explicit control 
by Parliament of all peacekeeping activities. This would set a 
very dangerous precedent, for Bill C-295 would restrict the 
prerogative and discretion of the governor in council to 
determine Canada's contribution to UN or regional operations.
<P>
	Under section 4 of the National Defence Act the Minister of 
National Defence has responsibility for the management and 
direction of the Canadian forces and of all matters relating to 
national defence including peacekeeping. The bill would 
remove this responsibility not only from the minister but from 
the government as a whole respecting military operations.
<P>
	Perhaps the most serious repercussion of giving Parliament 
direct control over peacekeeping operations relates to the speed 
with which events unfold in the post-cold war world. The bill 
which calls for a five-hour debate prior to any mission 
involving more than 100 Canadian forces members would add 
another layer to the decision making process. As a result it 
would limit Canada's ability to respond quickly to UN 
peacekeeping requests or to changes in the actual peacekeeping 
mandate.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	The need for quick deployment in peacekeeping operations 
cannot be overstated. We have heard again and again how a more 
rapid response by the international community might have 
saved tens of thousands of lives in Rwanda.
<P>
	Bill C-295 if anything would increase reaction time, making 
it even more difficult to respond to such crisis. The bill would 
also hamper current efforts by the ministers of national defence 
and foreign affairs to improve the UN's rapid reaction capability 
and to find ways Canada might contribute to such a capability.
<P>
	In short, the bill sends the wrong message to our partners at a 
time when we are leading the way in promoting new methods to 
enhance the UN's ability to prevent and resolve conflict.
<P>
	If Canada is to remain an effective peacekeeper the authority 
to deploy and operate peacekeeping forces must stay in the 
hands of the governor in council. The government has the 
expertise and experience to decide, sometimes on a moment's 
notice, whether troops should be deployed and how they should 
operate. Although it welcomes the advice of Parliament, the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13749"> 13749 </A></B>
<P>
government must have the flexibility and some measure of 
independence to make these decisions.
<P>
	In effect while Bill C-295 would like to see Canada define its 
own objectives for specific peacekeeping missions and decide 
when those objectives are met, it is willing to place Canadian 
commanding officers under UN or other international 
command. This is unacceptable. Currently Canadian forces 
personnel serving on peacekeeping operations are always 
commanded by a Canadian. While they can be placed under 
operational control of multinational commanders for specific 
tasks they are never put under command of the UN or other 
international organizations. If they were, their assigned tasks 
would be changed. Their units could be split up and they could 
be deployed to new areas of operations, all without consent of 
the Canadian government. This would be unacceptable.
<P>
	At present all Canadian contingent commanders are directly 
responsible to the chief of the defence staff for the Canadian 
contribution to the overall mission and tasks of a peacekeeping 
force. Bill C-295 would end this practice which would 
ultimately mean less, not more national control. This does not 
seem to fit the general intent of the bill which suggests many of 
these concepts have not been fairly thought out.
<P>
	Such muddled thinking carries over to the sections of the bill 
dealing with rules of engagement and the use of force. 
Subsection 5(3) authorizes the use of deadly force only in 
self-defence and in defence of civilians threatened with deadly 
force or else to stop serious human rights abuses.
<P>
	However, it is important to understand peacekeepers may use 
force to protect civilians only if it is specifically authorized by a 
United Nations security council resolution. At the same time, 
the UN mandate may also require the use of force for reasons 
other than those specified in subsection 5(3).
<P>
	In other words, rules of engagement must take into account 
the specifics of the mandate. They cannot be restricted by 
legislation that turns a blind eye to such details.
<P>
<B>(1740 ) </B>
<P>
	The bill is murky and confusing in other areas. It would 
amend the National Defence Act so that all members of the 
Canadian forces assigned to a peacekeeping mission would be 
on active service for all purposes. However, this proposal is 
unnecessary because pursuant to Order in Council 1989-583, 
April 6, 1989, all regular force members anywhere in or beyond 
Canada and all reserve force members beyond Canada are 
currently on active service.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on a point of order. A couple of the government speakers 
have pointed out to me an error I made in the drafting of the bill. 
At line 31 of page 3, I used the words ``command of the United 
Nations'' when I meant to use ``operational control''. I wonder 
if there would be unanimous consent for the following. I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in line 31 of subclause 6(2) of Bill C-295, the Peacekeeping Act, the 
word ``command'' be struck out and replaced by ``operational control''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent to permit 
that change in the bill?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
(Motion agreed to.)
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
honoured to participate in the debate on Bill C-295, an act to 
provide for the control of Canadian peacekeeping activities by 
Parliament and to amend the National Defence Act in 
consequence thereof.
<P>
	I would remind you that the Bloc Quebecois has already 
expressed its support, with a few reservations, for this bill by 
our colleague for Fraser Valley East.
<P>
	I would like to recall the exceptional participation by 
Canadians, and particularly francophones, in UN peacekeeping 
operations since they started in 1956 at the initiative of Lester B. 
Pearson.
<P>
	I would also take the opportunity afforded me to salute the 
courage of the Canadian military who, over the years and in the 
course of various missions, have taken part in UN peacekeeping 
operations. I salute in particular the members of the Royal 22nd 
Regiment from Valcartier. Their presence in the former 
Yugoslavia reminds me that the horrors of this Bosnian conflict 
are felt right here at home. I want to offer all my moral support 
to the men and women who are over there and to their families 
here, who are feeling doubt and uncertainty but also pride.
<P>
	These peacekeeping missions are not what they were 40 years 
ago. They are constantly changing. They are increasingly costly 
in human and material terms, and their objectives are ever more 
in doubt. The role of peacekeepers is also being questioned. 
Should the deployment of international troops be faster and 
easier or, on the contrary, should UN peacekeeping operations 
be limited? Should UN peacekeepers have broader mandates?
<P>
	Recent conflicts in the former Yugoslavia, Somalia and 
Rwanda have made the international public more aware of 
peacekeeping activities, but they mainly brought to light the 
flawed rules of engagement for UN peacekeepers, and perhaps 
also the Canadian government's lack of responsibility in 
refusing to set clear peacekeeping objectives.
<P>
	Yet, these operations were once quite simple. The 
peacekeepers' job was to come between the warring factions in 
order to keep the peace and foster the resolution of conflicts. But 
peacekeeping operations have changed a great deal since the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13750"> 13750 </A></B>
<P>
1956 Suez crisis, while humanitarian efforts have become much 
more important in recent years.
<P>
	The rise in ethnic conflicts since the tensions between East 
and West have disappeared have turned peacekeeping missions 
into dangerous operations in which peacekeepers are caught in 
the middle of heavy fighting. Of course, the collapse of the 
Soviet bloc and the end of the cold war have given us an 
opportunity to contribute to the advancement of democracy and 
human rights. But this should not be done blindly.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the new complexity of peacekeeping mandates 
did not go hand in hand with public acceptance. The Canadian 
Forces' traditional role on the international stage has always 
been to support peacekeeping missions by contributing troops. 
However, the time for unconditional participation in every UN 
operation may be over.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	As some say, Canada is not the 9-1-1 of the planet. It is our 
view, in the Bloc Quebecois, that Canada should make any 
future commitment subject to more definite conditions. It is also 
our view that the Canadian Armed Forces should be configured 
around a clearly defined role. The credibility of our actions 
depends on it.
<P>
	In addition, we think that Canada should have a 
comprehensive review of its involvement in international 
security and peacekeeping. It should therefore review its 
contribution to existing military alliances, such as NATO and 
NORAD, as well as promote within these organizations a 
broadening of their role and mandate according to the needs of 
the UN.
<P>
	While reviewing its contribution to global peace and security, 
Canada should support the setting up of a standby contingent 
that could be deployed with UN peacekeeping forces abroad. 
These organizations need to see their skills updated both with 
respect to preserving security and resolving conflicts.
<P>
	The problem is that the Canadian government has no 
peacekeeping policy. As the hon. Leader of the Official 
Opposition asked last March, on what basis do we agree to take 
part in peacekeeping missions? No one can answer.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois refuses to give the defence minister a 
free hand and allow troops from Quebec and Canada to continue 
to be sent on missions which are frustrating because there is no 
clear and definite mandate, and in which they are totally 
powerless to do anything about the horrors suffered by civilian 
populations.
<P>
	Today, at a time when peacekeeping missions are becoming 
increasingly complex and their costs astronomical, while more 
and more lives are lost, clear conditions of participation are 
essential. The Bloc Quebecois hopes that the government will 
undertake to set out the conditions under which our troops will 
participate and their mandate can be renewed.
<P>
	It is essential that conditions be harmonized with the UN. UN 
missions are hard, particularly psychologically, because their 
purpose is not clear. The government and the Minister of 
National Defence should provide more information to this 
House, they should encourage a debate on the issue, so that we 
can work together to find a solution to the impasse in which 
Canadian troops find themselves.
<P>
	This is why the Bloc Quebecois supports this bill. It is 
essential that Parliament be informed of Canadian military 
activities abroad. As you know, the Bloc said on a number of 
occasions that Canadian participation in peacekeeping missions 
ought to be voted on in the House of Commons, following a 
short debate, time permitting.
<P>
	However, the Bloc Quebecois feels that Bill C-295 goes way 
too far in terms of parliamentary control and is much too rigid. 
Clause 4 does not include any provision dealing with the 
situation where Canadian troops might have to get involved in 
peacekeeping operations at a time when Parliament is not 
sitting, such as in the summer for example.
<P>
	Consequently, the legislation proposed by the Reform Party 
precludes the government from taking quick action in case of a 
crisis. There must be a happy medium between the position of 
the Reform Party and that of the Liberal government, which tries 
to restrict the role of parliamentarians to making speeches 
which carry no weight.
<P>
	We also have some reservations about the role of the UN in 
defining peacekeeping operations. Clause 4 of Bill C-295 
provides that a motion must be debated in the House of 
Commons to authorize the participation of Canadians in a 
peacekeeping mission, to specify the objectives and role of the 
mission, to define the state or the area in which the mission is to 
operate, to specify the date on which the authority is to expire, 
and to specify a maximum planned expenditure for the mission.
<P>
	I remind Reform members that the mandate, the objectives, 
the area and the duration of each UN mission would not be an 
issue if a permanent peacekeeping force were established, since 
the parameters would be defined by the United Nations.
<P>
	The problem exists today because the government sends, 
more or less automatically and without giving it much 
consideration, Canadian troops to every UN peacekeeping 
mission. So, the lack of parameters regarding the mandate of 
Canadian troops participating in peacekeeping missions clearly 
illustrates this problem, since the Canadian government seems 
unable to define the mandate and the objectives of Canadian 
participation in peacekeeping missions. Obviously, Parliament 
should look after that issue.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13751"> 13751 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	Do not forget that Canada's policy on peacekeeping missions 
must include a mechanism by which the peacekeepers' 
mandates can be adapted to the circumstances of the conflict. 
Unfortunately, the Reform Party is silent on this issue.
<P>
	The fact remains, nevertheless, that Parliament should be in a 
position to periodically review the situation and the context of 
peacekeeping missions, in order to make decisions on whether 
or not to commit Canadian troops, or whether to extend or 
shorten their mandates. This is why we will throw our support 
behind Bill C-295, despite the reservations that I have already 
expressed.
<P>
	In this month celebrating the 50th anniversary of the United 
Nations, it is clear that the international community and the 
government have to seriously review the UN's peacekeeping 
operations.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the government in its 
election platform made a commitment to better involve 
parliamentarians in the decision making process on foreign 
policy and defence issues. To that effect, House and Senate 
members have had the opportunity to participate extensively in 
the review of Canada's foreign and defence policies.
<P>
	A number of debates have been held in the House over the last 
16 months on several aspects of our international relations. 
These debates have allowed members to express their views 
specifically on Canada's peacekeeping policy and operations. 
This is why I thank the hon. member from the Reform Party for 
bringing in Bill C-295. It gives us another opportunity to give 
our views on our peacekeeping forces abroad.
<P>
	The concerns raised in Bill C-295 are in part similar to those 
expressed in previous debates. They show that a more open and 
accessible decision making process in the field of defence and 
foreign policy is necessary. The government subscribes to the 
intentions which have motivated the tabling of Bill C-295. It is 
after all the responsibility of this government to ensure that 
Canada's contributions to peacekeeping operations remain 
efficient and useful and that they respect the financial situation 
of the country.
<P>
	Bill C-295 generally calls for rigid procedures which would 
run counter to the need for the case by case flexible approach 
that has made Canadians successful peacekeepers in the past. 
Moreover the adoption of Bill C-295 which in its general 
outline borrows heavily from the American approach to 
peacekeeping would send a very negative signal to our partners 
and to the international community at a time when Canada is 
promoting new ways of improving the efficiency and the 
relevance of the UN in the field of conflict prevention and 
resolution.
<P>
	The end of the cold war has seen a return to violent ethnic and 
nationalistic conflicts in many parts of the world. This reality 
coupled with the new co-operation among the members of the 
security council have changed the peacekeeping equation. 
Missions have increased in number and grown in size and scope 
putting severe pressure on the financial capability of the UN and 
member states.
<P>
	Ten years ago Canada's share of the total UN cost of 
peacekeeping was $8 million. In 1995 Canadian assessment 
alone will be in excess of $150 million, not including the 
incremental costs of the Department of National Defence. This 
is admittedly a burden but it is also an investment in peace at 
costs far lower than were we to allow conflicts to continue 
unabated and uncontained.
<P>
	Canada remains one of the strongest advocates of reinforcing 
the UN's conflict prevention and conflict resolution capability. 
We have been working with like minded countries at the UN to 
bring about reforms that will provide the organization with the 
political, financial and military tools it needs to fulfil its 
growing responsibilities.
<P>
	Canada is conducting a study on a UN rapid reaction 
capability which will provide recommendations on how to make 
the UN more efficient and more timely in case of conflicts. We 
are also organizing with our partners peacekeeping seminars in 
the context of the ASEAN regional forum and the OAS. We are 
working with the OAU to improve the capability of African 
countries to better contribute to peacekeeping operations and 
preventive diplomacy.
<P>
<B>(1755 ) </B>
<P>
	On April 24 the Pearson Peacekeeping Centre officially 
opened providing the international community with a world 
class training facility in this vital field. Canada's credibility and 
efficiency in the field of peacekeeping came from its 
commitments to the UN and its reliability in time of crisis. 
Canada has contributed with distinction in most operations in 
the history of peacekeeping because of the foresight of its 
leaders, the flexibility of its policies and the courage and skills 
of its troops.
<P>
	Bill C-295, despite the well founded intentions of its author, 
would prevent the government from meeting these conditions. 
More specifically, Bill C-295 calls for a five hour debate prior 
to any mission that involves 100 or more members of the 
Canadian forces. Given the complexity of the situation on the 
ground and the sensitive nature of the negotiations that take 
place between the UN, the parties to the conflict and the troop 
contributors, a public debate on a given operation would take 
place in the shadow of diplomatic activities. It would likely lead 
to general reflection on peacekeeping without addressing the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13752"> 13752 </A></B>
<P>
specifics of the mission being debated. In other words, it would 
not respond to the problem for which this is allegedly a solution.
<P>
	Other avenues are already available to parliamentarians to 
express their views on the subject. The government will 
continue to ensure those views are taken into account when 
cabinet decides on Canada's contribution to peacekeeping.
<P>
	Given the nature of conflicts in the current international 
environment and the speed at which crisis situations degenerate 
into open confrontations, debating each mission might also 
hinder the government's ability to rapidly reply to a UN request 
and deploy Canadian troops in a timely fashion. This is precisely 
the opposite of what the government is currently promoting and 
urging the UN, to be more timely and more effective in 
responding to crises. Both the defence review and the foreign 
affairs review drew attention to this issue.
<P>
	Bill C-295, if implemented, would ask the Minister of 
National Defence to specify the objectives, duties and role of the 
mission as well as to define its area of operation. These aspects 
are currently defined by the UN Security Council after careful 
consideration and discussions with troop contributors. This is 
the sole competence of the UN.
<P>
	Should individual countries decide to redefine missions, 
objectives and operational requirements this situation would 
lead to constant stalemate in UN planning and deploying. When 
an operation does not meet Canadian approval, Canada does not 
contribute. This was the case for instance in the latest UN 
verification mission in Angola.
<P>
	Canada and other like minded countries have invested 
personnel and financial resources in order to ensure the UN 
fulfils its task in an efficient manner, observing the criteria and 
conditions which are necessary for countries contributing troops 
to participate in peacekeeping missions.
<P>
	We continue to play a leading role in the establishment of a 
better decision making process in the UN. Recently we have 
succeeded among other things in obtaining a better consultation 
mechanism between the security council and the contributing 
countries at the early stage in the process of mission planning. 
We intend to continue to press the UN and the security council 
on this issue.
<P>
	The bill also stipulates that the Canadian forces in 
peacekeeping operations shall be under direct command of a 
Canadian officer. This has always been the case. We do not need 
further legislation to ensure that provision.
<P>
	The bill further allows for this Canadian officer to be placed 
under United Nations command. The government strongly 
opposes this suggestion. Currently, Canadian soldiers are under 
UN control, but the ultimate command of the troops remains 
with Canadian authorities. Such a practice prevents the UN field 
commander from using Canadian troops for tasks that have not 
been agreed to by the government.
<P>
	Such a far reaching commitment appears to contradict the 
intent of the rest of Bill C-295 and demonstrates this proposal is 
not clearly thought out. I respect the author of the bill just tried 
to correct that with unanimous consent, but I think it shows how 
ill thought out the bill was.
<P>
	Let me underline again the commitment of this government to 
open debate on peacekeeping issues, especially in times of 
scarce resources. It is important to reach a broad consensus 
about where and how Canada should contribute to the needs of 
the international community. The foreign and defence policy 
reviews and the debates in the House are tangible proof of the 
seriousness of the government about the issue.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	However, Bill C-295 is a step in the wrong direction. The idea 
of providing greater parliamentary control over the Canadian 
contribution to UN peacekeeping is exerted at the wrong end of 
the decision making process.
<P>
	The adoption of this bill would not shake the overall Canadian 
attitude toward peacekeeping operations. It would rather have 
the effect of confusing the decision making processes and 
limiting Canada's ability to respond in a timely fashion to UN 
requests.
<P>
	Canadians remain supportive of our contribution to 
peacekeeping, as was demonstrated during the foreign and 
defence policy reviews and in several polls taken over the years. 
Canada should build on this past experience rather than move in 
the direction of this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to speak to Bill C-295, an act to 
provide for the control of Canadian peacekeeping activities by 
Parliament and to amend the National Defence Act in 
consequence thereof. Bill C-295 is the peacekeeping act.
<P>
	In commencing my remarks, I would like to address some of 
the concerns expressed by the member for 
Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke as well as those of the 
parliamentary secretary.
<P>
	Careful examination of the bill reveals that their concern of 
the ability of the governor in council to react rapidly is ill 
founded, in fact, specious. If we read the bill, it says that less 
than 100 people can be deployed for an indeterminate amount of 
time. More than 100 people can be deployed immediately 
without reference to Parliament for up to 30 days.
<P>
	If Parliament does not agree that Canadians should have a say 
in whether or not their people are committed to peacekeeping 
operations and 30 days is inadequate, then Parliament, in my 
estimation, is not doing its job.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13753"> 13753 </A></B>
<P>
	Bill C-295 should not be necessary at this time. We should 
have established long since an ability for Parliament to become 
involved in the deployment of Canadian forces personnel to life 
threatening situations.
<P>
	I would like to go on record as commending the government. 
It is far superior to its predecessors in that it has had four debates 
to date dealing with peacekeeping. The first one was on January 
25, 1994 and at that time there was all party support for Canada's 
continuing peacekeeping commitments. Following that, on 
February 17, 1994 there was a debate by the special joint 
committee on Canada's defence policy which also touched on 
peacekeeping and again received all party support.
<P>
	The third debate on peacekeeping was in September 1994. 
Notice was given on September 19, with the debate on 
September 21, hardly sufficient time to adequately prepare and 
debate an issue, particularly when the mandate was to be 
renewed on September 30. In other words, it was just over a 
week from the time the debate commenced until the 
commitment was signed.
<P>
	In December 1994 Reform laid down four stipulations which 
should be met if Canadian troops were to be left in the former 
Yugoslavia. These were that the airport at Sarajevo should be 
kept open; convoys should be able to proceed unimpeded; 
peacekeepers should not be interfered with and that a ceasefire 
should be in place and respected. As we all know, subsequent to 
that time these four parameters were all violated.
<P>
	Using an opposition supply day, Reform forced a discussion 
on severe problems in the defence department. The Minister of 
National Defence, having belatedly realized his failure to 
schedule a debate on renewal of the Balkan commitment, tried to 
convey that the opposition initiated debate would constitute a 
debate on renewing our peacekeeping commitment. When that 
was not satisfactory to us, the minister called for a debate on 
March 29, 1995 with the commitment expiring on March 31, 
1995.
<P>
	While I commend the government for having held debates, I 
question the validity of their timing. If we are really serious 
about Parliament and Canadians having input in whether 
Canadian troops should be committed to life threatening 
situations, surely it deserves more attention than it has been 
given by the government.
<P>
	I would like to quote from the red book where it says: ``A 
Liberal government will also expand the rights of Parliament to 
debate major Canadian foreign policy initiatives, such as the 
deployment of peacekeeping forces and the rights of Canadian 
to regular and serious consultation on foreign policy issues''. 
From that statement it is quite obvious the government is not 
keeping its promise so we have another broken red book 
promise.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	If one wants to look at a newly emerging democratic country, 
my colleague from Nanaimo-Cowichan recently returned from 
a North Atlantic Council meeting in Hungary at Budapest. He 
found that although it is relatively newly into the business, 
civilian control of the military in Hungary is vitally important. 
More important, the Hungarian Parliament has far more control 
than does the Canadian Parliament. No Hungarian soldier may 
be sent on operations beyond Hungary's borders without the 
approval of Parliament. This ensures that the pros and cons of 
any deployment are debated and that the people are aware of the 
factors bearing on the involvement of their country in foreign 
ventures.
<P>
	I ask the question: Had there been a full parliamentary debate 
prior to committing forces to the former Yugoslavia, would we 
now be in Bosnia and Hercegovina? I suggest that probably there 
would be at least 250 members of the House who would disagree 
with that initial commitment having been taken, going on the 
mandate that was not there and the fact that the achievement of 
peace was not a real desire on the part of the people involved.
<P>
	There was no peace to keep and no desire for peace on the part 
of the combatants. That would have been brought out in debate. 
It would have become obvious there could be no appropriate 
mandate for the Canadian peacekeepers to become involved.
<P>
	We need real debate, not a facade or smoke and mirrors. This 
is even more vitally important when one considers that 
peacekeeping is becoming more dangerous with every day. 
Canada, as the House will well remember, was once involved in 
all peacekeeping operations. With the reduction in the size of 
our forces, the financial constraints and the realization that 
Canada can no longer contribute to all, we must selectively 
involve ourselves in those missions that we know we can 
accomplish well.
<P>
	UN peacekeeping has grown astronomically. In January of 
1993 the UN had 12,000 peacekeepers in the field. Eighteen 
months later, in July of 1994, there were 80,000 peacekeepers in 
the field. In early 1993, Canada had 4,700 peacekeepers 
deployed. The number now has shrunk to between 3,000 and 
3,500, but that number seems likely to continue. Canada is now 
providing 3.6 per cent of the UN peacekeepers.
<P>
	With regard to command and control, I would like to return to 
the comments made by both the Bloc and the parliamentary 
secretary with regard to a UN standing force. They object to the 
unfortunate mistake of my colleague when he put command 
rather than operational control, but they seem willing to 
consider the assignment of operational command or control to 
the UN. I do not think Canadians are willing to see Canadian 
soldiers committed to a shooting situation or to a life 
threatening 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13754"> 13754 </A></B>
<P>
situation based on a decision by the United Nations  without 
reference to Parliament. Certainly I would not agree with that.
<P>
	Canadians are the best or at least among the very best in the 
world of peacekeeping. Our peacekeepers are well trained, well 
disciplined. They are innovative. They are trustworthy. They are 
dependable. They are compassionate and proficient in 
establishing and maintaining good relations with all factions in 
the area of conflict. This is painfully evident when one visits 
Bosnia or Croatia. Our peacekeepers are trusted because they 
are known to be unbiased. They show no favouritism to one side 
or the other. This means that all sides trust their judgment and 
rely on them to be fair and impartial.
<P>
	Someone said that more interpersonal relations training is 
required for our peacekeepers. There are very few, if any, of us 
who would not benefit from more training in this aspect but 
personal observation in the field has shown me that our 
peacekeepers not only do well but excel in their relationships 
with all factions in their area of responsibility. Possibly, because 
of Canadian qualifications, we should consider a different 
aspect of peacekeeping for Canada. Perhaps it should be our 
mandate or our best purpose to deploy quickly. We have the 
ability to resolve a situation over a short period of time and then 
withdraw, turning that job over to other peacekeepers: a first in, 
stabilize, establish a good situation and withdraw scenario.
<P>
<B>(1810 ) </B>
<P>
	Withdrawing seems to be Canada's primary peacekeeping 
problem. We can involve ourselves but we cannot get out. 
Canada had troops in Cyprus for more than 29 years. As a matter 
of fact we still have two people there. We have been in Croatia 
and Bosnia-Hercegovina for more than three years.
<P>
	Bill C-295 would not hamstring government's ability to react 
quickly to pop-up crises because it applies only to the 
commitment of 100 or more personnel and to time periods 
exceeding one month. Furthermore, considering the seriousness 
of deploying Canadian personnel on peacekeeping operations, a 
parliamentary debate would seem to be the minimum acceptable 
approval required.
<P>
	Should Parliament be in recess at the time of a crisis surely 
such a commitment deserves and would justify the recall of 
Parliament for such a debate.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill C-295 on behalf of the 
people of Guelph-Wellington today.
<P>
	I thank the hon. member for Fraser Valley East for his concern 
for Canadian peacekeepers. I know he is very sincere in this bill. 
I believe the bill has been introduced because of his concern and 
for the well-being of Canadian forces, a concern that is shared 
by the residents of Guelph-Wellington.
<P>
	Canadians invented the concept of peace making. Former 
Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson was awarded the Nobel Peace 
Prize in the 1950s. Our peacekeepers shared that same prize in 
the 1980s. We have always acted in the interest of maintaining 
international peace and security.
<P>
	Many of my constituents have participated in peacekeeping 
operations across the world and have distinguished themselves 
in service to their country. For example, recently Petty Officer 
Second Class Martin Mollison received a mention in dispatch 
from the Governor General for his act of bravery while serving 
in Cambodia.
<P>
	I cannot support this legislation for several reasons I wish to 
make clear to the House. As the hon. member knows, 
peacekeeping is carried out pursuant to the authority of the 
Minister of National Defence under section 4 of the National 
Defence Act. The minister has the authority with respect to the 
management and direction of the Canadian forces and of all 
matters relating to national defence.
<P>
	The legislation changes the decision making with respect to 
peacekeeping deployment and therefore restricts the 
prerogative, speed and discretion of the crown to determine 
Canada's contribution to United Nations or regional peace 
operations.
<P>
	The legislation would also remove the responsibility and 
discretion of the minister respecting military operations. This 
would therefore affect the speed with which we can respond to 
requests for assistance from the United Nations.
<P>
	The legislation would also ensure it would take longer for 
Canada to provide assistance because it would add another layer 
in decision making processes which is a strange suggestion from 
a member whose party stands for reduced government and easier 
decision making.
<P>
	The Reform Party's blue sheet states it supports a national 
defence policy that would provide a fast response to national or 
international conflict. By providing for a process that would 
subject the involvement of Canadian forces in international 
peacekeeping missions to parliamentary control the hon. 
member appears to be contradicting the support of a quick 
response which is central to the promises he made during the last 
election.
<P>
	Chapter VII of the United Nations charter provides for action 
by the security council with respect to the peace, breaches of 
peace and acts of aggression. Under articles 25 and 48 of the 
charter, member states of the United Nations are required to 
carry out the decisions of the security council for the 
maintenance of international peace and security.
<P>
	The procedures proposed by Bill C-295 would restrict 
government from carrying out its obligations under the United 
Nations charter. All Canadians share the pride of knowing that 
we have contributed to world peace. While the armed forces 
remain small and the population is modest compared to other 
<P>

<P>
nations, we were the first in peacekeeping and we remain 
respected because of what we do.
<P>
<B>(1815 ) </B>
<P>
	Peacekeeping is what we do well. We are asked to participate 
in missions around the world because other nations look to us for 
the expertise and skill required to perform the job of 
peacekeeping. Regrettably, we are often targeted by those who 
do not respect freedom and peace because we are, quite simply, 
the very best.
<P>
	One hundred thousand Canadians have served in over 30 
missions during the past 45 years. We have been asked because 
Canada has earned the respect and has acquired the skill to 
function as peacekeepers wherever we are required.
<P>
	I find it troublesome to read that Bill C-295 would give up 
Canadian sovereign command of Canadian forces. As the 
parliamentary secretary said earlier, Canadian personnel 
serving on peace operations are always commanded by a 
Canadian. Our commanders are directly responsible to the Chief 
of Defence Staff for the Canadian contribution to the overall 
mission and tasks of any given operation abroad. The hon. 
member at this point has said that he has changed that. I am 
pleased to see that, because it was a real flaw in the bill.
<P>
	The people of Guelph-Wellington are justifiably proud of 
our contribution to the history of peacekeeping. We support the 
concept of our troops promoting good relations and preventing 
genocide, acts of terrorism, and civil war. The Canadian flag has 
for many in the world been seen first on the shoulders of a 
peacekeeper in Somalia, Yugoslavia, Cyprus, and Central 
America. Our peacekeepers have served as care-givers, have 
rebuilt and maintained orphanages, and their families have 
organized food, clothing, and toy collections in order not only to 
keep the peace but to provide some comfort to innocent men, 
women, and children who suffer from acts of violence and war.
<P>
	Many of those peacekeepers were born in 
Guelph-Wellington and have family in my community or they 
have studied at the University of Guelph. My constituents 
remind me that every peacekeeper is a hero.
<P>
	The people of Guelph-Wellington want the overall control 
of our troops to be in the hands of the Canadian command.
<P>
	Never before has a government so often sought the 
consultation of members of Parliament on issues of 
peacekeeping. We have on this issue, as we have on so many 
others, demonstrated our commitment to seek the views of all 
parliamentarians and their constituents.
<P>
	The Prime Minister and the Minister of National Defence 
have listened and they will continue to do so. Actions have 
followed their seeking our advice on peacekeeping missions. 
There are times, however, when the government needs to act 
without delay. In our rapidly changing world, when nationalism 
and religious fervour  have risen to increasingly dangerous 
terms, the need for flexibility is paramount.
<P>
	My constituents will continue to support the government in 
promoting world peace and development. We understand the 
complexities of this commitment. We know that peacekeeping is 
not without risk. We also know that as the makers of the concept 
of peacekeeping its success will continue as long as we play a 
vital role in its future. The current system works well. It allows 
the government maximum flexibility.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I cannot support this legislation. I thank the 
House for the opportunity to speak to Bill C-295.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives me 
great pleasure to speak on this private member's bill. It is 
certainly timely. I congratulate the hon. member for Fraser 
Valley East for bringing it forward at this time.
<P>
	The current crisis in Bosnia has brought into sharp focus the 
need for Canadians to have clear criteria for the future of 
peacekeeping missions. That is exactly what Bill C-295 does.
<P>
	Certainly we have heard in the House many times that we 
cannot go everywhere. We have heard that we have to be more 
accountable, we have to be more transparent, and of course we 
always have to be aware of the cost of such measures.
<P>
	Let me review what has occurred in Bosnia to illustrate why 
we need a bill such as this.
<P>
	Canadian troops first went to this war-torn country over two 
and a half years ago in the honest hope that they could provide 
assistance and humanitarian relief to the people of Bosnia. They 
also hoped to keep combatants apart and facilitate a negotiated 
peace for the region.
<P>
<B>(1820 ) </B>
<P>
	Unfortunately, these laudable goals were not backed up by a 
United Nations mandate that could get the job done. With no 
leadership from Ottawa, our peacekeepers have been left 
twisting in the wind.
<P>
	Our peacekeepers are the best in the world and their service in 
Bosnia has been above and beyond the call of duty. They deserve 
to have modern equipment, a coherent government policy, 
decisive leadership from Ottawa, and a UN mandate that allows 
them to do their job properly. Unfortunately, the government has 
let them down in almost all these respects.
<P>
	We have received most recently mixed messages. We have a 
defence minister who says we should consolidate, we should 
fight back, and he even condones air strikes. We have a foreign 
affairs minister who says let us leave it the way it is and hope we 
can return to the mandate, as long as they do not keep taking us 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13756"> 13756 </A></B>
<P>
hostage and humiliating us. We have a Prime Minister who in 
effect simply tries to ride the middle and more or less agrees one 
day to go one way and another day to go the other.
<P>
	We do not have leadership in this area, and we certainly are 
letting our peacekeepers down because of it. Meeting with 
people as recently as today, that has been reconfirmed by people 
who have been there as recently as two days ago. To begin with, 
the government has overextended our commitments to 
peacekeeping while simultaneously cutting back on the defence 
budget. The results have been most unfortunate. For example, 
we have troops who go out on peacekeeping missions with 
equipment that would be considered antiques by many nations.
<P>
	Compounding this, we have Liberal defence cuts that have 
very much limited the availability of trained personnel. This 
means that for missions such as the one in Bosnia we have to 
keep sending the same people over time and again. How do 
members think our soldiers feel as they are posted back to 
Bosnia for the third or fourth time? What about their families? 
What do members think their reaction is when they see Canadian 
peacekeepers being targeted by all sides in that conflict? What 
do they feel, knowing that Canadian troops are regularly taken 
hostage at gunpoint by the very people they were sent to help?
<P>
	We must decide what we are going to do, and this bill helps us 
to do that. We must specialize. We must pick our areas. We 
cannot be everything to all people. And of course we must make 
sure we have a clear mandate and the equipment to deliver on 
that mandate.
<P>
	There is no peace to keep in Bosnia. There is also no 
humanitarian mission to speak of. The only thing the UN is 
successful at is being used as a pawn by the warring factions. 
The government should have recognized this long ago. Canada 
should never have renewed our commitment to Bosnia in March, 
considering the ridiculous situation our peacekeepers are in. 
The Reform Party warned the government and we asked for this 
withdrawal since before last Christmas, but the government did 
not listen.
<P>
	Our proud peacekeepers were not sent to Bosnia to be 
hostages. They were not sent there to be forced to helplessly 
watch murder and torture, since their mandate does not allow 
them to stop it. They were not sent there to be shot at by the very 
people they are supposed to be helping to find peace.
<P>
	The Bosnian mission has disintegrated beyond repair. While 
the government buries its head in the sand and wrings its hands 
in indecision, it is up to private members such as my hon. 
colleague from Fraser Valley East to speak for the people of 
Canada and to stand up for the interests of our peacekeepers.
<P>
	Bill C-295 does what the government should have done long 
ago. Instead of trusting the safety and lives of our peacekeepers 
to the twist of fate, this Parliament must set down criteria to 
condition our involvement for future missions. These criteria 
should outline what is acceptable and what is not. This is what 
Bill C-295 does. Most important among these criteria is that 
Parliament have the right to choose what peacekeeping missions 
Canada will participate in.
<P>
	It is not up to the Prime Minister to snap his fingers and expect 
that everyone will do what he wants. We supposedly live in a 
democracy, not a dictatorship, although the recent tactics of the 
Liberal Party on Bill C-68, Bill C-85, and Bill C-41 really have 
me wondering if that is true.
<P>
	It is amazing that we are told, ``If you do not agree with us, 
backbenchers, stay home. Forget about the people at home. The 
party knows best. We will take the message from Ottawa to the 
constituency.''
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	We waste time talking about $2 coins and three most 
important bills like this are left for us to talk about in six hours' 
time on third reading. We keep all of these people in line by 
giving them travel perks, by constituency spending, and by 
committee activity.
<P>
	Beyond the basic idea of parliamentary approval, members of 
Parliament will need specific information upon which to base 
their decision. Without knowing the specific objectives and 
duties of the peacekeepers, how can members know how to 
vote? Without knowing the duration and the maximum cost of 
the mission, how would Parliament decide on the best course of 
action? These questions will be answered if Bill C-295 is 
passed.
<P>
	Another key aspect of this bill is that it clearly spells out that 
Canadian peacekeepers shall be neutral and not engage in 
combat. This may seem obvious, but from watching the crisis in 
Bosnia it seems like the UN has taken sides. This is 
unacceptable. You cannot join the war you are intending to stop. 
This is why we have concerns about the strike force, about the 
whole concept of that strike force and what it is going to do. I 
guess we would have to applaud the government on the go slow 
action of recommending our involvement in this whole strike 
force idea. To escalate the war is certainly moving further and 
further away from the mandate, which we do not believe exists 
there any longer.
<P>
	Another vitally important criterion for the good of our 
peacekeepers involves the reasonable use of force. Again 
referring to the ridiculous situation in Bosnia, we see how this 
has been a major failing in the past. We have had troops that 
have not been able to defend themselves properly. We also have 
troops who have been forced to watch helplessly as civilians 
were massacred because their mandate did not allow them to do 
anything 
<P>

<P>
to stop it. Bill C-295 deals with this problem and spells out 
some very-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order. I am sorry, the hon. member's 
time has expired.
<P>
	The hon. member for Vancouver Quadra.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member for Fraser Valley East has brought 
forward legislation in the area of what under our constitutional 
system is left to good judgment and good sense. It takes us a step 
toward the American constitution, constitutionalizing these 
areas of discretionary judgment. Yet of course the experience 
with the American constitution is that when it comes to issues 
like the Vietnam War it does not prevent the United States 
sliding into that, in spite of the constitutional provisions.
<P>
	Reference has been made to eastern European experience. I 
was interested myself in the Russian constitution and the careful 
separation of powers now provided and the control by 
parliament over the military. Of course in Russia the newly 
written constitution has not stopped it from being embroiled in 
the conflict in the Caucasus.
<P>
	It is a mistake to imagine that legislation can cover these 
issues of prerogative power. In those constitutions that have 
done it, alternative glosses are simply developed.
<P>
	I thought we had a valuable debate here in the last few months. 
I do remember the undertaking given on the government side to 
consult with Parliament. When I went to the committee on 
defence this afternoon I had the privilege of sitting in and 
speaking there. I was reminded of our extraordinary good sense 
and that we have profited by experience. The failure in Somalia 
was a failure of judgment by the previous government. It did not 
study the geography; it did not study the military logistical base 
for support, and it paid the error of that misjudgment.
<P>
	These are matters about which I think we can say that we in 
Canada are better informed today. I think several successive 
debates in this House have brought an understanding on both 
sides that it is something to go into seriously, that we understand 
the limits of peacekeeping, that we will not creep into 
peacemaking type political actions under the guise that it is 
classical peacekeeping as Canada has conceived and that where 
we send our people in we will make sure their mission is 
adjusted to the realities of the military logistical support we can 
provide.
<P>
	What I am saying is I basically believe the system as it now 
exists will involve a proper and full consultation with 
Parliament from now on. We are anxious for advice. We are all 
committed to no more Somalias but to continuing in the Pearson 
tradition where we can be useful. Somebody cited Cyprus. We 
can be proud of Cyprus. We have kept the peace there and that is 
the model we will all be following in the future.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	I commend the member opposite for his initiative. However, I 
do believe it is covered under the powers of the constitutional 
customs which we have developed and which have been very 
much evident in the past few months by the experience of the 
debate and the lessons we have learned in Bosnia.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to present the first amendment of my caucus to Bill C-41. 
However, before I do so, I wish to point out that my colleagues 
and I listened very intently to all the witnesses who appeared 
before the Standing Committee on Justice. We made every 
attempt to reflect the opinions of these people in the 
amendments we introduced during clause by clause 
consideration of the bill. The amendments put forward today are 
based on the sentiments expressed to us from both the 
committee testimony and the thousands of letters we have 
received from all across Canada.
<P>
	Reform members of the Standing Committee on Justice paid 
particular attention to the view of the Canadian Police 
Association on Bill C-41, an authority the justice minister often 
cites as one of the major supporters of his gun control 
legislation. In its brief to the committee the Canadian Police 
Association stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Bill C-41 with few exceptions is unwieldy, complicated, internally 
self-contradictory, duplicitous and, what is worse in almost all of it, completely 
unnecessary for anyone with any knowledge of or use for the common law 
heritage of Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It went on to say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>While it would attempt to codify basic sentencing principles eliminating this 
most basic judicial discretion, at the same time it would bestow huge new 
discretionary powers to a whole range of persons within the justice system. The 
common thread in those new powers is that all are to the benefit of the offender 
in the sense of non-custodial consequences for criminal actions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Where sentencing reform calls for protection this bill offers platitudes. 
Where it calls for clarity it offers confusion and outright hypocrisy. It will 
almost certainly cause the already skyrocketing criminal justice budget to 
expand further still.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is what the Canadian Police Association had to say about 
the bill. I could not have better summarized Bill C-41. We have 
to wonder why the Minister of Justice so readily embraced the 
support of the Canadian Police Association for Bill C-68 and 
totally ignored its opposition to Bill C-41.
<P>
	Our first amendment is to delete section 717 of Bill C-41. 
Through this section the government has introduced a program 
of alternative measures to incarceration. This is the Liberal 
government's response to overcrowding in Canada's prisons. 
Rather than deal with the cause of crime, something Reform has 
been urging the government to do for some time, the Liberals 
choose to provide alternatives to putting criminals in prison.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13761"> 13761 </A></B>
<P>
	We would not have objected so vehemently to this section of 
Bill C-41 if the government had specified which offences may 
be subject to alternative measures. We could support the use of 
alternative measures for specific non-violent offences to reduce 
expensive court procedures and incarceration. However no such 
specifications appear in Bill C-41.
<P>
	The Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police and Victims of 
Violence recommended section 717 be amended to ``restrict the 
availability of the program to persons who have committed less 
serious offences and first time offenders''. Specifically 
reflecting the opinions expressed by these witnesses, Reform 
introduced an amendment during clause by clause consideration 
to limit the use of alternative measures. Our amendment was 
defeated.
<P>
<B>(1920) </B>
<P>
	The government failed to describe in the bill what may or may 
not constitute an alternate measure but rather has left this 
discretion up to the provinces. This has effectively granted 
broad discretionary powers to an unnamed source that is to be 
variable from province to province. This will create an 
inconsistency in the justice system of the country, something we 
can ill afford.
<P>
	Reform introduced an amendment proposing that a set of 
federal standards be established for the implementation of 
alternative measures programs by provinces to ensure justice is 
consistent in Canada. Our amendment was defeated.
<P>
	The discretion given in the bill to the provinces responsible 
for the administration of justice is not reflected in Bill C-68. 
When Reform introduced amendments during clause by clause 
consideration of the bill to return to the provinces the authority 
to regulate gun clubs and gun shows our amendment was 
defeated.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary said there should be federal 
standards for the regulation of these businesses. The 
inconsistency in the government's justice legislation clearly 
demonstrates that the objective of justice to reduce crime is not 
the motivating factor behind Bill C-37, Bill C-68 or Bill C-41.
<P>
	Under Bill C-41 alternative measures can only be used if the 
offender fully and freely consents to participate, with no 
consideration being given to the victim. Reform proposed the 
use of alternative measures only after due consideration has 
been given to any views expressed by the victim against whom 
the offence has been committed. The rights of victims should 
always come before those of the offender.
<P>
	We also introduced an amendment stipulating that these 
measures could only be used for a person who has not been dealt 
with by alternative measures before or has been previously 
convicted of an offence. Both amendments were defeated.
<P>
	As stipulated in Bill C-41 it is not mandatory for records 
concerning alternative measures to be retained. Nor do the 
records have to be transferred to a central repository. This means 
when someone commits another offence that a previous offence 
which was dealt with by an alternative measure will not be 
available for sentencing in the second case.
<P>
	One has to wonder how serious the government is about doing 
background checks on applicants for a firearms licence as 
outlined in Bill C-68. Because of this provision in Bill C-41 
pertinent information regarding an admission of guilt may not 
be discovered by chief firearms officers unless they conduct 
lengthy and expensive checks into the records of all local police 
forces. Again Reform introduced an amendment making it 
mandatory for the police to retain records and for those records 
to be placed in a central registry. Again that amendment was 
defeated.
<P>
	We therefore today move to delete the section dealing with 
alternative measures from Bill C-41. We have also introduced 
an amendment to delete section 718.2 from the bill which gives 
the courts the authority to increase or reduce a sentence for 
relevant, aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the 
offence or the offender.
<P>
	Reform believes this section of the bill is totally unnecessary. 
The courts already take aggravating and mitigating 
circumstances into consideration when determining the length 
of a sentence to impose on an offender.
<P>
	We do not believe this section serves any purpose except to 
advance the justice minister's position that sexual orientation 
should be a protected category in the charter. We object to the 
minister's back door attempt through the bill to keep his word to 
provide added protection for certain groups of people and 
thereby create a semblance of special status for those groups. 
Rather than amend the charter and thus draw widespread public 
opposition, he is appeasing this group of Canadians by including 
the term in the Criminal Code.
<P>
	Reform believes all Canadians are equal before the law. We do 
not accept that anyone should be granted special protection or 
status before or under the law and therefore move to strike this 
section from the bill.
<P>
	I am appalled the government has chosen to limit debate on 
this contentious bill. It had ample opportunity to bring the bill 
back to Parliament months ago when the committee reported it 
back to the House. The government obviously delayed report 
and third reading stages of the bill in anticipation of it being lost 
in the bottleneck of legislation the government is scrambling to 
pass before the summer recess.
<P>
	It is quite obvious the government is afraid to allow Bill C-41 
and Bill C-68 to sit over the summer, providing Liberal MPs an 
opportunity to discover how their constituents really feel about 
these bills. I have to question the confidence of the government 
with regard to these pieces of legislation. I therefore implore 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13762"> 13762 </A></B>
<P>
members  of the House to listen to Canadians and remove these 
sections from the bill.
<P>
<B>(1925) </B>
<P>
	Canada is faced with rising crime rates, escalating costs to 
administer justice and growing debt. The task of the federal 
justice minister is to deal with these problems in unison. That 
would be difficult but not insurmountable.
<P>
	I place these considerations before the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wappel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I am 
looking to your guidance on a question with respect to the voting 
patterns you have just issued on the various motions.
<P>
	Is it appropriate for me to mention this point of order now or 
would you prefer that I see you privately? I am somewhat 
confused as to item (k) in Group No. 2. I am in your hands as to 
how you would like to handle it.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> If the hon. member would come to the Chair 
perhaps I could at least give him an opinion on how I believe it 
will be worked out.
<P>
	In the meantime I would propose to continue debate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Motion No. 4 is on the French language. You may think that this 
is a little different, but I did not think either that I would one day 
make a speech on the French language in this House. However, 
that was my only reason for putting forward this motion, as you 
will see.
<P>
	The motion deals with the French version of Section 717.2(1), 
which, in my opinion, is not drafted in everyday, understandable 
French. Understandable it may be, but certainly not for the 
average person.
<P>
	Since it is a very short paragraph, I will read it for you:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>717.2(1) Le dossier relatif à une infraction imputée à une personne et 
comportant, notamment, l'original ou une reproduction des empreintes 
digitales ou de toute photographie de la personne peut être tenu par le corps de 
police qui a mené l'enquête à ce sujet ou qui a participé à cette enquête.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The French ``qui a tenu'' is obviously a literal translation of 
``hold''. In French, ``obtenu une photographie'' means holding 
it in one's hands, although in this context it means keeping or 
holding it. That is why I moved my amendment aimed at 
substituting the word ``conservé'' for the word ``tenu''. A 
photograph or document may be kept but, as I understand it, it is 
held in one's hands. It is in that sense that, as I said, I was very 
surprised to realize that I now had to put forward a motion on the 
French language.
<P>
	I should tell you that a number of my other motions are also 
related to the French language, as you will see a little later. I will 
not list them all at this time, but the French used here is often 
peculiar, as the Bar Association noted. In several appearances 
before the justice committee, the Barreau du Québec observed 
that the French used in the Criminal Code did not match reality.
<P>
	I will now quote an excerpt from the Barreau's brief on 
another bill, but it could also apply to this one. The Barreau du 
Québec says that no one is deemed ignorant of the law. That, as 
we know, is true. They go on to say, ``The law must, however, be 
intelligible. The genius of the language, although it has its own 
rules, does not rule out the Cartesian, concise approach that is 
essential to the proper understanding of statutory law''.
<P>
<B>(1930) </B>
<P>
	As for Michel Sparer and Wallace Schwab, they recognize the 
fact that the implementation of these principles requires strong 
intellectual skills, for the writer must be able to move away from 
specifics and sometimes partisan views to take a broader, more 
global approach while at the same time being extremely 
succinct.
<P>
	They add that the simpler subject-verb-complement 
structure which is preferred in French shows that this language 
emphasizes what English usually relegates to a position of 
secondary importance, hence the need to be careful not to 
translate literally and to rearrange in a logical sequence, as 
required, sentences that sound English.
<P>
	Understandably, in view of how complex regulatory activity 
is, legal instruments cannot always be drafted in accordance 
with these guidelines nowadays. According to the Barreau du 
Québec, clarity must nevertheless remain one of the primary 
goals of the legislator, hence the value of drafting the French and 
English texts separately, a rule that the Barreau suspects was 
broken in this case.
<P>
	That is a common complaint from the association. That is why 
I moved several amendments to Bill C-41 designed to make the 
French version truly consistent with what we call the genius of 
the French language. I hope that our linguists are listening in 
this evening, so that someday we can have French instruments 
that are understandable and intelligible.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to speak to the motions brought 
forward in this first grouping.
<P>
	Motion No. 4 was brought forward by the member for 
Saint-Hubert. I realize what the member is intending and has the 
suggested wording that would reduce the scope of the terms of 
the bill. The Department of Justice looked at this and felt the 
recommendation would be inconsistent with the use of the verb 
tenir elsewhere in the text. Therefore if we changed it here we 
would run the risk of putting other parts of the legislation in a 
tenuous position.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13763"> 13763 </A></B>
<P>
	With respect to Motion No. 3, I am very surprised when the 
member for Crowfoot talks about cost cutting in conjunction 
with the Canadian Police Association and wanting to save 
money by doing away with alternate measures. The inmate 
population is exploding. The years between 1989-90 and 
1993-94, four years, the federal inmate population increased by 
17 per cent, with total expenditures in 1993-94 at $880 million 
for federal corrections and $990 million for provincial 
corrections.
<P>
	The annual cost of holding an inmate on average in medium 
and maximum security was $39,000 per inmate per year for 
federal institutions and $35,000 per inmate per year for 
provincial institutions.
<P>
<B>(1935) </B>
<P>
	That indicates the dramatic increase in the actual cost of 
incarceration. The member for Crowfoot says we should not 
have alternative measures. If we do not start working toward 
alternative measures what we will have is people in 
incarceration costing an extremely large sum of money.
<P>
	Many are in incarceration. One-third of the people in 
incarceration are there for non-payment of debt. We want to get 
away from that. Who is being punished in a case like that when 
we have people in incarceration for non-payment of debt?
<P>
	In many cases they cannot afford to pay. It is of no purpose to 
put them in incarceration. The alternate measures have been in 
federal legislation for many years in the Young Offenders Act. 
The experience of the provinces in administering alternative 
measures programs has been sufficiently positive that they have 
asked us in the Department of Justice, the Minister of Justice in 
particular, to include similar measures within the Criminal Code 
for adults.
<P>
	Deleting those provisions would go against a perfectly 
reasonable request being made by the provinces. The 
availability of alternative measures exercised under the 
programs authorized by the provincial attorney general within 
enabling federal legislation respects the division of powers 
between the Government of Canada and the provincial 
government and recognizes provinces are in the best position to 
develop and administer programs related to the offenders 
targeted by those measures.
<P>
	The availability of alternative measures will better enable 
provinces to manage their costs in respect to court time and the 
use of correctional facilities and resources. It seems 
inconsistent that the Reform Party, which has focused much of 
its attention on bringing costs under control, would deny 
provinces the tool to better manage cases appearing before their 
courts.
<P>
	Deterring and deleting alternative measures would reduce the 
scope of action available to the courts and to the provinces as 
they administer criminal justice and would not strengthen either 
this bill or the criminal justice system in general.
<P>
	The member for Crowfoot, on behalf of the Reform Party, said 
he put forward federal standards. We want to have some kind of 
standards but alternative measures are looked at in different 
ways in different provinces.
<P>
	The problem with the program is some areas do not have the 
facilities to provide the alternative measures. That is a severe 
problem and it means in some areas of the country alternative 
measures provisions or possibilities are either non-existent or 
severely curtailed.
<P>
	We could say because of that we will scrap alternative 
measures altogether so they are not put in place anywhere in the 
country but that really does not achieve anything. It denies the 
people in the areas that have the alternative measures 
possibilities from utilizing these possibilities.
<P>
	Also, we could say if one has created a certain seriousness of 
offence that person is not eligible. When we are dealing with 
cases, with human concerns and with human considerations, 
who is to say that where somebody who has been flaunted and 
taunted in incarceration would be better put back in 
incarceration than into a program where he would have to spend 
some time working in the community or for the benefit of the 
victims?
<P>
<B>(1940 ) </B>
<P>
	Also we want to be able to offer the program in a positive 
nature and to improve on it. We heard in committee that one 
problem with the alternative measures was that when young 
people were involved in this they were not being supervised. 
That is the case in some instances. We have to strengthen these 
programs. I think there are various ways of doing that.
<P>
	It has also been stated by the Reform Party that we should 
have a central registry because there is no record of those who 
are put on alternate measures and we do not know if they have 
been before the courts before or if they have been on alternative 
measures. If there is no record the next time they appear it would 
be considered a first offence and they would be on alternative 
measures again.
<P>
	That is not the case. It is not CPIC, it is not on a national 
computer but it is in local court files. There is a general record 
on alternate measures programs.
<P>
	Alternate measures programs work in different ways in 
various provinces. It is used as a diversion program in Nova 
Scotia. Offenders are put on the diversion program before they 
come to court and a record of this is kept in the police files. In 
other provinces they appear before the court and instead of being 
sentenced after the case is heard they are put on the alternative 
measures program. The programs are working. Young people 
have been rehabilitated to prove it.
<P>
	We are not saying we will have the same success rate with 
adults because the older a person becomes the less the 
possibility of rehabilitation, but we do feel there will be success. 
Quite often incarcerating these people costs the Canadian public 
up to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13764"> 13764 </A></B>
<P>
$100,000 per person in some instances, which is the case in 
some young offenders facilities.
<P>
	The average cost of keeping someone incarcerated in a federal 
institution for one year is $39,000. If we can get better results or 
even if we can get the same results in alternative measures we 
should examine them.
<P>
	We should leave the possibility with the provinces that want 
these programs for adults. We should give the learned judges 
and justices the ability to place people on these programs if it is 
deemed the best course to take.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard St-Laurent (Manicouagan, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
as the official opposition critic on correctional issues, I take a 
particular interest in this bill. In spite of all the controversy 
surrounding this issue, the time has come to update and adapt 
our criminal justice system to the modern reality.
<P>
	The efforts made to reform the sentencing process in Canada 
span a number of years and have required enormous human and 
financial resources. For the first time, we have an opportunity to 
give concrete expression to these efforts and to implement 
recommendations made by numerous commissions in their 
reports. Such a reform requires an objective review of the 
current situation, as well as the development of an original 
model for the future.
<P>
	Several recent studies come to conclusions which confirm the 
need to reform Canada's criminal justice system. Let me 
mention a few. First, it is fairly safe to say that Canada puts too 
many people in jail for periods which are too long. Second, 
contrary to popular belief and to what some may claim, the 
crime rate, particularly for violent crimes, has not increased in 
Canada. Studies covering the period between 1988 and 1993 
show that these rates remained essentially the same throughout 
that period. In fact, the rate for violent crimes has dropped 
slightly since 1991.
<P>
<B>(1945) </B>
<P>
	Bill C-41 is a true reform of the sentencing process, and only 
such a reform will solve some of the crucial problems which 
have been surfacing in recent years. Instinctively, and also 
because of fear, society has always been in favour of imposing 
long terms of imprisonment on criminals. Yet, it is established 
that such long periods of incarceration increase the risk of 
recidivism.
<P>
	Consequently, public safety is not at all increased, quite the 
contrary. If we put offenders in jail for long periods of time, the 
problem will not be solved once they get back on the street.
<P>
	Almost sixty years later, we finally have a chance to make 
amends and act responsibly, fifty years after the famousArchambault report, published in 1938, stated that we had a 
collective responsibility, and we have that chance in the form of 
Bill C-41 and, more specifically, the new section 717 of the 
Criminal Code.
<P>
	Of course we could save a lot of public money by using 
probation instead of incarceration as part of the rehabilitation 
process. In Great Britain, where alternative measures have been 
used for years and are used frequently, this did not lead to an 
increase in the crime rate, on the contrary, since Great Britain 
has one of the lowest repeater rates in the world.
<P>
	The government has spent millions of dollars in recent years 
on the construction and maintenance of prisons that in the end do 
not do what they are supposed to do. Incarceration has failed to 
meet its two main objectives: to punish the offender and to 
protect society on a permanent basis.
<P>
	Overcrowding and double occupancy of cells have reached a 
critical level in federal penitentiaries, as the hon. member from 
Kingston pointed out a few minutes ago. If Canada were to build 
new prisons, they would fill up immediately. However, if we 
could find alternatives to incarceration, in the case of offenders 
who are not dangerous-the majority of the prison 
population-we would solve the problem of overcrowding in 
prison institutions. We are talking about more than 80 per cent 
of the prison population, in this case.
<P>
	So before getting into construction programs that will cost 
many more millions, we should develop alternatives that are 
less costly, more cost effective and therefore more effective 
overall.
<P>
	The average annual cost of community supervision for all 
provinces is about $1,500 per person on probation or parole, 
while it costs $80,000 annually to keep an inmate in prison.
<P>
	Quite frankly, using prison sentences as the principal 
punishment for all kinds of offences is no longer a defensible 
option nowadays. Most offenders are neither violent nor 
dangerous. It is unlikely their behaviour will improve as a result 
of going to prison. Consequently, alternatives to incarceration 
and alternate forms of punishment are increasingly considered a 
necessary option.
<P>
	Alternatives to incarceration are not a recent development. 
The principle has been discussed for half a century. And for half 
a century we have been marking time. I think it time we tuned 
into today's reality and for once took a step forward by adopting 
provisions that would enable us to develop alternatives to 
incarceration, as clause 6 of Bill C-41 proposes.
<P>
	We are forever hearing that imprisonment is expensive and 
that the courts are too slow. Well, by adopting alternative 
measures we also resolve the problem of congestion in the 
courts. With these measures, minor offences may be handled by 
means other than formal and costly legal proceedings. There are 
two main objectives: to prevent subsequent criminal behaviour 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13765"> 13765 </A></B>
<P>
and to attenuate any prejudice minor offenders may suffer in 
legal proceedings.
<P>
	These measures also get the community involved and put 
greater focus on reconciliation between victim and offender. 
Alternative measures are already used successfully in certain 
provinces for young offenders. They may now be used for 
adults. There are many alternative solutions.
<P>
<B>(1950) </B>
<P>
	They do not involve just victim compensation, for example, 
the number of day-fines, compensatory work for non-payment 
of fines, and so on. There is a whole list of them, if you want to 
be more specific.
<P>
	There are many examples of sentences aimed at the social 
reintegration of offenders. Therefore, first offenders or minor 
offenders will be taken out of the legal system. These measures 
will ensure public protection by reducing the negative effects of 
incarceration. The courts will have more time for more 
important matters.
<P>
	It should be pointed out that this diversion process is only for 
those who admit liability for their acts of commission or 
omission when it is considered that alternative measures do not 
interfere with public safety and the interests of the victim, while 
at the same time meeting the needs of the offender.
<P>
	Such alternative measures must be part of a program approved 
by the attorney general, his deputy or a person designated by the 
lieutenant governor in council. The Crown must be satisfied that 
there is sufficient evidence to prosecute and the person charged 
must be informed of his or her right to counsel, on top of having 
fully agreed to participate in this program.
<P>
	Imprisonment and detention should only be a last resort, when 
everything else has failed. Alternative penalties are a good 
example of a different approach to conflict resolution in that 
they attempt to minimize the negative impact on individuals, 
judicial red tape and the economic and human cost to society of 
many needless incarcerations.
<P>
	To conclude, I will therefore support this bill, which makes it 
possible to take a step forward, and I am pleased that by passing 
these provisions on alternative measures we can show that we 
are able to be innovative in devising sentences which are more 
sensible and therefore more in line with what is needed at 
present in the correctional service.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
gives me pleasure to speak to Bill C-41.
<P>
	Once again we have a piece of legislation that simply does not 
do anything in terms of justice, punishment or dealing with the 
problems facing the country. When I look at the last two years, 
there have not been any bills passed in the House as far as I am 
concerned that do anything in terms of making the country safer, 
better for those individuals called victims who need the 
protection of our system. It just is not happening.
<P>
	I am thinking of certain bills such as the one the member 
across the way put forth to eliminate section 745 which died and 
we do not bring it back. I could mention a dozen others. I am 
really upset that we are not getting good legislation that will 
give the effect the famous red ink book says it would do.
<P>
	There is no measure in this legislation that causes me more 
grief than the government's attempt to deal with violent young 
offenders. We passed Bill C-37 which says that 16 and 17-year 
olds will go to adult court. Then we come out with a bill that is 
going to make the sentencing the same as if they were in youth 
court. It does not make sense.
<P>
<B>(1955) </B>
<P>
	Picture the family of a young mother standing by her 
graveside hearing words from the minister telling all who 
gathered how much this woman will be missed. Picture the tears 
sliding down the many cheeks of Canadians present and listen to 
their voices repeat over and over again: ``Why did this happen?''
<P>
	This picture is happening far too often to too many Canadians 
to be passed over by the government's attempt at social 
engineering which does little to prevent violent youth from 
believing that to kill someone they will be punished by this 
government. This government is using crybaby tactics to soothe 
the intellectuals who continually state that 16 and 17-year old 
murderers are too young, too poor and too abused to know the 
difference between right and wrong.
<P>
	What does this government say the penalty should be for such 
sadness, hurt and brutality to victims, families and friends? 
According to the justice minister, if the murderer is a 16 or 
17-year old, a slap on the wrist and a promise not to do it again is 
penalty enough. Remember, this is the same government that 
publicly stated it was going to get tough with ultraviolent young 
offenders. Remember, this is the justice minister who told 
Canadians that his government would not tolerate those youth 
who carry knives and hold no regard for human life or the 
feelings of those who care.
<P>
	What did this minister and the government do to punish and 
deter 16 and 17-year old hooligans with no regard for others? In 
Bill C-41 the government proposed to punish 16 and 17-year 
old murderers by transferring them to adult court with a five 
year jail sentence. Maybe if the youthful killer was particularly 
violent and gruesome, he possibly could be removed from 
society for 10 years.
<P>
	This sentence is ironically considered just as serious to the 
justice minister as his original punishment for law-abiding 
citizens whose only crime is hiding a firearm from the 
minister's scrutiny. The fact that this minister and this 
government 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13766"> 13766 </A></B>
<P>
equated taking a human life with the heinous crime of refusing 
to file the proper paperwork with the bureaucracy is ridiculous.
<P>
	This minister made fine grandstanding speeches on how 
violent, killing youth would be held accountable for their 
actions. This same minister and his government told heart 
wrenching stories of poverty, dysfunctional families and their 
effect on juvenile crime. Whatever the reason, there is no excuse 
for coldly and cruelly taking another life.
<P>
	Let me remind those opposite that not all youth raised in 
poverty turn to crime, deciding a human life is a worthless 
commodity that can be snuffed out at a whim. Let me remind 
those opposite that many youth are not raised in ideal conditions 
but go on to work hard day after day, save their money, meet 
someone, marry, have children and do all the normal things. Yet 
this bill makes folly of those hard working youth who do 
understand they have a role in society and that they can achieve a 
better life by following the minimum expectations of society.
<P>
	What does this tell the people of Canada who have day in and 
day out raised their voices in loud cries that they have had 
enough of 16 and 17-year old butchers being treated like victims 
of some social order-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
hesitate to interrupt the hon. member, but I would like some 
clarification from the Chair. It is my understanding that at this 
stage we are debating report stage Motions Nos. 3 and 4. I have 
been listening with care to the remarks of the member for Wild 
Rose and have yet to understand what relationship they bear to 
Motions Nos. 3 and 4. It may be that there is some confusion as 
to the stage of the debate. I wonder if the Speaker might provide 
some guidance.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Yes, the hon. member is correct. We are 
debating Motions Nos. 3 and 4. Many times members use a few 
minutes to set up their argument. I would presume that is what 
the hon. member for Wild Rose is doing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I hope that I sum this all up at 
the end.
<P>
	There are several things I know this government would like to 
do in regard to alternative measures, even with the violent 
people it is talking about and it certainly applies to the youth just 
as much as anyone else. I am talking about those alternative 
measures that may be applied to youth where we were going to 
get tough in Bill C-37. We were going to take 16 and 17-year 
olds to adult court, yet the sentencing and alternative measures 
the government is trying to propose in this bill do not seem to 
fall into line with what was proposed in Bill C-37.
<P>
<B>(2000 ) </B>
<P>
	Why should 16 and 17 year olds be excused for the most 
serious of crimes? If they are only one or two years older, what 
difference does it make when it gets that serious? Canadians are 
saying this is enough of this namby-pamby justice spouted by a 
bleeding heart government. Canadians say that the quality of 
mercy must be chosen when the right circumstances prevail, and 
murder is not one of those circumstances.
<P>
	How dare we suggest alternative measures for a killer? How 
dare we even think that might be a good solution? Canadians are 
saying that if a 16 or 17 year old chooses to kill, he or she must 
also know that society will choose not to show mercy, that 
society will demand a grievous penalty to match the heinous 
crime.
<P>
	Canadians are growing weary of a government that says one 
thing to a majority but follows the directions dictated by a small 
minority of ivory tower individuals who barricade themselves 
behind security systems and isolate themselves from the real 
world and reality and then say that young murderers cannot be 
blamed for their crimes and should be put on alternative 
measures.
<P>
	I have had enough of this say everything but do nothing 
government. This has been going on for far too long. We see 
other clauses that come up in this particular bill and we have 
been trying to figure out exactly what we are trying to prove in 
our society. Consider 718.2. We would like to get rid of this 
section. We have made a list of people who are going to be 
treated differently than others because of their race, colour, 
creed, and now we want to add sexual orientation.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, while we are at it let us add fat people. I will tell 
you what happened in this House just a month ago. Someone 
sitting right over there said ``Come on, fatso, let's go outside 
and fight''. Rather than speaking to you, Mr. Speaker, about that 
kind of language, I decided I would meet him face to face and 
see if I could tell him not to do that. I am sure he will not do it 
again. It is a shame that I as a fat person would be left off this 
list. If we check, there are lawsuits throughout the country of 
people who did not get jobs because they were not built right or 
maybe because their IQ was a little too low. Why would that 
affect anything? Maybe some do not look right.
<P>
	So let us take the section and get rid of it. For heaven's sake, 
do not add sexual orientation. That is the last thing we need in 
this country.

	<B>The Speaker:</B> We are still debating Motions Nos. 3 and 4, and 
I give the floor to the hon. member for Bellechasse.

will try to be brief and will probably succeed in this endeavour.
<P>

<HR>
<B><A NAME="13767"> 13767 </A></B>
<P>
	In response to the motion introduced earlier by my colleague, 
the hon. member for Saint-Hubert, the hon. member for Cape 
Breton-The Sydneys did not appear convinced of the need to 
amend section 717. Therefore, I took the liberty of consulting a 
dictionary while I was waiting for my turn to speak.
<P>
	In fact, subsection 717.2(1) of the French version says the 
following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>717.2(1) Le dossier relatif à une infraction imputée à une personne et 
comportant, notamment, l'original ou une reproduction des empreintes 
digitales ou de toute photographie de la personne peut être tenu par le corps de 
police qui a mené l'enquête à ce sujet ou qui a participé à cette enquête.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The controversy centres on the meaning of the word ``tenu''. 
On page 849 of the general Larousse English-French dictionary, 
the verb ``to hold'' is translated by ``contrôler et avoir la 
responsabilité de''. The hon. member for Saint-Hubert in fact 
proposes translating the English word ``hold'' by the most 
correct French equivalent. I can very well hold the bill in my 
hands; but that does not necessarily mean that I will keep it for 
10 years.
<P>
	The aim of clause 717.2 is to enable police officials to keep 
records on offences. If they are to be kept, there must be some 
control. So, if I take the bill and put it in my desk, I am 
controlling it. It is archived, and I control it. I do not have it in 
my hands.
<P>
	I understand that the English verb ``hold'' can include a 
number of things, but there is a specific term, which does not 
have a negative effect on other legislation. In using the French 
verb ``tenir'' in its strictest sense, we talk about holding 
something in our hands and having immediate and brief control, 
but we will hold on to it.
<P>
<B>(2005) </B>
<P>
	The hon. member for Cape Breton-The Sydneys may very 
well hold his wife in his arms, but that does not mean he controls 
her. There is a difference between the two.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> He wants to keep her.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Langlois:</B> He would do well to hold her from time to 
time, if I may be permitted a little humour. I am sure the hon. 
parliamentary secretary will agree that the magic of the French 
language and one of its beauties as well would enable us to bring 
the English and the French closer together. This is why I invite 
the hon. parliamentary secretary to see if this error cannot 
simply be corrected.
<P>
	Excuse me for having taken my seat before I had finished 
speaking.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunziata:</B> On a point of order, Madam Speaker, is there 
still an opportunity to speak to Motions 3 and 4, which I 
understand are grouped together?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Yes, there is. The hon. 
member for York South-Weston.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I was not in the House because I was trying to seek 
some clarification with respect to this concept of alternative 
measures. I would like to address my comments for the moment 
to this particular provision in Bill C-41.
<P>
	As I understand it, a person can commit a murder, a person can 
commit a rape, a person can commit an aggravated assault, and 
under this provision that person may never in fact be prosecuted 
in a court of law.
<P>
	The section reads: ``Alternative measures may be used to deal 
with a person alleged to have committed an offence only if it is 
not inconsistent with the protection of society and the following 
conditions are met: (a) the measures are part of a program of 
alternative measures authorized by the Attorney General or the 
Attorney General's delegate''.
<P>
	That means that we in this Parliament dealing with federal law 
are saying that there are crimes, any crime in the Criminal Code, 
if the attorney general for any of the provinces in Canada 
decides that for example we are not going to prosecute rapists 
any longer-you may say this is far-fetched and it will never 
happen, but the fact is that this amendment would allow that to 
happen. A provincial government somewhere in this country 
might decide for whatever reason they are not going to prosecute 
rapes any more and instead rapists will heretofore be subject to 
alternative measures.
<P>
	What are those alternative measures? We do not in this 
legislation describe what those alternative measures are, what 
crimes will be subject to those alternative measures. In fact it 
says any crime. We do not know. Does that mean that a rapist, 
someone who is alleged to have committed a rape, can for 
example be diverted out of the criminal justice system and into 
some alternative measures? What can those alternative 
measures be? We do not know. This bill does not define what 
alternative measures are. This bill leaves it up to the attorneys 
general of the provinces.
<P>
	I am sorry, but I do not have faith in attorneys general in this 
province to prosecute or to deal with serious offenders. They 
could very well say, using my scenario, that alleged rapists will 
have to do some community work, will have to cut grass instead 
of serving time in prison, or they might have to work at a day 
care centre. That might sound outrageous, but this section is 
outrageous. It is inconsistent with the desire of Canadians from 
one coast to the other to have strict laws to deal with violent 
offenders.
<P>
<B>(2010 ) </B>
<P>
	I can understand if we used alternative measures for 
non-violent offences such as fraud, robbery, someone who 
steals food, milk or bread, someone who is not a threat to my 
children or to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13768"> 13768 </A></B>
<P>
my neighbour's children.  However this is totally openended. 
Any offence is eligible for alternative measures.
<P>
	In effect what this bill would do is have a checkerboard 
system of criminal law in this country. If the attorney general for 
the province of Alberta decides no to alternative measures, there 
are no alternative measures in the province of Alberta. Everyone 
will be prosecuted under the Criminal Code. If the province of 
Quebec decides yes, we love alternative measures, we are going 
to divert everyone to the alternative measures scenario, then all 
of a sudden someone who commits a serious crime in Alberta 
will serve time in a penitentiary but if someone commits a 
serious crime in the province of Quebec he will be cutting grass 
somewhere and sleeping at the local Howard Johnson.
<P>
	Members might laugh, but let me tell them that under section 
745 of the Criminal Code there there is some discretion to the 
various provinces. In the province of Quebec, almost all those 
applicants, all those convicted killers who were convicted of 
first degree murder and applied for their parole ineligibility to 
be reduced, almost all of them have been successful. The going 
rate for murder in the province of Quebec is closer to 15 years. 
In the province of Alberta, where the attorney general takes a 
different view of these matters, the going rate for first degree 
murder is 25 years.
<P>
	Criminal law should be applicable and evenly applied across 
the country. Section 745 is a clear example of what happens 
when one allows provincial attorneys general discretion in 
prosecuting in a particular fashion. There is no doubt in my mind 
that if this section is passed without amendment there will be a 
checkerboard system of criminal law.
<P>
	If the government is serious about alternative measures they 
will restrict it to non-indictable offences. The hon. 
parliamentary secretary laughs and shrugs it off. I can 
understand-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> That is utter nonsense.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunziata:</B> I can understand that there are a lot of prisons 
in the member's riding and he might be somewhat sympathetic 
to that element in society.
<P>
	There is a danger in this section passing an inconsistent 
system of criminal law. At the very least, the government should 
agree that any violent offence cannot be diverted out of the 
criminal justice system. That is discretion that this Parliament 
should not give to anybody. If one is alleged to have committed a 
violent offence, whether it is murder, rape, aggravated assault, 
that person should be prosecuted in a criminal court.
<P>
	I do not want someone who assaults my children or rapes my 
neighbour's wife to be given the opportunity not to be 
prosecuted. That is unconstitutional. Every Canadian under the 
Constitution is entitled to the equal benefit and equal protection 
of the law.
<P>
	I would submit that this section is unconstitutional. It is not in 
keeping with what I have been hearing for 11 years as a member 
of Parliament. We need effective laws in this country. What this 
does is further tip the balance in favour of those who choose a 
criminal lifestyle. That is wrong.
<P>
<B>(2015 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I should like to put one observation on the record about 
Group No. 1 that has to do with sentencing circles for aboriginal 
Canadians.
<P>
	I do not really have a problem with the whole notion of 
sentencing circles, but there seems to be a grave anomaly 
between how we handle and treat young offenders in the system 
in an aboriginal sentencing circle and young Canadians who are 
not aboriginal in a similar circumstance.
<P>
	As the House well knows, in a sentencing circle one of the 
primary motivators to change behaviour is identification of the 
perpetrator by his or her peers, aunts, uncles and other people 
who live in the community. In a sentencing circle the perpetrator 
is expected to make good to the community at large because he 
or she may have broken trust with the community. It is his or her 
obligation to make good to the community.
<P>
	Why is it an important part of rehabilitation in the aboriginal 
community to identify young offenders to the community when 
in the non-aboriginal community anonymity is the very 
foundation of the Young Offenders Act? It just does not make 
sense to me that in the aboriginal community identification is a 
large part of the rehabilitation process and on the other side of 
the same coin in non-aboriginal communities which do not have 
the benefit of sentencing circles anonymity is a large part of it. 
In my estimation it makes no sense whatsoever to have 
anonymity as a part of the Young Offenders Act.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Ontario, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is a 
privilege this evening to speak to Motions Nos. 7 and 8. We are 
dealing with a very controversial bill. It is controversial because 
many Canadians have expressed concern about the intent of the 
bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Venne:</B> Pardon me, Madam Speaker, but let me explain 
before the hon. member goes any further with his remarks. I do 
not know if I should discuss this with you right now, but I have a 
problem. As I understand it, based on the Speaker's decision, my 
Motion No. 4 will be voted on at the same time as Motion No. 3, 
which deals with a completely different subject. Mine is about 
the French language, and the hon. member's about alternative 
measures. There really is no connection.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The Speaker has 
decided in this case that, if Motion No. 3 is adopted, it will not 
be necessary to vote on Motion No. 4. In fact, both votes have 
been deferred. As a result of the vote on Motion No. 3 being 
deferred, the vote on Motion No. 4 was automatically deferred.
<P>
	Does this answer your question? The vote on Motion No. 4 has 
been deferred along with that on Motion No. 3.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Venne:</B> Very well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Langlois:</B> Madam Speaker, on a further point of 
clarification, just to be perfectly clear, before the hon. member 
for Ontario resumes his speech, which I will listen to with great 
interest.
<P>
	My understanding was that the vote on the motion put forward 
by the hon. member for Saint-Hubert was deferred till the end. I 
can understand that. But if the motion put forward by our 
colleague, the hon. member for Crowfoot, is defeated, we will 
have to vote on Motion No. 4 in the name of the hon. member for 
Saint-Hubert in any case, will we not?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> You could approach the 
table. The Speaker's decision is clear. If Motion No. 3 is 
defeated, Motion No. 4 will be voted on. It was included in 
Group No. 1 only for the purpose of debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McTeague:</B> Madam Speaker, I know that I have only 10 
minutes to address two issues. I hope that I will be able to do so 
in so little time, and if I am, that will be quite an 
accomplishment.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I believe generally in the principle of equality. I believe that 
Bill C-41 is a good bill in general. It deals with substantive 
matters of sentencing and matters that we treated openly in the 
campaign.
<P>
	However, the most troubling part of the bill deals with section 
718.2(a)(i). I find it troubling because this section of the bill, 
which is a very small paragraph in an omnibus bill, attempts to 
treat the whole matter of hatred in a very superficial way.
<P>
	This section has been presented as a means toward combating 
hate crimes by toughening sentences where it was not the case in 
the past. It gives members the impression that hate crimes are 
somehow going unaddressed in terms of our legal ability to 
respond effectively to the rise in crime and the incidence of hate 
crime.
<P>
	The Canadian Bar Association before the justice committee 
made it extremely clear that without exception there were no 
examples where one could prove that people who committed 
hate crimes, whether against an individual or a person belonging 
to a group of individuals, did not have the book not thrown at 
them. It is with regret that I suggest the piece of legislation in 
section 718.2 is nothing less than redundant.
<P>
	The level of support for the concern about the bill falls into 
two areas. My fellow colleagues from the government side will 
be able to speak about their concerns with reference to sexual 
orientation. My concern is of a much grander nature. It deals 
with the fact that we are saying in the country and in the bill that 
hatred is only significant when the characteristic of the 
individual is taken into account. I would submit that misses the 
very point on which hate crimes ought to be based.
<P>
<B>(2025 ) </B>
<P>
	Hatred is hatred. It is no more or less significant given who it 
is directed against. It should be a principle not only of 
Parliament but a fundamental principle of Canadians in general 
that hatred is something we should repudiate at every turn.
<P>
	I thought I would at some point be able to bring forward 
Motions Nos. 6 and 7 to the justice committee. One of the 
motions would delete the clause after the words hate, biased and 
prejudiced. Those words make it so that hatred is more 
significant if it is only based on race, national or ethnic origin, 
language, colour, religion, sex, age, mental or physical 
disability, sexual orientation or any other similar factor. I do not 
know what any other similar factor is. Perhaps I could have an 
appropriate explanation of exactly what that means, but I say 
with some certainty that a judge reading any other similar factor 
would have difficulty trying to understand just what is meant.
<P>
	I have looked to various applications of the legislation and 
where it will have its greatest impact. If we are serious about 
changing hate crimes, particularly as our red book suggested in 
terms of hate propaganda, ought we not to be correcting sections 
318 to 320 of the Criminal Code rather than treating hatred in a 
rather cavalier fashion, in a rather superfluous or superficial 
fashion under an omnibus bill on sentencing?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13771"> 13771 </A></B>
<P>
	If I had been given the opportunity to speak or provide some 
amendments based on good advice to the government during the 
committee period, I would have put forward the concern some 
hon. colleagues have expressed that other forms of hatred 
manifested against certain individuals would not be covered 
under the legislation.
<P>
	I presented to the hon. member for Portneuf the prospect of 
hate based on language. I am pleased to see that it is here. 
Unfortunately I had to do that indirectly.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	One of the things I noticed is that my position and 
reservations on this bill were expressed and reinforced by the 
Barreau du Québec. According to the Barreau, Canadians do not 
want a restrictive two-tier justice system that protects only 
some segments of our society.
<P>
	On the other hand, some people have argued that there is no 
indication that the courts have been lenient with offenders 
motivated by hatred for these segments, groups or individuals in 
our society. In their opinion, as judges already have 
considerable latitude in the sentencing process, they often use 
this latitude to impose tough sentences for crimes they deem 
detrimental to society.
<P>
	According to the amendment proposed by the Barreau, if the 
evidence submitted to the court shows that the offence was 
motivated by prejudice, the judge may feel that the aggravating 
circumstances surrounding the crime call for a tougher 
sentence.
<P>
	Although I respect the Barreau's position, I am quoting these 
comments for the hon. members opposite, especially those from 
the Bloc Quebecois, because the Barreau du Québec, which 
represents all lawyers in the province, said that what was needed 
was a general rather than specific principle.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am extremely concerned that the legislation, in its attempt to 
address hate crimes, will leave people out. I am not sure what 
motivates one to write legislation such as this, particularly 
section 718. However, if it has anything to do with political 
correctness, might I suggest that in exchange for political 
correctness we respond to actual legal need? Hatred is a very 
serious problem that ought to be treated more seriously in more 
appropriate legislation.
<P>
	How serious can we be about nibbling around the edges? I am 
concerned about ensuring that we have a fair system of justice 
for all. The legislation almost ensures that in Canada we no 
longer can claim to have a justice system for all.
<P>
<B>(2030) </B>
<P>
	We are saying that it is more important for some hatreds to be 
treated more significantly if the person who happens to be the 
unfortunate victim of hatred is part of the listed group. I have 
cited language. I could also cite the physical appearance of 
people. The hon. member for Wild Rose referred to fat people.
<P>
	This is a very political environment. Perhaps we could talk 
about hatred based on political considerations, people who hold 
political views that are different from others and who have been 
the subject of hate. How in this bill, how in this amendment, are 
those people going to find equal protection before and under the 
law?
<P>
	The charter says that we are supposed to provide equality for 
all individuals. My reading of this section suggests that only 
some people, those who happen to constitute a part of this list, 
will be protected.
<P>
	Many other concerns have been raised in the past about 
whether the legislation will be able to in some way thwart or 
deter someone from committing a hate crime. Those who are 
filled with hatred do not read omnibus bills on sentencing to find 
out what their punishment will be.
<P>
	What they will know is that in every single instance without 
exception the justices and the good people of this nation who 
prosecute these issues have been able to find without exception 
that when someone commits a crime based on hate it is always 
treated as an aggravating circumstance. If this list forms the 
basis under which the law would find an aggravating 
circumstance, those left out could be considered crimes 
committed for which the judge would find at the point of 
sentencing to be of a mitigating factor.
<P>
	We need equality of treatment when it comes to hatred. We 
need to make sure that we use the proper instruments to protect it 
and to protect those who have been its victims in the past and its 
victims in the future.
<P>
	Not much more can be made more true than the fact that 
individuals from coast to coast expect from Parliament fairness 
and equality before the law. Bill C-41 is a long bill. It is an 
exhaustive bill. We must treat hatred in its proper perspective.
<P>
	I urge all members to support my motions, justice for all.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
the motions on clause 718.2 of Bill C-41 represent the majority 
of the motions to amend tabled at report stage. Most deal with 
the question of whether or not the expression ``sexual 
orientation'' should be included in the provisions which relate to 
the aggravating circumstances to be considered when a sentence 
is imposed.
<P>
	Motion No. 5, tabled by the hon. member for Crowfoot, is the 
most drastic one, since it proposes to completely eliminate 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13772"> 13772 </A></B>
<P>
clause 718.2 in the bill. In so doing,  the Reform Party would 
render the legislation meaningless, since it would abolish the 
basic principles and objectives of sentencing.
<P>
	The principles stated in clause 718, which underlie the bill, 
are a step in the right direction. Indeed, we can only support a 
measure which seeks to contribute, along with crime prevention 
initiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, 
peaceful and safe society by imposing appropriate sanctions.
<P>
	Moreover, the alternative measures provided in clause 717 
regarding some offenders, that is the penalties other than 
incarceration and probation, are innovative measures which will 
result in fewer offenders being sent to jail, while also putting the 
emphasis on rehabilitation rather than incarceration.
<P>
<B>(2035) </B>
<P>
	Some motions, including those of the hon. member for 
Scarborough West, seek to introduce a comprehensive 
definition of the expression ``sexual orientation'' in clause 
718.2 of the bill. The member actually managed to table several 
motions to amend which are essentially variations on the same 
theme, in the hope that one of them will somehow get through.
<P>
	The debate on the real issues of Bill C-41 was sidetracked 
from the very beginning. Indeed, since the legislation was 
tabled, the debate has focused on the sensitive issue of 
homosexual rights. Under aggravating circumstances, the bill 
provides a list of prejudices motivating hate crimes, including 
the sexual orientation of the victim.
<P>
	The judge must consider a hate motivated crime as an 
aggravating circumstance at the time of sentencing. The debate 
has been sidetracked both by the defenders of homosexuals' 
right to protection and by the extreme right that wants the bill's 
provision regarding aggravating circumstances to be dropped. I 
have received thousands of letters asking me to vote against Bill 
C-41 because it contains the phrase ``sexual orientation''. Our 
offices were flooded with these form letters. They merely 
reflected the opinion of a ill-informed minority.
<P>
	Those who signed these letters actually wanted us to scrap a 
75 page bill, containing a hundred clauses and representing a 
complete reform of that part of the Criminal Code that deals 
with sentencing, because it contained two words too many. Let 
us keep in mind that Bill C-41 does not create new rights. It is a 
sentencing bill, and therefore sets out parameters by which 
judges must be guided in arriving at sentences. Clause 718.2 in 
particular concerns only an accused found guilty and the criteria 
that apply to his sentence.
<P>
	It is not the purpose of this clause to create rights for the 
groups listed therein. The rights of individuals are protected 
under the Constitution and other legislation on the protection of 
human rights. Bill C-41 is not a new charter of rights and 
freedoms, as several interested groups would have us believe. 
When a bill contains the term ``sexual orientation'', the meaning 
of the term  raises many questions. What does it really mean? 
How should its meaning be interpreted?
<P>
	In the Egan case, the federal court seems to indicate that a 
sexual tendency or orientation can be heterosexual, homosexual 
or bisexual. This case made a challenge under section 15 of the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The court concluded 
that, although the Supreme Court has never issued an opinion on 
the issue, the fact that sexual tendencies can be invoked as 
motives constituting discrimination such as those prohibited 
under subsection 15(1) had become a matter of settled law.
<P>
	On June 30, 1993, a little while after the Egan decision, the 
Supreme Court stated in the Ward decision that sexual 
orientation is an innate or unchangeable characteristic. This 
case involved discrimination against refugees and the protection 
of refugees. The Supreme Court accepted as a category persons 
who fear persecution because of gender, linguistic backgrounds 
and sexual orientation.
<P>
	I would like to mention in passing that the Bloc Quebecois 
proposed an amendment regarding the linguistic traits of 
victims in committee, which was accepted. This amendment is 
in line with the position taken by the Supreme Court in the Ward 
case. But, you might ask, should we not clearly define the term 
``sexual orientation''? Since political correctness has come into 
style, the names of several minority groups have changed 
considerably.
<P>
<B>(2040) </B>
<P>
	The blind have become the visually impaired; the deaf, the 
hearing impaired; the mentally ill are now mentally 
handicapped.
<P>
	Since language changes constantly, the designation of 
homosexuals has changed as well. In the 19th century, this 
phenomenon was referred to as sexual inversion. In the 20th 
century, this term was replaced by the word homosexuality. 
Subsequently, we had the terms gay and lesbian. Not so long 
ago, people talked about sexual preference. Of course, the gay 
community soon dropped this term because it indicated a choice 
or characteristic acquired by the individual and not an innate 
characteristic.
<P>
	Scientists are now trying to determine whether homosexuality 
is not only innate but genetically determined. In a scenario that 
may not be that far down the road, we may have individuals with 
male or female genetic characteristics, plus homosexual genetic 
characteristics that would influence the individual's behaviour 
and thus determine his or her future sexual orientation.
<P>
	Some people maintain this is a nightmare scenario, especially 
those who flooded the fax machines on Parliament Hill with 
strong protests against Bill C-41. The mere term sexual 
orientation caused a wave of panic. Opponents of this legislation 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13773"> 13773 </A></B>
<P>
simply want to throw out an entire bill on sentencing because it 
supposedly gives  more rights to homosexuals, which is patently 
untrue. Crimes motivated by hate or prejudice have a profound 
impact on the victim. They differ from any other kind of crime. 
The victim, attacked because of the colour of his or her skin, 
because of his or her religion or because she is a woman, suffers 
far more than someone whose wallet is stolen. That is what 
clause 718.2 of the bill is all about.
<P>
	I will not support Motions Nos. 5 to 17, inclusive, except, of 
course, for Motions Nos. 9 and 15.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Roseanne Skoke (Central Nova, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I rise in the House to speak at report stage on Motions Nos. 6 and 
13 proposing amendments to Bill C-41.
<P>
	Bill C-41, and in particular section 718.2, has been 
vigorously promoted by the government and the media as the 
hate crime legislation.
<P>
	Let me remind this honourable House that section 718.2 is not 
the operative hate crime provisions of the Criminal Code. 
Rather it is the purposes and principles of sentencing which 
must at all times reflect the fundamental values, principles and 
morals on which this great nation, Canada, has been founded.
<P>
	Section 718.2, as drafted, is unacceptable. It does not reflect 
the principles and values of the majority of Canadians. The 
specific inclusion of the words sexual orientation gives legal 
recognition and legal status to a faction in society which is 
undermining and destroying Canadian values and 
Judeo-Christian morality.
<P>
	Such a special recognition of sexual orientation in the 
Criminal Code is an overt condonation of the practices of 
homosexuality which is being imposed on all Canadians. Bill 
C-41 has the effect of legislating a morality that is not supported 
by Canadian and Judeo-Christian morals, values and principles.
<P>
	To endorse or to include the words sexual orientation in any 
federal legislation would confer on homosexuals the ability to 
obtain special legal status, allow them to redefine the family, to 
enter into the realm of the sanctity of marriage, to adopt 
children, to infiltrate the curriculum of schools and to impose an 
alternative lifestyle on youth. All these demands are 
encroaching on and undermining the inherent and inviolable 
rights of family and the rights of the church.
<P>
	The family unit is the basic institution of life and the solid 
foundation on which our forefathers have built this great nation. 
The protection of families, family life and family values must be 
a priority with this government. Families have inherent and 
inviolable rights. Families have existed before the church and 
families have existed before the state. The rights of the family 
must be preserved, safeguarded and protected by Parliament.
<P>
<B>(2045) </B>
<P>
	Why do I as a legislator continue to make reference to 
principles, values and morals when debating Bill C-41? It is 
because section 718.2 refers specifically to principles. In the 
words of the hon. justice minister before the justice committee 
on Bill C-41 on November 17, 1994-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to raise a point 
of order pursuant to Standing Order 18, which reads in part as 
follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>No Member shall speak disrespectfully of the Sovereign, nor of any of the 
Royal Family, nor of the Governor General or the person administering the 
Government of Canada; nor use offensive words against either House, or 
against any member thereof.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	As a gay man, the words spoken by the hon. member for 
Central Nova are deeply offensive, not just to me as an 
individual but to all gay men and lesbians in this country. To be 
accused of immorality-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I did not hear the hon. 
member refer to you as an individual. I stand corrected if she 
did.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Skoke:</B> In the justice committee on November 17, 1994 
the justice minister stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>But the second and I believe the more important reason for legislating is that 
one of the legitimate purposes of Parliament and of legislation is to allow the 
legislators to identify themselves with a principle, to take the lead and to show 
what the values are that guide us as a nation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We may have different views on what those values are, but this bill reflects 
the values and views of this government in relation to this matter.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I beg to differ with our justice minister on this issue. With 
confidence I say that section 718.2 does not reflect the 
principles and values of the Canadian majority. As of June 6, 
1995 this honourable House had received over 83,000 signatures 
on petitions directly related to the wording of sexual orientation. 
Since September 20, 1994 I have received in my office alone 
over 10,000 letters, faxes and telephone calls confirming the 
views, values, principles and morality of Canadian people.
<P>
	The media can attest to the interest shown in Bill C-41 on the 
issues of principles, values and morals. Talk show hosts, radio, 
television, newspapers, magazines and all Canadians are talking 
about Bill C-41 and its serious implications. No more. 
Canadians are not prepared to silently acquiesce in legislative 
change which will affect their right to speech, right to 
expression, opinion and belief, the right to freedom of religion 
and most important, the right to practise all those freedoms 
openly without fear of intimidation, coercion or criminal 
sanction.
<P>
	Section 718.2 is incorporated in the Criminal Code of Canada. 
Whether the question of the purpose of the criminal law is 
approached from a retributive or a utilitarian direction, it is 
important to understand that the fundamental nature of criminal 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13774"> 13774 </A></B>
<P>
law sanctions is punitive. The criminal law and the criminal 
justice system constitute the end point on a continuum of 
informal and formal customs, beliefs and institutions of social 
control, the end point in terms of the ultimately coercive 
intervention of the state in the lives of its citizens.
<P>
	Simply put, the criminal sanction of section 718.2 will 
ultimately operate to elevate the existing Canadian legal test of 
tolerance to a higher legal standard whereby Canadians are 
required not only to be tolerant of homosexuals and their chosen 
lifestyles, but they must condone, accept and endorse 
homosexuality as being natural and moral.
<P>
	Canadians do not have to accept homosexuality as being 
natural and moral. Homosexuality is not natural; it is immoral. 
Homosexuality must not and should not be condoned.

Constitution Act recognizes the supremacy of God and the rule 
of law. The recognition of the supremacy of God entrenches into 
the Constitution natural law. Therefore the laws of our country 
must not contravene natural law for to do so the laws would be 
ultra vires or unconstitutional.
<P>
	A strict legal approach to section 718.2 will disclose that this 
section is seriously flawed and unconstitutional. There are many 
unanswered legal questions regarding section 718.2. The words 
hate, prejudice and bias are undefined. Hate is an emotion; bias 
and prejudice are beliefs. The charter guarantees freedom of 
conscience, expression, opinion, belief and religion.
<P>
	In practicality, when the court employs section 718.2 in 
determining whether motivation is on the basis of hate, 
prejudice or bias as an aggravating factor, I ask this honourable 
House what legal test shall be applied? Is it an objective test or a 
subjective test? If it is subjective, whose subjectivity is applied, 
the subjectivity of the victim or the subjectivity of the accused?
<P>
	If sexual orientation is included in the list of section 718.2, 
what is the operative legal definition of sexual orientation and 
how can one identify the sexual orientation of another? What 
legal test will be applied by the judge and will such a test be 
based on the actual or perceived sexual orientation of the 
victim? Where in Canadian law can an accused person be 
sentenced for a crime without having first been charged, tried 
and convicted of the said crime?
<P>
	Section 718.2 is a double jeopardy provision of Bill C-41 
which is unconstitutional. Its effect clearly sentences an 
individual for hate motivation without the individual having 
been charged under the hate crime provisions of the Criminal 
Code. This is unacceptable in Canada. It contravenes the charter 
guarantees of the right to be charged with an offence known in 
Canadian law and the right to be tried in accordance with the 
fundamental principles of justice.
<P>
	Section 718.2 violates the equity sections of the charter, in 
particular section 15, which states that every Canadian is equal 
before and under the law. The list of factors provided for in 
section 718.2 creates an inequity in law which must not be 
tolerated. Since every Canadian is equal before and under the 
law, then a list of categories is unnecessary and restrictive.
<P>
	The hon. member for Ontario has proposed an amendment to 
delete the list. I support Motions Nos. 7 and 8. I do not support 
the inclusion of the words sexual orientation in Bill C-41 or in 
any federal legislation. I ask this honourable House to support 
my position by voting in support of my specific amendment, 
Motion No. 13, which will specifically exclude the words sexual 
orientation from section 718.2.
<P>
	I further challenge this honourable House to carefully 
consider section 718.2 and to examine its constitutional validity 
and its effect upon the charter guarantees afforded to all 
Canadians. Before this House is Motion No. 6, a general 
amendment to Bill C-41 which will delete section 718.2 in part 
and I ask for support from this honourable House.
<P>
	In conclusion I cannot support any federal legislation that 
includes the words sexual orientation particularly in the 
Criminal Code of Canada. To do so would be to utilize a criminal 
sanction to afford special legal status to homosexuals and to 
give legal recognition to a faction in our society which is 
undermining and destroying our Canadian values, principles 
and morals.

	Over the past 25 years Parliament has been encroaching upon

<P>
	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it is difficult to know where to begin in 
response to the comments of the last speaker. As one who is 
among those she has accused of seeking to undermine and 
destroy the Canadian society, as one she has described as 
immoral and unnatural, and as a member of a community of gay 
men and lesbians whom she has similarly slandered with her 
hatred-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wappel:</B> Madam Speaker, on a point of order I refer you 
to Standing Order 18 where it states that no member may use 
offensive words against any member. The hon. member has 
accused the hon. member for Central Nova of slander. That is a 
direct accusation against a member of this House. I ask you to 
call the member to order.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I will ask the hon. 
member for Burnaby-Kingsway to withdraw his comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Madam Speaker, the previous speaker was 
clearly making reference to a community. In responding-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I believe the standing 
order as read is quite specific. Would you please withdraw your 
words. They were directed at a member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Madam Speaker, I will withdraw any personal 
references to the hon. member but certainly with respect to the 
point-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Fine. Thank you.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Madam Speaker, on a point of order. When you 
take part in a debate you are responsible for the words you utter. 
I know that, like all the members of this House, you are 
particularly sensitive to the words reported.
<P>
	I would just like to understand your decision and draw to your 
attention that the remarks our colleague made in her opening 
words to her debate are what she actually said. If I may, I-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Order. I have already 
made a decision on the point of order. The member referred 
directly to a member of this House, which is not done, while the 
other member referred to a group in society.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Madam Speaker, obviously what we are 
seeing here is that if one hon. member in the course of debate 
were to refer to black people hypothetically as a group as being 
immoral, unnatural and attacking the family and an assault on 
Canadian values, that black people were in that category, of 
course in those circumstances a member of this House who 
happened to be a black person could not respond. That is what 
the Speaker is saying. The Speaker is saying that if a member of 
this House got up-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunziata:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The 
hon. member for Burnaby-Kingsway purports to be opposed to 
hate yet he seems to want to propagate it. I would simply 
indicate that he is challenging the authority of the Chair. You 
have made your ruling and he persists in challenging your 
authority. I would ask that if he is not prepared to play by the 
rules-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Madam Speaker, I want to be very clear on the 
motion I am proposing to the House. Before doing so, I want to 
say that I strongly support the principles underlying section 
718.2 of this legislation. I find it particularly disturbing that a 
member of this House in arguing against this provision could so 
distort the reality that underlies the section.
<P>
	For example, it was suggested that this section would take 
effect even if there were no convictions. That is what the hon. 
member for Central Nova said. Section 718.2 takes effect only at 
sentencing. The hon. member is a lawyer. I assume she is aware 
that sentencing takes place only after conviction. Let us be very 
clear.
<P>
<B>(2100) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Skoke:</B> Madam Speaker, on a point of order, I think it is 
important that if the hon. member is to quote what I say he 
quotes directly and does not paraphrase. He has obviously 
misunderstood the context of my speech and I think that is 
important.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member's words 
speak for themselves and the distortions in those words speak 
for themselves as well.
<P>
	No one in supporting this legislation is seeking any kind of 
special rights or privileges any more than those who support 
legislation to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act to prohibit 
discrimination based on sexual orientation are seeking any kind 
of special rights or privileges.
<P>
	There are certain communities in which people are attacked 
on the basis of certain identifiable characteristics. The gay 
community is one of those communities.
<P>
	The justice committee on Bill C-41 heard very moving 
testimony from two gay men who were walking peacefully down 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13776"> 13776 </A></B>
<P>
the street in Toronto near the corner of Church and Welsley when 
they were attacked by thugs with broken beer bottles and beaten 
up. They were not  attacked because they were fat. They were 
attacked because they were gay. That is what this legislation is 
attempting to respond to.
<P>
	The hon. member for Scarborough West asks how they knew 
that. That is a very good question. That is precisely the purpose 
of the amendment in Motion No. 10. They assumed these were 
two gay men. They perceived them as being gay men because 
they were walking in an area which has a significant number of 
gays and lesbians.
<P>
	That is why it is essential this legislation respond to the 
question of sexual orientation. If an individual attacks another 
individual because they believe that person to be Jewish or gay 
or lesbian the impact of that is just as serious. As a number of 
witnesses who appeared before the committee made very clear, 
it is essential that the perception of the victim be included in this 
legislation. That is the purpose of my amendment.
<P>
	As one of the briefs from the Ottawa-Carleton regional police 
bias crime unit pointed out, Alain Brosseau, a waiter working 
one night at the Chateau Laurier, walked toward his home 
through Majors Hill park and was attacked by a group of people 
who thought he was a gay man. They threw him off the bridge 
and killed him. That was just as serious and this legislation 
should reflect that seriousness as well. That was the point made 
by B'nai Brith, the point made by the Centre de recerche-action 
sur les relations raciales and by many others.
<P>
	It is important we understand this legislation is not conferring 
privileges. I wish it were not the case that Jews are singled out 
for anti-semitic attacks. I wish it were not the case that gay men 
and lesbians were victims of gay bashing, as the Minister of 
Justice said.
<P>
	On Saturday night in Vancouver at the Edge restaurant some 
friends of mine were sitting peacefully having coffee when 
suddenly through the door came a number of thugs who started 
to attack them, calling them faggots, beating them up and 
breaking their arms. This crime does not just affect the 
individuals involved but by its very nature it has a chilling effect 
on a community. That is why it is so important that we amend the 
criminal law as has been proposed here.
<P>
<B>(2105) </B>
<P>
	This legislation is very important. It is also important that we 
understand the kind of attitudes we have heard from the member 
for Central Nova. The member for New Westminster-Burnaby 
said that gay bashing was not much of a problem because it was 
only one marginalized group, skinheads as he said, attacking 
another marginalized group, or it was gay people beating up 
other gay people. Those are the attitudes we have to confront.
<P>
	We need this legislation. I commend those moving it forward. 
I commend the Ottawa police department for its leadership in 
this area. I hope the House will reject the voices of those not 
prepared to accept equality and move toward legislation that 
ensures hate crimes are punished to the fullest in society.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I am pleased to join in debate on Bill C-41.
<P>
	I want to comment as objectively as I can on section 718.2. 
This section has attracted more attention than any other aspect 
of the bill. There is a backlash of sorts that has conjured up a 
great deal of concern among a number of Canadians. The bill is 
referred to often as a hate crimes bill. It is a sentencing bill with 
some 60 or 70 pages and has a wide range of important 
amendments to guide our sentencing.
<P>
	Section 718.2 as has been indicated by a number of prior 
speakers has attracted attention. Section 718.2 states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A court that imposes a sentence shall also take into consideration the 
following principles:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) a sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant 
aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the 
offender, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,</BLOCKQUOTE>
(i) evidence that the offence was motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based on 
race, national or ethnic origin, language, colour religion, sex, age, mental or 
physical disability, sexual orientation or any other similar factor, or
<P>
(ii) evidence that the offender, in the committing offence, abused a position of 
trust or authority in relation to the victim shall be deemed to be a aggravating 
circumstances;
<P>
	To put that in English, section 718.2 basically says that when 
someone has been charged and convicted of a crime, prior to 
sentencing that person the courts must make an assessment and 
that assessment must be whether there is an aggravating 
circumstance.
<P>
	Presently in the bill there are two different categories of 
aggravating circumstances. The first refers to bias, prejudice 
and hate. That goes on to be elaborated on by adding to it the 
so-called list for greater certainty. In other words that a bias, 
prejudice or hate was based on race, national or ethnic origin, 
language, colour, religion, sex, age, mental or physical 
disability or sexual orientation would require a stiffer sentence.
<P>
	The second aggravating circumstance has to do with abuse of 
positions of trust or authority. A position of trust would be in the 
character of a doctor over a patient, a teacher over a student, a 
babysitter over a child. Positions of authority might include 
such things as an elderly person in the care of a child or a child in 
the care of the parents.
<P>
	One of the reasons the bill and this section have attracted so 
much attention is this list on which bias, prejudice and hate 
might be motivated is identical to the list in our charter of rights 
and freedoms. The only addition to the list are the words sexual 
orientation which have brought tremendous focus to this 
section. It has been the one reason the bill has been used as a 
proxy for the discussion of all sides of the story and the 
arguments with regard to sexual orientation.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13777"> 13777 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(2110) </B>
<P>
	I do not want to use much of my time to deal with this. The 
extent of concern within my community, and I have received 
many letters, indicates that basically we are all equal under our 
laws and that if there is any list it tends to indicate that someone 
has been left off the list. If our charter is to hold true the words 
bias, prejudice and hate should be sufficient. On that basis I will 
be supporting the report stage motion to eliminate the list.
<P>
	I will now move on very briefly to my motion which is to add 
an aggravating circumstance to bias, prejudice and hate and the 
abuse of trust in authority positions.
<P>
	According to the 1993 violence against women survey and 
Statistics Canada 29 per cent of women or 2.7 million who have 
ever been married or lived in a common law relationship have 
been physically or sexually assaulted by their partner at some 
point during the relationship. We are all painfully aware of the 
serious problems and the negative consequences not only to 
those involved but to society as a whole. We have been so 
overwhelmed by the tragic statistics and the pleas for help over 
so many years, I fear we have become desensitized to the 
severity of the problem.
<P>
	As a result of those facts I have presented a report stage 
Motion No. 16 which asks the House to consider making spousal 
abuse a situation which would require stiffer sentences. It did 
take some time. The motion was submitted in April. It took a 
great deal of time to work through justice, to work with 
colleagues from all sides of the House.
<P>
	I am pleased to inform the House that as a result of the motion 
and as a result of the support I received from all sides of the 
House the Minister of Justice has agreed to accept the situation 
of spousal abuse as an aggravating circumstance requiring a 
stiffer penalty. This is a very momentous situation for the House 
to stop giving merely moral support to the plight of abused 
women and children and to start giving tangible, legislative 
backbone to deal with the issue of spousal abuse.
<P>
	Motion No. 17 presented by the minister will be addressed in 
the House in advance of my Motion No. 16. I will be supporting 
Motion No. 17. I believe it incorporates the intent of the motion 
I put forward.
<P>
	I thank the minister and the justice officials and members of 
the House. I am sure all women in Canada thank all members for 
their support for abused women.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough West, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I have only 10 minutes to offer my comments on 13 
very interesting amendments which obviously, as we have seen 
from the debate so far, evoke very strong feelings. 
Unfortunately with only 10 minutes I am forced to concentrate 
on my amendments.
<P>
	I do support Motion No. 6 standing in the name of the hon. 
member for Central Nova for the legal, moral and ethical 
reasons she stated in her speech. If the House is not supportive 
of Motion No. 6 then I am certainly in support of Motions Nos. 7 
and 8 standing in the name of the hon. member for Ontario for 
the reasons he gave in his excellent address.
<P>
<B>(2115 ) </B>
<P>
	If it should transpire that none of those motions have passed 
with the approval of this House, then we have section 718.2 with 
the phrase sexual orientation as part of that section. In those 
circumstances, only one of two things will happen. Either the 
phrase sexual orientation will remain undefined, or it can be 
defined by this House pursuant to one of the amendments that I 
have put forward.
<P>
	So one might wonder why we need a definition, which is what 
I want to talk about in the remaining time. Let us examine some 
actual facts, not rhetoric and various other things, but let us talk 
about some facts.
<P>
	Fact one: This is the first time the phrase sexual orientation is 
going to be used in any federal Canadian statute.
<P>
	Fact two: This phrase is undefined in any legal or standard 
dictionary.
<P>
	Fact three: This phrase is undefined by any court in Canada. 
There have been passing references to the phrase, a footnote 
here or there by one or two or three judges, but it has not been 
judiciously interpreted in this country.
<P>
	We asked the minister what sexual orientation means. When 
he appeared before the justice committee on November 17, 
1994, he said: ``Sexual orientation encompasses homosexuality, 
heterosexuality, and bisexuality''. If that is in fact the case, then 
that is exactly what my Motion No. 11 proposes. It proposes to 
state that sexual orientation means exactly what the Minister of 
Justice said it meant in the committee; namely, homosexuality, 
heterosexuality, and bisexuality. The important point is that it 
would mean nothing else but those three things the minister 
said.
<P>
	It is interesting to note that virtually every jurisdiction in the 
world that I have found that uses the phrase sexual orientation or 
similar words actually defines the phrase. We are meeting so 
much resistance here in Canada to defining a legal phrase that 
has never been used in this country in a statute. Yet in other 
countries there does not seem to be this problem.
<P>
	Let us take a look, for example, at California, which has a 
population greater than our entire country. They say sexual 
orientation means heterosexuality, homosexuality, or 
bisexuality, period. This is exactly what the Minister of Justice 
said and exactly what my Motion No. 11 states.
<P>
	What about our own regulations, not statutes, under the 
Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications  
Commission? Even they go some way to defining sexual 
orientation by saying: ``Sexual orientation does not include the 
orientation 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13778"> 13778 </A></B>
<P>
toward any sexual act or activity that would constitute an 
offence under the Criminal Code''. Who could disagree with 
that? That is in fact a definition because it is a definition of 
exclusion. Motion No. 11 is a definition of inclusion.
<P>
	Let us take, for example, the District of Columbia. Sexual 
orientation means male or female homosexuality, 
heterosexuality, and bisexuality-and I note for the hon. 
member for Burnaby-Kingsway-by preference or practice. 
But it is defined. That is the point: it is defined in statute.
<P>
	Finally, let us talk about Australia. We talked about the United 
States, so we will now talk about South Australia and its equal 
opportunity act. The act states: ``It is unlawful to discriminate 
on the grounds of sexuality. Sexuality is defined as meaning 
heterosexuality, homosexuality, bisexuality or 
trans-sexuality''. Well my other motion deals with that, with the 
exception of trans-sexuality.
<P>
	All of these jurisdictions define the phrase. So what I am 
saying is we should define the phrase. What if we do not? Does 
the undefined phrase sexual orientation mean something other 
than what the minister has said it means?
<P>
<B>(2120 ) </B>
<P>
	Let us look at the evidence that was called at the committee. 
Dr. Greenberg, who is a member of the policy review committee 
from the Canadian Criminal Justice Association and who is also 
a psychiatrist at one of the Ottawa hospitals, in response to a 
question by me, said: ``Sexual orientation is a descriptive term. 
It basically defines what attracts a person to a stimulus. In other 
words, just like a compass, what is it that orients a person toward 
a particular stimulus? It is what stimulus arouses a person 
sexually.'' I asked, ``Yes, so necrophilia would be a sexual 
orientation to you?'' Dr. Greenberg answers, ``A deviant sexual 
orientation, yes.''
<P>
	It goes on. The Canadian Psychological Association said: ``It 
is not for us to say whether in the courts it would be,''-that is to 
say, interpreted-``but certainly sexual orientation is a key and 
fundamental component of pedophilia''. That is not the member 
for Scarborough West talking, that is Dr. Stephen J. Wormith, 
chairperson of the criminal justice psychology section of the 
Canadian Psychological Association. That is what he says. This 
is if it is undefined.
<P>
	We have many other quotations, which I have sent around to 
all hon. members in this House.
<P>
	If those witnesses do not agree that sexual orientation does 
not mean what the minister said, what are the courts going to do? 
The courts are not responsible to the people of Canada. I do not 
want to take that chance. It is for this House to define phrases, 
not for the courts.
<P>
	Interestingly enough, every other characteristic listed in 
718.2 is defined. Race has been defined. National or ethnic 
origin has been defined. Language has been defined. Colour has 
been defined. Religion has been defined. Sex has been defined. 
Age has been defined. Mental or physical disability has been 
defined. Here are the definitions, judicial and otherwise.
<P>
	The only identifiable characteristic that has not been given a 
definition in this country is sexual orientation. Why is that? 
According to the minister, he says that it would be offensive to 
provide a definition. I quote: ``It would be offensive for us to 
define that term''. That is the reason he gives for not defining a 
term that the witnesses said includes necrophilia, pedophilia, 
scopophilia, or whatever other kind of philias you want to talk 
about. That is not just some hon. member talking; those are 
actual expert witnesses before the justice committee who made 
these points.
<P>
	Who would it offend? It is not offensive to the people of 
Scarborough West. I conducted a poll. Seventy-two per cent of 
my constituents want sexual orientation defined before it is put 
in any federal statute. It is not offensive to anybody I know.
<P>
	If we draft statutes on the basis of offence, we have given a lot 
of offence to a lot of gun owners and we just passed Bill C-68. 
That gives offence. We cannot draft statutes on the basis of who 
they might or might not offend. We draft statutes on the basis of 
what is right and what is wrong. Wedraft according to the proper 
rules of drafting and give definitions.
<P>
	I ask the House, if sexual orientation is going to remain, 
please define it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, this is a very interesting debate. I have been 
listening to it very carefully.
<P>
	I am really very mystified about how this whole question of 
sexual orientation has managed to take off as such a 
pre-eminent feature of Bill C-41. As was said earlier, we are 
talking about a bill that has 70 pages dealing largely and most 
importantly with the question of sentencing, which we have 
wanted for some time. There are some very good provisions in 
this bill that are much needed in our society, particularly with 
respect to our criminal justice system.
<P>
<B>(2125 ) </B>
<P>
	What we seem to gravitate to is one little section. It is not even 
a whole section; it is just a little itsy-bitsy part of a section. It is 
in section 718.2 that we refer to the words ``sexual orientation''.
<P>
	The hon. member for Scarborough West has done a lot of 
research on this, and I commend him. He says that sexual 
orientation should be defined. He mentions that the other 
aspects-race, colour, sex, and gender-are defined. However 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13779"> 13779 </A></B>
<P>
they are not defined in the bill. They  may be defined, but they 
are not defined in the bill because these are incidental terms.
<P>
	What we are dealing with is the fact of sentencing. That is why 
it is called a sentencing bill. There are no rights given under this 
bill to anyone, regardless of race, religion, language, or sexual 
orientation. We are not saying that anybody in those categories 
has any rights.
<P>
	What we are saying is that if somebody is attacked and it can 
be proven that they were attacked because of their sex, religion, 
language, or sexual orientation, such as the hon. member for 
Burnaby-Kingsway has said about some people going into a 
restaurant and saying ``Let's go and get those faggots'', then 
there is objective evidence that they are being attacked for that 
reason. Because they are being attacked for that reason, it is a 
question of bias, prejudice, or hate based on those principles. If 
the people then go to court and are found guilty, they will be 
sentenced. In the sentencing it will be determined that the reason 
they committed the crime was because of bias, prejudice, and 
hate on their part in relation to language, religion, or sexual 
orientation. If that is the case, then their sentence is greater than 
if that was not the case.
<P>
	A member says that is already being done in the courts across 
the country. Why then, one may ask, do we have it in the 
legislation? Because it is not being applied equally across the 
country. It is being applied differently in each province and we 
want to have it applied equally. Members have said, hate, bias 
and prejudice are onerous terms, principles, and sicknesses, 
which creep into adverse and unpleasant actions in our society. 
We want to apply it equally across the country.
<P>
	Why, if we want to put it in the act, do we have to use these 
terms? The reason we have to use terms like religion, language, 
sex and sexual orientation is because the Supreme Court of 
Canada stated in the Zundel and Keegstra cases that they have to 
know what we mean by hate. What is it we are talking about 
when we talk about hate? Are we talking about hate based on 
sexual orientation, religion, or language, or are we talking about 
hate based on someone beating somebody else up because they 
do not like the Vancouver Canucks or the Toronto Maple Leafs? 
Is that the sort of hate? Hate can be used in so many ways.
<P>
	We want to define what kind of hate we mean and what we are 
talking about when we go to court on this principle. So we put in 
examples, but we also say that is not the last of it. We also say 
``national or ethnic origin, language, colour, religion, sex, age, 
mental or physical disability, sexual orientation or any other 
similar factor''. We are not saying that anything can be hate; we 
refer to a similar factor that relates to the terms we have 
previously set forth in that list.
<P>
<B>(2130 ) </B>
<P>
	We are not giving any rights at all under this. The bill does not 
define sexual orientation because it is not a principle of the bill. 
The worst that can happen by not defining sexual orientation is 
that someone may make a mistake about what sexual orientation 
is in the sentencing process.
<P>
	If some people want a definition of sexual orientation it 
should be put in the Canadian Human Rights Act. That is where 
such a definition would apply, not in a sentencing bill.
<P>
	In Motion No. 10, brought forward by the member for 
Burnaby-Kingsway, he mentions changing the bill. Instead of 
saying race, national or ethnic origin, religion, language or 
sexual orientation, he wants it to say ``the actual or perceived 
race'' and so on.
<P>
	We do not need that because perceived is not a factor either. If 
someone is attacked because of language or sexual orientation 
or race it does not matter in the sentencing process if that person 
actually spoke that language, was of that sexual orientation, was 
of that race or not. The fact they were actually attacked based on 
bias, prejudice or hate and whether the victim was correctly 
identified in that hate, bias or prejudice does not matter. It is the 
reason for the assault that the sentence is given.
<P>
	If the person is convicted on the basis of that attack, based on 
that bias, prejudice or hate on questions of language, sexual 
orientation or religion, whether the victim was or was not, if the 
attacker thought the victim was, there is still the hate and there is 
still going to be the enhanced sentence. It does not matter if it 
was perceived or not perceived but what the objectively stated 
intention of the person committing the offence was.
<P>
	This is a good bill. We are getting carried away, led astray by 
various factors. Everything in the bill is important but what is 
most important is what the bill wants to do and can do.

	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I wish to state from the outset that it will be 
impossible for me to support the amendments proposed by the 
hon. members for Scarborough West and for Central Nova, 
which, of course, should not surprise us. I want to start by 
repeating what we were told by a psychology professor, who had 
a great influence on me. He started from the basic premise that 
sexuality has many facets. This sexology professor reminded us 
that those who feel comfortable with their own sexuality do not 
feel the need to denigrate others with a different sexual 
orientation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
	Tonight, I am sorry that some of my colleagues, whose views I 
as a parliamentarian must respect, may have made comments 
which, in my opinion, showed, to say the least, very little respect 
for a kind of sexual pluralism that must be acknowledged. What 
I find most regrettable, and the reason why I do not understand 
the purpose of the amendments tabled by some of my 
colleagues, can be summed up as follows: Is it too much to ask 
some parliamentarians to recognize, to understand that, in 1995, 
some members of society are still being molested, beaten or 
ill-treated for the sole reason that they are or appear to be 
homosexual?
<P>
<B>(2135) </B>
<P>
	That is what the bill before the House wants to deal with. I fail 
to understand why parliamentarians who have a voice in 
government, who have a public voice, will not admit that this is 
so, although all the hard scientific evidence is there.
<P>
	In fact, two years ago, the Government of Quebec, the first 
government in Canada to speak out against discrimination on 
the basis of sexual orientation, instructed the Quebec Human 
Rights Commission, a public body with credibility, to 
investigate violence against gays. That was the specific mandate 
of this commission. We can assume that, if a government takes 
the trouble to instruct a commission to investigate, acts of 
violence are being committed in our society.
<P>
	The commission, which made several recommendations, 
examined fifty statements by gays, young and not so young, who 
were attacked-I think it is important to emphasize this-who 
were attacked simply because they were gay. I think you would 
have to be extremely obtuse, bigoted and empty headed not to 
realize, as a parliamentarian, that this is a situation that must be 
dealt with.
<P>
	What do the opponents to this bill find so disturbing? Of 
course we could wonder about their fantasies, but we will 
refrain. We will remain strictly on topic. What disturbs them in 
the legal sense?
<P>
	With all due respect for the hon. member for Scarborough 
West and the hon. member for Central Nova-I must admit that 
when she talks about homosexuality, she does not mince her 
words, which is putting it mildly-I have not heard either 
member give examples that would hold water in the legal sense.
<P>
	I would have had more respect, although I still have some, 
through you Mr. Speaker, for the hon. member for Central Nova 
or the hon. member for Scarborough West, if they had risen in 
their seats and argued on a legal basis to make a connection 
between agreeing that gays should not be attacked and 
pedophilia.
<P>
	That is what disturbs them. That is what frightens them. I had 
a chance to discuss this with the hon. member during an 
exchange in committee. However, none of them were able to 
make a connection between what is proposed in clause 718.2 and 
what they themselves as parliamentarians anticipated would 
happen.
<P>
	Quite frankly, when people are disturbed by a difference that 
is as legitimate as it is ancient, by the expression of a difference 
in sexual experience, one wonders, and whether they are 
parliamentarians is irrelevant, whether they have a healthy and 
balanced life.
<P>
	What is disturbing, and I think the Minister of Justice is to be 
commended for his courage in this respect, is that, as 
parliamentarians, we have no obligation to support a certain set 
of moral values. You know, when the only argument is a moral 
argument, when as a member, all they can do is get up and talk 
about prayers, religion and family, it is because they do not have 
much in the way of legal arguments.
<P>
	I have great respect for people who are deeply religious. I 
have great respect for parliamentarians in this House who, in 
some way or another, want to perpetuate the family, be it in its 
traditional form.
<P>
	But please, do not tell us that because we want to protect a 
specific group of people who are confronted with violence every 
day, because the legislator wants to make attacking gays 
because of their sexual orientation a factor in determining 
sentencing, please do not tell us we are challenging family 
values.
<P>
<B>(2140) </B>
<P>
	I come from a traditional family. My father, Claude, is 55 
years old, my mother, Thérèse, is 60 years old. I have a twin 
brother who has the exact same genetic base as me, another 
brother who is a police officer-nobody is perfect-and an older 
brother. I come from a traditional family. It is quite traditional, 
with my father supporting the family and my mother raising five 
children at home, who all shared similar influence.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon (Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, Lib.):</B> 
And one son who is a comedian.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> The hon. member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine is paying me a 
compliment that I cannot ignore. My point is that it is certainly 
not as a challenge to the traditional or alternative family that we, 
as legislators, want to put a stop to violence. I cannot accept this 
kind of argument.
<P>
	I suspect that the hon. member for Scarborough West made an 
honest mistake when he told us that there is no mention of sexual 
orientation in any Canadian legislation. As a good, honest 
lawyer, he knows full well that for a number of years now, the 
Canadian Human Rights Act is to be construed as explicitly 
including sexual orientation. Finally, it took all the 
determination, the energy and the drive of a group like EGALE 
to remind everyone, including MPs, this in a manner that 
deserves to be praised, that in 18 years of existing case law, no 
comparison can be made between what the legislator is about to 
do and any form 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13781"> 13781 </A></B>
<P>
of perversion mentioned by some members of this House who, 
in so doing, showed an unacceptable lack of consideration.
<P>
	After all, why, as parliamentarians, do we want the courts to 
take sexual orientation into account, among other factors, when 
sentencing an offender? The hon. member for Scarborough West 
knows full well that none of the other aggravating factors is 
defined in clause 718.2. Why be so obsessed about stating facts 
which do not withstand close scrutiny?
<P>
	I will conclude with this: When parliamentarians from every 
party, as well as the courts, understand that we play an educating 
role every time we make a decision, then we will live in a society 
which I long for, a society where it will possible for a person, 
whether a public figure or not, to be gay, to live his or her 
difference and feel good about it, and to not be exposed to 
physical abuse, as is unfortunately often the case for members of 
the gay community.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I want to compliment my colleagues from Scarborough 
West and Hochelaga who have been speaking in this debate for 
the tenor, the tone and the wisdom of their speeches and the way 
they have conducted themselves. It is interesting that two people 
coming from such polar opposites in this debate can both put 
their points well, succinctly and make their arguments.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I am absolutely fed up with being 
discriminated against. It is really starting to get to me. After 
studying the legislation, I see no mention of white, middle aged, 
sort of Catholic males.
<P>
	If I am lying in a ditch somewhere with my head kicked in, 
why is it any less of an offence, albeit I am a member of the 
Reform Party? Why is it any less of an offence for me to be lying 
in a ditch with my head kicked in than someone else who may be 
black, may be gay or some other human characteristic? That is 
the reason I have a problem with the legislation. The whole 
notion of sexual orientation in the bill is a red herring.
<P>
<B>(2145 ) </B>
<P>
	If the government had the guts and courage of its convictions 
on sexual orientation it would come in the front door and amend 
the human rights act upfront instead of trying to slide this 
amendment in through the back door. As the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Justice so aptly put it, why does this 
one teeny-weeny, itsy-bitsy two-word phrase in a 30-page bill 
have people up in arms?
<P>
	It has people up in arms because it does not come to this 
question honestly. We have to be very careful to address the 
whole notion of sexual orientation honestly. Most Canadians, 
myself included, are absolutely 100 per cent against the notion 
of discrimination against anybody for any reason, including 
people who are gay. We are equally opposed to affirmative 
action based on any human characteristic.
<P>
	The whole notion of rights came up in the 16th century and 
has come up through western Liberal democracies. It is a big 
part of the American Declaration of Independence. Now that we 
have sort of been messing around with the Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms the whole notion of rights has become 
confused.
<P>
	As human beings we have two rights that are inalienable: the 
right to life and the right to liberty. Beyond those every other 
so-called right is a privilege given to us by other members of 
society for one reason or another.
<P>
	When people came together under an apple tree and decided 
on some sort of governance, they were willing to give up some 
of our individual freedoms and liberties for the greater good, so 
that those that remained would be enhanced. We gave the 
responsibility to government to provide for these freedoms, 
security of the person and policing. We did so voluntarily but we 
did so as human beings.
<P>
	We did not come together under a tree as white males, gay 
males, lesbian females, black females, males and females. We 
came together under a tree and said that for the common good we 
would have rules and order in society. We did not vest any one of 
us with rights or privileges superior to anyone else. When we 
came together and decided to have governance we said we 
wanted it for the common good.
<P>
	Down the road things do not always work out the way they 
should. We know there are certain people in society who have 
been discriminated against. We know intuitively it is right to 
prevent discrimination. We have enacted laws over the years to 
prevent it. If we have to enact laws in the future to prevent 
discrimination against people because they are gay, 
homosexual, bisexual or lesbian, we should do so. However let 
us not be afraid of addressing it head on.
<P>
	As my hon. colleague from Scarborough West said, statute 
laws that are ambiguous in nature in not defining the term sexual 
orientation do not bring credit to the law making process.
<P>
	I wish to conclude my comments with a plea to all hon. 
members and to Canadians in general. We must make a clear 
distinction between the prevention of discrimination, which is 
laudable and which we all want, and affirmative action or giving 
benefit by reason of specific characteristics including sexual 
orientation. These are two very different ideas which have been 
combined and mixed up in the bill to the discredit of the bill.
<P>

<P>
<B>(2150) </B>
<P>
	If it is the government's intention to have sexual orientation 
as a defined part of the human rights act, the government should 
bring forth legislation as it promised to do in the election 
campaign and in its red book. It should show the courage of its 
convictions and do it through the front door honestly and 
honourably, not try to slide it in the back door through this 
legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to make further 
submissions on the legislation. Earlier I spoke about the 
alternative measures section in the code. I indicated then that I 
disagreed with the provision that would allow attorneys general 
across the country to use their discretion and not prosecute 
serious crimes. It is somewhat inconsistent now that the bill 
purports to deal more harshly with those who commit crimes 
motivated by hate, knowing that a court could very well divert 
an offender who commits an offence out of the criminal justice 
system and invoke the alternative measures.
<P>
	The bill is not about sexual orientation. The bill is not about 
homosexuality. Frankly what the hon. member for 
Burnaby-Kingsway and the hon. member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve do in the confines of their bedrooms 
is their business. That is not what the bill purports to deal with.
<P>
	The question of whether or not homosexuality is immoral is 
not the issue with the legislation. As the hon. member indicated, 
that debate is the real debate and that debate will only take place 
when a bill is put before the House dealing with amendments to 
the Canadian Human Rights Act. Bill C-41 is an omnibus bill. It 
is referred to as an act to amend the Criminal Code (sentencing) 
and other acts in consequence thereof.
<P>
	If we look at the index we see it deals with alternative 
measures, purpose and principles of sentencing, punishment 
generally, procedure and evidence, restitution, conditional 
sentence of imprisonment, fines and forfeitures. The bill is not 
about sexual orientation or homosexuality. It is often referred to 
in the media as the hate crime bill. One section deals with hate 
crime and that is section 718.2. The section purports to deal with 
hate motivated crimes. The bill is not about homosexuality; it is 
about political correctness.
<P>
	The first question I ask as a lawyer and as a Canadian is 
whether we need this section in the Criminal Code. The answer 
is very simply no. This section is here not because there is a void 
that has to be filled in criminal law. It is not here because there is 
a groundswell of support for this change in the country. It is 
because specific groups in society have effectively lobbied the 
Government of Canada to inject into the criminal law an 
unnecessary section.
<P>
	I quote from a reputable newspaper that has never been 
accused of being homophobic, anti-homosexual or anything of 
the sort. The <I>Globe and Mail</I>, wrote an editorial entitled 
``Unnecessary Laws'' which takes the position that the section is 
unnecessary. My views happen to coincide completely with the 
arguments made in the editorial. I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The new sentencing guidelines are redundant and ill considered, injecting 
politics once again into the making of criminal law.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>D (2155) </BLOCKQUOTE>
	It goes on to say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If Parliament wants to protect threatened groups from hate crimes, it cannot 
exclude certain groups that some of its members happen not to like. The real 
problem with section 718.2 is not that it refers to homosexuals but that it is 
proposed at all.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	And this is the key:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Judges already have wide discretion in sentencing. They often use this 
discretion to hand out particularly harsh sentences for crimes they consider 
particularly harmful to society. As far as we can determine the government has 
presented no evidence that judges are being unduly lenient with criminals 
motivated by hate. So why pass a law that in effect asks them to be tougher?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	What evidence does the Minister of Justice have or what 
evidence did he present to the justice committee to warrant this 
new section in the Criminal Code of Canada? As far as I know, 
and I have asked several members of the committee, there was 
no study presented to the committee and there was no evidence 
other than anecdotal evidence.
<P>
	The member for Burnaby-Kingsway and others can talk 
about a particular hate motivated crime that happened in 
Vancouver, Toronto or Halifax. We know these crimes take 
place. But how often do they take place? Does the government 
have that evidence? Does the minister have a study that 
indicates that 1,000, 1,500, 2,000 or 10,000 so-called hate 
motivated crimes are taking place? We keep statistics on all 
kinds of matters related to the criminal law. If so, is there 
evidence to suggest that judges have been unduly lenient in 
dealing with offenders who commit a crime motivated by hate? I 
would submit there is no evidence to suggest that judges are too 
lenient. Then why present the law?
<P>
	The criminal law is not a piece of legislation to be amended 
and changed in order to be ``politically correct'' because certain 
groups in society have pressured effectively for an inclusion of 
something in the law. The criminal law deals with many matters. 
It is a serious law, not to be used by politicians to curry votes and 
support from groups within society.
<P>
	The <I>Globe and Mail</I> goes on to say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Criminal Code is not a toy. Nor is it a showcase for the government's 
good intentions. It is the law of the land. Before the government makes any 
changes to the code it should show that there is a problem in the first place, and 
what is more, a problem that can be addressed by the law. Governments should 
make law only out of demonstrated need. First demonstrate, then legislate.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13783"> 13783 </A></B>
<P>
	The <I>Globe and Mail</I> makes a very persuasive argument on 
why we do not need this section in the Criminal Code of Canada.
<P>
	The <I>Financial Post</I> is not a homophobic newspaper. I do not 
believe it can be accused of being anti-homosexual or anti-gay. 
It carried an editorial dated May 27 entitled ``Cluttering up the 
Code'' from which I would like to quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>So much for the punishment fitting the crime. According to C-41 it is not 
enough that a person is assaulted or robbed or killed. Now any relevant 
aggravating circumstances are to be considered when meting out the 
punishment. If you happen to be beaten up or murdered because you were in 
the wrong place at the wrong time, or because someone wanted to rob you, the 
court is told to give the offender a lighter sentence than it would to someone 
who assaulted or murdered because they hated the victim's religion.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(2200 ) </B>
<P>
	In other words in an attempt to attack discrimination the law 
itself would discriminate. Furthermore, since the government 
has not produced evidence that the courts have been especially 
lenient on those who commit crimes motivated by hate, where is 
the need for such a provision? The bill says the fundamental 
purpose of sentencing is to contribute to the respect for the law. 
The section on sentencing does the opposite. It is motivated by 
politics, not by the principle of impartial justice.
<P>
	For these reasons alone, I urge members of Parliament to 
reject this section of the bill. It is unnecessary. It is politically 
motivated. We are not debating here the issue of whether 
homosexuality is moral or immoral. That debate is yet to come.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
was interested in the parliamentary secretary to the justice 
minister's comment about how good Bill C-41 is and how much 
more it included other than section 718.2.
<P>
	If the parliamentary secretary was listening carefully to the 
member for York South-Weston, he clearly pointed out two 
areas of this bill that are very questionable. One of them deals 
with alternative measures. Several clauses and subclauses are 
very questionable. Another one is section 718.2.
<P>
	A third one I have found which is absolutely reflective of a 
government that really does not pay attention to the wishes of 
the people but writes legislation contrary to it is section 745.1. 
This section deals with early release for first and second degree 
murderers if they are under 18 years of age.
<P>
	Very little has been debated on this bill. It was incumbent 
upon members in this House to do a thorough debate of this bill 
because of its implications.
<P>
	Returning to 745.1 it reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The sentence to be pronounced against a person who was under the age of 18 at the 
time of the commission of the offence for which the person was convicted of first 
degree murder or second degree murder and who is to be sentenced to  imprisonment 
for life shall be that the person be sentenced to imprisonment for life without eligibility 
for parole until a person has served such period between five and 10 years of the 
sentence as is specified by the judge presiding at the trial.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In other words, what is the difference between this piece of 
legislation when dealing with first and second degree murderers 
who are under 18 years old and those provisions under the Young 
Offenders Act? There is no difference whatsoever. Just like 
section 745, the attempt to repeal that section of the Criminal 
Code by the member for York South-Weston was brought about 
by him through a private member's bill.
<P>
	Here is another section that almost replaces it which would be 
extremely irritating if the people in this country knew about its 
existence yet they know little about what is happening here. Bill 
C-41 is a very questionable document.
<P>
	If I have learned anything since coming to Ottawa it is the 
wishes of the Canadian people are seldom reflected in 
legislation. More often than not legislation is passed either in 
spite of the desires of Canadians or by pulling the wool over 
their eyes, which is what Bill C-41 does.
<P>
	I have also learned that political philosophy can influence 
legislation in one of two ways. The ideology of the political 
party that sponsors the piece of legislation can influence the 
means by which a commonly desired Canadian goal can be 
achieved, or it can set the goals. Bill C-41 is little more than 
ideology dressed up.
<P>
<B>(2205 ) </B>
<P>
	Canadians are realizing more and more that our current 
justice minister, the architect of this piece of legislation, is a 
man of the left, if not the far left. The justice minister knows 
exactly what he is doing. Just as he has hidden the true intent and 
true result of Bill C-68, the firearms registration bill, in a soft, 
fuzzy cloud of crime control, so he has disguised the real intent 
of Bill C-41 behind a veil of real justice reform. It is pure 
trickery, but it is also very transparent.
<P>
	Bill C-41 is a bad bill and it will do bad things for Canada. 
Bill C-41 is an entirely predictable expression of what the 
current minister wants for Canada and what sort of impact he 
wants to leave on the political landscape. With Bill C-41 Canada 
sits atop the crest of a hill. If we in the House pass the bill we 
will propel ourselves down the slippery slope of governmental 
redefinition of the family, of governmental sanction of 
unhealthy relationships.
<P>
	Mark my words, this in turn will lead to a further alienation of 
the Canadian people from their legislators. People are already 
disillusioned with politicians. They do not trust politicians. 
Why should they? Politicians craft bills like Bill C-41 and 
disguise it behind the veil of justice reform. It is only later when 
the legislative rubber hits the road and the courts take action that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13784"> 13784 </A></B>
<P>
Canadians find out what really is the true impact of the bill. That 
is what will happen with Bill C-41.
<P>
	The world will not end if this bill passes. In fact, it will not 
change overnight. However, it will change and it will change for 
the worst. If this bill passes, the courts will be given full licence 
to redefine what marriage is, what discrimination means, what 
the limits of freedom of association are and just how free free 
speech is. We have seen examples of that in the House with the 
attempts to shut down debate. That will happen.
<P>
	Bill C-41 with the inclusion of sexual orientation, whatever 
that means, as a protected category will inevitably lead to a 
change of discourse in the courts and eventually on the streets. It 
will lead to expanded special rights for one very small group of 
people. It will set new limits for the majority of people who do 
nothing more in life than go to work, go to church, pay their 
taxes, raise their kids and ask nothing more than to be left 
untouched as much as possible by the long arm of the Liberal 
state apparatus.
<P>
	My years on the police force were invaluable in understanding 
what the real long term impact of legislation such as this will do. 
It has provided me with an education like no other with respect 
to the importance of the fine points of legislation and the 
massive ripple effect it will have on the street. The devil is in the 
details, as they say.
<P>
	The Bail Reform Act for example is an act which was filled 
with good intentions but led Canada down a slippery slope 
which ended in the weakening of the criminal justice system in 
protecting society. That was a Liberal act. It was intended to 
allow the early release of non-violent offenders but was 
interpreted by jurists to include violent offenders. Broad 
intentions were transformed into bizarre reality as the 
legislative rubber hit the judicial road.
<P>
	We have all seen the direction the Supreme Court has taken on 
the charter. The charter has to be so exploited by narrow 
political causes that constituents regularly call my office saying 
to scrap the thing altogether. Our esteemed court of highest 
appeal has ruled that drunks cannot commit crimes.
<P>
	For those on the other side of the House who accuse me of fear 
mongering for suggesting that Bill C-41 with its addition of 
sexual orientation to the list of protected groups will not create 
waves which will wash dangerously over Canadian families, I 
say let us look at the record and let us get rid of the long list of 
those protected areas. For those who say that this bill is only 
about protecting people I say, just wait. A few years away, a few 
court decisions hence, this protection will turn into promotion. 
While all of us in this House support protection of any person 
from discrimination or violence, let us think very carefully 
about what we want to end up promoting.
<P>
<B>(2210) </B>
<P>
	Let us be honest with ourselves on this bill. We all know what 
it is going to lead to. I along with my constituents do not like that 
one bit.
<P>
	The Reform Party does not like opposing legislation just for 
the sake of opposing it. No party should oppose legislation for 
that reason but we oppose this bill in its present form for good 
reasons. Those reasons are very much related to the problems I 
spoke of above.
<P>
	What will happen when the open endedness of section 717 of 
the bill dealing with alternative measures for non-violent 
offences hits the streets and is subject to administration and 
interpretation? Nobody knows. The justice minister does not 
know.
<P>
	I for one did not seek election in this House in order to leave 
the fate of legislation up to the law of unexpected consequence. 
This section, one of the more important sections of the bill, 
opens the door to the sort of judicial expansion that I witnessed 
while I was on the police force, the sort of expansion I know 
Canadians do not want.
<P>
	Since we could not have this section tightened up in 
committee, we have no choice but to vote to scrap it. In my 
experience it is far better to return to the drawing board than to 
paint a dangerously obscure picture, especially when we are 
talking about criminal justice legislation.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when I 
came into this House tonight, the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Prime Minister said to me: ``It is a sad day''. I said that it was not 
a sad day, but that it was a great day for a number of reasons. If I 
may refer to another piece of legislation, a battle was won 
tonight in the House, the battle to see the gun control bill passed. 
That made it not a sad day.
<P>
	I know that my colleague and my other colleague, the member 
from Mississauga who also thought it was a sad day were 
referring to attitudes that are expressed not just in this House, 
not just in this city or this province but right across the country. I 
want to talk a little about that in my very brief time. I am 
paraphrasing but I believe and my colleague from Toronto 
agrees with me that it was St. Thomas More, the great chancellor 
of England who said that all that is necessary for evil to triumph 
is for good people to do nothing.
<P>
	I have listened to some of the nonsensical reactions. I am not 
talking about members in this House but the letters I have 
received and responses from people who clearly have not read 
the bill, who do not understand what the bill is about, or who 
perhaps do understand what the bill is about and still evince an 
attitude of frightening intolerance. I know what my two 
colleagues mean when they say it is a sad day.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13785"> 13785 </A></B>
<P>
	The reason I know it is not a sad day is that this bill will 
become law. It will pass because it is the right thing to do. What I 
am struggling with is the fact that colleagues in this House, 
some colleagues within our own party, members of the church to 
which I belong and to which I pay great homage and great love 
hurt me very much by their illogical and irrational response to 
this legislation. This legislation says in effect that if <I>x</I> goes out 
and hits <I>y</I> because he just does not like <I>y</I>'s face and injures him 
and he is convicted of let us call it assault causing bodily harm, 
so we do not have to worry about private prosecutions here, the 
provisions in this legislation would not kick in. It does not call 
for it. It is not one of the things that falls under these provisions 
against hate.
<P>
<B>(2215) </B>
<P>
	What if someone does not like you, Mr. Speaker, because you 
may be a Presbyterian and decides to assault you because he 
does not like Presbyterians and you are a member of that group? 
Should this exacerbate the situation? I think so. The Minister of 
Justice thinks so, the Prime Minister thinks so, the 
parliamentary secretary thinks so. The vast number of 
Canadians think so. The vast number of Canadians are tolerant 
and believe that to attack someone because of a belief, 
ethnocultural background, skin colour or sexual orientation 
exacerbates the assault.
<P>
	The questions as to whether that is right or wrong are distinct 
questions of policy and divisions between the Reform Party and 
the Liberal Party to take one example. What we are talking about 
is something that goes much deeper. It goes back to what I said 
when I started my speech that the member for Mississauga and 
the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister were 
disheartened when I came in here tonight because of the feelings 
of intolerance that have flown around this bill from its 
inception.
<P>
	I went home today to do two things. I was opening a special 
centre for technology in my riding, a wonderful thing for the 
G-7, and also because my mother is very ill. She is dying in the 
hospital after a very long life. I thought about bringing up this 
allusion tonight in my speech.
<P>
	In a sense I want to pay tribute to her because I am here and I 
hold the opinions I hold because of the way she, a single mother, 
brought me up. She was a school teacher who desperately 
wanted to be a lawyer but coming to her maturity in the 
depression in Cape Breton, the oldest of nine children, it was not 
possible. She taught school. She was involved in politics. She 
was involved in the teachers' union. She was a feminist. She was 
a single mother because my father died when I was very young. 
She believed passionately in tolerance.
<P>
	I remember when I was four years old a man came to our 
house selling baskets. He was a Micmac. As was the Cape 
Breton tradition, my mother gave him a meal before he left. She 
bought some baskets from him as well.  As he walked away from 
our house my mother said: ``That poor man. It is a very difficult 
thing to be an Indian in this society''.
<P>
	I remember the discussion that resulted from that. It went on 
between us for the next 40 years as she talked to me about 
questions of tolerance. She talked to me about taking people at 
face value. She talked to me about tolerance based on fear and 
ignorance and how we must always fight to root it out.
<P>
	Whether that intolerance is against aboriginal people, people 
of colour, people who hold a different sexual orientation from 
someone else's it is shocking that we allow the vilification that 
has gone on around this debate to go on, that we allow the 
ignorance and fear to go on, and that we do not collectively as 
parliamentarians stand up and say enough.
<P>
<B>(2220 ) </B>
<P>
	We are changing the sentencing law because it is the right 
thing to do. We are changing the sentencing law because people 
deserve to be protected from people who hate them. If someone 
assaults someone else because they hate what he or she stands 
for, thinks, believes in or because of something endemic to that 
person which includes sexual orientation, they are wrong and it 
deserves to be brought out after their conviction in a court of law 
and added to their sentence.
<P>
	I stand here tonight to say this from my mother, Reenie 
Clancy, who will not be with us for very much longer. I am very 
proud that she taught me to believe this way. I am also very 
proud that I am here to vote for this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Bill C-41, the sentencing bill, starts out with good intentions but 
fails to carry them out. I like the part that mentions reparation to 
victims and the promotion of a sense of responsibility to 
offenders. It is about time victims were mentioned in 
legislation. I would even like to see that portion of this bill 
strengthened.
<P>
	However, the bill goes down hill from there. The alternative 
measures section allows authorities to choose individual 
offenders for special sentencing deals. Already sentences for 
similar crimes vary from place to place within Canada and they 
even vary from the city to the country. If one is to kill someone 
in this country, as the hon. member for York South-Weston 
pointed out earlier, statistically one should probably do it in 
Quebec because one gets far less time in jail than in other parts 
of the country. I find that incredible.
<P>
	The alternative measures section will make it easier on some 
criminals, which is the trend in our justice system, to blame all 
wrongdoing on society and remove the need for punishment. 
People do not want more leniency. They want the opposite. 
Imagine the return of the lash that was suggested 10 years ago as 
a legitimate element in our justice system. Now we hear calls for 
it in some parts of the country nearly every day. I am not 
convinced that is the answer but it shows me people are crying 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13786"> 13786 </A></B>
<P>
out for  action from the government. They demand action and 
justice but they are not seeing it in this bill.
<P>
	Tomorrow I hope to meet with the justice minister to talk 
about a case in my constituency in which a woman was stalked 
for five years and finally when she was caught by her estranged 
husband and stabbed repeatedly her husband received two years 
less a day in jail. That is a shame. I am sick and tired of 
sentencing bills that allow this kind of discrepancy. That person 
should have been put away for a long time and this woman 
protected. Instead they are allowed to come back into society in 
a few short months. It is disgusting.
<P>
	When we get to the hate crime section of the bill we see some 
more inequalities. It allows a stiffer sentence if a crime is 
motivated by hatred against certain groups. If aggravated 
assault is perpetrated on me because somebody wants my 
money, it hurts just as much to get punched in the eye no matter 
what group I am from. The whole concept of identifying 
Canadians by groups instead of as individuals is a disturbing 
trend in Canadian society.
<P>
	Too often the government wants to label people by ethnicity, 
colour, race, gender and now by sexual orientation. People 
should be labelled in one way, Canadians. They should be 
entitled to all the privileges, responsibilities and protection 
every single Canadian deserves.
<P>
	This section also marks a basic shift in our legal system by 
starting to criminalize thought. We have always punished people 
for the wrong things they do, not for the wrong things they think. 
I have zero tolerance for hatred and I think we should 
continuously speak out against hatred whenever we see it. We 
cannot stamp it out by pretending to read people's minds and 
then sending them to jail for it. It sets a bad precedent for the 
future because hatred is so hard to define and to know what goes 
on in someone's head is almost impossible.
<P>
<B>(2225 ) </B>
<P>
	In a previous debate some months ago when the member for 
Central Nova stated in her opinion that homosexuality is 
immoral, her words were characterized by the member for 
Burnaby-Kingsway as hateful, bigoted comments that have 
absolutely no place in the Chamber and certainly not in the 
Liberal Party of Canada.
<P>
	One member's moral opinion, granted, is seen by a leading 
homosexual in the country as an expression of hatred and 
bigotry. It is a dangerous trend to label people like that. Where 
could this take us?
<P>
	Maybe members are not familiar with this but British 
Columbia right now is contemplating a law called the bubble 
law that will make it illegal to even voice protest against 
abortion within a certain distance of an abortion clinic. Every 
day an elderly priest stands in front of the House and wears or 
puts up a sign that says abortion is wrong. That is his opinion. If 
the law in British Columbia passes it would be illegal to do that. 
Someone could sit  on a park bench within 100 feet of an 
abortion clinic with a sign around their neck saying they are 
against abortion and they would be totally in contravention of 
the law.
<P>
	That is the trouble because it starts to infiltrate and impugn 
motives on people. They could not even stand on the corner with 
a simple sign hung around their neck saying they are against 
abortion. One day if this trend continues legitimate opinions 
that express the morality of homosexuality on either side may be 
viewed as illegal or hateful. I think that is a very dangerous 
trend.
<P>
	The hate crimes section does not yet entrench this but it takes 
a step in that direction. By establishing a principle in Bill C-41 
we are paving the way that it is all right to punish thoughts with 
jail terms.
<P>
	I would like to remove the entire hate crimes section. The 
second best option would be to remove all the enumerated 
groups. My third preference would be to remove the phrase 
sexual orientation from the bill. If this amendment also failed in 
this group I would at least think the terms should be defined.
<P>
	Why would I remove the phrase sexual orientation? Other 
speakers have elaborated that it is simply not necessary. 
Homosexuals or people of whatever sexual orientation are 
already protected against violence, as they should be, like all 
other Canadians because they are protected by the Criminal 
Code.
<P>
	The Canadian Bar Association said to the committee that 
when someone can show they have been assaulted or somehow 
abused in all cases prosecutions followed, and so they should. 
That is why it is unnecessary to include phrases like this.
<P>
	Why should sexual orientation be defined? When the Prime 
Minister was the Minister of Justice he said in committee in 
1981:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I am not here to determine what sexual orientation means. It is because of the 
problem of the definition of those words that we do not think they should even 
be in the Constitution.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	On July 14, 1993 the Canadian Human Rights Commission 
said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We should be wary of coming to a complete definition. I propose to analyze 
this case from the point of view of what I believe to be a minimal definition of 
sexual orientation, namely, the capacity, or perceived capacity, to be sexually 
attracted to persons of one's own gender.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Homosexuality is a minimal definition. The commission left 
it open ended. Let me read some very recent quotes from the 
standing committee on justice. John Conroy of the Canadian Bar 
Association said on November 24 last year:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13787"> 13787 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That has certainly been the definition I've always understood: homosexual, 
heterosexual or some other sexual orientation. It could be any kind of sexual 
orientation, and it could be something that, as you say, is illegal.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Listen to Dr. Stephen Wormith, chair of the criminal justice 
psychology section of the Canadian Psychological Association 
last November:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Sexual orientation is a crucial factor of paedophilia; a fundamental 
component of a true paedophile is his or her sexual orientation. Certainly 
sexual orientation is a key and fundamental component of paedophilia.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(2230 ) </B>
<P>
	On February 9 of this year, Robert Wakefield, the director of 
the Ottawa region of the Criminal Lawyers Association, said 
this about sexual orientation:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Psychiatrists use it. They will say somebody is heterosexual, or gay, or 
lesbian, or a paedophile. There are other sorts of deviant sexual behaviours that 
they regard as an individual's sexual orientation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Finally, Dr. Greenberg, assistant professor of psychiatry at the 
University of Ottawa and staff forensic psychiatrist at the Royal 
Ottawa Hospital, said in February of this year:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Sexual orientation is a descriptive term. It basically defines what attracts a 
person to a stimulus. In other words, just like a compass-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	A member asked him: ``So necrophilia would be a sexual 
orientation to you?'' ``A deviant sexual orientation, yes,'' he 
answered.
<P>
	I cannot believe that the Minister of Justice wants to open this 
can of worms. He is not listening to the experts. I am ashamed to 
have to stand here in Parliament and tell the Canadian people 
what the government is doing. If people are concerned about 
what this bill could mean, then they should get on the phone or 
the fax and get in touch of their member of Parliament or the 
Liberal government and tell them that of your concern about 
what this could open up if this bill goes ahead as it is written.
<P>
	I regret that with time allocation there are only a few hours 
left before this bill will become law if the government pushes 
ahead. I ask the government to reconsider, to listen carefully to 
the amendments that will be proposed later and do the right 
thing to eliminate this section altogether.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
speak on Bill C-41.
<P>
	Let me first pay homage to the hon. member for Halifax. Her 
comment about the influence her mother had on her definitely 
indicates a life well spent and she can be very proud of it. I am 
proud of it as a Canadian.
<P>
	A lot of misinformation is floating around about Bill C-41. It 
is quite a comprehensive bill. It is a major bill. One hon. 
member mentioned some misgivings about the issue of 
alternative measures. Alternative measures refer to cases where 
jail is not appropriate and community service can be utilized. 
Rehabilitation is first and  foremost and saves society money, as 
well as being more humane.
<P>
	My seatmate from Mississauga South had a part to play in the 
bill, including special considerations for family members. I 
applaud him for that initiative.
<P>
	The controversial section of the bill is section 718.2. It deals 
with hate motivation. One of the things I heard most often is that 
we are conferring special status on homosexuals. We are giving 
them special treatment. Let me just say that the law applies 
equally to heterosexuals and homosexuals.
<P>
	If a group of gay people or homosexuals were to attack a 
heterosexual, the law would have the same application. 
Everybody is equal before the law. That is an important point to 
make because a lot of people would propagate misinformation 
on this bill.
<P>
	When I listen to arguments in the House about hate crime I 
really am amazed. This is the year we celebrate the 50th 
anniversary of the end of the second world war. We are all proud 
of the contributions that Canadian soldiers made.
<P>
	Let us think back to what happened during the second world 
war. Everybody seems to forget. Let us talk about some of the 
hate crimes that occurred during that war. The horrors that the 
Jews suffered are well known. First they lost their property, their 
jobs, their civil rights. Then they were taken to the gas 
chambers. When the war came to an end six million Jews had 
died in the holocaust.
<P>
<B>(2235) </B>
<P>
	I cannot for the life of me understand how this year when we 
are celebrating the 50th anniversary of victory in the second 
world war we could have such flippant attitudes in the House 
about hate crimes. It is just amazing.
<P>
	We have all heard about the <I>Spirit of St. Louis</I> that went from 
port to port looking for refuge for Jews. They were turned away 
at port after port and were sent back to their deaths. Nobody 
wanted to know or to believe this was happening.
<P>
	A few short months ago we remembered the 80th anniversary 
of the massacre of the Armenians when 2.5 million people died. 
They died because of hate. Finally we seem to have some good 
news coming our way. Members of the IRA are putting down 
their arms. What is the basis of that conflict? It is a religious 
conflict-hatred.
<P>
	Take a look at the present situation in Yugoslavia. What do we 
have there? It is not some minor disagreement. A holocaust is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13788"> 13788 </A></B>
<P>
occurring right now and it is based on hate. There are also the 
Hutus and the Tutsi in Rwanda. It goes on and on.
<P>
	Recently I attended a NATO conference in Budapest in eastern 
Europe. The major problem discussed in the civilian affairs 
committee related to the treatment of minorities and avoiding 
the examples of history. How do you do that? It is done by 
recognizing that hatred for others because they are different 
from us can have a very drastic impact.
<P>
	Let me express a bit of a disappointment. When this new 
Parliament started a new party came into the House that 
promised to treat politics differently and not heckle other people 
while they were trying to speak. I am referring to members of the 
Reform Party. They have been a major disappointment on this 
issue to me personally.
<P>
	I come from the community of Kitchener-Waterloo where 
neo-Nazis have made their presence felt. They have marched in 
front of European Sound. They have spewed forward their hate 
propaganda. One of the Jewish activists in my community, 
Mona Zetner, had her house burned down. She had to go into 
hiding.
<P>
	As a person who came to this country as a refugee having 
grown up in war torn Europe, I can appreciate what hatred has 
done. I would suggest to members of the House that perhaps they 
might think about that, look around at the problems in this 
world. Many of them come from hatred.
<P>
	I heard many people talking about how this bill has had no 
support. The United Church of Canada supports this bill. The 
Centre for Research-Action on Race Relations has urged 
members of Parliament to support it. The Urban Alliance on 
Race Relations support the bill.
<P>
<B>(2240 ) </B>
<P>
	I say this to my colleagues in the Reform Party because they 
often ask for the police officers' stance. The chief of police for 
Ottawa says: ``As chief of police, I strongly support this 
legislative change that will allow my officers to effectively 
work to counter hate crimes in our community. I urge the quick 
passage of Bill C-41''.
<P>
	The Canadian Jewish Congress, a community so much more 
than many others knows the effect of hate and hate crimes, 
supports the bill. The list goes on and on.
<P>
	Let me end with the support that comes from the Canadian 
Federation of Municipalities. At its March meeting held in 
Ottawa, the Federation of Canadian Municipalities' national 
board of directors endorsed a resolution concerning violence 
arising from hatred over race, religion, gender and sexual 
orientation. FCM supports the position taken in Bill C-41 which 
would provide sentencing guidelines to enable judges to impose 
tougher sentences on those who commit crimes of hate based on 
race, religion, gender and sexual orientation.
<P>
	These people represent the grassroots of the country and are at 
the level of enforcement of the law. I stand with them and I stand 
with my colleagues in the Liberal Party who are going to pass 
this bill. I am going to do it proudly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am glad tonight that the Liberals have resolved all the problems 
of Canadians so now they can create some more with Bill C-41.
<P>
	I was talking to a fellow today about Bill C-41. He said that 
the solicitor general will probably have a little bit of a new job as 
a result of this. He will have to get new signs outside of the 
prisons now. We will not call them prisons. We will call them 
institutes for the morally challenged. That is where this kind of 
legislation is heading.
<P>
	One of the Liberal members talked about incidental terms, 
minor terms. Why are we talking about section 718.2? There are 
so many other good things in this bill. Why are we concentrating 
on it?
<P>
	It is truly sad that the Liberal government does not get it. We 
need a sentencing bill. What we have is a sentencing bill mixed 
into an omnibus bill that has every other agenda that Canadians 
do not want. How do we deal with a debate when we want 
improvements to sentencing but all these other side issues of the 
Liberal government are involved in it? We vote against it even 
though there are some provisions that might be good. We have to 
vote against it because it has some things that are ridiculous.
<P>
	I note in the bill on page 3 there is an attempt to define things. 
For instance, there are definitions of accused, alternatives, what 
a court means. There are all kinds of definitions in the bill. It 
escapes me as to why the definition of sexual orientation is not 
in the bill.
<P>
	If it is undefined, who gets to define it? All of the lawyers in 
the country who are going to spend an inordinate amount of our 
money at the cost of victims, once again will define sexual 
orientation. They are also going to be defining other issues in the 
bill, issues based on bias, prejudice and hate.
<P>
	This will come about at the cost of the victim once again 
running through court case after court case trying to get 
definitions. I might try to help the Liberal government because I 
am going to define it tonight. I am going to define sexual 
orientation.
<P>
	I get my definition from a number of authors produced in a 
book by Victims of Violence with which I have had some 
association in the past. They say that the term sexual preference 
and sexual orientation are essentially the same thing. In fact, in 
the index of the recent <I>Sex in America</I> study under ``sexual 
orientation'' the reader is directed to see ``Attitudes About 
Sex'', which includes sexual preference. Both refer to the type 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13789"> 13789 </A></B>
<P>
of individual a person is sexually attracted to. If pedophiles are 
ever to hope to be protected by the law,  they must first show that 
pedophilia is a sexual orientation.
<P>
<B>(2245) </B>
<P>
	I would like to read a couple of quotes in an attempt to define 
it, because they do not have the courage to do it.
<P>
	Dr. David Greenberg, a psychiatrist at the sexual behaviour 
clinic at the Royal Ottawa Hospital, said: ``Heterosexuality, 
homosexuality, pedophilia-they are all just different 
orientations and an individual may have a number of them''.
<P>
	The first lawyer who comes up on the first case of pedophilia 
will attempt to define it. Perhaps the lawyer for Alan Winter, a 
pedophile from my area, will attempt to define it, because the 
government has not the courage to define it.
<P>
	Kim Tate, author of <I>Child Pornography</I>, 1990, defined a 
pedophile as ``an individual above the age of consent who 
prefers to have sex with children and who fantasizes about 
them''. That is found at page 104.
<P>
	Dr. Fred Berlin of the John Hopkins Medical School, in the 
Focus on the Family newsletter, number 11, November 1992, 
said that pedophilia is a value judgment and it may be a different 
kind of sexual orientation.
<P>
	Do they understand where these folks are coming from? If this 
government does not define sexual orientation then other people 
will in the courts. If the government has not the courage of its 
convictions, why is it leaving it to the courts?
<P>
	The comment I hear from a Liberal member is that statutes are 
normally interpreted by the courts. That tells us everything 
about the reason the Liberal government will not define sexual 
orientation. It will leave it to the lawyers to do it at the cost of 
young kids in this country.
<P>
	Dr. Paul Cameron of the Family Research Institute in 
Washington said: ``Sexual orientation is as ambiguous as 
political orientation''.
<P>
	Why will the government not define it?
<P>
	Let us go to a quote from the Right Hon. Prime Minister when 
he was the justice minister. He was asked in the House of 
Commons on January 21, 1981, what sexual orientation meant. 
He stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is because of the problem of the definition of those words that we do not 
think they should be in the Constitution. Do not ask me today to tell you what it 
is, because those concepts are difficult to interpret, to define and that is why we 
do not want them in the Constitution. I am not going to venture to tell you what 
is sexual orientation. I am not interested; and I will not fall into that trap, 
because we do not want them for the very reason that it is socially and in terms 
of law it is a very difficult area.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In 1981, before he was Prime Minister, he did not want it. And 
here we are in 1995 and he does not have the courage to define it. 
He is going to leave it to the courts.
<P>
	One only has to have some experience with a pedophile to 
understand what is going on. In my community, Alan Winter had 
a foster home. He had over 80 children sent to him by one of the 
governments in the country. Thirty-one of those people, of 
whom I have met a number, were all molested by Alan Winter. 
He got sentenced to 16 years in prison as a dangerous offender 
but of course the parole board let him out in a little over five 
years. That is a different story, which will hit the House one day 
soon.
<P>
	An hon. member said that has nothing to do with this bill but it 
has everything to do with this bill. This government does not 
have the courage to define sexual orientation in section 718.2 of 
Bill C-41. It is going to get defined, and the very people who are 
committing unlawful acts of pedophilia are going to use sexual 
orientation as an excuse. That is what is wrong with it.
<P>
<B>(2250) </B>
<P>
	Some say this is fear mongering; some say this is 
homophobic. This is reality. This is what the lawyers out there 
are sitting on. In fact I have a video of a lawyer in this country 
saying exactly that: that will be his defence.
<P>
	Since we have over 80,000 signatures from petitioners from 
every province and territory in this country saying do not 
proceed with this area of the act, why is it that the government 
chooses to ignore those people? Why is it that this government 
chooses to ignore people by restricting debate and calling 
closure on this particular bill, on MPs' pensions, on Bill C-68? 
Why is it?
<P>
	There is one word this government should remember. It is 
``retroactive''. When we get on that side of the fence, the tables 
will be turned.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Carolyn Parrish (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I was not really prepared to speak this evening. 
Actually I do not even have House duty, and I have been sitting 
here since early this afternoon listening.
<P>
	When we listen to things like this we really firm up our own 
beliefs and become very aware of how nasty human beings can 
get, how obtuse human beings can get, how they can purposely 
change things to suit themselves, and how they have obviously 
lived a life not subject to prejudice.
<P>
	When I was a little girl my mom took me to kindergarten and 
registered me. I am a Polish kid. We went up to the desk and 
people said to her: ``What is the name of the child you are 
registering?'' She said ``Carolyn''. She looked at me for a 
minute. My maiden name was Janozeski. Because she had been 
beaten up and told she was a smelly polack from the time she 
was a small child, she changed instantly my last name to Janis. 
For many years I was functioning under a pseudonym.
<P>
	The profound effect of being told she was a smelly polack and 
there was nothing she could do to defend herself against that 
accusation except scrub herself, change her clothing, make sure 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13790"> 13790 </A></B>
<P>
she was always clean, was  that when she took me to school when 
I was five years old she changed my name.
<P>
	The thing that really bothers me is people who fit into this 
category that everyone is objecting to so strongly. They cannot 
scrub themselves, they cannot change their clothing, they 
cannot change the colour of their skin. But we can protect them 
against people who do not understand what goes on inside that 
skin.
<P>
	It is very important that we keep very clear that this is a 
sentencing bill. It is not condoning any acts that seem so 
offensive to the people on the other side of the floor. It is saying 
to them that if you do not like the colour of someone's skin or if 
they happen to have the outward appearance of a different sexual 
orientation from yours, you cannot walk up to them on the street 
and punch their head in. There is nothing they can do to protect 
themselves against those types of accusations. Therein lies the 
frustration.
<P>
	In a country like Canada we protect those people. We protect 
each other. In fact, if anybody you are protecting hits anybody 
for any reason, why are you protecting them? You do not need 
the categories.
<P>
<B>(2255 ) </B>
<P>
	Anybody who attacks somebody else in this country should 
feel the full force of the law. Anybody who gets into a bar room 
brawl and chooses to get into an argument with a neighbour is 
walking into it with their eyes wide open. The cases we have 
heard described are of people walking along the street and 
simply because of the way they walk, the way they wear their 
hair or the fact that they may be different from us, you are 
condoning people leaping out of a car and beating them to a 
pulp.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, no.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Parrish:</B> I am sorry, I have been sitting here all evening 
listening to you stretch a bill-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. Forgive me for interrupting, but I want 
the hon. member to please address the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Parrish:</B> I have been listening to a stretching of the truth 
all evening. I have been listening to them talk about a simple 
two-word expression, about opening a Pandora's box to the 
world, that in Canada we will be condoning all kinds of 
perversions.
<P>
	I am a Roman Catholic. I come from a Polish Catholic 
Church, and one cannot get much stricter than that. The priest in 
my church said to me one day, ``What about this C-41?'' I said 
``I'm going to send you a copy of the bill, and you call me if you 
have any problems with it''. I have never received a phone call. 
There are over 10,000 families in that church who listen to that 
priest and who form opinions based on his learned judgment.
<P>
	I have had church groups in my area send me profoundly 
disgusting pieces of literature because members of Parliament 
have sent them letters stirring them all up with false 
information.
<P>
	I am standing here in the House and am very proud to be 
supporting C-41. I am remembering the prejudice my mother 
went through and the prejudice I have experienced on very 
minor occasions. I am hoping that everything we do in this 
House will protect all children and adults from that same sort of 
prejudice.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have been listening with great patience to the 
debate unfold this evening. I have my speaking points here. As a 
matter of fact I even have the Liberal speaking points for Bill 
C-41, their strategy to try to win the debate and to out-talk the 
opposition. I have heard the arguments of all the lawyers on both 
sides of the House and on both sides of the issue. If anything, it 
has given me more of a prejudice or a bias against lawyers, 
perhaps because I am a bit troubled with this bill.
<P>
	I see in the Liberal speaking points that it states: ``Bill C-41 
will not be the subject of a free vote''. It concerns me that the 
Liberal powers had to send a note to all of their members 
suggesting that they dare not suggest a free vote on this issue. 
That is very disconcerting.
<P>
	I probably have had just about as much mail on this issue as I 
have had on gun control. They have been running neck and neck. 
I think actually the gun control issue won the day, but hundreds 
of letters have poured into my office expressing concern. Most 
of the letters were handwritten or typed. Very few letters were 
duplicated, photocopied or photostatted. A lot of the letters 
expressed serious concerns about C-41. Unfortunately, it all 
bore down on this particular portion that deals with the hate 
section. This bill is rather large and I am sure there are a lot more 
weaknesses in this bill than just the area we are discussing in this 
section of report stage.
<P>
	I want to talk a little bit about the whole process of hate, bias, 
and prejudice. Raised out in the prairies, I was taught that we 
were to love our enemies. I was taught that hate was wrong. I 
believe with all my heart that hate is wrong. It is very difficult to 
know when you are loved or hated. You cannot always tell. Mr. 
Speaker, when you look at me I do not sense that you hate me. I 
expect you do not, and I assure you I do not hate you. Perhaps I 
would and I was hiding it. This bill attempts to play god by 
looking into people's heads and deciding whether or not they 
hate and whether or not the crime they committed was based on 
their hate, prejudice or bias. The words prejudice and bias 
concern me even more than the word hate in this legislation.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13791"> 13791 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(2300) </B>
<P>
	A crime is a crime. If someone commits an assault against me 
it is a criminal action and the Criminal Code allows the justice 
system to deal with that action. Whether that person hates me or 
not, it is a crime and needs to be dealt with.
<P>
	What is morality and what is immorality? That is very 
difficult to determine. What if somebody knocks me on the head 
because they want to see if I have some money in my wallet? 
That is a crime, an assault. It is immoral because that person 
wants the money in my wallet. That is just as immoral as if the 
person hated me because I am white or because I am a 
heterosexual.
<P>
	It is wrong. There are laws in place to deal with that offence, 
whether the person is committing an immoral act of knocking 
me over the head to commit a theft of my money or whether he is 
knocking me over the head because he hates me for some reason. 
Put forward in the bill is my gender, my sexual preference, my 
physical disability if I should have any. It is a crime and our 
Criminal Code has to deal with crimes because they are crimes, 
not because of who committed them or why they were 
committed. If it is wrong, it is wrong.
<P>
	The bill is causing great division and great concern that our 
justice system will begin to look into people's heads and convict 
them based on playing the role of god in determining whether or 
not they hate, are prejudiced or biased. That is wrong. That is 
why the legislation is wrong and it should be defeated.
<P>
	The Holocaust was a hateful, terrible blight on human history. 
It was wrong and all the perpetrators should have been brought 
to justice for that terrible atrocity against humanity. It was 
wrong. It was criminal. It was hateful.
<P>
	If someone kicks, beats or attacks a person because they are 
not white, that is wrong. There are provisions in the Criminal 
Code already to deal with that hateful, wrong crime and I 
applaud that. If a person is attacked for some other reason other 
than those on the short list in Bill C-41, it is just as wrong and 
needs to be punished just as severely.
<P>
	This follows along the lines of the Charlottetown accord 
where winners and losers were picked. One group is especially 
set aside and included in the legislation. Somehow it is given 
more pre-eminence by the judicial system. Those who are not on 
the list are nobodys. They are not nearly as important. The 
justice system needs to deal fairly with criminal acts. So what if 
it was theft? Let us just give a light sentence; it was not a hate 
crime. That thinking is wrong. This legislation is wrong and 
should be defeated. It does not need to be passed in this form.
<P>
	I have biases and prejudices and I do not make apologies for 
those. Some are positive biases and some may be considered to 
be negative biases. I have a negative bias toward the Liberal 
Party because of the legislation it put forward. I do not hate 
Liberals but I have a bias against them and that is why I did not 
run as a Liberal. That is fair and just. There is nothing wrong 
with that. I  have a bias in favour of my wife. That is why I 
married her. I thought she was wonderful. I see other people I 
would never want to be married to. I may have a bias against 
them but I do not hate them. That is not a criminal action.
<P>
	If this bill were passed, who knows how the courts might 
interpret the legislation? It is rather frightening because the bill 
is not just talking about assaults. It is talking about all criminal 
actions.
<P>
	I could talk about a lot of issues but before my time runs out, I 
want to talk about whether laws like this create solutions or 
whether they exacerbate the problem.
<P>
<B>(2305 ) </B>
<P>
	There is another category of people who are not looked upon 
very highly. I happen to be one of them. That is the category we 
all fit into on these benches, the category of politicians. 
Politicians are not included in this legislation. I know all of us 
have heard people say that they should take all politicians, put 
them in a boat, take them to the middle of the Atlantic Ocean and 
sink the thing.
<P>
	That is terrible. I would be one of them. I would be sunk. That 
could be considered hateful and wrong. So what should we do? 
Should we include politicians in this legislation as well? Is that 
going to solve the problem? Will people suddenly think we are 
wonderful because we put a law in place that says you must not 
say that politicians should be put in a boat, sailed out to the 
middle of the ocean and sunk? That would exacerbate the 
problem. People would say: ``Aha, we were right. They should 
be put in a boat, taken to the middle of the ocean and sunk''. This 
is creating a worse problem because it is bringing these groups 
into prominence.
<P>
	In summation, let me give an example. This House wants to 
pass a bill that will give MPs a special pension. Is that not 
wonderful, a special law just for MPs. That is going to endear us 
to the public, is it not? It is far richer than any pension in the 
private sector. Is that going to make people love us more? No, it 
will do the opposite. People are going to say: ``Those 
politicians, they have to have a special pension plan just for 
them. They have to have special laws just for them. They want to 
be above the common people. They need special 
consideration''. People then begin to have negative feelings. 
They have biases and prejudices, perhaps even hatred against 
politicians. That is wrong.
<P>
	The philosophy behind this bill is wrong. It needs to be 
defeated and I will be voting against it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I was not going to participate tonight. However, having 
listened to the very provocative comments, I thought it was time 
to once again attempt to set the record straight for the members 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13792"> 13792 </A></B>
<P>
of the Reform Party who seem to have trouble reading very plain 
English.
<P>
	Reform Party members in the course of their remarks tonight 
have totally misrepresented the effect of the proposed 
amendments to section 718.2 on page 8 of this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> Is the member the only one who can interpret it?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> I am going to interpret it. I am going to tell the 
hon. member what it means with the hope I can get it through his 
head. This seems to have been a real problem tonight.
<P>
	The hon. member for Kindersley-Lloydminster said people 
would be convicted because of their hatred which is totally 
false. There is nothing in this bill dealing with hatred that 
changes the rules in respect of hatred. It does in respect of 
sentence, not in respect of the commission of an offence. There 
is a significant difference in law between those two.
<P>
	A person will be convicted on the basis of the law as it stands. 
There is no change in the provisions in this act respecting hatred 
and conviction. A person is convicted of an offence against the 
law as it stands. This bill makes the sentence different from what 
it would otherwise be.
<P>
	There is quite a difference between conviction and sentence. 
Sentence follows conviction; it does not precede it. A person 
does not get sentenced until he or she is convicted. A person 
must be convicted and will not be convicted under this law in 
any way which is different from that under the existing law. The 
new law will provide for a different sentence after conviction 
based on hate, if that is judged to be the basis of the crime.
<P>
	The hon. member for Fraser Valley West went further in his 
remarks. He suggested this was going to change things and give 
all kinds of protection to pedophiles and other serious offenders. 
Mr. Speaker, I invite you to find that in this section of the act or 
indeed in this whole bill. Where is there any protection for 
anyone? This increases the severity of the sentence. That is not 
protection but increased offence and increased penalty. There is 
no change here that lets people off. It increases penalties for 
offences.
<P>
	It says if you discriminate against someone based on sexual 
orientation you will get a harsher penalty. It does not say that 
persons who commit sexual offences get lighter penalties. That 
is what the hon. member for Fraser Valley West said in his 
speech. I have never heard such rubbish in my life. It is totally 
false, misleading and wrong. He should be ashamed to have 
made such a stupid comment.
<P>
<B>(2310) </B>
<P>
	We have heard dozens of them tonight, gross 
misrepresentations of this bill. I hear them in here and I get them 
in letters from constituents, particularly from British Columbia. 
They come floating into my office obviously stirred up by 
members of the Reform Party going out there and spouting this 
nonsense to their  electors. Nothing could be further from the 
truth. This just is not right.
<P>
	This bill does not do anything like what is being suggested in 
this House. All it deals with is sentencing. A person is convicted 
under the current law and then is sentenced. This provides a 
slightly heavier penalty for those who commit hate offences. 
That is all this does. This is not a case of revamping the law in 
relation to any minority groups. It provides for a stiffer penalty. 
What is wrong with that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> It is already in place.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> If it is already in place, why are these minority 
groups crying out for this protection? They are saying people are 
beating them up with impunity. That is why. They are getting 
away with it or they get light sentences. This is exactly what 
they say.
<P>
	Minority groups came to the committee. The hon. member 
was on the committee as far as I know. I was not, but I heard 
about it in the media. They cried out for help saying that judges 
do not believe they are being beaten up just because they are 
members of these minority groups. Judges give a light sentence 
as though it were a normal case of assault that just happened on 
the street. In fact minority groups are of the view, and this view 
is widely shared by members of this party, that gangs are going 
around looking for members of minority groups to beat them up.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> Deal with the gangs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> That is what this bill is for. It will put them in 
prison. They will get a longer sentence if they have committed 
this kind of offence.
<P>
	Why would members opposite take such exception to this? 
Who are they trying to protect by fighting this bill? The thugs 
who go about beating up these people. That is who they are 
trying to protect. Why do they have any interest in protecting 
those people? Surely they should be ashamed of protecting those 
kinds of people.
<P>
	A little while ago I had reference to the fact that I represented 
a lot of people in prison in Kingston. I do and I am proud to 
represent them, but I do not expect that they would get lighter 
sentences because they go beating people up. I expect that they 
get punished for it.
<P>
	This bill only asks that in taking into account what sentence is 
appropriate a judge consider certain aggravating circumstances. 
One of those aggravating circumstances is stated to be evidence 
that the offence was motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based 
on a number of factors. What could possibly be wrong with that?
<P>
	I can understand an argument that says we should have 
equality of treatment. An assault is an assault is an assault. If 
somebody gets bumped on the head whether it is because the 
person is out to beat him up because he is black, gay, Catholic, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13793"> 13793 </A></B>
<P>
Jewish, or whatever, okay, maybe that should not be treated 
differently. I understand that argument and that appears to be the 
argument Reform  Party members are advancing although they 
are doing it in the most cumbersome fashion imaginable. They 
are putting all kinds of other things in the bill.
<P>
	If that is the only argument, surely it is not unreasonable to 
have passed a bill that does not specify a minimum offence, that 
does not specify that the penalty must be heavier but does 
provide that in considering the sentence to be given, the judge 
must take that factor into account.
<P>
	This has nothing to do with juries. This is a matter of 
sentencing which is in the exclusive purview of a judge under 
our system. Juries will not be deciding sentences for criminals 
based on this section. The hon. member for Fraser Valley West 
in his remarks implicated juries in the whole thing, which again 
is a gross distortion of the facts.
<P>
	I am really having trouble understanding how it is that 
members of this House could possibly misconstrue this bill. 
This is an extremely minor change in the law. It has nothing to 
do with the commission of offences. It only has to do with 
penalties.
<P>
	One of my colleagues got a call from a constituent about this 
one night asking why he was supporting this bill. He made it 
very clear by saying: ``Why would I not? Unless you are raising 
a bunch of gay bashers in your house you will not have any 
worry about this bill either. It will not have anything to do with 
you''. He was absolutely right. The only people who will be 
affected by the bill are the thugs who are running around 
communities beating up people. If those are the people Reform 
Party members are defending, I say to them that they should be 
ashamed of themselves.
<P>
<B>(2315) </B>
<P>
	I am not surprised and I think it appropriate to read something 
more from the little book of reform. One can derive some basis 
for the thoughts of members of the Reform Party on this issue 
when one hears their views on certain social issues. I would like 
to read some now.
<P>
	The hon. member for Yorkton-Melville had better be 
careful; he is in this book too. I want to read a quote from the 
hon. member for New Westminster-Burnaby, that enlightened 
patriarch of Canada's social system who said: ``Old age security 
is welfare for the aged''. Those are words of wisdom. That is 
what he said. Imagine.
<P>
	We have the hon. member for Beaver River who is frequently 
quoted as an authority on this kind of subject. She said: ``We feel 
that medicare is for the sick and not for the poor''.
<P>
	Then of course we have the hon. member for Capilano-Howe 
Sound, also well known as the father and architect of Canada's 
social programs, who said: ``Having programs in support of 
single mothers causes mothers to be single and need support''. 
My goodness. De profundis, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> I have more. I can see, Mr. Speaker, that they 
are a little overwrought.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, despite the very late hour I will try to return a little 
sanity to the debate.
<P>
	Bill C-41, the sentencing bill before us, has some 
fundamental flaws. It seems the drafters could not decide what 
is the real purpose of sentencing. Should we base the prison term 
on the seriousness of the crime or the identity of the victim? Are 
alternative measures desirable because our jails are full or 
because it is more likely that criminals in community service 
programs are less likely to reoffend?
<P>
	Certainly a structured program in open custody may be a 
preferable alternative to incarceration for a first time offender, 
especially if it is more for a minor property offence and genuine 
remorse is shown.
<P>
	Is it appropriate for repeat offenders whether against property 
or people? Section 717 leaves alternative measures wide open. 
There are no limitations on which types of crime should be 
excluded. If it is primarily intended to empty our jails of the 
people who fail to pay their fines then say so. If it is supposed to 
provide an alternative for first time offenders who do not belong 
with hardened criminals then say so, but do not leave it wide 
open.
<P>
	Who gets to decide which self-admitted criminal will benefit 
from alternative measures? In section 717(b) the bill only says a 
person. This means someone other than a judge may decide 
which criminals avoid court and a criminal conviction.
<P>
	Why is the government reluctant to exclude habitual or 
violent offenders from alternative measures? Is it afraid of a 
charter challenge by murderers who would claim that their 
rights are being violated? If they are denied alternative 
measures, will lawyers try to tie up the courts with appeals and 
challenges to any decision to proceed in the courts?
<P>
	If the government does not have the courage to restrict 
eligibility for alternative measures perhaps we must reconsider 
whether alternative measures should be available at all. As 
legislators we have a responsibility to society to make the tough 
decisions about which types of crime or offenders should be 
eligible.
<P>
	A condition of people's eligibility under section 717 is 
admitting to their crime. However, after admitting to an offence, 
they are henceforth referred to as persons alleged to have 
committed an offence. There is no trial. They are never 
convicted of a crime. They are not called an offender and 
therefore have no criminal record. Furthermore their admission 
of guilt cannot be used against them in any future court 
proceedings. Alternative measures represent the ultimate plea 
bargaining dream for lawyers. Now they can admit to a crime, 
there is no conviction, and the records are buried after two years.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>

<B><A NAME="13794"> 13794 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(2320 ) </B>
<P>
	I quote from section 717.1:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-regardless of the degree of their compliance with the terms and conditions 
of the alternative measures.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Something is very wrong with the sentencing bill. Section 717 
needs to be fixed or struck.
<P>
	Another seriously flawed section is 718 which outlines the 
purposes and principles of sentencing. Noticeably absent from 
the list is the concept of punishment. For example, under section 
718(a) one objective is: ``to denounce unlawful conduct''. What 
is that supposed to mean? Breaking the law is not nice? Why do 
we not say that one objective is to punish unlawful conduct?
<P>
	Under section 718(b) the objective is: ``to deter the offender 
and other persons from committing offences''. I find it 
encouraging that the government considers alternative measures 
such as raking leaves at the local park deterrents. At the same 
time it totally denies the deterrent value of capital punishment in 
the case of first degree murder. Which would give a person 
greater pause: the prospect of three square meals a day, leisure 
time and the opportunity to pursue a university degree behind 
bars, or the death penalty?
<P>
	The objective of section 718(d) is: ``to assist in rehabilitating 
offenders'', which represents a clear indictment of our 
rehabilitation record. Why not simply say to rehabilitate 
offenders? Why qualify it? If we admit that they are not 
rehabilitated, that incarceration alone is not working and that we 
know they are going to reoffend, why are we letting them out? Is 
that consistent with public safety?
<P>
	The drafters of the bill failed to realize that incarceration by 
itself does not punish or rehabilitate people. Likewise 
acknowledgement of one's actions is not the same thing as guilt 
or remorse. Let us face it, the real reason we are trying 
alternative measures is that the government is finally willing to 
admit the current prison system is not working. If the 
government can prove recidivism rates are lower with 
community service and open custody, why are the same 
principles of work and restitution to society not being applied 
during incarceration? What is wrong with making able bodied 
prisoners work?
<P>
	The new Ontario government is contemplating workfare for 
welfare recipients. The bill advocates labour in the community, 
but the government is afraid it will be denying the rights of 
hardened criminals if they have to work to help compensate for 
their room and board in prison. Perfecting their golf swing or 
learning new safe cracking techniques from fellow inmates is 
hardly constructive or liable to contribute to rehabilitation or 
reintegration.
<P>
	Why can we advocate labour for people in open custody but 
not for those in closed custody? Society should not fear the 
concept of punishment. Instead we seem to extend more rights to 
criminals than to victims. At last count Clifford Olsen had 
launched 32 frivolous lawsuits at taxpayers' expense. Instead of 
helping to support the cost of their upkeep and learning the habit 
of working every day, other felons like him go on strike over the 
quality of their food.
<P>
	In section 718.2 the government completely departs from the 
previous implicit admission that our jails are crowded and 
incarceration as now practised is not working. Suddenly the 
government advocates putting people behind bars for longer 
periods, not based on the seriousness of the crime but on the 
physical attributes or the sexual preferences of the victim.
<P>
	I find it ironic that in section 717 the government refuses to 
list which crimes are eligible for alternative measures, leaving it 
open to anything from car theft to murder. However when we 
turn to section 718.2 suddenly the government feels the need to 
create a list. If the aggravating and mitigating circumstances 
apply to everyone equally why is there a list of special 
considerations?
<P>
	After letters opposing the new gun control legislation, the 
second highest number of letters I have received from my 
constituents concern the inclusion of the undefined phrase 
sexual orientation in the list of aggravating circumstances found 
in the bill. They do not want special rights extended to 
Canadians based on their sexual preferences, and that is what 
section 718.2 appears to do.
<P>
	If the government caves in to special interest groups and 
political correctness then it should call a spade a spade.
<P>
<B>(2325 ) </B>
<P>
	By including the phrase sexual orientation the government is 
trying to deter gay bashing by heterosexuals. By leaving it 
undefined it can also include other sexual orientations such as 
pedophilia and necrophilia.
<P>
	Liberal colleagues across the way will say that pedophilia is a 
crime in Canada. Yes, it is. A recent court decision said that 
sodomy with a 14-year-old was legal, but under section 718.2 if 
someone punches a pedophile he could receive a harsher 
sentence even though pedophilia is illegal under Canada's laws.
<P>
	Canadians want equality. Sexual orientation has been the 
lightning rod for Bill C-41. Even if it were defined or removed, 
the fundamental premise of section 718.2 is flawed. Canadians 
<P>

<P>
should be equal before the law and section 718.2 must be deleted 
in its entirety.
<P>
	If we change a basic sentence in principle and emphasize the 
identity of the victim more than the severity of the crime, we 
will truly be on that slippery slope. The rule of law requires 
proof, not conjecture. Regrettably prejudice exists in Canada, 
but creating false inequalities through arbitrary criminal 
sentencing will hardly address the problem. If anything, it will 
increase intolerance by creating the justifiable perception that 
some groups are getting preferential treatment under the law.
<P>
	In conclusion, justice is supposed to be blind. We all grew up 
with the image of the blindfolded woman holding the scales. 
Why do criminals not receive the same sentence for the same 
crime based on the seriousness of the offence, no matter what 
group the victim belongs to? Are some Canadian lives worth 
more or less than others? Prejudice, bias and hatred must be 
addressed through other mechanisms. It is not the role of the 
courts to implement the government's social engineering 
agenda.

	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Halifax West will have 
the floor next. I would point out that it is 11:26 p.m. and the hon. 
member will probably not be concluding today. He will have the 
floor tomorrow.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Geoff Regan (Halifax West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
members of the Reform Party made statements about lawyers 
and how terrible it is that so many lawyers in the country will get 
involved in the issue in various ways. Sometimes in this job it 
helps to have some understanding of the law and some training 
in law because we are dealing with interpretations. Reform 
members are telling us how laws will or will not be interpreted 
while at the same time they are claiming they have no 
understanding of legal matters.
<P>
	The law is all about making distinctions. The penalties differ 
according to different elements of a crime. If there are 
additional elements in an offence then the penalties are 
different. For example, common assault is not considered in the 
same way. The penalty is not the same as an assault causing 
bodily harm because there are additional elements that require a 
stiffer or more serious response.
<P>
	The reason the Criminal Code has so many sections is that we 
are making distinctions and there are many different elements 
and different kinds of crimes. When we are talking about an 
attack on a group there is a distinction. An attack of any kind is 
an important crime. It is important that there be strong sentences 
against attacks of whatever kind. When people are attacked 
because they belong to a group, whether it is a religious group or 
whatever, it is a kind of terrorism against the group. It is an 
additional element that requires an additional response. It is a 
little more serious. Both are serious but this is a little more so. It 
is an additional element and that distinction must be made.
<P>
	I recently read the Supreme Court of Canada decision in the 
Egan and Nesbitt case which deals with the issue of sexual 
orientation. There are quite a number of different opinions but 
they all used the phrase sexual orientation. I do not know what 
members here or what lawyers in the country claim to be better 
lawyers and to know more about the law than the Supreme Court 
of Canada. However they are comfortable using that phrase and 
express no concern or no hesitation in doing so. That is the first 
point I wanted to make.
<P>
<B>(2330 ) </B>
<P>
	The second point is this section does not condone any kind of 
activity. However, the government has introduced an 
amendment which provides that nothing in the bill will change 
or make something not a crime or condone any activity that is a 
crime at present. Therefore if pedophilia is a crime now it will 
still be a crime. If necrophilia is a crime it will still be a crime. 
Those things will not change. I cannot see why they are so 
concerned about this provision.
<P>
	Too often these kind of offences have received lighter 
sentences than they should and there are no bases in these cases 
for appeal. There must be a basis for an appeal and this provision 
provides for that. They must be treated seriously and the bill 
provides that. I recommend support.
<P>
