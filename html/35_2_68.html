<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="GOVERNMENTRESPONSETOPETITIONS">GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 36(8), I have the honour to table, in 
both official languages, the government's response to nine 
petitions.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="NATIONALPEDOPHILEREGISTRY">NATIONAL PEDOPHILE REGISTRY</A></H4>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ind.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to present this petition on behalf of constituents and concerned 
parents across the country who support the effort to create a 
national pedophile registry.
<P>
	The petitioners I represent are concerned with making our streets 
and homes safer for our children. They are opposed to the current 
status quo in the screening of pedophiles within our communities.
<P>
	The petitioners pray that a federally implemented pedophile 
registry be established in order to help better protect our children.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="NATIONALPARKS">NATIONAL PARKS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
response to concerns about the fee structure in our national parks, I 
am pleased to present the following two petitions: ``We, the 
undersigned citizens of Canada, believe our national parks belong 
to all Canadians with a first priority to ensure that costs for 
Canadians and their families to use and enjoy the parks remain 
affordable''. The petitioners wish to draw this to the attention to the 
House.
<P>
	The petitioners ask that the standard fee for going into a park 
should be $2 for a passenger vehicle or $25 annually.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CRIMINALCODE">CRIMINAL CODE</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I have several petitions I wish to present to the House.
<P>
	The first petition deals with section 745 of the Criminal Code. 
As members know, that provision in the code allows those 
convicted of first and second degree murder with parole 
ineligibility in excess of 15 years to apply to have their parole 
ineligibility reduced.
<P>
	The petitioners call on the Government of Canada to repeal 
section 745 of the code so that the parole ineligibility provisions 
are not reduced.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="YOUNGOFFENDERSACT">YOUNG OFFENDERS ACT</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the second petition deals with the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	The petitioners request that Parliament amend the Young 
Offenders Act to provide that young offenders charged with murder 
be automatically tried in adult court, and that if convicted they be 
sentenced as adults, and that their identity not be hidden from the 
public.
<P>
	As the House knows, Canadians are demanding changes to the 
Young Offenders Act.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="IMPAIREDDRIVING">IMPAIRED DRIVING</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the final petition calls on the Government of Canada to proceed 
immediately with amendments to the Criminal Code to ensure that 
the sentence given to anyone convicted of impaired driving causing 
death carries a minimum sentence of seven years and a maximum 
of fourteen years as outlined in private member's bill C-201 
sponsored by the hon. member for Prince George-Bulkley Valley.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="INCOMETAX">INCOME TAX</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
two petitions. The first petition has to do with the taxation of the 
family and comes from my riding of Mississauga South.
<P>
	The petitioners draw to the attention of the House that managing 
the family home and caring for preschool children is an honourable 
profession which has not been recognized for its value to our 
society.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4266"> 4266 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1010 )</B>
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to pursue 
initiatives to eliminate tax discrimination against families that 
choose to provide care in the home for preschool children, the 
chronically ill, the aged or the disabled.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="FETALALCOHOLSYNDROME">FETAL ALCOHOL SYNDROME</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
second petition comes from Kingston, Ontario. The petitioners 
would like to draw to the attention of the House that the 
consumption of alcoholic beverages may cause health problems or 
impair one's ability, and specifically that fetal alcohol syndrome 
and other alcohol related birth defects are 100 per cent preventable 
by avoiding alcohol consumption during pregnancy.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to enact 
legislation to require health warning labels to be placed on the 
containers of all alcoholic beverages to caution expectant mothers 
and others of the risks associated with alcohol consumption.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="GASOLINETAXES">GASOLINE TAXES</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to present two petitions.
<P>
	The first petition notes that 52 per cent of the price of gasoline is 
composed of taxes, that the federal excise tax has increased by 566 
per cent in the last 10 years, and that the federal government 
actually reinvests less than 5 per cent of its fuel tax revenues.
<P>
	Therefore, the petitioners request that Parliament not increase 
the federal excise tax on gasoline and strongly consider 
reallocating its current revenues to rehabilitate Canada's crumbling 
national highways.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="PARLIAMENTOFCANADA">PARLIAMENT OF CANADA</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the second petition is from constituents in British 
Columbia.
<P>
	The petitioners draw the attention of the House of Commons to 
the fact that whereas elected members of the Parliament of Canada 
are duty bound to represent the interests of Canadians for the good 
of Canada, and whereas members of Parliament swear allegiance to 
the Queen and to Canada, and whereas members of Parliament 
have a moral and legal obligation to fulfil their duties in the best 
interests of all of Canada, therefore the petitioners humbly pray 
that the leader of the official opposition of the 35th Parliament of 
Canada and the caucus members of the official opposition party, 
having breached their allegiance and moral obligations as members 
of Parliament of Canada, be permanently ejected from the 
Parliament of Canada.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="HUMANRIGHTS">HUMAN RIGHTS</A></H4>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 36, I would like to present a couple of 
petitions.
<P>
	The first petition is signed by several people in the constituency 
of Beaver River from Thorhild and some from Edmonton. Who 
knows, Mr. Speaker, they may even be your constituents.
<P>
	The petitioners ask Parliament to be aware of the fact that 
societal approval, including the extension of societal privileges, 
would be given to same sex relationships if any amendments to the 
Canadian Human Rights Act were to include the undefined phrase 
sexual orientation. They find that frustrating and discriminatory.
<P>
	They call on Parliament not to amend the Canadian Human 
Rights Act or the charter of rights and freedoms in any way which 
would tend to indicate societal approval of same sex relationships.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="WARTIMEMERCHANTMARINE">WARTIME MERCHANT MARINE</A></H4>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 36, I would like to present a petition 
from several people in Alberta as well as B.C. and several places 
across the country. It talks about the wartime merchant marine 
navy.
<P>
	It states that it was the fourth arm of the armed services; that 
veterans of the wartime merchant navy are under the civilian war 
related benefits act; that one in ten Canadian merchant seamen lost 
their lives, the highest proportional rate of all services; that 
merchant navy prisoners of war spent 50 months on average in 
imprisonment but only 30 months are recognized; and that these 
people were excluded from the War Veterans Allowance Act from 
pensionable benefits, from veterans' post-World War II free 
university education, housing and land grant benefits, small 
business financial aid and veterans' health care benefits.
<P>
	They call on Parliament to consider the advisability of extending 
benefits or compensation to veterans of the wartime merchant navy 
equal to that enjoyed by veterans of Canada's World War II armed 
services. I am sure they would all say that fair is fair and let us get 
on with it.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="PROFITSFROMCRIME">PROFITS FROM CRIME</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to table two petitions from constituents in Langley, 
Aldergrove and Abbotsford, British Columbia in my riding.
<P>
	The first petition asks that Parliament enact Bill C-205, which 
was introduced by the hon. member for Scarborough West, at the 
earliest opportunity which would provide in Canadian law that no 
criminal profits from committing a crime.
<P>

<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CRIMINALCODE">CRIMINAL CODE</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
second petition asks that Parliament amend the Criminal Code to 
allow for post-sentence supervision and/or detention of those who 
have been convicted of sex offences involving children or serious 
personal injury offences. This should apply to those offenders who 
refuse treatment and/or are assessed at high risk to reoffend.
<P>
	Second, to establish a procedure of public notification of a sex 
offender being released and to allow such notification to be made 
available for reviewing at RCMP stations and other government 
agencies.
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	Third, it would establish a registry including fingerprints of all 
convicted sex offenders.
<P>
	Fourth, it would amend the Criminal Records Act to prohibit 
pardons for those convicted of sex offences involving children.
<P>
	Fifth, it would amend the Criminal Code to prohibit for life all 
those convicted of sex offences against children from holding 
positions of trust and responsibility regarding children.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="IMPAIREDDRIVING">IMPAIRED DRIVING</A></H4>
	<B>Mrs. Beryl Gaffney (Nepean, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have two 
petitions to present. The petitioners are mostly from the national 
capital region.
<P>
	They pray and request that Parliament proceed immediately with 
amendments to the Criminal Code that will ensure that the sentence 
given to anyone convicted of causing death by driving while 
impaired carries a minimum sentence of seven years and a 
maximum of 14 years as outlined in private member's Bill C-201, 
sponsored by the member for Prince George-Bulkley Valley.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, in the second petition, which contains 125 names, 
the petitioners pray and request that Parliament proceed 
immediately with amendments to the Criminal Code that will 
ensure that the sentence given to anyone convicted of driving while 
impaired or causing injury or death while impaired does reflect 
both the severity of the crime and zero tolerance by Canada toward 
this crime.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise today to present petitions of some 
1,200 names.
<P>
	The petitioners pray and request that Parliament proceed 
immediately with amendments to the Criminal Code that will 
ensure that the sentence given to anyone convicted of causing death 
by driving while impaired carries a minimum sentence of seven 
years and a maximum sentence of 14 years as outlined in private 
member's Bill C-201, sponsored by the member for Prince 
George-Bulkley Valley.
<P>
	I am presenting these on behalf of constituents of my riding and I 
am very pleased to do so.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Zed:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I was wondering 
if I might seek the unanimous consent of the House to revert to the 
introduction of government bills. The Minister of Justice has the 
high risk offenders bill that needs to be introduced.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is that agreed?

	<B>Mr. Zed:</B> I ask, Mr. Speaker, that all remaining questions be

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is that agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunziata:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. A lot that 
happens in the House is esoteric to the House in that people who 
watch, the thousands of Canadians who watch the proceedings of 
the House right across the country, do not know what is going on at 
times with respect to the proceedings of the House.
<P>
	It makes it even more difficult for members who do not belong to 
any caucus to follow the proceedings. For example, the 
parliamentary secretary a few moments ago talked about some 
question number that, as a member of the House, I can review the 
document that will tell me. However, for the thousands of 
Canadians out there who are constant viewers of the parliamentary 
channel, they are at a loss to understand what is going on.
<P>
	As a suggestion to the parliamentary secretary, he might want to 
in future explain or at least indicate what the question is that is 
being deferred or answered.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I fully agree with the member. We tend to 
use the jargon of this place. It would help if every one of us tried to 
avoid using standing orders by reference and so on. Maybe we can 
be a little clearer in what we say in this place.

	The House resumed from September 16 consideration of Bill 
C-45, an act to amend the Criminal Code (judicial review of parole 
ineligibility) and another act, as reported (without amendment) 
from the committee, and on the motions in Group No. 1.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to say it is a privilege to talk on Bill C-45 with regard to 
the amendment to section 745 of the Criminal Code.
<P>
	I would like to say that, but it is really not a privilege. The fact is 
we should not be here talking about this amendment to section 745, 
the faint hope clause as it has become known. It really should have 
been repealed. To be standing here today talking about 
amendments from the Liberal government is really quite an insult.
<P>
	If we were to talk to many of the people of the lower mainland of 
British Columbia and particularly in my riding, they would agree 
with what I say. Why did the government not repeal this section of 
the act?
<P>
	Since it does not have the courage of the convictions of many 
people in this country, I will try to put in a wake-up call to the 
government and explain why it is necessary to repeal this part of 
the Criminal Code.
<P>
	I may be the only MP in the House who has attended a parole 
board hearing for individuals who were put before a parole board 
hearing as a result of a federal review under section 745. That in 
itself may not be significant. However, what is significant are the 
circumstances by which I attended the parole board hearing for the 
two individuals who were released under section 745.
<P>
	They killed a young RCMP officer in Cloverdale, British 
Columbia in the 1970s. They were sentenced to hang, until the 
Liberal government decided that hanging was a bad thing and 
decided that life, 25 years, would be a good thing with the 
possibility of getting out before 25 years. Lo and behold, at year 17 
these individuals who killed that young police officer are now out 
on the streets.
<P>
	One might say they had spent enough time in prison, perhaps 
they are sorry for what they did. They deliberately enticed a young 
19-year old officer chase their car. They stopped their car, he got 
out of his car and they blew him away with a gun.
<P>
	Before the parole hearing took place and after the judicial 
review, I was called by the sister of this young policeman who now 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4269"> 4269 </A></B>
<P>
lives in Montreal today and his  brother who lives in Vancouver. 
They told me: ``We thought this was all behind us. We thought we 
were done with this and here we are once again sitting here 
listening and rehashing the horrible events that led to our young 
brother's death''.
<P>
	The constable's brother was sitting with me at the parole board 
hearing. He really made no input to the hearing, made no victim's 
impact statement and could not say how he really felt. His sister 
could not get to Abbotsford to the parole board hearing. She stayed 
in Montreal with bated breath waiting and hoping they would get 
their just sentence, life.
<P>
	It turned out there was another policeman in the room who was a 
friend of the constable back in the 1970s. He just shook his head at 
what he heard. I think everybody in the room agreed that people 
had forgotten after all those years. It was such a big deal when this 
policeman was killed in the 1970s but now people had forgotten 
what it was all about.
<P>
	Such are the problems with section 745, the faint hope clause. 
Those two individuals, cop killers as they were considered, who in 
earlier years would have been hanged or would have received life 
are now out. One is going to college.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	I do not know what it will take to get this government to 
understand that first degree murderers are first degree murderers 
and that giving them an opportunity to get out as in the faint hope 
clause is only sentencing the victims to a lifelong series of events 
which never goes away.
<P>
	For instance, you only have to talk to Sharon and Gary 
Rosenfeldt. I know people do not like to hear about Clifford Olson 
and nobody likes to talk about him and people like him. When you 
talk to Sharon Rosenfeldt she says: ``What else can I do? The 
government is going ahead with all of these things. This guy has so 
many rights and privileges in a prison. We have to talk about it''. 
Yet this government is talk, talk, talk but it does not listen.
<P>
	There are many victims groups in this country which I have the 
privilege of knowing. They call this a revictimization. I do not 
think the Liberals understand that. What is the point of taking the 
victims, their families, their children and their brothers and sisters 
all through this time and time again?
<P>
	If this government could only understand, for instance, the 
problems it has brought to bear on so many people with section 745 
with regard to Olson. He flew at taxpayer expense from Alberta to 
British Columbia for a hearing. There are countless hundreds and 
thousands of people on the lower mainland who are appalled by 
this and yet the government sits blank and allows it to happen. That 
in itself is criminal in my opinion.
<P>
	It is going to take the removal of the Liberals out of the House of 
Commons to make changes because they are not listening. There 
are probably 20,000 to 30,000 people who are ready to surround the 
building where Olson will have his federal hearing to give a 
statement. The member can laugh all right, but they will be there 
and they will give a statement and the member still will not do 
anything and will not understand, but they will speak out anyway.
<P>
	Giving this glimmer of hope to these people is really the wrong 
thing. All the government is doing is giving them much more 
opportunity than the victims. We have talked about victim rights in 
the House. This government does not even know what victim rights 
are and it could not even speak to it if we asked anybody to stand up 
here in the House.
<P>
	One says tsk, tsk. That is the insult you get from this Liberal 
government. Tsk, tsk. You have a Liberal laughing over here. I just 
do not understand. Breaks are given to some people.
<P>
	Look at what Olson has done and the fact that he has in excess of 
30 litigation cases against the crown. He is flown from hearing to 
hearing. He made tapes in his prison cell unknown to Correctional 
Service Canada. Steve Sullivan, executive director of the victims 
resource centre, wrote to the minister on March 1996 concerning 
those video tapes and the right to make them. Seven months have 
passed now and Correctional Service Canada did its own internal 
investigation and has been complete for a couple of months. It 
cannot get answers. Victims ask why this is being done.
<P>
	When is this government really going to get the message? When 
is this government going to understand in the House of Commons 
that there are a lot of people out there hoping the right thing will be 
done?
<P>
	In my riding there is a Liberal want to be, a guy pops up his head 
once in a while in our local newspapers who we beat in the last 
election. In the local newspaper he said: ``It doesn't really matter 
anyway. A guy like Olson is not going to get a parole. He is going 
to get a federal hearing. He is going to use taxpayers' dollars for 
legal aid but he is not going to get out on parole, so don't worry 
about it''.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	Why are we spending all the money if in fact he is not getting 
out? Why would we not repeal the section if in fact they are not 
getting out anyway? What kind of sham is this, this cloak and 
dagger stuff the government pulls over on the people of Canada to 
show yes, it is going to do something about this faint hope clause; 
the government will deal toughly with it and the government cloaks 
it.
<P>
	Why must we talk time after time in this House about sections 
within the Criminal Code? Why must we bring these events here to 
debate minor amendments when this  government with the huge 
majority it has can do what is right and repeal it? That is an 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4270"> 4270 </A></B>
<P>
interesting question for those who laugh and say tsk, tsk, for those 
who promise one thing and do another, for those who consider in 
this House on the Liberal side that criminal rights are more 
important than victims rights. Yes, members can shake their heads 
but that is what it amounts to.
<P>
	I get one minute to tell the House what I think but we cannot say 
that on television. The difficulty anyone has coming to the House 
of Commons with a majority Liberal government is they do not do 
much of anything at all. There will be changes. I can assure the 
House if the government does not repeal section 745 and Olson 
shows up in Vancouver, we will be there. We will be there not with 
10,000, not with 15,000 but with 20,000-plus people standing and 
telling Liberals just what they think of this Liberal government.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, thank you for recognizing me and allowing me to join in 
this very important debate. It is very important because in this 
debate we are exposing the true feelings of the government toward 
the issues of law, order, justice and security. The problem is that the 
government talks tough but acts in a weak, appeasing manner.
<P>
	If the opinion of the people of Canada can be espoused on 
anything, surely we can gauge their feelings on law and order. The 
public is sick and tired of those who are convicted of a crime and 
sentenced to prison for a particular period of time reappearing 
prematurely on our streets and endangering the safety of 
Canadians.
<P>
	Bill C-45 is just another example of the government caving in to 
special interest groups and not coming up with tough measures in 
amendments to the Criminal Code. Bill C-45 is 16 pages long. All 
it needed to be was one paragraph long. What did it need to say? 
Convicted murderers do not qualify for early parole. That is it.
<P>
	Bill C-45 provides a complex formula which, if a convicted 
murderer follows, he or she may be back on the street well before 
the sentence has expired. Is it so difficult for the government to 
understand that the people of Canada do not want to make it harder 
for murderers to get back on the street prematurely? They do not 
want them back there at all.
<P>
	Under this bill newly sentenced multiple murderers have no right 
to apply for early parole but those who were sentenced as serial 
murderers prior to the coming into force of the bill still can apply 
for early parole. Does the Minister of Justice believe mass 
murderers already in jail have some sort of protected acquired right 
to seek early parole? Is the minister afraid of a charter challenge 
that might result from removing this right from those already in 
prison? I say to the minister, have the courage to legislate. In this 
case let the serial killers bring their charter challenges regarding a 
law which would keep them locked up.
<P>
<B>(1035 )</B>
<P>
	I recently received a letter from the Minister of Justice. In it he 
states: ``Section 745 was enacted to offer a degree of hope for the 
rehabilitation of convicted murderers''. Where was the degree of 
hope for the victims? Where was the degree of hope for the friends 
and relatives of the victims?
<P>
	The minister went on to say that many groups oppose the 
legislation because they consider 15 years to be too light a 
sentence. That was in 1976, yet this minister decided Canadians 
were all wrong.
<P>
	The minister told us repeatedly during the debates on Bill C-68, 
the gun control legislation, that he needed to have it passed because 
it would make our streets safer. Most of us know we need crime 
control, not gun control. However, a number of members of the 
House-none in the Reform Party-found this argument attractive 
and the legislation passed. Now that the streets are supposedly 
safer, according to the Liberals because of Bill C-68, the justice 
minister is quite willing to render them unsafe by continuing to 
allow murderers to apply for early parole.
<P>
	My friends opposite say the new method is more difficult; the 
hoops that have to be jumped through are more complicated; the 
tests are more difficult. Yes they are. An application must first be 
made to a superior court judge. Now we are going to involve the 
precious time of our senior judges in this matter.
<P>
	What are the costs to the taxpayers for such a process? What are 
the costs to the other parts of the judicial system when we have a 
senior judge involved in these types of hearings? These costs are on 
top of the costs of the original court cases which the taxpayers paid 
to convict these murderers.
<P>
	Then, if the applicant for early parole is not happy with what he 
or she is told by a superior court judge, an appeal can be launched 
to the court of appeal. Again, at what cost to the taxpayers and to 
the judicial system? Lots of jobs for the legal profession though.
<P>
	Pity the position in which the superior court judge is placed as a 
result of this bill. It is up to the judge to decide if the matter should 
go to a jury hearing on the basis of a reasonable prospect of 
success. What will be the basis upon which this is determined? 
Good behaviour? Repentance? Perhaps an argument that it really 
was not such a bad murder after all.
<P>
	In his letter to me the justice minister went on to say: ``The 
parole board has the discretion to grant or to deny parole. The 
paramount consideration for the board in every case is the protec-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4271"> 4271 </A></B>
<P>
tion of society''. I can hear the gasps of shock from Canadians over 
that statement. How many murders have been committed while a 
convicted criminal is out on parole or early release? The horror 
stories are endless.
<P>
	The minister continued: ``Where the parole board grants parole, 
the offender remains subject to the life sentence imposed for the 
offence and hence, subject to supervision and to the specified 
conditions of release, literally for the offender's entire life. He or 
she can be reincarcerated at any time for a breach of the conditions 
of release''. Is this paragraph supposed to convince anyone? I 
wonder what solace Melanie Carpenter's family and all the others 
killed and tortured by those out on parole can take from that 
statement. Oh, but the offenders can be reincarcerated at any time.
<P>
	The Reform Party's position is clear on this matter, just as it is 
clear on all other matters dealing with justice and security in 
Canadian society. We see no reason to supply convicted murderers 
with a glimmer of hope. They gave no glimmer of hope to their 
victims. A life sentence for premeditated first degree murder is not 
about rehabilitation, it is about providing a fair and just penalty for 
the taking of a life, usually in a vicious manner.
<P>
	The Reform Party and Canadians seek the full repeal of section 
745 of the Criminal Code.
<P>
	I believe there is a crisis of confidence in our justice system 
today. A <I>Reader's Digest</I>/Roper poll shows that 81 per cent of 
respondents rate the criminal justice system as being fair to poor in 
dealing with violent offenders. Canadians consider violent crime a 
very serious problem and have little confidence in how the justice 
system deals with it.
<P>
	My riding of Mission-Coquitlam is, I feel, a very special 
riding. We are a mixture of academia, professionals, loggers, 
farmers, fishermen and small business. We receive more than our 
share of rewards for caring about the environment, providing 
young offenders programs, caring for seniors, and providing pages 
on a regular basis for the House of Commons. When I talk with my 
constituents they assure me that everyone must be responsible for 
their actions.
<P>
	I asked a question of my constituents about capital punishment: 
Do you agree with the use of capital punishment after all appeals 
have been exhausted in the case of serial killers and mass 
murderers? At the time of the householder we had 42,000 
households. I received answers from 2,680, which is 6.4 per cent, a 
very high return. Eighty-seven per cent said yes to capital 
punishment under those terms.
<P>
	I believe the Canadian people want a referendum on capital 
punishment since they do not have a government who will listen to 
their wishes and legislate wisely.
<P>
<B>(1040 )</B>
<P>
	Why is the government rushing this bill through the House? 
Second reading was given on June 18, 1996 and the bill was 
reported back to the House from committee on June 19, 1996. We 
are now rushing through report  stage on the first day back and third 
reading is biting at our heels. What is the government afraid of?
<P>
	One of the things that infuriates Canadians most is the fact that 
some of the worst crimes are committed by convicted criminals 
freed by the system, yet these Liberals are unconcerned.
<P>
	According to the <I>Digest</I> poll, the only criminal justice institution 
Canadians think highly of is the police; 68 per cent rated their 
performance good or excellent. The public believes the police do a 
good job catching criminals but have little faith in what happens 
after the arrest. Why? Because in 1971 Solicitor General Goyer 
summed up the Liberal government's agenda when he told 
Parliament: ``We have decided to stress the rehabilitation of 
individuals rather than the protection of society''. Fundamental to 
the approach was the notion that it is society, not the criminal, that 
is responsible for crime.
<P>
	Ontario lawyer Patrick Brode said: ``Suddenly the whole system 
existed to serve the criminal. It was based on a seriously flawed 
view that there really are no criminals, that people drift into crime 
because of circumstances, and that everyone can be reformed''.
<P>
	We are talking here of cold blooded, premeditated murders. How 
about the victims? They are dead a long time. What about the 
victims' families and friends? They also have a lifetime sentence 
with no parole. We must repeal section 745 of the Criminal Code. It 
is hard to believe that members of this government actually believe 
that the criminal is more important than the victim.
<P>
	I want to finish with a letter from a constituent. It states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Please take our concern to the House of Commons this fall. Our concern is as 
follows: It is time that the prisoners stopped tormenting the families and friends of 
their murdered victims. It is time that the laws changed so that the serial and multiple 
killers will no longer be eligible for early parole. These murderers planned to kill 
their victims. These same murderers have no remorse and are never going to change 
their habits or their penchants.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Theoretically, everyone deserves another chance, which is why we have parole in 
the first place. Serial or multiple killers have stepped beyond the line. They do not 
belong back in society. It is time to give the victims the right to put their lives in 
order the best they can after such heinous crimes have been committed. As it stands 
now, the victims have no rights; only the criminals have rights. It is time to give the 
victims the rights. The murderer has no right to travel and further torment the 
families and friends of the deceased. Why not reduce the strife and money? The 
money saved from the expenses of the parole hearing, i.e., legal aid, travel and so on 
could be put to better use. Stop persecuting the victims and the wasting of the 
taxpayers dollars. First degree murderers have no right to any parole nor parole 
hearings. Section 745 of the Criminal Code needs to be amended now. Olsons, 
Bernardos and the like have committed crimes and should serve their sentences so 
that we the victims can stop being casualties.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4272"> 4272 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, like some 
of the members who have spoken before, I will start by saying 
it is no pleasure to be standing here speaking on Bill C-45. Instead 
we should be debating Bill C-226. Bill C-226 calls for the 
complete abolition of section 745 of the Criminal Code instead 
of this tinkering which will only restrict multiple murderers from 
having access to early parole.
<P>
	It is no pleasure for me or any Reform MP to stand here debating 
a bill as weak as this piece of legislation is. This bill reflects the 
weakness in the justice minister's approach to dealing with crime 
and the weakness that has shown up in other legislation that he has 
presented to the House. It is totally out of line with what Canadians 
want. It is no pleasure to be speaking to this bill when we should be 
speaking on Bill C-226.
<P>
	I will summarize what is in Bill C-45, the legislation we are 
debating today. First, this bill removes the eligibility again only for 
multiple murderers to apply for judicial review and early parole. 
Somehow it is saying that multiple murderers should be denied 
parole but that we should consider early parole for people who have 
only killed one person. We are talking about first degree murder. 
Somehow in the minds of the Liberals it is not that serious anymore 
to kill just one person in a premeditated fashion. That is what they 
are indicating with this bill. That is my first point.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	Second, the bill states that the applicants have to persuade a 
judge that they have a reasonable prospect for success before they 
are permitted to take their case to a jury.
<P>
	The bill also deals with the point that a section 745 jury would 
have to reach a unanimous decision for an applicant's parole 
ineligibility to be reduced. Currently only a two-thirds majority is 
required. That is a slight toughening in that area.
<P>
	Again, the government somehow indicates the idea that a person 
who has only planned and committed one premeditated murder is 
just not a serious enough offence to be denied early parole. This is a 
thought that is totally out of touch with what Canadians want.
<P>
	The main point Reform makes and which I want to make is that 
nothing short of abolishing section 745 of the Criminal Code is 
good enough. Why are we wasting our time today and yesterday 
debating this very weak bill which will not abolish section 745?
<P>
	What do Canadians have to do to get their point across on this 
issue? They have held mass rallies, signed petitions, gone to the 
justice minister and to Liberal members of Parliament in droves. I 
bet I could not find one Liberal member of Parliament who has not 
had constituents come to him or her saying that they wanted section 
745 of the Criminal Code abolished completely. I  bet there is not 
one, Mr. Speaker, you included. They have heard, but why have 
they not listened?
<P>
	It is not good enough to tinker with section 745. It must be 
abolished. I make that as clear as possible because that is what 
Canadians are asking for.
<P>
	At a recent June assembly, 98 per cent of Reform delegates said 
they wanted section 745 of the Criminal Code abolished. I believe 
that percentage fairly closely, although certainly not completely, 
reflects the opinion of Canadians as a whole. The percentage may 
not be as high. In some constituencies it is certainly very high.
<P>
	MPs who took the time to survey their constituents found 
extremely high levels of support for abolishing section 745. What 
we saw at the Reform assembly very closely reflects what 
Canadians feel about the issue. It not just Reformers who want to 
get rid of section 745, but also victims of violence, the Canadian 
Police Association and the majority of Canadians.
<P>
	During debate on Bill C-68, the gun control bill, the justice 
minister focused again and again on the fact that the Canadian 
chiefs of police and the Canadian Police Association supported the 
bill. The Canadian Police Association supports abolishment of 
section 745, not just tinkering. Its members have told that to the 
justice minister very clearly. They left no doubt. Why did the 
justice minister hang his hat on the opinion of the Canadian Police 
Association concerning Bill C-68 and then completely ignore its 
members on this bill? The answer is that it does not suit his agenda, 
the agenda of the Prime Minister or the agenda of the Liberal Party.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	Bill C-45 still provides a glimmer of hope for first degree 
murderers. That seems to be an important issue to the justice 
minister, to the Liberal Party and to many of these Liberal MPs. It 
is funny how that is so important to these people. It is less 
important that the victim was offered no glimmer of hope before 
this murderer planned and committed that first degree murder. 
There was no concern about that expressed by the murderer.
<P>
	The government should focus a bit more on the fact that the 
victim was not be offered a glimmer of hope by this first degree 
murderer. That is important.
<P>
	Bill C-45 retains the right of first degree murderers to appeal 
their parole ineligibility while denying only multiple murderers 
this right. The taking of one life, as I said before, seems less serious 
than the taking of two. If the justice minister wants to make the 
distinction between single and multiple murderers he should have 
proposed consecutive sentencing rather than concurrent 
sentencing. That is the way to differentiate between the people who 
kill one and people who kill two. This would have put at least some 
value on the second victim of a first degree murderer.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4273"> 4273 </A></B>
<P>
	Because that did not happen and because of what is not in the 
bill, it is important to once again point out the difference between 
the approach of the government and Reform MPs on this issue. 
I want to make this absolutely clear. Reformers want the abolition 
of section 745, nothing less. They want first degree murderers to 
serve at least the maximum 25 year sentence that is possible under 
our laws with no chance of parole. What Reformers are speaking 
for is what Canadians want.
<P>
	When Liberals speak on the bill for whom are they speaking? It 
is clear Liberals speaking on this bill are speaking for the justice 
minister, the Prime Minister and the Liberal Party. Many of them 
are not speaking for what they believe. They certainly are not 
speaking for what they heard from the constituents that have come 
to them.
<P>
	Reformers are speaking for the majority of Canadians on this 
issue. There is no doubt of that. Reformers are speaking for 
millions of Canadians on this issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to address Bill C-45, which is a bill we 
oppose.
<P>
	We oppose it on a number of counts. Primarily we oppose it 
because it sends a clear message to the Canadian public and to 
criminals. It says to the Canadian public that their lives are not 
worth more than 15 years in prison. It sends a clear message to the 
criminals that if they kill somebody in cold blood, in a 
premeditated fashion, they may be asked to serve 25 years but then 
after 15 years the sentence will be revisited and likely repealed.
<P>
<B>(1055 )</B>
<P>
	It is not unusual for this to happen. Across my desk came a huge 
list of individuals who had committed first degree murder and who 
had been released after spending 15 years plus a small amount of 
time in jail.
<P>
	Who are these people? These are people who have committed 
first degree murder for killing police officers. Many have killed 
police officers but all have killed individuals in cold blood. It is 
very difficult to actually get a conviction of first degree murder 
because premeditation has to be proved. This is not a person who 
comes along and kills during a crime of passion. These crimes have 
been planned and done in the most indiscriminate fashion 
imaginable.
<P>
	This bill is opposed not only by the Reform Party but by the 
police associations that the Liberal Party profess to support. It is 
opposed by the vast majority of Canadians. They want to know that 
their lives is worth more than somebody spending 15 years in jail. 
If somebody is going to be convicted of first degree murder he or 
she is going to pay the penalty.
<P>
	The Reform Party has been accused of being without sympathy 
but that is simply not true. Reformers believe  that sympathy and 
consideration must be for victims and for criminals. However, a 
line has to be drawn somewhere and where a person has committed 
first degree murder that person has to pay the full price. Society 
demands it, Canadians demand it, police associations demand it 
and the people in this party demand it.
<P>
	The fact that Bill C-45 does not actually address section 745 in a 
meaningful way goes back to the early 1980s when the attorney 
general of that time said: ``We are going to change our focus in the 
justice department. Instead of focusing on the protection of society 
we are going to focus on rehabilitation of the criminal''. The 
primary role of the justice department, contrary to what the public 
believes, is not the protection of innocent civilians, it is the 
rehabilitation of criminals.
<P>
	The facts show that this government and previous governments 
have failed to do both. They have failed to protect society and they 
have failed to rehabilitate criminals. For example, everybody in 
this House realizes, particularly in youth crime, violent crime has 
increased dramatically with no decrease in sight. Those are the 
facts and there is no use denying it.
<P>
	When we look at other aspects of crime it is true that adult 
violent crime has decreased somewhat, but crime in general in 
many areas is on the rise. Governments have not put into place any 
effective measures of preventing that and there are ways of doing 
that.
<P>
	I spoke with the Minister of Justice before we left in June and I 
said that we can look at the United States and see some very 
important work that it is doing in urban centres to prevent criminal 
activity. In order to address future criminal activity and conduct 
disorders which go into youth crime and then often develops into 
adult crime, it has to be prevented. The way to prevent it is to 
address the children when they are very young, at four and five 
years of age.
<P>
	Unfortunately what we are seeing here are individuals, 
particularly in youth correctional facilities, who do not have the 
pillars of a normal psyche. Those pillars are developed very early 
on in the first five to seven years of life and that is where we can 
have the greatest effect.
<P>
	In the United States children are being brought into the schools 
and not only are they teaching them their ABCs, they are also 
teaching them self-respect, self-confidence, respect for others, 
appropriate conflict resolution, about drugs, alcohol and sex; a lot 
of the problems that teenagers are fighting and grappling with 
today.
<P>
	They also brought in the parents. They are usually single parents, 
and interestingly enough these parents do not have the appropriate 
capabilities to be parents. What they have found is a twofold 
benefit. First is the obvious benefit to the children. Also, they 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4274"> 4274 </A></B>
<P>
found that these parents started to develop the pose of a normal 
psyche  which did not develop early on. They started to learn about 
self-respect, self-confidence, self-reliance, personal responsibility, 
drugs, alcohol, conflict resolution. The result was fewer conduct 
disorders, less teen crime, a lower dropout rate. It was extremely 
beneficial and it did not cost the system more money.
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
	I ask the justice minister to take a leadership role in bringing 
together all the ministers of education from across this country to 
have a meeting in Ottawa to address this problem that would not 
cost more money but would have a dramatic impact on decreasing 
the number of youth crimes and therefore adult crime in the future. 
It is a win-win situation.
<P>
	The government has also failed to protect civilians, and Bill 
C-45 addresses that. Bill C-45 does not protect citizens. It only says 
to criminals that if you kill somebody, you are not going to pay the 
price, and that is unacceptable.
<P>
	To show how absurd this can get, I spent some time in jails both 
as a physician and as a guard. I will give two examples. There was a 
child in the juvenile correctional facility I was working at who had 
murdered somebody in cold blood with a bow and arrow to rob 
him. Someone else saw him commit this act. He and another 
murdered that person too.
<P>
	This person is a psychopath. At taxpayer expense his lawyer 
brought in a psychologist from the lower mainland to teach this 
person remorse. And so this child was trying to practise remorse. 
What a tragedy. They tried this to ensure that the child, who 
showed psychopathic tendencies, would get a lesser sentence than 
what should have been coming to him. It would not only give him a 
lesser sentence but give people less of an opportunity within the 
system to address his problems. That does a disservice not only to 
the public but to the individual being convicted.
<P>
	In another case, I had to go up to the jail once to commit 
somebody because their term was up. The person was a violent 
offender with a rap sheet as long as your arm. This person was 
going to be released the next day and the only way to get him back 
in the system was to commit him on psychiatric grounds.
<P>
	This person had chosen to show on umpteen occasions a wilful 
ignorance of respect for human beings and it had been 
demonstrated that this individual was a grave threat to innocent 
civilians. Yet, the system would have allowed this person to be 
released. The people in the system said those were the laws.
<P>
	We are here to change those laws and we are here to ensure that 
people who are going to be a danger to society are prevented from 
doing so not only for society's sake, which is most important, but 
for the individual who would commit these offences.
<P>
	We may not be able to address all the problems in the justice 
system, but we have seen over the last three years that the 
government is willing to only tinker around the edges of the 
criminal justice system instead of addressing the fundamental 
problems that exist within it. It does so at its peril but also sadly at 
the peril of the public that demands respect and deserves protection 
from individuals who would prey on it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunziata:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Yesterday 
and today I have been listening to the debate. I note that several 
Liberal members spoke yesterday, several of whom were critical of 
the bill. Today only critics of the bill appear to be speaking to the 
bill, and for some reason government members are not defending 
the bill before the House.
<P>
	If this debate is to be meaningful at all-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> As all hon. members know, there is no 
obligation for anyone to defend a bill.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I find the comment of my hon. colleague from 
York South-Weston interesting.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	The government side has decided not to include itself in this 
debate today. It is interesting because the changes that were made 
to section 745 were actually brought in by a member of the present 
Liberal government. They were brought in at a time when there was 
discussion regarding how to handle capital punishment or how to 
handle getting rid of the death penalty.
<P>
	Canadians were led to believe during that discussion that the 
saw-off for getting rid of the death sentence was going to be 
incarceration for a minimum of 25 years.
<P>
	Although it is a life sentence, the eligibility for parole is 25 
years. I would imagine at that time-not having been around for 
that debate-there was a great concern that 25 years was still not 
adequate for taking a person's life.
<P>
	I know that debate continues at least in my riding as to whether 
the deliberate taking of a life should be first degree murder, that 
there should not be the element for capital punishment.
<P>
	Canadian laws have changed. There was a time when it was 
capital murder. One was convicted either of manslaughter where a 
death happened not deliberately but through an event that the 
person was involved in or of deliberately murdering somebody. It 
was then capital murder.
<P>
	The legislatures since that time decided there could be a 
difference. They determined there would be first degree murder 
and second degree murder.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4275"> 4275 </A></B>
<P>
	That is what our courts have been able to use to determine the 
severity of the punishment that an individual should receive if they 
are responsible for the death of another individual.
<P>
	Sometimes they determined there was no intention and the death 
occurred through an accident or unintentionally. Manslaughter was 
the conviction. Manslaughter being a conviction does not have a 
minimum sentence. It can be no incarceration or it can be 
incarceration to whatever degree.
<P>
	Second degree murder was determined when the individual did 
not deserve a 25 year minimum sentence. With a minimum 
sentence of 10 years, second degree murder became an option. It 
was still murder with intent. If there was no intent, then it would be 
manslaughter.
<P>
	Legislatures have already provided the faint hope or the ability 
for the courts to say ``this individual, although there was intent, 
does not deserve to sit in jail for 25 years''.
<P>
	The courts have used that over the years. In my province two 
weeks ago a minimum 25 year sentence did not seem to be 
justified. Instead of convicting the person on first degree, they 
convicted them on second degree.
<P>
	I would suggest that in itself is enough, that it is really a 
contempt of the court process and of the judge and jury who made 
the original decision after looking at the facts of giving a first 
degree murder conviction minimum sentence of 25 years and then 
later saying ``we did not mean 25 years, 15 is good enough''.
<P>
	If the judge and the jury at the time when that individual was 
sentenced felt that 25 years was too much, was not an appropriate 
sentence, they would have convicted that individual of second 
degree murder.
<P>
	I suggest that Canadians feel the same way, that they are losing 
respect for our courts because they precisely see what is going on 
today. The courts determine that an individual deserves the 
minimum incarceration period of 25 years. Then the courts down 
the road change that decision.
<P>
	Canadians are losing faith. The Canadians who were there at the 
time of the event when the 25 year minimum sentence was handed 
out probably could live with that. With the passage of time after 15 
years and they see this individual applying to be released early, 
they lose faith in the system that told them the replacement for 
capital punishment was to be a minimum incarceration of 25 years. 
I suggest the Canadian public feels betrayed. The Canadian public 
is expecting this Liberal government with its massive majority to 
do something about it.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	I was part of the justice committee when it dealt with Bill C-41. 
We were looking at the sentencing legislation and all the changes 
that should be made to it. There was an opportunity at that time for 
the Liberal government to  look at consecutive sentences and at 
abolishing section 745. My Reform Party colleagues who sat with 
me on that committee presented those amendments.
<P>
	It was not just the Liberal members of the committee, the Bloc 
members of the committee also denied that opportunity. The 
amendments to the legislation were denied at committee stage and 
therefore did not get into the House for debate.
<P>
	It surprises me, if my hon. Liberal and Bloc colleagues are in 
contact with the people in their constituencies, that they do not 
realize the mood of Canadians has changed. There is a feeling that 
our justice system does not work and that justice is not being meted 
out. I feel very strongly that the changes proposed by Bill C-45 do 
not come anywhere near addressing the serious concerns of 
Canadians.
<P>
	I find it preposterous that the justice minister can tell Canadians 
that a vicious, violent murder of one person is not as serious as 
somebody who kills two people.
<P>
	In my dealings with the justice community I was told of an 
instance, I believe it was south of the border but the same mentality 
is present in Canada, where an individual was skinned alive before 
they put a bullet go his head. The purpose for that was to send a 
message. No one can tell me that the horrendous killing of that 
individual is any less horrific than somebody who kills two people 
because there happens to be two people in the house when they go 
berserk.
<P>
	I suggest those kinds of considerations are taken up when the 
original charges are before the court. When they are before the 
court the judge and jury of the day look at all the evidence when 
they mete our the sentence. It is those kinds of determinations 
which determine whether a person gets a first degree conviction or 
a second degree conviction. Anything more than that is not 
necessary. There is no purpose for having section 745 in the 
Criminal Code. There is absolutely no purpose to give someone the 
opportunity for early release when the court initially determined 
that the sentence was just based on the facts of the day.
<P>
	Canadians are concerned with the concept of justice. It is not that 
they want revenge. It is not that they want to be unfair or do 
something unjustified. They want respect for the courts and they 
want to see the decisions made by the courts upheld.
<P>
	Section 745 of the Criminal Code can put aside perhaps months 
of testimony and evidence which has been presented to the court. It 
can put aside the hours the jury spent deliberating whether the 
person deserved first degree with a minimum sentence of 25 years 
or second degree with a minimum of 10 years. That section of the 
Criminal Code puts aside all that time and effort, consideration and 
evidence. That should not be.
<P>
	I join with my Reform colleagues and some members opposite, 
particularly the individual who saw that the will  of the Liberal 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4276"> 4276 </A></B>
<P>
Party was not there and who chose to sit as an independent. I 
believe that individual realized the Liberal Party does not have a 
long term goal. It does not seem to have the will to follow through 
in representing and respecting the wishes of the Canadian public 
which elected it.
<P>
<B>(1115 )</B>
<P>
	It is interesting that this hon. colleague introduced a private 
member's bill. He is upset and concerned, as many of us are, that a 
committee of this House chose to disregard his private member's 
bill and refused to bring it back to the House for debate after it had 
passed through the House at second reading.
<P>
	I would suggest it is time for the Liberal government to start 
showing the Canadian people that it has the guts and the will to do 
what is right for the Canadian public and not just worry about 
something that has been placed in legislation which has shown not 
to be appropriate and should not be there. Instead of debating 
whether or not amendments should be made, we should be debating 
the private member's bill introduced by the member for York 
South-Weston which deals with abolishing the section. I would 
support 100 per cent dealing with that private member's bill which 
seeks to abolish section 745.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
happy for the opportunity to participate in the debate today at 
report stage of Bill C-45.
<P>
	My constituents expect me to speak on this very important 
matter. It is a matter which concerns them greatly; the fact that we 
have a bill that would tinker with section 745 of the Criminal Code, 
known to some as the faint hope clause.
<P>
	Before I begin, I would like to note that it is very strange that 
there are no speakers from the government side debating this very 
important issue. I think it shows a contempt for this House and for 
the Canadian people that they would place a bill before Parliament 
and then would not use the opportunity to explain why they want 
the changes they do. The Canadian public should look very 
carefully at those reasons. They do not want to debate this bill and I 
think there are reasons why they do not.
<P>
	The faint hope clause, section 745, which the government wants 
to amend, concerns me greatly. As has been mentioned several 
times in this House, it would apply to those who commit multiple 
murders but not those who commit a single murder. This has been 
explained very carefully by my colleague so I will not go into it. It 
is not retroactive. It does not apply to killers such as Clifford 
Olson, the very person we would want to control and not have come 
up for early parole. He is responsible for one of the most serious 
crimes that has ever been committed in this country and it would 
not apply to him.
<P>
	The section needs to be thrown out completely. I agree with my 
colleague from York South-Weston who introduced a private 
member's bill to that extent, that it should be withdrawn.
<P>
	In the very way we approach this there is a common theme that 
runs through this whole issue of criminal justice reform. It comes 
from the Liberal Party. George Orwell would recognize it very 
clearly. It is doublespeak. What does a life sentence mean in 
Canada? It was a Liberal government that threw out the death 
penalty in 1976 and gave us the current life sentence. Life sentence 
means murderers cannot apply for parole before 25 years. It does 
not mean life, it means the possibility of parole after 25 years.
<P>
	Furthermore, the doublespeak continues. Section 745 is the faint 
hope clause which states that in certain circumstances murderers 
can apply for parole in 15 years. What does life mean? It does not 
mean life at all. Let us be clear about it. I think we are going back to 
George Orwell's old scenario in <I>1984</I> which the Liberals seem to 
have adopted.
<P>
	The other thing has been running right through the theme of the 
Liberal Party and the Liberal government for the last 30 years 
which is that they are soft on crime. It is a well known fact that they 
are soft on criminals. After all, it was a Liberal government which 
scrapped the death penalty. We know that the Canadian public from 
the polls I have seen, and Liberals often like to quote polls, for the 
last 15 years have consistently suggested that the Canadian public 
would like to return to capital punishment for those who commit 
first degree murder. However, that bill was not introduced by this 
government. What we have instead is that in 1976 it scrapped that 
and gave us the current system.
<P>
<B>(1120 )</B>
<P>
	It was at about that time as well that it was decided that the 
Juvenile Delinquents Act should be scrapped and we were given 
the Young Offenders Act. They have tinkered with that a little bit, 
but it just seems to be another example of how soft they are in the 
whole area of criminal justice. Soft on crime, soft on criminals.
<P>
	Early parole, parole abuses, abuses by the parole board by not 
putting competent people in place are other examples.
<P>
	I would like to relate a little story about my chance to go through 
the Edmonton maximum security prison about a year and a half 
ago. It was an eye opener. Anybody who has not toured one of these 
types of prisons certainly should.
<P>
	The warden at the prison told me that about 80 per cent of the 
inmates had a substance abuse problem. Of course, I asked what 
they were doing to try to rehabilitate these people. These inmates 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4277"> 4277 </A></B>
<P>
do have the right to earn their way out of prison after a period of 
time. We have medium and minimum security prisons. If they do 
try to  upgrade their skills they have a chance to be rehabilitated.
<P>
	The warden told me that they had psychiatrists, psychologists 
and various others working with these people to try and help them 
overcome their drug abuse problem. However, at the same time 
drugs are getting into our maximum security prisons. Drug use is a 
common practice among prisoners in our maximum security 
prisons and at the same time we are trying to rehabilitate them. 
What does that tell us? What is Corrections Canada's answer to 
this? It is not to stop the family visitations which are identified by 
the wardens as being the main source of drugs getting into the 
prisons, although I doubt that would be the only source. I think in 
some cases some staff are probably involved. That would seem to 
me to be a pipeline for drugs getting into the prisons.
<P>
	What does Corrections Canada and the Department of Justice 
answer to this? Of course, not to stop the family visitations or get 
tough on screening of guards. No. It is to give prisoners new 
needles, give them bleach kits so that they do not contact AIDS in 
prison. What does that say about our criminal justice system? What 
does it say about the Liberal government? It says a lot. It says that 
the Liberals are soft on crime and continue to be.
<P>
	Where are we currently? The Canadian public is very concerned 
and rightly so. Canadians are buying security systems at an 
alarming rate. They are trying to guard themselves against break 
and enter. They are trying to arm themselves. Canadians have 
rallied on Parliament Hill asking for reform of the criminal justice 
system.
<P>
	My home in Alberta is in a very quiet farming community with a 
very stable population and basically no crime problems in terms of 
break and enter but this past year we caught up with the rest of the 
Canadian public. We now have joined the big leagues. We had a 
series of break and enters in broad daylight throughout our little 
farming community. Now people are saying: ``Well, I guess we 
have to get a guard dog or a security system''. That is the concern 
people have. They feel that they are under attack as never before. I 
know that MPs opposite must be getting the same kind of mail I am 
getting, especially members who represent rural ridings where 
people are asking what has happened to their communities.
<P>
	I operate a grain farm. We used to be able to leave the keys in our 
equipment in the fields. I had a truck stolen off my farm two years 
ago. That is what is happening in our society. I have received mail 
stating that people want this situation cleaned up. They want the 
government to get tough on criminal justice. They want to scrap the 
current Young Offenders Act and start over. Even the term young 
offenders has become very offensive now. It has been identified as 
an act that simply cannot be reformed, that it should be scrapped 
and we should start  over. Polls have indicated that Canadians want 
a return to the death penalty.
<P>
	What Canadians get from the government and from the current 
justice minister is tinkering. Tinkering with section 745 and gun 
control which will not be the answer to solving our crime problem 
in Canada.
<P>
	In fact, gun control and registration for long guns was modelled 
on our current handgun registration which has been in place since 
1935. Our handgun registration has not worked. There are as many 
or more crimes being committed with handguns than ever before, 
yet we have a registration system which is supposed to control that. 
Now we have a long gun registration that is supposed to give us 
peace, it is supposed to return us to the times when we had low 
crime rates. It simply is not going to happen. The government is 
going after the wrong people. There is also tinkering with the 
Young Offenders Act.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	This might play in downtown Toronto but I doubt it very much. 
It certainly does not play in my riding. People want this 
government to get tough on the crime problem in Canada. We know 
there is a crime problem.
<P>
	I see some members shaking their heads opposite, some of the 
same members that probably have prisons in their riding, like the 
parliamentary secretary who is yakking over there. He has a prison 
in his Prince Albert-Churchill riding. Perhaps he should go 
through that prison and see what kind of problems there are at the 
Edmonton maximum security prison.
<P>
	Canadians want us to get tough on this whole section of criminal 
justice. They want us to provide some assurances that their families 
can go out on the streets at eleven o'clock at night and feel safe. 
That simply is not the situation now. They want us to toughen up 
the criminal justice system so that they are not subject to break and 
enters in their homes which provide criminals an income for 
substance abuse. Canadians are not going to get it from this 
government obviously, but at some point they are going to get the 
kind of reform that is necessary to clean up Canada's crime 
problem.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to enter the debate on Bill C-45. I wish to ask three questions 
this morning. First, what is the value of a life? Second, what 
message does Bill C-45 send to the Canadian people? Finally, what 
are the Canadian people saying?
<P>
	Not too long ago a young little girl was playing on the street. She 
disappeared. Her name was Mindy Tran. She was found dead. I got 
a phone call about six months ago from a man whom I did not 
know. It was from the employer of Mr. Tran, Mindy's father. He 
said Mr. Tran was afraid to come and talk to me because he was a 
new immigrant to Canada and did not know exactly how to 
approach an elected government member. I told him to bring him 
in. He said: ``He wants me to come within. Is  that okay?'' I said: 
``That is more than okay, please come''. Mr. Tran sat across the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4278"> 4278 </A></B>
<P>
table from me. He said: ``What can we do to make sure that my 
other little girl is not killed like this one was?''
<P>
	It is an extremely difficult situation when the father of a young 
girl comes to a member and asks what the government is doing to 
protect him, his family and his little girl. It is serious when one 
looks at this kind of a question and one has to ask the question: 
What is the value of a life? What is the value of this little girl's life, 
Mindy Tran?
<P>
	Mindy Tran in her death mobilized the community like I have 
never seen a community mobilized. There was not a police officer 
who was not personally stirred in trying to find the person who had 
perpetrated this crime. All kinds of neighbours, relatives, friends 
and the whole community got together to search first of all for the 
body because it was lost. Somehow they could not find it. It took 
days and nights. Twenty-four hours a day there was a search going 
on throughout that community. Finally they did find the body of 
Mindy Tran. The community is still in sorrow over that particular 
incident.
<P>
	I ask the question again: What is the value of that life? 
According to this bill the life is worth 15 years of imprisonment for 
the perpetrator.
<P>
	One can look at the value of a life in economic terms, which is 
what insurance companies do. It is what judges do in determining 
the liability when someone has been killed in an automobile 
accident. The economic value of a key man in a business is 
determined when key man insurance is purchased to replace the 
money that person would provide for that company in order to 
replace them.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	There is an economic value to a person when they take out loan 
insurance, mortgage insurance and things of that sort. Insurance 
companies provide for personal insurance so that the individual 
who is the main breadwinner or the two breadwinners can supply 
food, clothing and shelter to the persons remaining after the death 
has occurred.
<P>
	There is more than an economic value to a life. There is also the 
value of emotion, the feelings that we have, the love that we have 
for one another; parents, one for each other and parents for their 
children, as demonstrated by Mr. Tran and his young daughter who 
was killed. How does one replace that?
<P>
	Yesterday we heard the story of Laurie Boyd and the trauma that 
created in the lives of the parents who had to recall that incident 
when they heard that Bill C-45 said that section 745 was not going 
to be deleted from the Criminal Code because the bill had not been 
allowed to be presented to this House.
<P>
	Mr. Tran is thinking today about the possibility of parole for the 
person who murdered his family member. He says: ``Mr. Schmidt, 
will you allow that to happen?'' I said: ``Mr. Tran, it is not for me to 
decide. I wish I were in that position. I am not''.
<P>
	We have a government in this land that was elected. Its members 
have decided and they are the ones who are responsible. ``But Mr. 
Schmidt, can you not do anything?'' I said to Mr. Tran: ``I will do 
what I can''.
<P>
	He broke down and cried. He said: ``Is that all my daughter's life 
is worth, you will try?'' This is the question I ask every member of 
this House. Is that all Mindy Tran's life is worth, and the other 
person who has been murdered?
<P>
	Parole creates that second trauma again for the indirect victims, 
not the ones who have been killed but the ones who remain who 
have the emotional tie. It is for them that the trauma is repeated.
<P>
	There is another cost to a life, the life to the nation. It destroys 
the talents and takes away the skills and the abilities that person 
would have brought to our society, the untold talents and abilities 
found in these people, especially in the children who have been 
killed. The question we need to ask ourselves is what is suitable 
punishment for that kind of behaviour.
<P>
	It draws me to the second question which is what message does 
Bill C-45 send to our people. What message does it send to other 
criminals? It says there is the hope of relief after 15 years. Really, 
the consequences of first degree murder are really not so great. 
Society paid with a life and now the criminal who did that says that 
society will pay to keep them and eventually release them back into 
society.
<P>
	What is the message that it sends to our young people? It sends 
to them the message that life really is cheap. It is worth 15 years. It 
does not really matter very much what the victim's rights are. It 
does not really matter very much that all the victim's rights, the 
person who was killed, were taken away.
<P>
	Society protects the rights of the person who perpetrated the 
crime. That is protecting, but it does not seem to matter that the 
rights of the person who was killed are destroyed.
<P>
	Therefore the young people can say to themselves: ``I can 
commit almost anything and get away with relative impunity''. 
Where does that kind of thinking end? What does it do to all the 
other crimes that are not as severe as killing another person? It 
ultimately creates disrespect for law and order. The end result of 
that is chaos.
<P>
	If this government or any government has any role to play, it is to 
push back the walls of evil and to prevent evil from taking over in 
our society.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4279"> 4279 </A></B>
<P>
	Finally, what example does it set for our children? If that is how 
we as government officials behave and treat the worst possible 
crime that one person can perpetrate against another with 15 years 
of incarceration, what message is that to our children?
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	I want to ask why does the government not let the people speak. I 
cannot believe the kinds of responses I got from a recent 
householder where I asked: ``What is bugging you about the 
government? What are your concerns about the government, the 
present government?'' The response that came through hundreds 
and hundreds of times was: ``When will you do something with the 
justice system? We do not feel safe in our streets. We do not feel 
safe in our homes. We feel that the time has come for us to do 
something serious about crime in our society''.
<P>
	They came up with some suggestions. They asked why we do not 
conduct a referendum on capital punishment in this country. ``Let 
us tell the government clearly and unequivocally what it is we 
want''.
<P>
	Yesterday morning Parliament stopped Bill C-234 from entering 
the floor of this House. The member for York South-Weston 
understood very very clearly what his people were telling him. He 
listened to them. He presented to this House a private member's 
bill.
<P>
	I support that bill. There are many of our constituents who are 
speaking the same kind of language. I am sure that his constituency 
is not an isolated example. And so I would urge the government to 
bring that bill back. Pass it. That would eliminate section 745 of the 
Criminal Code.
<P>
	We need to recognize that with Bill C-45 we have an indication 
that the government is really not serious, that it is a wimpy, 
snivelling flirtation with what is just and fair. It sends a message 
that is symbolic of justice but which lacks the essence of all that is 
noble, upright and fair. It should not be passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
a pleasure to rise today to speak to this bill. Much of what needed 
to be said has already been said by my caucus members.
<P>
	I am very disappointed that the government side is not entering 
into this debate. This bill is a very high profile bill. It is supposed to 
be one of the jewels in the justice minister's crown, or he would 
like it to be one. Why the Liberals are not entering into this debate 
is a sad commentary on this process.
<P>
	I will start by talking about the process itself, about what we are 
dealing with today, about the amendment to section 745. We should 
not be debating this bill today. What we should be debating in this 
House today is the bill brought forward by the member for York 
South-Weston. It was a private member's initiative  brought 
forward in good faith to the House of Commons, adopted on second 
reading, in other words in principle by this entire House, sent to 
committee and ordered to report back to the House.
<P>
	One of my jobs as party whip is to encourage my members to be 
on committees, to structure our caucus so that all the committee 
work is covered and so on. It is a very disheartening exercise when 
the members of our caucus find their hard work on private 
members' bills, their hard work on committee on amendments, 
their initiatives in committee to bring and raise the profile of 
important issues to the House of Commons are merely deep sixed 
in committee.
<P>
	My heart goes out to the member for York South-Weston on 
this issue. His bill is just one of the very high profile examples. We 
have some in our own caucus. Our member for 
Mission-Coquitlam has had the same thing happen. It is very 
demoralizing and it is a travesty of the democratic process when 
something is passed in this House by members of all parties only to 
be sent to committee where the government used a roundabout way 
to send it off into never-never land. That is a real travesty and 
should never have happened.
<P>
	On this issue, these questions bear repeating. What is the 
purpose of the justice system? What are we trying to accomplish 
with the justice system and the Criminal Code? What messages are 
we sending to the Canadian people? What are we as legislators 
hearing from the Canadian people? How are we reacting to what we 
hear?
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	People are getting hold of me in my office and one of the things 
they are asking me is what is the cost of the proposals of the 
Minister of Justice. How much does it cost to let people like Olson 
and others reintroduce their legal cases in an effort to get early 
parole? We do not know. cost. There is a royal recommendation in 
the bill, but we do not know the cost. I do not think the minister 
knows the cost. However, it is a significant cost.
<P>
	It sends the message to the victims of crime that yes, these 
murderers are going to get legal help and all the help available 
through the system. The victims do not get any help. If they want 
they can make a presentation at the hearing, but they do not get any 
help. There is an actual financial cost involved, let alone the cost to 
the victims.
<P>
	Many people are coming to me and saying they thought that 
what Parliament passed in the seventies when it did away with 
capital punishment meant that somebody who was sentenced to 25 
years imprisonment without parole would serve at least 25 years. 
Parliament was sending a message to the Canadian people and to 
the world that Canada placed a high value on human life and would 
not trade a life off for anything less than 25 years. Many people 
would argue that it should be a life for a life, that there should be a 
death penalty. Many people  said: ``I will accept 25 years without 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4280"> 4280 </A></B>
<P>
parole if you can guarantee me that is where that man or woman is 
going to stay''.
<P>
	The statistics are very sad. The statistics are that about 78 per 
cent of the people who apply for early parole are successful. 
Canadians are none too pleased with that. They are none too 
pleased that this bill will continue to allow all the backlog of 
deviants and multiple murderers to continue to apply. It is not 
retroactive. These people will continue to apply for early parole. 
They will continue to drag the victims through the mire of reliving 
the horror. The bill will not eliminate that. It will make it a bit 
tougher, but it will continue.
<P>
	What are Canadians demanding? I will give the House two 
examples. In the next little while I will be presenting in the House a 
petition initiated by some people in my riding. It has to do with a 
criminal who is currently in the prison system. This man is a sexual 
deviant who has been convicted of pedophilia. He has ruined many 
a life. These constituents came forward with a whole series of 
requests. They want a national registry for sexual pedophiles. They 
want no chance of parole for people who have been convicted of 
violent sexual crimes. They want many things.
<P>
	What is most telling about this is that they are not struggling to 
get a few names on a petition. It is not them and the family trying to 
get together to gather 40 or 50 names on a petition. So far there are 
15,000 names on the petition and more names continue to be 
mailed into my office on a daily basis.
<P>
	I wonder if the government is listening to this. This is just one 
example in one riding of the depth of feeling on the issue of 
criminal justice reform. They are saying that serious crimes 
deserve to be treated very seriously in order to send a message both 
ways, to the criminal element and to the victims of crime. The 
message will tell the victims that yes, they are important and that 
yes, their situation takes priority and that the government will 
ensure they receive adequate redress.
<P>
	One of the reasons my colleague from Fraser Valley West has 
brought forward his victim's bill of rights is that the victims need to 
have the protection which they do not have today.
<P>
	That is the big picture. That is the picture of 15,000 names. That 
is just one example.
<P>
<B>(1145 )</B>
<P>
	We have heard many examples and I would like to give a 
personal example. I had a father and daughter come to my office in 
my riding with concerns about the criminal justice system. The 
daughter had been abducted and stabbed repeatedly by her 
estranged husband. There was a restraining order against the 
husband, he was known to the police, he had threatened violence 
and had stalked this woman for some months.
<P>
	I bring this up as an example because the father sat in my office 
and said: ``What am I supposed to do when the criminal justice 
system does not treat this case seriously? This man attacked my 
daughter, stabbed her repeatedly and was charged with aggravated 
assault and did a couple of years in jail. What am I supposed to 
do?''
<P>
	The man would come and tap on the lady's window with a 
butcher knife to wake her up. The father said: ``Mr. Strahl, mark 
my words. I will tell you what I am going to do when this animal 
gets out of prison. When that guy gets out and taps on my 
daughter's window with a butcher knife I am going to blow his 
head off because the criminal justice system will not deal with it''. 
The justice system peddles away these serious charges and says to 
get a restraining order. It is not good enough to say get a restraining 
order. This woman lives her life in terror and this guy is out on the 
streets again.
<P>
	Here is the irony. I said: ``If you do that to protect your daughter, 
you will do 25 years in jail because that is premeditated. The gun 
was out and you shot the guy''. He said: ``Chuck, I do not care. 
What am I supposed to do if the criminal justice system will not 
protect my family? I will have to do it myself. I do not want to do it 
myself. I wish you would do something different''.
<P>
	That shows the frustration in the country over these kinds of 
cases where serious crime is not treated seriously. There is no more 
serious crime than murder. The message is not can we rehabilitate 
criminals. The message is not is some guy sorry he did it. I am sure 
many murderers are sorry that they committed the crimes 
afterward. The message we need to send that is not being sent by 
this bill is that murder is a serious offence. It is 25 years in jail at 
least.
<P>
	The Reform Party said there should be a national referendum on 
capital punishment. We will leave that for another day. Today, be 
assured that a crime like murder is going to get you in jail and you 
are not getting out for 25 years. This bill does not do that. This bill 
should have done that. We should have been dealing with the 
elimination of section 745, not tinkering.
<P>
	I am disappointed. I wish the government and the minister could 
sit in my office and listen to the people that tell me the truth about 
what is going on. They want changes and they want them now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to the have the opportunity to speak in Parliament about 
such an important issue but in a sense it is a very sad day because 
we have to witness again the Liberal government not dealing with 
the issue. The Liberals have spent three years with a platform of 
doing nothing and that is not good enough in dealing with the 
problems of Canada.
<P>
	Today we have the opportunity to show that we are going to be 
tough on those who take the life of someone else. We have people 
charged with first degree murder,  given a 25 year sentence and the 
Liberal government wants to rehabilitate, to be soft, to be kind and 
to allow them to go free after 15 years. That is unacceptable and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4281"> 4281 </A></B>
<P>
disgusting in the least. It should not exist that way in our country. 
When someone takes a life and the courts have proved that has 
happened, that person should serve at least 25 years in prison. 
Never mind waiting until they take two lives to serve 25 years.
<P>
<B>(1150 )</B>
<P>
	Many of my constituents say that is still too lenient and that we 
should have brought back capital punishment. They believe those 
who take a life should lose their life. It may happen one of these 
days but it will not be under a Liberal government. It will never call 
for a referendum on capital punishment because it knows that 
Canadians, with at least an 80 per cent majority, would come out in 
droves to vote on this issue. Eighty per cent of Canadians would 
support capital punishment for any murderer.
<P>
	The government does not want to do anything. It is too lenient. It 
does not want to accept its responsibilities.
<P>
	We should look at some of the statistics. Statistics from 1994-95 
and 1995-96 have proven that one out of ten parolees, and now 
murderers who will be allowed out on parole after 15 years, 
reoffend in a very serious way. This means that 10 per cent of 
parolees go out and again commit very serious crimes.
<P>
	I would like to look at this Liberal record of parole since they 
came back into power. I am sure this was the same under the old 
Tory Party which was equally as bad. However, because the Tories 
and the Liberals always had this friendly relationship in the House 
where one covered for the other, the general public did not know 
how bad our justice system was. They really did not know how bad 
the defence system was, which is unbelievable. Finally, as a 
Reform Party, we are getting that up on the table for the public to 
look at.
<P>
	Let us look at the Liberal record from Statistics Canada. About 
one in ten federal prisoners released on parole last year was 
charged with a new crime. The numbers were about the same for 
1994-95. In 1995, 984 parolees were charged, including 165 violent 
offences such as 15 murders, 22 sexual assaults and 71 armed 
robberies by those people who were in the justice system. The 
Liberal government lets them out to corrupt and offend in our 
communities.
<P>
	It was just as bad in 1994-95. There were 1,097 parolees 
charged. That is 10 per cent of them, including 256 violent 
offenders who again committed murder, sexual assault and armed 
robbery.
<P>
	Today we are going to be lenient again. The only way we can 
stop these murderers and send a message is to to really be tough. 
Twenty-five years is not tough enough in my opinion and in the 
opinion of many Canadians, but if that is the way it is today then we 
should stick to the 25 years. However, the legislation that is before 
us does not  do that. It sort of states that maybe they will try to do 
that in a back-handed way but one has to kill two people first in 
order to receive an automatic 25 years. That is about as ridiculous 
as it comes.
<P>
	I would like to talk about a personal experience in my 
constituency when I was a member of the legislature and a 
representative of an area south of Calgary. This deals with Darlene 
Boyd's daughter. It deals with another young lady from the 
community of High River, a lady who was at a social function in 
Calgary. While driving home to High River she ran out of gas. One 
of my constituents, who happens to be the murderer and is in jail at 
the present time with a 25 year sentence, now comes up for the 
opportunity of parole in February 1997. Luckily for the 
government, he murdered two people so he is not going to get the 
opportunity to have a parole just by having this legislation put in. 
However, if he had only murdered one person he would have had 
the right to parole. He would have had kindness, the opportunity for 
rehabilitation, education and put back into the community as an 
upstanding citizen through Liberal programs. That is the way it 
would have been.
<P>
	However, this lady who was driving home ran out of gas. A car 
driven by this individual from my community and his buddy from 
Calgary stopped to help her. What did they do? They grabbed her 
and threw her into their van. They drove off into fields about five or 
six miles away where she was raped, brutally beaten and killed. 
After they beat her with a tire wrench they threw her out of the van 
and then burned her body so that there would not be any evidence.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	Two or three months later at the Red Rooster in High River, 
Darlene Boyd's daughter, a lovely young lady with a future who 
had something to contribute to the community became the target of 
these two same individuals. They decided they needed another 
victim. They entered by the back door of the Red Rooster, took her 
at knife point into the van, drove about 12 miles east of High River 
into the Blackie area, stopped the van, raped and beat her with a tire 
iron. She tried to get out the van but she was killed in the field. 
They threw gasoline on her and burned this young lady. This Jim 
Peters could possibly have come up for parole, but he had killed 
two people, luckily for the government.
<P>
	There are sad situations which continue to take place. I would 
like to add a little more to that story. Once or twice a year I visit all 
the communities in my constituency, spending half a day or a day. I 
happened to be the community of Blackie which is only a few miles 
out of High River.
<P>
	When I arrived in town I stopped to speak to some friends who 
owned a store there. I was told: ``I would like to come to your 
meeting today, Ray, but I am scared to leave my wife in the store 
because there is a killer out there somewhere''. We visited for a 
while and then I  went over to the hotel which was right next door 
to have dinner. It is a small hotel restaurant about 18 feet by 18 feet. 
I visited with everyone in the restaurant and we talked. And guess 
who was sitting at one of the tables having dinner? The killer, the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4282"> 4282 </A></B>
<P>
murderer, Jim Peters. But we did not know that. My friend had a 
right to be afraid.
<P>
	We held a very short meeting in the town hall and everybody 
said: ``I have to go home and protect my family''. The tension and 
concern in that community was unbelievable.
<P>
	As legislators the Liberal government has done nothing since 
1993. Once again it is not dealing with the problem. It has a head in 
the sand approach. That is unacceptable to Canadians. I do not 
know when it is going to change. Maybe we have to have an 
election and get rid of the Liberals like we got rid of the Tory party. 
The only lesson the Tory party learned was that if you do not 
smarten up and do your job the people are going to turf you out.
<P>
	Well, the worm can turn for the charade that is taking place 
across the floor, this facade of a Liberal government. I would think 
that in the late part of 1996 or early 1997 the worm will turn and 
Canadians will begin to judge the incompetence of the government. 
When it does and the government changes, maybe there will be 
common sense policies in the country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the very first words I said in the House after the last 
election when most of us were rookies here in the House, were to 
the member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, who has been in the House 
longer than virtually anybody here today. I spoke at that time about 
the culture of the government at that time which led to the 
laissez-faire attitude we have had for the last 30 years or so with 
criminals.
<P>
	Some members will recall that October 7, 1972 was a pivotal day 
for jurisprudence because on that date the then solicitor general 
stood in the House and said that from that day forward the primary 
raison d'etre of the criminal justice system would be the 
rehabilitation of prisoners.
<P>
<B>(1200 )</B>
<P>
	He said this and this became the raison d'être because the 
recidivism rate was so high. He thought that if the road we have 
been going down all these years has not worked, then perhaps we 
should try something different, so let us make our raison d'être, 
rather than the protection of society, rather than a punishment of 
wrongdoing, rehabilitation. There is nothing wrong with that ideal. 
It is a noble ideal.
<P>
	In any event, I had some words to say about that. I attributed 
some words to the hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce who 
was sitting opposite. I noticed the look in his eyes. I knew I had 
misjudged the situation.
<P>
	At the first opportunity I apologized to the member opposite 
because I was wrong. I have over the last couple of years 
engendered a good deal of respect for the member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, the member who introduced the so-called 
faint hope clause to the House. I know he did so because his heart is 
in the right place. The problem is that in my respectful opinion 
sometimes we need to use a soft heart and a hard head. Sometimes 
it is absolutely essential that people in our society know that there 
is a line beyond which it is not appropriate to cross.
<P>
	I mention this because it is important to know to put the 
introduction of this law into the context of the time. Laws need to 
be adjusted to suit the temper of the time. In the context of the time 
we as a nation and most of the western world were experiencing a 
flower of magnanimity to one another, one to another. In the 
context of the time we got rid of capital punishment.
<P>
	How can a civilized society be more civilized by perpetrating a 
barbaric act of murder, killing someone else, in order to justify its 
existence? I am now a proponent of capital punishment and I would 
not be if life meant life. The quid pro quo for our country to get rid 
of capital punishment was a 25 year sentence for first degree 
murder. It was a life sentence, minimum 25 years. That was the 
quid pro quo. That was what the government of the day used to sell 
the notion of getting rid of capital punishment.
<P>
	That brings us to 25 years or so after the fact. As the member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce said yesterday, it is merely a faint hope 
clause. Very few people take advantage of it. Fifty people have 
taken advantage of it, 50 of 175 or so people eligible to take 
advantage of it. That is one-third. Two-thirds of the people who 
have applied for it have been successful
<P>
	The point is not how many are successful and how many apply. 
The point is that when someone takes the life of another person and 
it is deemed to be a first degree offence, premeditated murder, the 
sanction that our country has prescribed and the sanction that the 
social contract we as citizens of our country have prescribed is a 
life sentence, not 15 years. Whether a person in that first 15 years 
of incarceration has seen the error of their ways is not the question.
<P>
	The point is that we made a bargain. We were not going to take a 
murderer's live, even a first degree murderer's life, as a society. 
What we were going to do is to put them away so they cannot harm 
anybody ever again in the future.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	That was a social contract. We are abrogating that social contract 
when we slide in the so-called faint hope clause. That brings us to 
the duplicity of this argument today, which is this.
<P>
	By taking the bill of the member for York South-Weston, which 
would abolish section 745 from  the table and insert a lame duck 
replacement, it has put the Reform Party and others on the Liberal 
benches who would have voted in favour of that bill in the position 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4283"> 4283 </A></B>
<P>
that they cannot find themselves in. It is wrong to vote for this half 
measure while at the same time it allows Liberals on the other side 
to vote in favour of the measure that they would not have been able 
to vote in favour of because they do not want to change it.
<P>
	Altogether, the removal of the member from York 
South-Weston's private member's bill, which would abolish 
section 745, which should say life means life, and inserting this 
other bill which really does not accomplish anything is window 
dressing. It is fluff. It begs the question why is it okay to kill one 
person while it is not okay to kill two persons. It does not make any 
sense, none whatsoever.
<P>
	My angst of this bill is two-fold. First, we have abrogated our 
responsibility, the deal we made when we said life means life in 
place of capital punishment. At the same time, we have taken a 
private member's bill which dealt squarely and honestly with the 
issue off the table and inserted in its place a half measure which is 
nothing less than duplicitous and not worthy of this House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, this 
debate is a very interesting one because Canadians must be 
wondering why in the world this government, with the demand that 
there is on the part of rational, reasonable, thoughtful Canadians, 
would be coming forth with this half measure.
<P>
	They must be wondering what is on the mind of the justice 
minister, indeed what is on the mind of the Liberal members of this 
House.
<P>
	What we are talking about here are people who are incarcerated 
as a result of first degree murder. This is not something that 
happens. This is not just an event that took place. First degree 
murder is the premeditated, cold blooded taking of a life. When we 
give them a 25 year sentence, we give the victim's families and 
friends an opportunity perhaps to put small bits and pieces of their 
lives back together over that 25 year period.
<P>
	The Liberals consistently refuse to acknowledge that in the 
equation when a life has been taken, indeed there are family, 
friends and communities that grieve over that life that is taken.
<P>
	All of us in this House as individuals have been hit with some 
form of personal tragedy, whether it is the passing of our parents, 
the tragic accident involving our children or something of that 
nature. There is a tremendous amount of pressure that comes into 
our lives individually at that time.
<P>
	It is beyond comprehension that this justice minister, this Prime 
Minister and indeed the Liberal members would not realize there 
has to be a time of healing for the people, for the victims' families, 
for the victims' friends, for the victims' community.
<P>
	I ask myself why would the justice minister, why would the 
Liberals respond in this way? Why would they come forward with 
these half measures?
<P>
	Clearly it must be as a response to the bleeding hearts. It must be 
as a response to those who say we should let these people get on 
with their lives. It would be nice if the victims could get on with 
their lives.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	I reflect the remarks of my colleague who preceded me in asking 
why are there no Liberal speakers. Why are there no Liberal 
speakers defending this weak-kneed, half measure by the justice 
minister? I suggest the reason is that they want to be able to stand 
up and say: ``We supported the hon. member for York 
South-Weston. We supported his measure to repeal section 745''.
<P>
	Let it be very clear that any such claim is nothing more than a lie. 
The Liberal members of the House, in supporting this half measure, 
are in no way reflecting the views, the wishes, the desires, the 
attitudes and the direction in which the people of Canada want to 
go on this particular issue.
<P>
	If we ultimately take away a 25 year sentence for a premeditated, 
cold blooded murder, what is the ultimate standard in our society 
for people who take the lives of others?
<P>
	Section 745 still exists. The justice minister is simply trying to 
sugar coat it. Nothing less than the full elimination of this section 
will be acceptable to the people of Canada. Ninety-eight per cent of 
the delegates to the Reform convention voted for the full 
elimination of section 745. Victims of Violence, the Canadian 
Police Association and the majority of Canadians support the 
elimination of section 745.
<P>
	If we as members of Parliament are not reflecting the views, the 
wishes, the desires, the determinations and the direction in which 
the people of Canada want to go, what are we doing here? We are 
not just here to fill seats. We are not just here to follow the Liberal 
bleeding heart agenda. We are supposed to be here to respect and 
respond to the wishes and the desires of the people of Canada. This 
bill in no way does that.
<P>
	Bill C-45 still provides a glimmer of hope for murderers to get 
early release before serving a full sentence without the eligibility of 
parole for 25 years. As I mentioned, what we are really talking 
about here is the issue of the families and the friends of the victims 
of people who determined they were going to take another person's 
life in a fully premeditated manner. That is the ultimate in what we 
can do to another human being.
<P>
	I wonder how many of the victims were provided with a glimmer 
of hope, the glimmer of hope that the bleeding heart Liberals want 
to give to the murderers.
<P>
	It has been mentioned many times but I must say it again. Why is 
it that we can take away the possibility of  appeal if a person has 
murdered two or more people in a premeditated manner whereas 
we will not for only one murder? Is this a bargain sale on lives? 
Where is the thought process of the minister and the Liberals in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4284"> 4284 </A></B>
<P>
House? I do not understand why the justice minister, for example, 
has not simply gone to a system of seeing to it that murderers are 
given consecutive life sentences. That would simplify the whole 
matter. By going to consecutive life sentences Clifford Olson 
would have received 11 times 25 years and he would not be in a 
position to go after the victims' families again after only 15 years 
of trying to put their lives back together.
<P>
<B>(1215 )</B>
<P>
	It has already been stated that the 1976 Liberal government was 
responsible for the elimination of capital punishment and the 
creation of section 745. And so we have gone back to the future. 
We have gone back 20 years to a time when the Liberals really 
believed this was going to work. I believe we have to go to the 
victims' families. We have to ask the victims' families if this has 
worked.
<P>
	Our party, under the capable direction of the member for Fraser 
Valley West on this issue, has had this House agree to a motion that 
there should be a victims bill of rights. In all reality I do not believe 
we are ever going to see that. As long as this government continues 
to hold down its members and say ``yes you will vote this way'', 
and as long as this government is driven by its particular agenda, I 
do not believe we are ever going to see a victims bill of rights.
<P>
	What about the future? What hope is there? On this issue, I read 
the following into the record on May 9, 1994: ``Last weekend on 
Saturday I, along with about 350 other people in my constituency, 
attended the funeral of eight-year old Stephanie Graves who was 
attacked and shot in the Kimberley area''. I read the following 
poem about her. It was read at her funeral by her class:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I like your eyes<BR>
I like your nose<BR>
I like your mouth, your ears, your hands, your toes.<BR>
I like your face<BR>
It's really you<BR>
I like the things you say and do.<BR>
There's not a single soul<BR>
who sees the skies<BR>
The way you see them, through your eyes<BR>
And aren't you glad?<BR>
You should be glad<BR>
There's no one, no one exactly like you.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is for the victims like Stephanie Graves and their families that 
we stand on this issue and say the weak-kneed Liberal approach is 
inadequate and will not cut it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Minister for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities 
Agency and Minister of Western Economic Diversification, 
Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it has been very interesting listening to the 
comments of the Reform Party which talks about our being 
bleeding heart Liberals and being soft on crime. Yet when we 
introduced legislation on the Young Offenders Act to  increase 
sentences for young offenders in the commission of offences such 
as murder, to allow young offenders who were 16 and 17 years old 
to be more readily tried in adult court, it was the Reform Party that 
voted against this legislation.
<P>
	We are the ones who have been tightening up the criminal justice 
system. We have been getting tougher in areas in the criminal 
justice system. It is the Reform Party that speaks loudly on 
improving the criminal justice system and then weakens and votes 
against such legislation. That is the Reform Party. Reformers say 
one thing and they do another thing.
<P>
	They did the same thing with the sentencing legislation. When 
we introduced sentencing legislation to make it tougher on 
criminals who voted against it? The Reformers, who else? They say 
one thing, they do something else. That is the Reform Party.
<P>
	The Reform Party is now saying to get rid of section 745 so that a 
person cannot make an application for parole before 25 years. It 
must be remembered that it is an application to be made after 25 
years. It does not mean the person is eligible for parole at that time. 
It is the same thing with 15 years. If a person were eligible after 15 
years, it means eligible after 15. It does not mean the person will be 
paroled after 15.
<P>
	I am surprised the Reform Party takes that approach. This is an 
approach which I think is reasonable. It is reasonable that there is 
discretion in the justice system to deal with people on a different 
basis when they have different backgrounds. I am extremely 
disappointed that the Reform Party does not see that in particular 
cases.
<P>
<B>(1220 )</B>
<P>
	I will give an example of a case which is before the courts on a 
different matter, the Latimer case. It is surprising that the Reform 
Party would not suggest that maybe judges should have the 
discretion to impose a lower period of time before eligibility for 
parole. Then maybe the Reform Party should be suggesting that in 
cases like Bernardo there should be a provision that judges have the 
discretion that people like him should not be eligible for parole for 
75 or 150 years, but the Reform Party is not suggesting this. This 
should be step two. This is what should be looked at.
<P>
	I hear the issue of consecutive sentences being raised by the hon. 
member who just spoke. A life sentence is a life sentence. A life 
consecutive to life does not make sense. It is either life or it is not 
life. The question is on parole eligibility and that is where the 
judges should have the discretion at the time of sentencing to 
increase parole eligibility. However it is a matter that has to be 
looked at at some other time when discussing all the terms of 
eligibility on such offences.
<P>
	It is a matter that can be looked at but unfortunately the Reform 
Party does not look that far ahead. Instead members of the Reform 
Party concentrate and say that  first degree murder is premeditated 
murder. Yes it is in some circumstances but unfortunately they have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4285"> 4285 </A></B>
<P>
not read the Criminal Code because it can be first degree murder 
without premeditation.
<P>
	Members of the Reform Party should read the Criminal Code 
because they are misrepresenting to the public when they say that 
first degree is only premeditated and they are wrong on that point. 
That is a misrepresentation Reform members have undertaken in 
this House day in and day out on this particular point. That is the 
problem with members of the Reform Party. All they have to do is 
open up the Criminal Code, read the definition of first degree 
murder, it is there, but they will not do that. The members of the 
Reform Party will not do that. It is beyond them. Perhaps we should 
supply them with a copy of the Criminal Code.
<P>
	The Reform Party prefers to bluster along in this House on first 
degree murder without reading the code because some knowledge 
on this particular point may be dangerous to them. That is the 
problem we have.
<P>
	In dealing with parole eligibility there have been different 
figures raised. One member from the Reform Party has said there is 
a 10 per cent rate of recidivism for parolees. Why not look at the 
opposite? I am not necessarily accepting these figures because I 
prefer to check them out. When Reformers give numbers, I do not 
take them as the gospel truth; I prefer to have them checked.
<P>
	If we accept the Reform figures, that means there is a 90 per cent 
success rate of parolees. Why do we not look at that? A 90 per cent 
success rate is very good in many disciplines but no, that is not 
good enough. Reformers prefer not to look at that particular aspect. 
They do not want to look at that aspect at all.
<P>
	Again I suggest the members of the Reform Party are 
misrepresenting the aspect of the 15 year eligibility. If a person is 
eligible for application after 15 years and gets it reduced to, let us 
say 17 or 19 years, it does not mean the person is going to be 
paroled at that time. The parole board still has to deal with the 
matter.
<P>
	As the Reform member should very well know, since coming to 
power in 1993 the Liberals have tightened up on the appointees to 
parole boards. They are the most qualified people that can be 
appointed. The parole board is very good with these members. 
Reformers have to have some faith in the members on the parole 
board. They are good members who take their jobs seriously and 
who will deal with these matters seriously.
<P>
	When an application is made after 15 years under section 745, 
the application is not to a judge. The application is not to a member 
of the legal profession. Thank God the application is not to a 
member of the Reform Party. The application is to the community 
where the offence was committed. It is members from that 
community who determine whether that person's  parole eligibility 
period will be reduced. It is members of the community.
<P>
<B>(1225 )</B>
<P>
	Here we have the Reform Party which claims it represents the 
community saying that they do not want members of the 
community to determine whether parole eligibility is reduced. 
They want to take this power away from members of the 
community. I am very surprised. A party that claims to be a 
grassroots party is saying: ``Don't allow the grassroots of the 
community to make this decision''. It is a very interesting position 
by the Reform Party. Again, they speak one thing and they do 
something else.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am very pleased to participate in this debate because I 
represent the constituents of Surrey North and we have been 
plagued with a number of violent crimes involving mass 
murderers. Clifford Olson was one that haunted our neighbourhood 
as well. It is very fortunate that I have this opportunity to express 
my point of view.
<P>
	The previous speaker made reference to the fact of our inability 
to read the Criminal Code, but he on the other hand pointed out that 
in this particular bill the application is not made to a judge but to 
the community. If he would like to read section 745(1) he will find 
that it is indeed made to a chief justice.
<P>
	Another point that the previous speaker made was in relation to 
the Bernardo case and allowing the judges to have some flexibility 
in the sentencing from the point of view of whether or not to grant 
parole. My understanding in reading this bill would be that 
regardless of what a judge would say at that particular time, he 
could say no parole, but 15 or 25 years later, whatever the magic 
number is, another procedure would occur in which that person 
could make application for eligibility which means the previous 
judge's decision could be overruled. I do not know if that is the 
answer or not.
<P>
	There are two points I would like to make in relation to this bill. 
One is the content itself. That would relate to the fact that it is 
designed to set up some sort of a screening process in which it 
would not allow everyone the opportunity to make application for 
parole and that would be heard. It might reduce some of the time 
the courts have to spend on this as well. With the mechanism for 
the screening process that is set up, I tend to think there may be 
undue influence on the jury or the subsequent aspects of the 
process.
<P>
	Basically what seems to be happening is a prisoner will make 
application to a chief justice who will look at that individual's 
situation. I believe that clause 1(2) contains the kinds of things the 
judge will look at. It would include the number of years of 
imprisonment without eligibility for parole, his conduct while 
serving the sentence, the character of the applicant and the nature 
of the offence.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4286"> 4286 </A></B>
<P>
	It would be logical to assume that as we have had a heavy 
emphasis on rehabilitation in the prison system for the last 20 
years, a criteria that might be written into the act as well is his 
participation in rehabilitation programs and his progress in those 
same programs. I am deviating a little bit.
<P>
	My point here is that the judge is looking at that criteria in 
relation to the application to decide whether or not the application 
can proceed to a designated judge in a province and a jury and the 
case be made for parole. I suggest that only those cases the judge in 
his wisdom thinks may get parole would actually go into the 
process of being assessed for parole. All others would not.
<P>
<B>(1230 )</B>
<P>
	One of the arguments used for not having victim impact 
statements in court was that it could influence the jury. I argue that 
this is the same principle. A learned person in law has moved 
certain cases forward. I would tend to think that a layman type jury 
could be influenced that indeed these people would be eligible for 
parole. On the other hand they may not but there is a possibility that 
would happen. Therefore, I believe there may be undue influence 
by using this method of screening.
<P>
	Another point which should be made concerns the discussion we 
had on section 745 a year ago. At that time there were some token 
changes. The debate at that time described the fact that we felt 
these were half-way measures or token changes. Here we are again 
looking at the same thing and taking it one step further.
<P>
	I tend to question why we have to go back to a similar sort of 
issue. Two reasons occur in my mind. One is that the government 
was not prepared to deal with the situation in its entirety a year ago, 
to address the problem and put it to bed. The other may be that we 
are witnessing some sort of phase-in by the government of some 
kind of activity that is not necessarily popular to the masses.
<P>
	I suggest that when we, as citizens, elect a government we expect 
it to lead and that leadership should be directed at preserving the 
society to which the majority of the citizens have agreed. I do not 
really think the government is aware that the majority of citizens 
do not agree with this step in the process. We cannot have this kind 
of step. It has to be an either-or. Either we have this application that 
we go directly to a jury or we do not have it at all.
<P>
	Our position is that we do not have it at all. Let us stick with that 
first judge and jury that assessed those people and made the 
decision that they were going to go to jail for 15 years. It also 
provides a sense of leadership to the citizens that they cannot play 
around with the system and take chances. They must think about 
their actions before they do them because they will be responsible. 
If a person kills someone it will be 25 years in jail, no ifs, ands or 
buts. That might deter a few  people. We have those who it will not 
but I am certain our percentages would drop down.
<P>
	Right now it is almost like a game of roulette. One takes a 
chance, gets a good lawyer and might get off.
<P>
	We are defeating a number of principles when we bring in this 
screening process. There is no half-way measure but that seems to 
be the trend that we have experienced in the last three years. We do 
not seem to get to the solution. We only get half-way there. In some 
cases we do not even get half way there. We then bring it up again.
<P>
	I would like to suggest that it is possibly coming up again 
because after it came up a year ago the government realized that the 
move it made then was certainly not one that the Canadian public 
was happy about. I do not know whether we are trying to correct 
that now or whether we are witnessing an attempt to phase in 
something over a period of time that the Canadian people do not 
want. However, if we spread the time out far enough they will not 
even notice. It will come in very insidiously and suddenly it is 
there.
<P>
	I have a lot of problems with this. The screening mechanism 
used from a control point of view or as some sort of an evaluation, 
time saving or whatever the rationale is for it, will not achieve what 
it is designed to achieve. Basically what will happen is that a judge 
somewhere, who is looking in depth into this application for a 
presence in front of a judge and jury, will be duplication. What the 
judge goes over, the jury will also go over. I strongly suggest that 
instead of screening it will intimidate or influence the jury based on 
the fact that the judge has some knowledge in the area we are 
dealing with.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	Comment has been made about faint hope for prisoners 
sentenced to 25 years that something can happen in 15. By allowing 
parole it is faint hope for victims and their families that justice will 
be carried out.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I wish I could say I was pleased to participate in this 
debate on Bill C-45. However, I cannot say that. Rather we should 
be debating the private members' bill of the member for York 
South-Weston, which called for the repeal of section 745 of the 
Criminal Code.
<P>
	Bill C-45 is yet another half-hearted Liberal justice reform. A 
moment ago the member for Saskatoon-Dundurn, one of the few 
members of the governing party to debate the issue, said that 
Reform was being unrealistic, was being too severe in dealing with 
crime. I would debate that matter with him. I wish more of his 
colleagues were here to justify their reasons for this bill. I would 
point out that when the private members' bill of the member for 
York South-Weston was at second reading in the House, 74 
members from the Liberal Party voted for that bill, which would 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4287"> 4287 </A></B>
<P>
indicate  there are many people on the other side of the House who 
do not support Bill C-45.
<P>
	Another example of the half-hearted measures that the 
government is taking is its so-called revamp of the Young 
Offenders Act. We attempted to put real teeth and real meaning into 
those amendments and the government refused.
<P>
	I refer to an incident in Toronto not long ago where four 
youngsters took a 13-year old girl into an apartment and raped her. 
The leader was an 11-year old boy who simply laughed at the 
police, at the justice system and at the Young Offenders Act when 
he was called to account for the crime.
<P>
	Two older boys were given sentences of two or three years. But 
all that was done to the young fellow who led this enterprise was 
for the judge to call him a blatant liar. I am sure the young fellow 
laughed all the way home at that one.
<P>
	Another case occurred in my riding in the town of Sidney on 
Vancouver Island. A young teenager was pulled off his bicycle, 
knocked to the ground and kicked to death against the curb by two 
juvenile offenders. In its wisdom the court raised their crime to 
adult court. After they were found guilty the sentence was two 
years. Is this really indicative of justice? A youngster was dead at 
the age of 17 and his murderers get two years? I question the 
validity of this type of justice.
<P>
	My colleague from Surrey-White Rock-South Langley 
mentioned that at the time the death sentence was abolished and the 
25-year parole eligibility was debated, undoubtedly there were 
strong feelings on both sides that 25 years was not enough to pay 
for deliberately taking a life, for first degree murder.
<P>
<B>(1240 )</B>
<P>
	I will confess right now that I am not for the death penalty. I feel 
there is too much chance of a mistake being made and an innocent 
life being taken. However, I would advocate that a life sentence 
means life. The remainder of that individual's life should be served 
in prison. If he or she should subsequently be proved to be 
innocent, then he or she is still there to be released. If that proof 
does not come forward, then the individual should spend the 
remainder of his or her natural life in prison.
<P>
	Right now of course we have the provision of statutory release, 
which sees criminals sentenced to 10 years who are eligible for 
parole in far less time. If we add good behaviour to that, the 
individual will quite often spend less than half of his or her 
sentence in jail.
<P>
	I would agree that there are non-violent crimes for which a 
prison sentence is not only expensive for society but inappropriate 
because these are not dangerous people who will hurt other people. 
However, when we get into the dangerous offender category we 
have to be very  certain that they and anyone who would 
contemplate carrying out a violent crime are aware that the 
consequences, if they are convicted, will be severe.
<P>
	The problem is that the murdered person has a true life sentence. 
There is no recourse, no compensation, no nothing. That person is 
gone for life. That life has been given up. The person who took that 
life should also bear that punishment. The murderer should be 
incarcerated for the rest of his or her natural life in payment for the 
crime.
<P>
	What about the families of the victims? This is particularly 
appropriate for this section which allows a first degree murderer to 
apply for parole after only 15 years. Those families have gone 
through hell at the loss of their loved ones. They have suffered the 
trauma of having to identify the body, of having to hear the gory 
details of how their loved one died. Then, as they gradually accept 
the inevitability of what has happened and make accommodations 
for their loss, a short 15 years downstream they have to go through 
the whole thing again.
<P>
	What we need to do in punishing murderers, first degree 
murderers in particular, is to go to consecutive sentencing, not 
concurrent sentencing. Why on earth should an individual like 
Clifford Olson, who was convicted of killing 11 youngsters, get one 
life sentence when he should have received 11 life sentences for his 
crimes? How can we condone that?
<P>
	I would say the same about Paul Bernardo. He was an individual 
who manipulated, tortured and cruelly murdered two young ladies 
and perhaps more. He got one life sentence. He will be eligible for 
parole in 15 years because of this legislation, if it passes, which in 
all likelihood it will due to the government's massive majority.
<P>
	The hon. member for Saskatoon-Dundurn took issue with my 
colleague's statement about the recidivism rate: 10 per cent and 90 
per cent. Ten per cent reoffend and 90 per cent do not. My concern 
is not so much for the murderer, but rather the potential victims. Is 
a 10 per cent risk acceptable? These people have proven that they 
will go to the extreme of deliberately taking another person's life. 
Should their incarceration not take precedence over the danger they 
present to an unknown victim on their release?
<P>
	In the summer of 1987 convicted murderer Daniel Gingras, 
while on a temporary day pass from an Edmonton institution, killed 
two people before being apprehended.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	Again in 1988, Joseph Fredericks, a convicted sadistic 
paedophile, while on parole abducted, raped and fatally stabbed a 
young 11-year old boy in southern Ontario.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4288"> 4288 </A></B>
<P>
	Bill C-45 should not be passed and section 745 should be 
abolished.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, when I was 
thinking about what I might say today in the House with my 
intervention, I thought I could talk about the specifics of the bill 
before us. There is lots to talk about there.
<P>
	I thought I might even delve into some of the failures of this 
government over the last 15 or 20 years with respect to the criminal 
justice system. I thought I would start by asking this House some 
questions on behalf of constituents in Skeena.
<P>
	During the last election when I was running for office, I 
encountered a lady living in Smithers whose daughter had been 
tracked across British Columbia by her former boyfriend and 
brutally stabbed to death.
<P>
	This lady's other daughters have lost a sister, a very valuable 
member of their family. That cannot be undone. What happened to 
the fellow who did this? I will tell members what happened to him. 
He ended up spending a couple of years in jail prior to his going to 
court. He was found guilty and he was sentenced to 10 years.
<P>
	We know that with the way the parole system works, he might be 
eligible for parole right now. This murder took place in 1991 or 
1992 if my memory serves me right. What do I tell this lady?
<P>
	She said when I was running for office: ``I want you to go to 
Ottawa on my behalf. Get elected. I want you to do something 
about our criminal justice system. It has failed me and my family 
miserably. You have no idea of the agony that I have gone through. 
You have no idea of the agony that my family has gone through. It 
is an agony that continues. It does not go away. I want you to go to 
Ottawa and on my behalf and on behalf of my family and all the 
other Canadians who are ending up in this position do whatever you 
can to change it''.
<P>
	I will have to go back to this lady at some point. She will ask me: 
``What have you done?'' I will have to tell her that in spite of the 
efforts made by me and my colleagues in the Reform Party, some 
of whom have worked very hard to make changes, the reality is that 
nothing has been done.
<P>
	What do I say to the family of a commercial fisherman who was 
brutally beaten to death with sticks and stones? He was kicked to 
death by a group of young thugs in Prince Rupert last year. It made 
the national news. How could this happen in Canada? How is it that 
a group of 12, 14 and 15-year old boys could do this to somebody 
who represented no threat to them whatsoever and who was 
basically only minding his own business when this took place?
<P>
	What do we say to the family of that man? What do we say to the 
good citizens of Prince Rupert who are looking internally in shock 
as to how this could happen?  What are the circumstances that 
allow this kind of inhumane activity to take place within our 
society? What are we going to do about it?
<P>
	Frankly, I have to go back to the people in my constituency and 
to the good people of Prince Rupert to tell them that the 
Government of Canada has not yet seen the light. It is not yet 
prepared to really make any serious changes.
<P>
	What do I tell the young lady from Terrace who was assaulted, 
beaten and raped last year in Terrace in her own home in the middle 
of the night? Her assailant was brought before the courts. He was 
sentenced to two years in jail. Now barely more than a year later he 
is eligible and at this time is very likely out on parole and no doubt 
is fully free to go back into the community of Terrace and live 
within the community where he actually perpetrated the offence. 
This led to a huge demonstration in the community this summer 
which I attended where people spoke out and not only expressed 
their disgust at this turn of events but also demanded change.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	Those people at that rally stood there and committed their time 
and the time of their families to show solidarity with the 
community to make those demands for change. Now I have to go 
back to them and tell them what the government has done. The 
government pretends to care. It pretends to be contemplating 
serious change to the criminal justice system. But the reality is it 
tinkered with the Young Offenders Act. It made some minor 
changes. It tinkered with the parole and criminal justice system. It 
made some minor changes such as the bill we are dealing with 
today. And in a most cynical manoeuvre it inflicted a gun control 
bill known as Bill C-68 on the Canadian populace, the likes of 
which we have never seen, in an effort to persuade Canadians that it 
was serious about actually doing something about our criminal 
justice system.
<P>
	The reality is the government is a do nothing government when it 
comes to the criminal justice system. It has no real intention of 
changing the way the system operates. It has no real intention of 
demanding accountability. It has no real intention of putting the 
rights of victims ahead of criminals. In short, it has no real 
intention of doing anything constructive in this area.
<P>
	Members can bet that I am going to go back to my constituents 
and tell them what took place here on the floor of the House of 
Commons. I am going to tell them that the legislation which was 
introduced by this Parliament during the time I have been their 
elected representative was nothing short of tinkering and that the 
bleeding heart Liberals still do not get it. They do not understand 
that they are off side with a majority of Canadians who want 
change now and who are serious about it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4289"> 4289 </A></B>
<P>
	I heard some of the interventions which were made here 
yesterday by members opposite that the government is still more 
concerned about rehabilitation. It is still more concerned about the 
rights of the criminals, the rights of the perpetrators, than about 
the rights of victims. I am going to tell my constituents that the 
record of this government on criminal justice and on the rights 
of victims and their families is nothing short of abysmal. It is a 
disgrace. It is a national disgrace and the people opposite should 
hang their heads in shame. They can bet that I will be carrying 
this message forth in the next election.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to participate for a few moments on Bill C-45, 
presented by the Minister of Justice. It is an act to amend the 
Criminal Code dealing with judicial review of parole ineligibility 
at report stage.
<P>
	I have listened carefully to the debate. Not being a lawyer, I want 
to understand a little bit more about the essence of the bill and 
about the issues. I certainly do understand the emotion which has 
been expressed over the last many months. We have had private 
members' initiatives with regard to section 745. We have had 
presentations and submissions from the Minister of Justice.
<P>
<B>(1255 )</B>
<P>
	It shows this is an issue which responds to the needs of 
Canadians to have this matter addressed in a way which will best 
serve the judicial system.
<P>
	As I listen to the debate it follows a very typical pattern that 
many of the bills which come before this place have followed 
where the extreme positions are taken and continue to be repeated 
in a sense to paint a picture which is not very reflective of the 
reality of the bill and of the issues.
<P>
	It would be very interesting, if all members were to rise and 
speak on this bill, to see how many people would take a particular 
position and say: ``I am going to spend my entire speech talking 
about Clifford Olson and what a terrible person he is and what he 
has done and why this bill is the wrong way to go. Section 745 
should be eliminated totally because of Clifford Olson''. It simply 
states the extremes where we have a situation of a mass murderer 
who is the subject matter of the discussion.
<P>
	In that case I do not think there is anyone in this House and 
probably in Canada who would defend Clifford Olson's need to be 
released early from jail. I think all Canadians would say that 
Clifford Olson should never come out of jail. That is the bottom 
line.
<P>
	We are talking about section 745 of the Criminal Code which 
deals with a very touchy subject in a sense that it actually stems 
from the capital punishment debate of many years ago. I will keep 
this simple and not in a judicial or justice fashion.
<P>
	Section 745 came in as a compromise and as a by-product of that 
capital punishment debate. When the Parliament of the day decided 
it could not at that point support capital punishment in Canada, 745 
came out of that where it basically states that after serving 15 years 
of a 25 year sentence an application can be made by the criminal 
who has been accused and who is in jail for early parole. It is not to 
apply to get out early. It is a two stage process. I have not heard 
very much about the actual mechanics of that in debate.
<P>
	So that some members will understand, I will explain this in the 
way it was explained to me by the briefing we got from officials. 
Someone in jail would actually make an application for a judicial 
review and that review would be done by a jury of Canadian 
citizens. Actual people would form the jury and review the 
application of someone to proceed along this route. Only after a 
jury of peers would have decided whether this was eligible or this 
was a case that it could be argued that there was true remorse and 
there was no useful purpose being served by having that person 
fulfil the last period of their sentence would it then go to the parole 
board.
<P>
	The interesting thing that has not been mentioned when someone 
talks about getting rid of 745 is that there is a process of judicial 
review done by a jury of peers, ordinary citizens.
<P>
	The other aspect in this bill, which I think is an important change 
being proposed by Bill C-45, is that another step has been added 
which will eliminate any nuisance factor or improve the 
productivity of the system whereby in the first instance a judge of 
the courts will determine whether a particular proposed application 
has any merit. This means that if someone who is serving time 
decides after 15 years to make application it is first going to be 
determined whether the application is worthy of moving forward 
through the process. It has to be dealt with by a judge. It has to be 
an honourable person of the court who determines, on the history of 
the case and from the recommendations by the jury at the original 
trial, whether this application is worthy of going forward.
<P>
<B>(1300 )</B>
<P>
	This is where people like Clifford Olson would be stopped, 
totally. He may ask for it, but there is no possibility in our society 
that people like Clifford Olson will ever get any breaks to get out of 
jail early or at all for that matter.
<P>
	The second process is to go to a review by a jury of peers. Again, 
ordinary Canadians would be given all of the facts, all of the 
circumstances, and it would be up to Canadians, our neighbours, 
our friends from right across Canada. They would decide whether a 
case would merit consideration of shortening a sentence or having 
early parole.
<P>
	If that were successful, it would then have to go through the 
ordinary process of a review by the parole  board. There is a very 
comprehensive and extensive approach to it. The question comes 
down to is there a case of someone who has been convicted of first 
degree murder and who was sentenced to 25 years in prison that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4290"> 4290 </A></B>
<P>
should be considered for a reduction in sentence? It is a very tough 
question.
<P>
	Many members will say first degree murder is first degree 
murder. The murderer has taken a life and they should serve the 
total of 25 years and that is all.
<P>
	I asked justice officials to tell me about some of the cases where 
application was made and granted. I found that we were not talking 
about Clifford Olsons, we were not talking about Hell's Angels 
members who killed people and were getting out on early parole.
<P>
	Many of the cases were domestic problems where an abused 
spouse in reaction or emotion killed their spouse. There were cases 
where disputes within families led to one family member killing 
another family member. It is tragic and awful in our society. But as 
we all know, there are circumstances that create pressures and 
stresses on people which make them make very bad mistakes. They 
have to live with those mistakes for the rest of their lives. They are 
very remorseful. It serves Canada and society as a whole no benefit 
to have them incarcerated for that additional period.
<P>
	A better result may be achieved if those people are shown 
clearly, based on a review by judges, by juries of their peers and by 
the parole board, not to be a threat to society as a whole. The 
incident had complicated or mitigating circumstances associated 
with it but on the technicalities of the merit of the case it did in fact 
constitute first degree murder.
<P>
	I raise the issues to make sure all hon. members know the 
argument is not a Clifford Olson argument. There is no question 
that all hon. members of this place want to ensure those situations 
do not tie up the courts and do not particularly raise the kinds of 
problems that have been raised here.
<P>
	It is a constructive change that has been raised in Bill C-45. I 
support it and I know this House will look favourably on the bill 
because it is the right thing to do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I had a few notes on what I wanted to say about this 
government amendment, and perhaps I will get to some of those 
things. Listening to the hon. member for Mississauga South gave 
me some new points that I thought were more worthy of discussion.
<P>
	One point goes to the heart of the problem. The government does 
not listen to people. Something the member said really drew my 
attention to that. When he referred to capital punishment he said 
``the government of the day decided''. The government of the day 
is not supposed to decide. I do not know about the government over 
there. I do not know about the Liberal Party. I was not elected to 
rule over anybody. I was not  elected to think for other people. I 
was elected to listen, to react to what I hear and to carry that 
message here to Ottawa.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	The government of the day decided. That was said in all 
innocence and I do not wish it to be a reflection specifically on the 
hon. member who said that, but I think the concept of that is 
absolutely disgusting. It has brought us to the mess we are in in 
many things and most particularly the criminal justice system, the 
concept of somebody having a faint hope clause after 15 years. The 
member said there may be no useful purpose in having that 
criminal fulfil the final portion of the sentence.
<P>
	The criminals in this case were sentenced to life but they are not 
necessarily held for life. That concept is there but maybe there is no 
useful purpose in taking someone who is 20-years old and keeping 
them in there for 60 years until they are 80 or 85 or whatever. It 
specifically says 25 years and then after that a decision is made. 
That is where the so-called faint hope is. If you behave, if you show 
remorse, if you show you have understood the wrong you have 
done and you are going to try to live a better life, they have already 
said when you are going to be considered from the actual sentence 
which is not 25 years, it is life.
<P>
	Now we are saying that maybe you will get out after 15 or 20 
years. If we go along with that maybe we should look at 10 years. 
The jails are crowded, he did not kill anybody important, so we will 
let you out. Or, we are going to keep this guy for 15 or 20 years 
because he killed 10 people, but you only killed 2 or 3 so you are 
not so bad so we have to let you out early in order to keep things 
proportionate. Does that not sound ridiculous? I am trying to sound 
ridiculous because that is exactly the whole concept of this idea.
<P>
	In some cases like the Clifford Olsons and the Bernardos of this 
world, 25 years is a very light sentence. The very thought that they 
should even be remotely considered for parole after 15 years is 
absolutely nauseating.
<P>
	I agree with the hon. member for Mississauga South that the 
Clifford Olsons of this world are not going to get out after 15 years 
but they are going to get a podium to spout all kinds of garbage that 
only comes out of sick mind like his in the first place. That is going 
to retorture the families that have already had the ultimate torture 
visited upon them. Why give him a chance to revictimize the 
victims he has created? I do not see that it serves any useful 
purpose whatsoever.
<P>
	The hon. member also spoke about the honourable judiciary who 
was going to prevent this from happening. I had a case in British 
Columbia where the parents of a girl who was murdered lived in 
my constituency. The murder did not take place there but her 
parents lived there. Although this was a provincial matter, they 
were  getting absolutely no help or comfort from the provincial 
government whatsoever and so they came to me. Their daughter 
was stabbed 43 times by her husband. It was a vicious, violent 
death. He dumped her in the back of a pickup truck, drove to the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4291"> 4291 </A></B>
<P>
family home where their daughter was inside and waited until the 
lights went out because she was up watching TV.
<P>
	He parked the car with her mother's dead body in the back in the 
family garage. He went in and packed his cloths, took off into town, 
closed out the bank accounts, collected some debts from other 
people, sold his car and took off to Mexico until, in his own words, 
he could get his story straight.
<P>
	He was discovered and faced extradition. He returned and 
consulted with his lawyer and turned himself in. He said: ``Yes, I 
stabbed her but it was not my fault''. I do not recall the legal term 
for it but he had a momentary blankout. He went on the stand and 
said: ``I am a wonderful guy and I just thought my wife was great 
until I snapped because she was nagging at me. I have always 
treated her right''.
<P>
	The prosecution tried to bring in his former wife, whom he had 
beaten on many occasions. It was not allowed. The judge in this 
case, this wonderful judiciary who was going to take care of 
undeserving people like Clifford Olson, decided that because it 
happened more than six months before it was irrelevant.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	Then the prosecution said: ``Okay, we will bring in something 
more relevant. We will bring in independent witnesses who saw the 
accused on at least two occasions beating the victim in public so 
severely that she had to be rescued by bystanders''. The honourable 
member of the judiciary decided that was not appropriate either 
because it was only hearsay and the victim was not there to be 
cross-examined.
<P>
	That is the judiciary which the hon. member says will prevent 
the Clifford Olsons of this country from getting an opportunity to 
ask for a chance to get away.
<P>
	There is a term. It was not designed specifically to be used 
against the government. The term is bleeding heart Liberals. It is a 
generality. It does not refer specifically, or at least necessarily, to 
the Liberal Party, but it sure fits. It fits incredibly in this case. 
Bleeding heart Liberals.
<P>
	That is not so bad. There is nothing wrong with having a 
bleeding heart, provided they bleed for the right people. When we 
have the victims of Clifford Olson, all those young children, the 
parents, the families, the relatives, and we come in with some 
clause which will give an opportunity to the murderer of all those 
children, the person who brought all that misery to the families of 
those victims, when we start bleeding for them, we have a major 
problem. Right now we have a major problem. It is called the 
Liberal Party.
<P>
	For years I was a building contractor. If something goes wrong 
with a foundation, if it is a small area, sometimes it can be fixed. 
However, when the whole foundation is rotten the whole thing has 
to be taken out. It cannot be patched and repaired. We cannot patch 
and repair something which is so absolutely disgusting as section 
745. It has to be removed in its entirety.
<P>
	I recently bought a car. I paid $25,000 for it. However, I did not 
go in when the car was ready and say: ``I am only going to give you 
$15,000 because I want to have some faint hope that I will save 
money''.
<P>
	If there is a sentence out there, if it is what the people of the 
country decide on, 25 years is the minimum. It is not the maximum. 
They may stay in much longer. We have already gone to the 
judiciary, which the hon. member for Mississauga South said is so 
honourable and will protect us. If he accepts that, why do we not 
listen to the judiciary which said that 25 years is the minimum? 
Why does the government want to interfere and say: ``It might be 
the minimum, but we are going to consider making it considerably 
less''. That makes absolutely no sense.
<P>
	Section 745 needs to be eliminated. Something that is totally 
rotten cannot be fixed. We have to get rid of it. That applies to 
every other segment of our society and it applies here as well.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak to Bill C-45, an act to 
amend the Criminal Code in the judicial review of parole 
ineligibility and another act.
<P>
	I will start with a question. Where is the government coming 
from? What in the world is it doing? Having been here for just 
about three years I ask the question are we better off in any capacity 
now than we were three years ago? I wonder, in terms of the 
criminal justice system, what in the world the government is doing 
with this amendment.
<P>
	Bill C-45 purportedly toughens the justice system. I would say 
today that it is simply a half hearted public relations effort, as is 
most of what the government has done in its supposed reforms, in 
an effort to show the Canadian public that it is doing something.
<P>
	I will look briefly at the history of the justice system's response 
to this particular issue, a first degree murderer.
<P>
<B>(1315 )</B>
<P>
	We see a record that actually started in the era of another Liberal, 
Prime Minister Trudeau. At that time, the rights of the criminals 
and the process of the rehabilitation of criminals overtook, within 
the justice system, any idea of the importance or the pre-eminence 
of the idea of the protection of law-abiding citizens.
<P>
	Since the time of Trudeau, both traditional parties, Liberals and 
Conservatives, have spent those 20 intervening years becoming 
softer and softer on crime  and criminals. The sad fact is that one 
cannot get softer on criminals without making life more difficult 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4292"> 4292 </A></B>
<P>
for society in general, as well as for the victims of the crimes that 
they commit.
<P>
	First, capital punishment was replaced with life imprisonment. 
Later, parole was provided so that life, even life of a 25-year 
sentence, no longer meant that 25 years. A faint hope clause was 
introduced, as was described earlier by many of my colleagues, 
which gave an automatic right to apply for early parole at 15 years. 
Records show that the possibility of it is very good.
<P>
	In the meantime, the system is tied up with criminals, such as we 
have heard about today like Clifford Olson, who have a right to a 
process which makes no sense to the essence of justice or to the 
majority of Canadians.
<P>
	Today, with this amendment we come to another step in this 
process with a government that is full of bleeding heart Liberals 
who think that withholding parole from only multiple murderers 
constitutes being tough on crime. How ridiculous. The Liberal 
government today pretends that action is being taken in the 
criminal justice system. There is nothing here that is substantive, 
nothing helpful. What it is doing is at total cross purposes to the 
good of our society.
<P>
	I would like to remind the House of the recent amendments to 
the Young Offenders Act and the amendments made by this 
government purportedly to make that system work better. That too 
was a smokescreen for a mindset that did not take crime seriously. 
It was these amendments that put society at a greater risk today.
<P>
	In my constituency-I have spoken of this before-a little over 
two years ago, there was a murder. It has been mentioned by my 
colleague. It was a cold-blooded murder, a kicking to death of a 
young man on one of our streets five blocks from my home. They 
were two young offenders.
<P>
	Our community reacted to that with an outpouring of heartfelt 
petition to government to make some change. Over 3,000 people 
came together at a rally. Never has an event like that happened in 
my constituency before. Over 3,000 people participated.
<P>
	This summer, the then 15-year old and now 17-year old, with the 
changes made by this government to the Young Offenders Act was 
raised to adult court. His case was reviewed and he was sentenced 
according to the adult court provisions for young offenders, again 
specifically in response to the amendments made by this 
government.
<P>
	The cold-blooded murderer of Graham Niven on the streets of 
our town would have received 10 years under the previous Young 
Offenders Act. Given that he was raised to adult court, he received 
five years for cold-blooded murder. Because he had already served 
two years in the intervening time, he will be on the streets of Port 
Moody-Coquitlam in three years. From what I  understand that 
young man has shown no repentance, no sense of guilt or remorse. 
Yet in three years' time that young man who committed 
cold-blooded murder will be in our community, on our streets, 
thanks to grand amendments made by the government under the 
pretence of making the judicial system better. The system does not 
care or demand accountability. The system does not care about 
public safety on the streets of our cities.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	I know that my constituents do not think that Bill C-45 is tough 
on crime. I know that my colleagues' constituents do not think that 
Bill C-45 is tough on crime. Canadians do not think that this bill is 
tough on crime. Once again the Liberals are out of touch with the 
Canadian people. They have no interest in the views of Canadians. 
They seem to want to represent the views of the justice department 
which is disconnected, the views of a justice minister who has 
repeatedly shown us that he is disconnected and the views of a 
Prime Minister who is disconnected from the beliefs and wishes of 
the Canadian people.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Discepola:</B> Only Reformers are connected.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Hayes:</B> My colleague says that only Reformers are 
connected. We care about representing our constituents. Why do 
the Liberals not care what their constituents are thinking?
<P>
	The private members' bill put forward by the member for York 
South-Weston has been ignored, has been swept under the carpet. 
It demanded repeal of section 745 and that is where we should be 
going, not tinkering, not doing what we did with the YOA, but 
making real change.
<P>
	Seventy-four members supported that bill. Where are they 
today? Where are the government members who should be saying 
that we do need change. We need repeal of section 745. For 
goodness sake, why does the justice department reign without 
consideration of where Canadians are coming from. These 
members march in lock step with government priorities, whether it 
be automatic parole, or treatment of illegal immigrants or the small 
minority of immigrants who break the law. These are all things 
which are a total disgrace to Canadians. The government is not 
treating the criminal justice system with its due priority nor is it 
reflecting the views of Canadians.
<P>
	The member for Skeena asked some excellent questions. What 
do we say to a woman whose husband was murdered and we know 
she has to live with the pain for the rest of her life while the 
criminal has a chance to go free in 15 years? What do we say to 
children whose mother was raped and killed by a repeat offender 
who was released early by a justice system that does not take the 
crime seriously? What do we say to the families of Clifford Olson's 
victims when he applies for early release? What do I say to the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4293"> 4293 </A></B>
<P>
moms and teens who will  live on the same street as that young 
offender who will be released in three years?
<P>
	Liberal members who have spoken have no appreciation of the 
anger that is out there or the overwhelming public support for a 
capital punishment referendum. Reform listens and we speak to 
and support that. How can these MPs say they are representatives? 
They have managed to miss the message. Who are they listening 
to? They are not hearing the people I am hearing.
<P>
	I say today that we should repeal, not tinker with section 745. 
Along with my colleagues I will vote against Bill C-45.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
think we really need to look at some of the details of this bill. As 
my colleague said, maybe we are just tinkering with it.
<P>
	One frustrating thing that the Canadian public feels is that there 
needs to be some large changes made, not just tinkering with any 
piece of legislation, whether it is financial, economic or criminal 
justice.
<P>
	I want to respond to a Liberal member who just called across 
asking: ``Why did you not support the gun control bill''? If I though 
that the gun bill would eliminate or reduce crime and violent 
offences in great measure, I would be willing to support the gun 
bill. I think Canadians across the country probably would.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	What they see is a situation where the government is perhaps out 
of touch. The same member also is calling out right now. I do not 
know whether I could call this an assault, but I certainly do hear a 
lot of noise coming from that direction. The member says: ``Don't 
you think we listen to the people?'' Of course I do. I would not be 
arrogant enough to say that nobody in this House but Reformers 
listens to the people because that simply is not true.
<P>
	I know there are members in this House, and you probably 
yourself, Madam Speaker, spent the summer at home and listened 
to what people had to say. The concerns are the same across the 
country. Let us face it, nobody on either side of the House wants 
Clifford Olson to be free and wandering around in the Canadian 
public any more.
<P>
	What has happened is that the executive branch of the 
government says that it knows best. I know there are Liberal 
backbenchers here who are equally frustrated as we are. They have 
been home, and we have been home, for the summer and listened to 
what has gone on. People are hearing in their own constituencies 
that they want people to be accountable. They want government to 
be accountable. It is their cash that we are spending here. They 
want to make sure that murderers are accountable for their crimes 
as well. They feel a sense of frustration that Bill C-45 which is not 
completely repealing section 745 of the Criminal Code is going to 
do that job.
<P>
	The private member's bill brought in by our colleague from York 
South-Weston was going to do exactly that. It was repealing 
section 745 so that we would not have this automatic kickback in 
place so that after 15 years a murderer could automatically apply 
for early parole.
<P>
	We talk about justice and say that justice must be done. We could 
all debate in this House about how important it is for justice to be 
done and to be served. Let us remember that justice means justice. 
In a lot of our academic discussions we have probably forgotten 
what the word justice actually means.
<P>
	Those people who think that they know the meaning of it, the 
academics, the lawyers, the judges, the media and so on, perhaps 
have lost the true meaning of what justice is. Ordinary Canadians 
have not and whether they live in Reform ridings or Liberals 
ridings is immaterial. Ordinary Canadians regardless of whom they 
are represented by in the House of Commons realize that the 
meaning of justice has been lost or certainly watered down.
<P>
	I could give a definition of justice to mean acting in accordance 
with what is morally right or fair. We are afraid to walk the line to 
even talk about morals. Somewhere there is ultimate justice 
coming and those people who have taken a life, first degree 
murderers, who are applying for early parole now must realize that 
their victims are dead forever. When we hear on the news or see on 
television that someone has been brutally murdered by one of these 
violent offenders we feel that pain. We try to understand the grief 
that family is going through.
<P>
	Yet a couple of years later, for instance in the Mahaffy and 
French cases, although I feel that pain, it is certainly not the way 
the family feels it. That is with them forever. The person who 
committed murders may feel somewhat repentant. I do not know 
how they feel in their hearts. I know that they are alive and they are 
doing whatever they can do. Clifford Olson is working on his 
appeal right now. He is not feeling the grief that the families are 
feeling. Many people who have had loved ones murdered are 
feeling that pain. Dead is dead forever.
<P>
	When we think that justice means acting in accordance with 
what is morally right or fair, there are wrongs, there are rights, 
there are absolutes that it is wrong to take another life. We could 
just discuss it away in these hallowed halls all the time and say we 
think that this person needs special treatment or we think that this 
person deserves to get out of jail. There are people who genuinely 
do get rehabilitated but the frustrating part is that we just use all of 
them in a blanket statement.
<P>
	The words bleeding heart were used here earlier by various 
people. We need to be sensitive, to make sure that people who are 
forever going through the pain of  losing loved ones are not going 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4294"> 4294 </A></B>
<P>
to be hoodwinked or going to be held to ransom by a body of 
legislators who think that they know best for everybody and that is 
by giving the criminals more attention than the victims.
<P>
<B>(1330 )</B>
<P>
	Something we have to get to in our society, when we are talking 
about morals or what is absolutely right or wrong, is that when the 
rights of a victim and the rights of a criminal conflict we must 
always come down on the side of the victim. Yes, criminals need 
attention, rehabilitation, love and caring, but the victim was 
someone who was totally innocent and paid the price. As I 
mentioned earlier, those who have lost somebody have lost them 
forever.
<P>
	I would just like to mention Clifford Olson for a couple of 
minutes because his name has come up over and over again. He has 
been the flashpoint of this section 745. Clifford Olson wreaked 
havoc on many people's lives and those lives are suffering just as 
much now, 15 or 16 years later, as they were when the act was 
committed.
<P>
	I think Clifford Olson was arrested in August 1981. I was on a 
camping trip on the coast. I was camping in a tent on the sand at 
Long Beach on the west coast of Vancouver Island. I got up the next 
day and packed up my tent to drive across Vancouver Island to go 
over to Vancouver. I heard on the news that Clifford Olson had just 
been arrested around Ecluelet on the west coast of Vancouver 
Island which was about two miles from where I was camped. A 
young woman, sleeping in a tent on the beach, I thought I was 
perfectly safe. I had no thought in the world that anything wrong or 
dangerous would happen to me.
<P>
	Ironically, I found out he had just been arrested a couple of miles 
up the road. He had picked up a couple of girls and had not done 
anything to them yet. Fortunately they did not have to pay the price 
with their lives. However, he was out and about and free. Who 
knows, many other people could have been his victims.
<P>
	He was arrested then and is now applying, 15 years later, for 
early parole. The sad and ironic twist about this thing, which was 
brought in by a Liberal government in 1978 by the member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, I understand is that the time goes from the 
time of arrest which is 15 years ago. As one of my colleagues said, 
the moment one is arrested the time is added and therefore the 15 
years are up.
<P>
	I would like to ask how anyone of us would feel if we were one 
of the victims' families and heard that Clifford Olson was going to 
get his day in court. Can anyone imagine having to open that 
wound again and watch him get that opportunity in court? I cannot 
think of anything worse, more damaging, more dangerous, more 
frightening and more harmful than to give this guy another day in 
court so that he can go and bring up all this stuff again. I do not 
think the families of those  victims need to see that again. I do not 
think he needs his day in court.
<P>
	I do not know if you were one of the ones, Madam Speaker, 
whom he wrote a letter to recently in this Parliament, but the fact is 
Clifford Olson sent mail to many of the people in this Chamber and 
there was a condom stuck in that letter. I would like people to 
reflect on that for just a minute by asking if this is what we are 
allowing to happen. Do we want to give this guy his day in court? I 
think not. I do not think that anyone of us needs to be subjected to 
getting a condom from this character, I really do not.
<P>
	However, we see a government which says: ``Yes, we are going 
to bring this in because we need to be compassionate''.
<P>
	Let me finish by saying yes, we do need to be compassionate. By 
repealing section 745 all together does not mean that we are not 
being compassionate. What it means is that we will still allow a 
trigger to be in place because some murderers and violent offenders 
are curable. They are not all incorrigible. Some of them will be 
rehabilitated. Some will care and will have a genuine conversion 
experience in prison. They will want to make their lives better and 
pay back to society some of the terrible things they did by doing 
good work. Some of them will be allowed to be released. By 
eliminating section 745 all together does not mean we are just 
going to lock these guys up and throw away the key. However, 
there is such a thing as a pardon. I think that trigger could still be in 
place.
<P>
	I wish the Minister of Justice and his colleagues would say: ``We 
want to make sure that even though we do repeal section 745 there 
is still room for a pardon so that somebody can be released on that 
but it would be the exception rather than the rule''. I think that is a 
far healthier way of going about it than the way the government is 
moving with not repealing section 745 and going ahead with Bill 
C-45 right now. I think it is wrong and I do not think it will solve 
the problems that we face in the country.
<P>
<B>(1335 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, Bill C-45 is before Parliament this September for 
specific reasons. There is a national consensus. The national 
consensus is that the operation of section 745 is flawed. The public 
does not like it. As with so many issues, the government tries to 
respond but it will not abandon its old ways and become a 
responsive agent for change.
<P>
	This bill demonstrates that it is a rather poor manager of the 
country's business. It is not a matter of left or right on the political 
spectrum. It is between Liberal system defenders and the out of 
date attitudes of the Liberals, and Reformers who side with average 
Canadians in their impatience for change to reform our laws, to 
represent  the situation that has become evident to the public as it 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4295"> 4295 </A></B>
<P>
has observed the results and the operations of section 745 of the 
Criminal Code in its community.
<P>
	The Liberals continue to stick to the old. Reformers are the 
system changers. It is a matter of ideals and social philosophy. It 
reveals the bankruptcy of Liberalism and the dissonance between 
the old view of the Prime Minister and the tremendous desire for 
reform that is in the land.
<P>
	Today we have an example of the distasteful Liberal attitude of 
the divine right to govern from the Reformers who wish to 
represent mainstream Canadian values and the desire to give this 
country a fresh start.
<P>
	The statistics of reoffending are not relevant to the central 
argument. However, the amount of crime we have in society is 
central. It is a matter of doing what is right, of doing what 
mainstream Canada wants. It is a matter of how average Canadians 
view themselves, of how citizens in my riding interpret what it 
means to be Canadian and of what should happen in society when 
murder occurs.
<P>
	It is my view that section 745 of the Criminal Code has no 
appropriate place in Canadian criminal law. It is not appropriate as 
an instructive and social aspect of defining the limits of social 
order. It is a classic case of old style government prescribing and 
telling Canadians what is good for them, while it closes its ears to 
the national outcry against the section 745 rule.
<P>
	There was a deal in this nation, the fair exchange was the 
abolition of capital punishment. Measures were introduced for 
those who have received life in jail. The faint hope of parole at the 
25 year point was the fair exchange when capital punishment was 
eliminated.
<P>
	Then that fair exchange was broken by the Liberals and slippery 
rules were introduced that the parole eligibility date could be 
reduced to even 15 years.
<P>
	The bill before Parliament today tinkers again with these rules. 
The problem is this whole game should never have been 
entertained in the first place. This section should be repealed, not 
adjusted.
<P>
	If the Liberals had their ideology deeply rooted in the Canadian 
soil and if they could comprehend the victims in this country, they 
would have abolished section 745. They would not have come back 
with this weak-kneed pointless piece of legislation known as Bill 
C-45 that we are debating today.
<P>
	I also take issue with the fact that Bill C-45 appears to create 
categories of good and bad murderers. Those who kill one person 
will be entitled to a section 745 review. These are the good 
murderers according to the justice minister's legislation. However, 
serial killers will not be entitled to a section 745 review. These are 
the minister's bad murderers in the bill. It is truly unbelievable that 
the minister has actually quantified human life in this piece of 
legislation.
<P>
	I ask the Prime Minister is one life any less valuable than two, 
three, five, ten? According to this bill an offender should be given a 
glimmer of hope if they kill only one person, but any more than that 
and they will not get a section 745 review.
<P>
	The Liberals have set the quota at one life. It is disgraceful and 
reprehensible that the justice minister would draft his very own 
categories of murderers, some deserving leniency and others not.
<P>
<B>(1340 )</B>
<P>
	What is parole anyway? Parole means that an offender can spend 
jail time in the community under some kind of supervision. 
Unfortunately, often that supervision is rather loose. I have deep 
concerns about the public expectation of what parole supervision 
means and actually what is delivered.
<P>
	A life sentence with the opportunity of parole at 25 years was the 
fair exchange, but section 745 breaks that reasonable social 
convention.
<P>
	My community is upset because section 745 should not exist, 
and yet the government is tinkering with it. The government can 
create an image, an appearance that it is doing something, because 
the public is upset.
<P>
	This bill does not reflect mainstream Canadian values. The 
protection of society and the consideration of victims must be 
paramount before considering any legitimate concern for the 
offender. Therefore, on behalf of my community I cannot support 
the bill.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Resuming

privilege denied by the Chair, and then another member rose and 
the Speaker recognized or wanted to recognize another? That 
member was not in the Chamber and we were not accorded the 
same privileges that member received. What was the procedure 
with regard to that? I would appreciate the Speaker's comments.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Hon. 
members, these are not points of order. Resuming debate.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Cohen:</B> Madam Speaker, as the government has stated, Bill 
C-53 is an excellent example of both the government's continuing 
commitment to responsible criminal justice reform and a positive 
federal, provincial and territorial collaboration.
<P>
	Our correctional system divides its responsibilities between two 
levels of government and among 13 separate provincial and 
territorial jurisdictions. While each level of government and each 
jurisdiction has its own unique challenges, there are many issues 
common to all of them which face all of them. Now more than ever 
it is important that we work in collaboration to share our expertise 
and experience in addressing these common problems.
<P>
	It is no secret that all jurisdictions have been experiencing prison 
population growth in recent years. This population growth 
threatens to outstrip available resources. At the same time those 
very government resources have been declining. These pressures, if 
we do not seek effective solutions, will undermine any 
jurisdiction's ability to effectively treat, manage and return 
offenders to the community as law-abiding citizens. That, after all, 
is our shared goal.
<P>
	From 1989-90 to 1994-95 the federal penitentiary population 
grew by 22 per cent. During this same time  period, provincial 
prison populations grew on average by about 12 per cent. While 
this growth was occurring, the reported crime rate was actually 
declining. Why have we seen this increase in prison populations? 
In fact there are a number of reasons.
<P>
	There are indications that at the provincial level more custodial 
sentences are being given by the courts and for longer periods of 
time. There has also been a significant growth in the number of 
charges for sexual and other forms of assault. At the federal level 
there have been fewer conditional releases granted and more 
revocations of those releases that are granted.
<P>
<B>(1355 )</B>
<P>
	The net result is that Canada's incarceration rate is simply very 
high by world standards. In fact, among western countries it is one 
of the highest. The combined federal, provincial and territorial 
incarceration rate is 130 youth and adult offenders for 100,000 
population. This places us far above European countries such as the 
Netherlands at 51 per 100,000, or Germany at 81 per 100,000.
<P>
	Even among western democracies there are considerable 
differences in culture, values and social institutions which make it 
difficult to assume that direct adoption of the practices of other 
nations would be viable. Nevertheless when our incarceration rate 
is so dramatically higher than many of our European partners, it is 
incumbent on us to ask some tough questions as to why this might 
be so. Some believe for example that the criminal justice system 
today is too often used to deal with social problems that could be 
handled more effectively by other social services or programs or by 
greater collaboration among health and social program areas and 
the criminal justice system.
<P>
	In particular we need to be sure that the criminal justice system 
is making the most effective use of community health and social 
resources in preparing offenders for returning to our communities 
as law-abiding citizens. All jurisdictions have traditionally 
considered community corrections to be a viable alternative to 
incarceration for low risk offenders.
<P>
	Today community based programs are increasingly important as 
cost effective correctional alternatives that can be used to offset 
escalating institutional populations and costs. When an offender 
should be imprisoned because of the risk they pose to the public, 
that is where they should and will remain. This is not a question of 
dollars and cents; it becomes a question rather of public safety. 
Where that public safety can be achieved through controlled 
reintegration into the community, then that is the best way to 
ensure that scarce taxpayers' dollars are spent on incarcerating 
only those offenders who truly must be incarcerated or who truly 
need to be incarcerated.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="4298"> 4298 </A></B>
<P>
	Some community based measures which have been integral 
parts of correctional practice for years are being given more 
emphasis today. These include things such as bail verification and 
supervision programs, electronic monitoring, house arrest, fine 
option programs, victim-offender reconciliation programs, 
enhanced probation, and community based treatment programs. 
All of these programs have at their heart the diversion of low risk 
offenders out of the criminal justice system or to a lower degree 
of control within the system when it is safe and consistent with 
criminal justice objectives to do so.
<P>
	Early intervention to divert offenders before a criminal 
behaviour pattern has been established is regarded by many as a 
sound method to avoid future criminal involvement and the 
associated costs to society.
<P>
	Many such programs have been developed and tested on both an 
experimental and an ongoing basis. Recent consultations have 
revealed that there is a renewed interest in many jurisdictions and 
that there are many such programs being implemented or 
considered.
<P>
	The reforms in Bill C-53 provide an excellent opportunity to 
build on this renewed interest. These improvements to the 
provincial temporary absence legislation will provide a sound and 
flexible framework for provinces and territories to provide 
community based management of offenders in appropriate cases. 
Offenders who are able to work can continue to do so while others 
can pursue treatment, educational, vocational or other programs in 
the community, all while subject to correctional control.
<P>
	As I said at the outset, all jurisdictions are facing common 
problems with regard to escalating workload pressures in the 
criminal justice field. Solutions are being sought in diverse ways 
but with many common themes. Sharing knowledge about these 
efforts, working together to expand our knowledge about the 
problems and potential solutions, and engaging in collaborative 
efforts can maximize the results of each of our individual efforts 
and benefit all jurisdictions.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Of course when the debate continues after 
question period, the hon. member will have the floor.
<P>
	It being almost 2 p.m., we will now proceed to Statements by 
Members.

<P>
	That is not what I heard this summer. These are not the worst 
times, but there is a deep uneasiness with the people I talk to. 
There is sort of a gut feeling that things are not as good as they 
should be.
<P>
	What these people sense that the Prime Minister does not is that 
Canada can do better: better than the mess that the government has 
made of the armed forces; better than the laws that say only 
multiple murderers get a full sentence; better than the national 
unity plans consisting of flag giveaways; better than a debt that will 
reach $600 billion in a few weeks; better than a 9 per cent 
unemployment rate every single month for the last six years.

<P>
	As colleagues may be aware, prostate cancer now has the highest 
rate of occurrence for newly diagnosed forms of cancer in 
Canadian men, after non-melanoma skin cancer. It is also the 
second most common cause of cancer deaths.
<P>
	During this decade the incidence of the disease has risen at an 
unusually high rate. The lives and health of many Canadian men 
and their loved ones will be affected by this cancer and by 
interventions of screening and treatment.
<P>
	Greater awareness about prostate cancer and more research into 
ways to prevent and treat this disease are needed.
<P>
	I commend the Canadian Cancer Society and the Canadian 
Prostate Cancer Network for their continuing work in helping to 
combat this disease.

partnership between the Bank of Nova Scotia and the Ontario 
Association of Community Development Corporations and 
represents an example of Industry Canada's efforts to increase 
small business access to capital.
<P>
	Scotiabank has agreed to make $2 million in wholesale loan 
funds available at below market rates to eight community 
development corporations that will administer the loans under their 
existing network. This will provide viable businesses with access 
to much needed higher risk start-up and expansion capital, directly 
addressing one of the greatest obstacles to small business growth 
and development in Ontario.

September 17 marks the United Nations International Day of 
Peace. It is a day for us to be proud of the contributions that Canada 
has made to the United Nations such as those of former Prime 
Minister Lester B. Pearson who won the Nobel peace prize for 
creating the concept of peacekeeping during the Suez crisis.
<P>
	Since that time, Canadians have been involved in numerous UN 
missions including Korea, Cyprus, Rwanda and of course our 
ongoing mission in the former Yugoslavia.
<P>
	Last year Canada was credited with initiating a UN rapid 
reaction force that would act in times of crisis.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Canada has good reason to be proud of its past performance, and 
must continue to work in conjunction with the United Nations on 
behalf of peace in Cyprus, Lebanon, Iraq and anywhere else in the 
world where human rights and international law are not being 
respected.

	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, since August, the government's decision to terminate the 
industrial milk subsidy has resulted in a higher price for milk 
solids, and that increase will be reflected in the price of dairy 
products. Consumers will, in fact, have to pay an average of 4 per 
cent more for their dairy products, and this hits the less well off 
particularly hard.
<P>
	This is only the first step, for the end of the industrial milk 
subsidy, as announced in the last Martin budget, will continue to 
have repercussions for the next five years.
<P>
	It is unfortunate that low fat products will be the ones most 
affected, since these contain more milk solids. This will eventually 
have an impact on the general health of the population and, 
strangely enough, at the very moment the federal government is 
also pulling out of funding health services, by cutting back its 
transfer payments.

<P>
	The unemployment rate remains above 9 per cent after three 
years of economic recovery. I blame this dismal record on the 
government's failure to deal with labour market problems.
<P>
	Our employment insurance system subsidizes permanently 
seasonal industries. Premiums, known to kill jobs, are too high. 
Our high marginal income tax rates drive abroad the most skilled 
and entrepreneurial Canadians. Our high capital gains and 
corporate taxes push investment abroad.
<P>
	Small business, the Canadian job creation machine, is held back 
by red tape and excessive taxation. Large business is discouraged 
from hiring labour by too much regulation and legislated wages.

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, at 
a time of increasing concern about literacy, it is unfortunate that 
another Liberal promise was broken a week or two ago when the 
Minister of Finance made it clear that the Liberals were not going 
to retract the GST on books.
<P>
	At the time, the Minister of Finance defended his decision by 
challenging his critics to say where the $140 million would come 
from. One of the places the Prime Minister could look for the $140 
million is in the $2 billion that was moved overseas tax free as a 
result of the family trust loophole.
<P>
	In that respect I am very glad to welcome the legal action being 
taken by Cho!ces, a social action group in Winnipeg, which is 
going to take the federal government to court if it does not have 
that tax decision, that advanced ruling reviewed so the money that 
should be going into the public treasury goes there to pay for things 
like taking the GST off books.

	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today I would like to pay tribute to Dr. Lucille Teasdale, 
who died of AIDS related complications on August 1. It was during 
my training as a nurse that I had the opportunity to work with this 
extraordinary woman.
<P>
	In a profession that was then an almost exclusively male 
preserve, Lucille Teasdale, one of the first female surgeons in 
Canada, earned the respect and admiration of her colleagues.
<P>
	In the early 1960s, she founded a hospital in Uganda with her 
husband, Dr. Pietro Corti. Despite threats, fear and the war, she 
continued for 34 years to provide care with devotion and skill. In 
1985, as the result of cutting herself during surgery, she became 
seropositive. Nonetheless, she continued her work until the end.
<P>
	She gave her life to relieve the suffering and misery of her 
African compatriots. Her unbeatable tenacity, her exceptional 
discipline and her courage made Lucille Teasdale a great Quebecer 
and we thank her.

	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when Reformers asked the minister of agriculture what he 
would do to improve the operations and accountability of the 
Canadian Wheat Board, the minister always dodged the question 
by saying wait for the report of his hand picked western grain 
marketing panel. Now this same minister ignores its 
recommendations. Why?
<P>
	In the ag minister's recent open letter to farmers he said that it is 
the quality of the support that he is considering more than the 
quantity. Read his lips. His opinions will take priority over the 
opinions of the majority of farmers. If the marketing panel's 
unanimous report is not a quality report, what else could possibly 
be good enough? Why did he even commission the panel of 
experts?
<P>
	The minister tries to excuse his inaction by saying this is a 
dispute between groups of farmers. Wrong. He is the one who has 
created and fuelled the division.
<P>
	Who should control the Canadian Wheat Board, prairie farmers 
or the minister and his bureaucrats? The minister's own weakness, 
indecisiveness and lack of action for the past three years is going to 
destroy a valuable marketing tool for western farmers.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="JOBCREATION">JOB CREATION</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
infrastructures program is the only job creation measure introduced 
by this government.
<P>
	The program has had an immediate and positive impact, 
although the jobs were only temporary. With respect to setting up a 
new program, the Government of Quebec has already made it clear 
that it would like to have responsibility for the projects and have 
the option of using money already budgeted or targeted for these 
job creation programs.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Could he tell us 
whether he and his government agree with the concerns expressed 
by the Government of Quebec with respect to setting up a new 
infrastructures program?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, at the conference we had with the provincial governments 
in June, I discussed with the premiers the possibility of continuing 
the infrastructures program next year.
<P>
	Since then, the federal Minister of Finance has met his 
provincial colleagues or will be meeting them to discuss what 
should be done to ensure we get results. We do not want this to be a 
substitute for normal expenditures by municipalities.
<P>
	Furthermore, the minister directly responsible for the 
infrastructures program, the President of the Treasury Board, has 
met the municipal affairs ministers. I think progress is being made. 
In fact, I made the offer myself in June, and at the time, a number 
of premiers took a negative position. It seems they may have 
changed their minds during the summer.
<P>
	The ministers are working on this, and we hope to be able to find 
common ground.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, right now, 
the problem is that, according to our information, the Minister of 
Finance and the President of the Treasury Board are more reluctant 
than their cabinet colleagues to introduce another infrastructures 
program. It so happens that the same two ministers are supposed to 
discuss the program's implementation.
<P>
	I would like to ask the Prime Minister, since his ministers do not 
all agree on the relevance of this kind of measure for stimulating 
job creation, whether he intends to make a decision very shortly so 
we will know exactly where the government stands?
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when I spoke to the provincial governments, the Minister 
of Finance was with me. And when I spoke to the Federation of 
Canadian Municipalities in Calgary, the President of the Treasury 
Board was in Calgary as well.
<P>
	However, we must ensure that the program is administered in 
such a way that it creates jobs and is not simply a substitute for 
normal expenditures by provincial or municipal governments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, does the 
Prime Minister realize that Canadians need jobs now and that it is 
therefore important for the government to act quickly when 
introducing a measure like this instead of waiting until it is a little 
closer to election time and then being tempted to use it for 
propaganda purposes. We need this kind of program now, and we 
would like to see action now. Will he keep that in mind?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to inform him that we have a program that is 
still operating now and that municipalities are using that program 
to create jobs.
<P>

<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4303"> 4303 </A></B>
<P>
	To cover up the unfair treatment being accorded Quebec in the 
area of funding for research and development, the Prime Minister 
is leaving out the figures for the national capital.
<P>
	Of the forty-four laboratories or federal research centres in the 
National Capital Region, forty-three are located in Ontario. Will 
the Prime Minister finally admit that most of the economic impact 
is going to Ontario's benefit rather than that of Quebec?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jon Gerrard (Secretary of State (Science, Research and 
Development)(Western Economic Diversification), Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there are historic reasons why the science and technology 
federal laboratories initially grew up in Ottawa.
<P>
	However, over the last 10 years a major effort has been made to 
correct this. Some of the recent federal laboratories, 10 or so of 
them, have been placed in Quebec. There are major initiatives to 
put the Canadian Space Agency in Saint-Hubert.
<P>
	As a result of these efforts, the federal spending on science and 
technology, when we include all the federal expenditures, is now 
very close in Quebec to the population of Quebec, which is about 
25 per cent.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, once again, the government is incapable of reading 
Statistics Canada's statistics. Despite all that has been added on for 
Quebec, we are still in the hole. We had 15 per cent, and with all the 
extramural additions, we are at 18.6 per cent, far from the 25 per 
cent of the population we represent.
<P>
	What, then, is the Prime Minister waiting for before treating 
Quebec fairly and giving it the share of R&amp;D spending to which its 
demographics entitle it?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Quebec is now receiving 22.3 per cent of all R&amp;D 
funding, and this year is getting $11.3 billion more than it has paid 
out in taxes to the federal government.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday the Prime Minister said that the defence 
minister and General Boyle had his full support.
<P>
	He said this despite the revelations of the Somalia inquiry, 
despite General Boyle's document fixing and buck passing, and 
despite the defence minister condoning these activities.
<P>
	Why does the Prime Minister continue to support the things that 
are wrong in the Canadian military: cover-up, lack of leadership, 
lack of accountability at the top, by refusing to fire the defence 
minister and General Boyle immediately?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I said very clearly yesterday that we are in a very 
important and difficult situation and changing the way things were 
done at national defence before. We have major operating cuts. We 
have a huge reduction of armed forces personnel. These things are 
very difficult to deal with.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	I said yesterday that what the military needs at this time is 
stability in leadership. One of the problems that created this 
situation is that under the previous administration there were six 
ministers of national defence in nine years. I do not believe a 
problem can be solved by playing the game of changing people 
every time the House of Commons asks for it. Real leadership is 
when there are good ministers doing a good job under difficult 
circumstances. The Minister of National Defence has my 
confidence.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister's idea of national defence seems to be 
defending the minister and his political appointee. He should be 
defending the men and women of the Canadian Armed Forces who 
are embarrassed by flaws in the top leadership and who are losing 
their respect for the Minister of National Defence. Instead, the 
Prime Minister chooses time and time again to defend his 
long-time political friend and his hand-picked chief of defence 
staff.
<P>
	Why has the Prime Minister decided to defend his political 
friends instead of the reputation and morale of the Canadian Armed 
Forces?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, a very long time before the leader of the third party came 
to Parliament the Minister of National Defence was a member of 
Parliament serving in the cabinet. It is because of his experience 
that I asked him to take on this very difficult task. He did not ask to 
go there; I asked him to take it over. I said: ``You will be there for a 
long time because I will not change my ministers every time the 
leader of the opposition or the leader of the third party gets up in 
the House''.
<P>
	As far as Mr. Boyle is concerned, he is not my political friend. I 
met him the day that I offered him the position of chief of staff, 
after recommendations from inside and from the Minister of 
National Defence.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister simply illustrates my point. I give him 
a chance to defend the reputation and morale of the Canadian 
Armed Forces and he immediately defends the reputation and 
morale of his political friends.
<P>
	The Prime Minister was wrong in his choice of Minister of 
National Defence and wrong in his support of General Boyle. In 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4304"> 4304 </A></B>
<P>
defending them he is really defending Liberal political interests 
and loyalties and failing to defend the national interests.
<P>
	Are the political interests and loyalties of Liberals really worth 
more to the Prime Minister than the reputation and morale of the 
Canadian Armed Forces?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is the first time in a long time that there has been an 
inquiry into national defence. When we have an inquiry in relation 
to a big organization such as this, of course it is going to be 
difficult. A commission is working on the situation and it will 
report.
<P>
	In the meantime, we have been reducing the number of bases, 
personnel and so on. It has been done in a very competent way, with 
no strikes and no disturbances.
<P>
	Of course some people do not agree. As the Minister of National 
Defence said yesterday, not everybody is happy. We used to have 
120 generals and we cut them by one-third. There was a surplus of 
generals and some had to go. We have to cut more. Those who are 
not happy can go. Some will have to go anyway. Those who are 
unhappy should be very happy not to be there.

	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in

stated: ``If and when there is another referendum, we will make 
sure that the question is clear, that the implications are clearly set 
out and that all Canadians have a say on the future of this country''.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Justice. In wishing to have the 
courts decide the wording of the referendum question, is the 
minister aware that he is placing the Government of Quebec under 
trusteeship, thus denying the people of Quebec the right to 
self-government?
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, yesterday I repeated the 
commitment we made in the throne speech, namely that, during the 
entire process of a referendum, it is very important that the 
question be clear and that an effort be made to ensure everyone is 
informed of the consequences. As I said yesterday, all Canadians 
must also have a role to play.
<P>
	All this is a question of Canada's future as a country. As I stated 
yesterday, we will our commitment is honoured.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
February 28, 1996, the Deputy Prime Minister stated that the 
federal government did not intend to hold a country-wide 
referendum on the question of Quebec sovereignty.
<P>
	Can the Minister of Justice tell us today whether the government 
has changed its mind and plans to hold a country-wide referendum 
on the future of Quebec?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, these questions arose in the context 
of a decision of the Quebec Superior Court deciding that matters 
involving the project of sovereignty very much fall within the 
jurisdiction of the court and that the Constitution relates directly to 
these questions.
<P>
	It was in that context that I said in the past and I repeated in the 
House yesterday that as the national government we are going to 
ensure that such matters are considered in the context of the law of 
the land. We are going to ensure that the political and the legal 
aspects of these matters are respected and that things are done in 
accordance with the values that we hold dear as Canadians.

Mr. Speaker, the most devastating cut to the Department of 
National Defence is when this government cut leadership, 
accountability and responsibility from the vocabulary at the 
Department of National Defence headquarters.
<P>
	The Liberals campaigned on a promise of more open 
government. Yet Canadians are shocked to learn of the policy of 
containment at the Department of National Defence and for the 
first time in Canadian history we find that this federal government 
has applied to the courts to suppress a document that was released 
by the information commission.
<P>

designed to thwart the information commissioner and designed to 
thwart information getting to the Canadian public?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and

hon. member was so caught up with his own rhetoric yesterday that 
he failed to listen to the question that was posed by the member 
from the Bloc Quebecois who asked this very question, so I would 
like to repeat the answer.
<P>
	We are going to court not to disagree in any way with the 
application of the Access to Information Act, but to safeguard the 
rights of a public employee. We believe that is paramount.
<P>
	I do not believe I should say any more except that the courts are 
to adjudicate matters where there is a dispute.
<P>
	The hon. member attacks this government as not being open. 
What could be more open than a public inquiry  under the Inquiries 
Act, under the glare of television lights where people give 
evidence? That is openness. That is what this government believes 
in.

<HR>
<B><A NAME="4305"> 4305 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the minister's comments are totally off track. We are 
not talking about the rights of an employee, we are talking about 
the rights of the Canadian public to know information that is being 
published by the information commissioner.
<P>
	For openness and accountability the Department of National 
Defence has the worst record in government. While this minister 
has been in office, documents have been lost, they have been 
altered, they have been destroyed, they have been withheld and the 
white-out budget at the Department of National Defence has gone 
through the roof.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister agree with the defence minister that 
openness means covering up and that truth, duty and valour mean 
don't get caught?
<P>
<B>(1435 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and

evidence that has been given at the inquiry. That is rather 
unfortunate.
<P>
	A process is in place and that process has to be fair to 
individuals. It has to be fair to all the evidence that comes out 
before the commission. It has to be fair to the commissioners and it 
has to be fair to the Canadian public.
<P>
	The hon. member has demonstrated that he does not have the 
degree of fairness in his political arsenal, his rhetorical arsenal. 
When it comes to the rights of individuals, again he is not being 
fair to a public employee whose rights have to be safeguarded. This 
government will safeguard that employee's rights by seeking 
adjudication by the courts.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Justice is playing the ``rule of law'' card, 
but what this really means is the rule of the majority of 
``Canadians'', wanting to impose their will on the people of 
Quebec.
<P>
	Does the minister realize that he is in the process of recreating 
the Meech Lake scenario, which allowed Newfoundland and 
Manitoba to decide Quebec's future?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General

suggesting that the rule of law somehow results in the oppression 
of anyone.
<P>
	It is crucially important to the population of Quebec as well as to 
the rest of Canada that everything we do in this country is 
consistent with legal principles.
<P>
	The rule of law and democracy go hand in hand, and the rule of 
law is not an obstacle to change. It permits change to take place in 
an orderly way. If that is seen in its proper context as part of 
democracy then one sees that the premise of the hon. member's 
question is quite wrong.
<P>
	It is troubling when an attorney general of a province, who is 
supposed to be the chief law enforcement officer of the province, 
leaves a courtroom and says that he will have nothing more to do 
with the case and that the result of the case is irrelevant to him or 
his plans. That is troubling. It is inconsistent with the values of the 
people of Quebec, the values of the people of this country.
<P>

Edward Island, smaller than some Quebec ridings, can decide 
Quebec's future. This kind of imposed democracy and majority 
have been only too familiar for a long time now.
<P>
	Behind the great aplomb and fine words of the Minister of 
Justice lies another reality, that of double standards. How can the 
minister tell us that all Canadians should be consulted when one

us, then we have to worry about a scenario in which there is a

country is separate and that Canada has come to an end. That is not

	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday the defence minister spoke of due process in the Somalia 
inquiry. Yet on August 28 before General Boyle had delivered his 
testimony and before Colonel Haswell had even started to testify, 
the minister publicly exonerated General Boyle and commended 
him as CDS. Those comments amounted to a blatant interference 
with the inquiry.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister condone this improper violation of 
due process by the very minister who commissioned the inquiry?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, one of the 
hallmarks of Canadian society is our fairness. It is our fairness to 
allow everybody to be heard, to have everyone's rights respected.
<P>
	What that means in the case of the Somalia inquiry is to receive 
all the documentation, hear from all the witnesses and then to have 
the impartial commissioners make a judgment. When they report, 
which is due in March of next year, the government will respond to 
that report. In the meantime, it would be fundamentally wrong and 
a denial of due process to comment on any of the proceedings.
<P>
	I would ask the hon. member to follow his own admonition.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this minister and his department have hampered the inquiry 
proceedings. He has intervened inappropriately, he is court 
marshalling a corporal who wanted to testify and he has taken the 
information commissioner to court to prevent him from doing his 
job.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister fail to see that his defence minister 
has condoned or even supported a culture of containment and cover 
up at national defence headquarters?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this government is one of complete openness. It  is the 
first time that we have had a complete inquiry. They have spent 
eight months debating all the elements not on Somalia but of the 
operation of the department. Now they have moved on the mandate 
to look into what happened in Somalia and they will report in due 
course. Let them do their jobs. I want everybody to let the chief of 
staff do his job and the minister of defence do his job.

	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Yesterday, in this House, the Prime Minister expressed his 
complete confidence in General Boyle and in his Minister of 
Defence. However, during his testimony before the Somalia 
inquiry, General Boyle admitted having violated the spirit of the 
Access to Information Act, and what is more, his own military 
police even concluded that he had lied to them.
<P>
	Is there not an ethical problem when a Prime Minister so blithely 
states his confidence in an individual who has admitted violating 
the spirit of a statute and who has made false declarations to the 
military police?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, once again we 
have to be fair. We have to be fair to everyone that appears before 
that inquiry and avoid jumping to conclusions.
<P>
	Making premature judgments, jumping to conclusions is a denial 
of a basic right that Canadians have and that is to be heard in an 
impartial setting. We have established the inquiry to provide that 
setting. I am sure that everyone in the country appreciates the 
process, if not the hon. member across the way.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
supplementary is directed to the Prime Minister.
<P>
	General Boyle himself admitted to the Commission that there 
was a lack of communication with his subordinates, that he did not 
know about the army's cover up operation, thus confessing to 
serious oversights.
<P>
	How could the Prime Minister state yesterday, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>General Boyle [-] is doing his job as he must. And he must continue to do so.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1445)</B>
<P>
	Does this mean that the Prime Minister approves of General 
Boyle's inept, and that is the least that could be said, performance 
of his duties?

<HR>
<B><A NAME="4307"> 4307 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, General Boyle stated what happens to everyone, which 
is that there arise in large administrations situations where the boss 
does not know all the details. He came right out and said so to 
the Commission. The Commission will draw the appropriate 
conclusions in the context of an inquiry that has already gone on 
for nine months.
<P>
	We would all sometimes like to see certain documents that are 
not shown to us, but in so far as we accept responsibility for a 
department and our duties, and do not shirk them, we must now 
wait and see what the Commission will have to say about this 
matter, and about everything to do with the Somalia inquiry.

	<B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Oakville-Milton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there has been considerable confusion about the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs' recent advisory about travel to Mexico. Is he 
advising Canadians not to travel to Mexico at all? Could the 
minister explain the situation and clarify it for the House?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the member for the question because I think there 
has been a good deal of misunderstanding and misapprehension.
<P>
	The Department of Foreign Affairs regularly issues travel 
advisories. There is nothing exceptional for the country of Mexico. 
We do them every month or so. All we have done is as we have 
done for the past several reports, which is to note that in certain 
Mexican states there has been some civil unrest. We are simply 
cautioning travellers or tourists not to go into those areas or to stay 
within the tourist areas and to carry identification. In no way does it 
constitute a warning. In no way does it say not to go to Mexico.
<P>
	I would tell any members of Parliament who have received 
requests from their constituents that we would be glad to supply 
full information on the travel advisory. Although the Reform Party 
clearly cannot read or does not care, I think most members of 
Parliament care about their constituents who must travel to 
Mexico.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the replies of both the Prime Minister and the Minister 
of National Defence today on the question of the mess at that 
department, we have received the ultimate in hypocritical answers 
by saying let the Somalia inquiry decide.
<P>
	It was the defence minister himself who tried to get a friend of 
the government appointed as a commissioner of  the inquiry. It is 
top military officials and officials of the department who have been 
implicated in fixing documents to be supplied to the commission. It 
is the government itself that has given legal help to some 
participants in the process but not others.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. If the Prime Minister 
believes in letting the commission do its work, why does he not fire 
the Minister of National Defence and General Boyle for failing to 
do so?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the commission has been sitting now for seven or eight 
months. It has asked questions day after day on national TV. 
Lawyers are asking questions. They are grilling public servants as 
if they were almost criminals. Everything is out in the open. We 
could not have a more open government. The three commissioners 
have been named. I know only one personally. One of them is a 
judge who I guess was appointed by a government other than ours. 
I do not know him at all and have never met him. No one can say 
that it is not an inquiry which is independent, open and has all the 
resources. In fact it is getting very expensive to look into the 
problem.
<P>
	We wanted to look into the Somalia incident as this House was 
committed to do. It has now taken seven months and it will 
probably take many more months. Even the Watergate affair in the 
United States was settled in six or seven weeks.
<P>
<B>(1450 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister did not address any of the points that I 
raised. If this is an open inquiry and we are supposed to let the 
inquiry do its work, why did he not comment on the defence 
minister's attempting to influence who were the commissioners? 
Why did he not comment upon the attempt to alter documents 
before the commission? Why did he not respond to anything about 
the uneven legal help that is given to some participants and not to 
others?
<P>
	The Prime Minister is getting pretty close to participating in the 
cover-up by the military.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, in our questions and our answers 
we are getting very close to using unparliamentary language and 
attributing motive.

public before the next federal election?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think that the leader of the third party needs more than a 
new haircut.
<P>
	Of course when the report is finished, the report will be tabled. I 
think the way the leader of the third party is acting in the House 
today, he will be competing very closely for the same level of votes 
in the next election as another reform leader in the United States,

<P>
	When she announced the television production fund, which will 
get 75 per cent of its budget from Heritage Canada, the minister

<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I believe that the decision 
to announce this programming fund was well received, not only by 
the Government of Quebec but also by the Minister of Culture, who 
said it was a step in the right direction for culture in Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, if 
it is a step in the right direction, here is my supplementary for the 
minister. Speaking of direction, the new board of directors will, for 
all practical purposes, be a board of cable companies.
<P>
	Does the minister realize that as a result, Téléfilm Canada will 
be run by the cable companies and the decision-making power will 
be transferred from Montreal to Toronto?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, no, on the contrary. With 
a new investment of $100 million we were able to produce 
economic benefits for independent producers, the majority of 
whom are located in Montreal, to the tune of $650 million. This 
represents 10,000 jobs in a cultural industry that is just as 
important in Montreal  as it is in Toronto, Vancouver and across the

Mr. Speaker, the minister of agriculture's cherished western grain 
marketing panel, his very own brain child, published a report that 
favoured much to the minister's chagrin many reforms that 
Reformers have suggested all along to modernize the grain 
marketing system. This was good news for the prairie economy. 
The bad news is that the minister is sending signals that he will 
ignore much of the multimillion dollar report.
<P>

as is his habit by ignoring the recommendations of his own hand 
picked panel?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, over the past many months I have 
listened very carefully to the farmers and others who have views to 
express on grain marketing.
<P>
	I would like to refer to an article that appeared in a newspaper in 
southwestern Saskatchewan earlier this month wherein the author 
is reporting on a poll that the author has taken. The author writes 
this: ``The most significant results were that 60 per cent of those 
polled were opposed to wide open dual marketing. Sixty-four per 
cent opposed the free market of grain by farmers into the United 
States''. On another point the author says: ``It is clear that most 
permit book holders in this constituency wish to retain single desk 
marketing for wheat''. The author is the member of Parliament for 
Swift Current-Maple Creek-Assiniboia.

	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the member's poll also indicated that the producers 
supported dual marketing for barley but the minister failed to 
mention that aspect.
<P>
	In this House, the minister indicated he put great faith in his 
hand picked panel, his very own creation. Now he is dropping the 
panel's report like a ton of bricks.
<P>
	The minister has led farmers down the garden path by telling 
them to wait for the panel's results. Now he is signalling that he 
will choose to ignore the unanimous recommendations of his very 
own panel. How can the minister justify his costly confusing and 
indecisive behaviour?

<P>
	In this case the author advises that the first responsibility of the

	In 1992 and 1994 the Liberal Party and caucus promised to

recognizing the harsh impact of the tax on literacy, on students and

raising taxes on reading in three Atlantic provinces through

by this government?
<P>

we are open to examine all possibilities. However, in the course of 
that examination there are a number of questions which must be 
answered. First, is that the best use of $140 million which is what 
would be the cost on the one hand? Also, is this the best way to

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-53, 
an act to amend the Prisons and Reformatories Act, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard St-Laurent (Manicouagan, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the purpose of this bill is to amend the Prisons and Reformatories 
Act.
<P>
	First of all, you may recall that this bill evolved in connection 
with a task force formed in 1993. The bill is the result of 
recommendations made by a federal-provincial, and of course also 
territorial, task force appointed by Correctional Services to 
recommend amendments to the legislation regulating temporary 
absences for offenders in provincial or territorial custody.
<P>
	Amendments were made by the ministers of Justice last May in 
1996. These amendments were proposed in response to requests 
from the provinces and territories. Their purpose is to remedy 
deficiencies in the legislation and to give the provinces and 
territories increased flexibility in administering their temporary 
absence programs.
<P>
	Provincial and territorial authorities had for some time 
expressed the need for updating the Prisons and Reformatories Act.
<P>
	This bill was read the first time on June 18, 1996. Since then, the 
Bloc Quebecois has thoroughly examined all the ramifications of 
this bill. The Bloc will now propose improvements in committee, 
since we assume the bill will pass second reading as is more or less 
customary, because on the whole, the bill seems quite acceptable. 
However, the Bloc would have-in any case I will make that 
suggestion to the Bloc and of course we have talked about it a 
little-three points which I think should be given closer consider-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4311"> 4311 </A></B>
<P>
ation and perhaps amended if possible, but in any case considered 
more closely. There  are some important elements that in my 
opinion were more or less overlooked.
<P>
	The principle of protecting society, which predominates in the 
Federal Parole Act, is absent from the general principles of this 
bill. It is included as one element among many others in section 7.1 
of the bill.
<P>
	In my opinion, it is ethically incorrect to claim all of a sudden 
that protecting society has now become of secondary importance in 
the formal legislative process. I think we should ask ourselves what 
should come first, if not protecting society, in this kind of 
legislation.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	Everything that we do here, all the legislation that we vote on, 
has as its purpose to improve the lot of society or to better protect 
it, which in the end comes down to improving the lot of society. 
When, as here, the term ``protection of society'' is relegated to a 
subclause in the bill, I think this is a bit dangerous.
<P>
	As you know, all good pieces of writing are the product of 
thought, but when there is an error in thought, we must question the 
material it gives rise to. It therefore seems important at this time to 
be sure, when using the term ``protection of society'', to include it 
in the basic general principles of Bill C-53. This is something that, 
in my opinion, the proposers should not have much trouble 
approving.
<P>
	I will now move on to a second aspect, which I will call Liberal 
subtlety. I would propose changing ``lieutenant governor'' to 
``lieutenant governor in council'', and therefore more specifically 
the provincial cabinet. This choice of term represents the reality 
and leaves provincial governments with complete discretion in this 
area. The present wording of the bill is confusing.
<P>
	Using the term lieutenant governor means that one person 
appointed by the Prime Minister of Canada, if memory serves, will 
be making the decision about, or at least will have a large say in, 
what happens to paroled inmates. At a time when there is talk of 
decentralization, when the Liberals are talking about 
decentralization, mark my words, the Bloc Quebecois will give the 
Liberals a golden opportunity to put their money where their mouth 
is and give the cabinet of each province, rather than the lieutenant 
governor as provided in the bill, the right to determine certain 
questions.
<P>
	This is, therefore, an excellent opportunity to stop merely talking 
about delegation and redistribution to the provinces, and to actually 
do it, by just adding the words ``in council'' after ``lieutenant 
governor''. It ought not to be difficult, either. We in the Bloc 
Quebecois do not consider it a difficult thing to delegate to the 
provinces, naturally, but we shall see. Let us just let things take 
their course.
<P>
	The third element is a little more complicated and takes a bit 
more explaining. In clause 7.4(1), the duration  of a temporary 
absence is lengthened from 15 to 60 days. I must admit that I have a 
little trouble living with that, and the Bloc will have to work on this 
in order to propose proper modifications for, as it stands, with my 
own personal experience in this area, and judging from what my 
contacts have had to say, I can see that this does nothing to improve 
the quality-we are back to where we were just a while ago-of 
protection for society.
<P>
	The principle is that an individual is given parole, and has to 
report every two weeks so things may be assured of working out 
properly and developments monitored. The individual must 
change, must learn to live in society as well.
<P>
	So, a follow-up is done every two weeks; that is the case now. 
The new act calls for this to be done every 60 days, a period four 
times longer, when already the individual can get round things now. 
I will provide you with some interesting statistics. I have figures 
for a number of years, but I will limit myself to those for April 1, 
1995 to March 31, 1996, because of the time.
<P>
	It will be seen that 73 per cent of paroles are successful. In other 
words, 73 of every 100 people released are successful. That is all 
very nice, but what about the other 27 percent?
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	However, we must not forget that the remaining 27 per cent must 
be divided in two. There are people who breach parole for technical 
reasons. For instance, someone who was prohibited from being in a 
bar, in a drinking establishment, is seen there and returned to 
custody because he breached his parole. He did not commit a 
crime, let us be clear on that. It is not a crime to be in a drinking 
establishment although it may be prohibited as one of the terms of 
parole. It is merely a breach of parole, so it is a technical 
misdemeanour. There is no danger to society.
<P>
	Seventeen per cent of offenders fail in this respect. We have the 
remaining 10 per cent whose parole was withdrawn because they 
had committed a crime. Imagine. This is where I make the 
connection between 15 and 60 days. These people were seen every 
15 days, and the authorities were unable to find out when they were 
about to commit a crime. Ten per cent, and we are talking about 
2,500 people, that is a lot.
<P>
	So I do not think the results will be better if we take this 
fifteen-day period and multiply it by four. I find it very hard to 
believe that society will be better off, that the individual himself 
will be better off and that consequently, citizens will be better 
protected.
<P>
	Unless we find a miracle solution, and a number of solutions 
have been tried within prison walls, I can guarantee you that, the 
problem will not be solved by leaving people who need supervision 
to their own devices. Of course they should not be oversupervised, 
since they need some time for themselves in order to  become part 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4312"> 4312 </A></B>
<P>
of society again, to become part of the normal processes in a 
society. But they must be supervised just the same.
<P>
	At the present time, it is estimated that every two weeks requires 
a certain amount of staff, but there are results. Multiplying this 
period by four will only save on the number of people working for 
the solicitor general. There will be fewer parole officers to follow 
up each case. I feel the loser in this case is society. And also the 
individual who needs a leg up to get back into society and needs 
some supervision in the process. He is not being helped either. He 
is not being helped at all, but is being left even more to his own 
devices, and society as a whole is paying the price.
<P>
	One favourable improvement is noted, however, a rather obvious 
one. I am referring to clause 7.6, which I will take the time to read, 
as it is very short:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>7.6 (1) A designated authority who suspends, cancels or revokes a prisoner's 
temporary absence, or a person designated by that authority, may have a warrant or 
notice of suspension, cancellation or revocation issued for his or her apprehension 
and recommittal.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In order to review briefly what used to happen, let us take the 
case of an individual, one of whose conditions of parole was not to 
enter a drinking establishment but who was seen in such an 
establishment. When the individual reported to his officer, every 15 
days, if he was assessed by the officer, he would have had to go 
before the parole board to determine whether or not he had 
breached the conditions of his parole; the group in question decided 
that there had, in fact, been a breach. At that time, if the individual 
was not present, for example, he was deemed to have been in 
breach, but all that came out of it was a document, a report from the 
board. This report stated that the individual in question was in 
breach, and was no longer eligible to be on parole, but he was no 
longer there.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	They tried to give this to the police, who told them that it was 
just a report from the board and not a warrant, and that they could 
not execute it. It is worthless to law enforcement officers, it is of no 
use to them.
<P>
	With this new change, the document from the board in question 
has the force of a warrant, the force of law. It can be given to a 
police authority and the officers will be able to move quickly to 
arrest the individual who has breached his conditions of parole.
<P>
	Briefly, in my opinion and in the opinion of some members of 
the Bloc, this is the essential point. We have looked into this, and 
will have to do so again, in order to put the final touches on a 
presentation to the committee that will be looking at Bill C-53 in 
second reading. The Bloc will, as a minimum, be looking at the 
three elements I have just spoken to you about, in order to verify 
whether it would be possible to improve the bill a bit.
<P>
	As you will have concluded, the Bloc Quebecois gives its 
support, in principle, to Bill C-53, but this does not mean we are 
dropping the three elements I have referred to, particularly the last, 
which strikes me as the place where it will get hung up, if 
anywhere. This is where the two parties may not see eye to eye, 
because the jump from 15 to 65 days is a bit too much.
<P>
	As for the first element, all that is required is to insert the term 
``protection of society'' in the general principles of the bill, instead 
of later on, where it gets lost in the shuffle. I imagine it ought to be 
rather easy for the proposers to support such a proposal. The other 
change is to add ``in council'' after ``lieutenant governor'', which 
would enable the provinces to decide fully, rather than the 
lieutenant governor.
<P>
	These are the key points the Bloc considers to be real 
improvements to Bill C-53. If we are passing it, let us take 
advantage of the opportunity. The books are already open, so let us 
take advantage of the opportunity to add the right words in the right 
places. The Bloc supports Bill C-53 in second reading, and gives its 
agreement in principle.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to address Bill C-53. I cannot say that I and 
my party are in agreement with the bill. We are not. However, it 
does give me an opportunity again to address some of the major 
concerns which the people of the country have been expressing to 
me over the summer months and before. It is not just in my riding 
that people are very upset with criminal justice matters. This 
concern is found in every riding across the country.
<P>
	Members opposite know full well that the criminal justice 
system is hurting and needs a lot of reformation.
<P>
	Bill C-53 is an act to amend the Prisons and Reformatories Act. 
It would add a statement and a purpose to temporary absence 
programs and authorize the provinces to create additional types of 
temporary absence programs.
<P>
	The purpose and principles set out in the bill are almost identical 
to those set out in the Corrections and Conditional Release Act. 
There is, however, one significant exception. The principle that the 
protection of society is to be the paramount determination of any 
case is not repeated in this bill. If this is to be the paramount 
consideration when dealing with conditional release under the 
Corrections and Conditional Release Act, it is not clear why this 
would also not be the paramount consideration regarding 
temporary absence at a provincial level.
<P>
	The Reform Party opposes the bill because it places the 
rehabilitation and integration of criminals ahead of any 
consideration for the protection of society.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4313"> 4313 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	Canada is long overdue for significant readjustments to our 
liberal justice process. Protection of society must once again 
become our paramount consideration when dealing with and 
deciding to reintroduce offenders into our communities.
<P>
	Even at the present stage, prior to anything this bill may offer, 
there are serious considerations and violations for those offenders 
who have walked into our society, who have reoffended and who 
have done terrible damage to those communities in which they 
were placed often without the knowledge of the people in those 
communities.
<P>
	Let me state what has become painfully obvious for a great 
majority of Canadians. The criminal justice system, including 
corrections, parole, court administration and the Young Offenders 
Act, has failed to meet the expectations of the majority of our 
citizens.
<P>
	People today question the entire process and they have lost 
confidence in the government's ability to ensure personal safety 
and to protect private property.
<P>
	I have had the opportunity to go door to door throughout my 
constituency. The number two item of concern to most of my 
constituents has been criminal justice and their safety.
<P>
	It did not matter if it had been them personally who had been 
victimized but certainly a neighbour or a friend close by they were 
referring to. That was their concern.
<P>
	They feel the justice system is not dealing with those concerns 
adequately. As a result, most Canadians no longer believe the 
promise of welfare state criminology, that crime will fall 
proportionate to increased social spending and wealth 
redistribution by government.
<P>
	That seems to be what is driving our criminal justice system. 
Critics of the current system argue that one of the more immediate 
threats facing Canadian society is a criminal justice system that is 
no longer effective at deterring crime because it has lost its will to 
punish and correct criminal behaviour.
<P>
	They point out that three decades of correctional experiments in 
which many violent, serious and repeat criminals have been forced 
against their will to participate in rehabilitation programs have 
proven costly and largely ineffective.
<P>
	That is what is happening inside. Suffice it to say there exists a 
great deal of concern with respect to the early release of violent and 
repeat offenders.
<P>
	Canadians are dismayed because the principles of truth or 
honesty in sentencing no longer seem to apply in our justice 
system. How often have we heard the judge say eight years and yet 
the parole board turns around and says released in one-third, two 
years or three years?
<P>
	That is not truth in sentencing. The Canadian people would like 
to see a sentence given and that time served. The chasm between 
appearance and reality in sentencing criminals due to plea 
bargaining and parole has fueled demands for significant changes 
to the system, specifically truth in sentencing and violent strike 
legislation.
<P>
	I had an opportunity to travel into the state of Ohio during the 
summer. In the area where I was, there was a prison that housed 
5,000 state prisoners. What was significant was that on questioning 
the deputy warden in that institution, they were preparing 
themselves for truth in sentencing legislation that had just been 
enacted in their legislature. Truth in sentencing. They were 
preparing to take those prisoners and hold them in jail.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	They found it to be cheaper holding them in jail than to release 
them and have them reoffend time and time again, where the costs 
were filtered down to the municipalities with investigations, courts 
and everything else, and that is the concern in Canada.
<P>
	Critics also point out the problems within our correctional 
system such as the unfettered flow of illegal drugs within the 
system. I was at a press conference this morning where that topic 
came forward. Bleach kits and condoms were the order of the day 
and are the order of the day in our federal penitentiaries. If that is 
the way Correctional Service Canada responds to a problem within 
its walls, then we have a major problem on our hands when 
offenders walk out the door.
<P>
	They will still have their drug problems and will commit crime 
as a result. The health risks to both the prison population and the 
staff that look after them will increase tremendously as it is right 
now and has been pointed out by the last series of stats that reflects 
a 46 per cent known increase in HIV-AIDS within the prison walls.
<P>
	The source of the drug problem in our prisons is a result of the 
visitors program. In other words, they take advantage of the 
restriction under the charter with regard to search and seizure. A 
guard cannot single out an individual and say we are searching you. 
They have to take them at face value and have just cause to do so.
<P>
	Critics also point out to the lack of meaningful work programs 
within the present system. Skill based training programs are being 
phased out and replaced by cognitive skills training, moral 
reasoning and anger management courses. Mandatory work 
activities are not required.
<P>
	To enlarge on cognitive skills training certificates and anger 
management course certificates, many prisoners I have talked to 
who have been released and were serious about job hunting and the 
like would present these certificates to their perspective employers 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4314"> 4314 </A></B>
<P>
and time and time again the reply was: ``Well, what can you do?'' 
Correctional Service Canada's system does not prepare  an offender 
for his release to go into the job market. I think that is a shame.
<P>
	The Liberal government has time and time again talked about its 
compassion and yet a prisoner in a federal institution does not 
receive basic training because of these pie in the sky courses being 
offered in their place.
<P>
	Mandatory work activities are not required. Another problematic 
issue is the taxpayer funded amenities for prisoners. Inmates are 
granted luxuries which many law abiding citizens are not, 
including but not limited to access to golf courses, GST rebates, 
cable TV, legal aid, lavish work facilities, free counselling, full 
medical and dental with no line ups, free university education and 
the ability to refuse to work.
<P>
	A general feeling exists that because we have made prison 
conditions too easy it has undercut the deterrent effect of 
imprisonment. There is whole group of people involved in the area 
of prisoners' rights. There are advocates, lawyers, prisoners' rights 
groups inside and out and they scream at anyone who opposes the 
present or the status quo.
<P>
	Anyone who does is condemned and the finger is pointed; the 
archaic thinking that goes on with those who oppose the present 
system. It is inhumane to think of anything otherwise.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	The general public does not buy these noisy nabobs. It is even 
critical of the system and the advocates who keep liberalizing it. As 
far as I am concerned these criticisms are justified. Canadian 
recidivism rates are between 50 and 85 per cent depending on who 
we talk to. Contrary to the claim that crime is decreasing, the 
incident of criminal activity today is at a level three times greater 
than it was 30 years ago.
<P>
	Prison facilities are at or near capacity and sometimes the 
accusation or the comment is that they are overflowing. New 
correction facilities must be planned or in the absence of such 
preparation more offenders will be released on the streets or 
released on temporary absence.
<P>
	Temporary absence is the substance of Bill C-53, the legislation 
currently before the House. With respect to this legislation 
Reformers are guided by our party policy as found in the blue book, 
the justice section, sections A, which reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Reform Party supports a judicial system which places the punishment of crime 
and the protection of law-abiding citizens and their property ahead of all other 
objectives.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I would like to talk a bit about what we are committed to do. The 
number one priority of our criminal justice system ought to be the 
protection of law-abiding Canadians and their property. I know we 
can read in some documents that are presented by the members  
across away that this is the paramount consideration or this is the 
mandate of whatever bill they may pass. In this one they do not 
mention it at all.
<P>
	What has been happening in our system? It is becoming more 
and more liberal and the concerns of people in the constituencies 
across this country reflect it. This year in my city alone of Calgary 
somewhere in the neighbourhood of five pedophiles were operating 
all within a two or three week period and several of them had been 
on release. One had been released even after he refused treatment 
in the penitentiary. Within three months after being driven from 
High River, a small town south of Calgary, he went into Calgary 
and it just so happened to be in my riding that he attacked another 
young girl.
<P>
	These considerations must be taken into account when offenders 
such as pedophiles are released into the community. This bill does 
nothing to address these concerns. This bill operates in the opposite 
fashion. It will release earlier and for longer periods of time people 
who are incarcerated.
<P>
	Reformers are wholly committed to placing the rights of victims 
ahead of the so-called rights and considerations of criminals. Our 
party reflects adequately the statement and the presentation of the 
victims' bill of rights by the member for Fraser Valley West, a 
Reformer, which was presented in this House and adopted by the 
governing party, the Liberal government. That consideration is 
there, but let us act on it.
<P>
	Since Bill C-53 would consider prisoner rehabilitation and 
reintegration as equal to the consideration for the protection of 
society, Reformers oppose the bill, as it places the rights of 
criminals ahead of those of the victims.
<P>
	Bill C-53, an extension of the Corrections and Conditional 
Release Act, would expand the scope and the number of temporary 
release programs in Canada. Do we need more?
<P>
<B>(1545 )</B>
<P>
	A study by the National Institute of Justice in the United States 
reflected that the cost of incarceration was one-half that of release, 
and that the recidivism rate, the following investigations and court 
action resulted in double the costs. That is what is happening.
<P>
	From the appearance of this bill, the government intends to pass 
other laws to release more people. It has never adequately studied 
the issue of the cost of crime in our country. Before we get more 
laws on the books some research should be done to find out exactly 
what the problem is and what costs are involved. However, that 
does not seem to be the way or intent of this Liberal government.
<P>
	Past experience has demonstrated that the temporary absence 
program, especially for violent, serious and  repeat offenders, can 
jeopardize public safety. All one has to do is look at the Daniel 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4315"> 4315 </A></B>
<P>
Gingras case. I am not saying that Daniel Gingras will be released 
again or that kind of scenario will be repeated, but it could very 
well happen. It happened then because he was given a birthday 
pass, which was up to Corrections Canada. He escaped when he 
was in the West Edmonton Mall and subsequently raped and killed 
two people, unsuspecting victims.
<P>
	The concept of temporary absence illustrates that there is little 
truth or honesty in sentencing. Many Canadians feel this approach 
is wrong, specifically that criminals owe a debt to society and this 
debt should be paid through the full uninterrupted service of 
sentence. Is that too much to ask? Are the Canadian people asking 
too much when they say: ``If a man is sentenced to 15 years, he 
should do 15 years?'' I do not think so. It is high time the 
government started to listen to statements from right across the 
country about the concern over early release.
<P>
	Programs of temporary absence are an extension of status quo 
correctional philosophy which argues, first, that most criminals 
commit crimes because they themselves are victims and, second, 
that crime is mostly a product or a result of social conditions and 
that the most effective remedy is for the state to intervene through 
programs such as stepped up welfare payments and other social 
experiments.
<P>
	Nowhere is punishment mentioned in this scenario. It is 
becoming evident by the treatment of prisoners in jails that 
punishment is not part of the scenario.
<P>
	Temporary absence is another in a long list of language which is 
preferred and used by welfare state criminologists, which includes 
conditional release, mandatory supervision, statutory release, 
community sentencing, alternative measures and other newer 
labels which are essentially built on the same theme. They build on 
the notion that the purpose of imprisonment is rehabilitation and 
that the best measure of an inmate's rehabilitative progress is his 
conduct in prison. The conduct of an individual in prison will 
certainly be different than it is out in the street. He will be restricted 
to some degree.
<P>
	The murderer who shot the policeman has been a good boy for 
eight years. He has not done anything seriously wrong. Maybe he 
smoked a few joints in prison because there is a good flow of drugs 
in there, but he has really done nothing wrong. That thinking and 
that philosophy are not acceptable to the majority of people in the 
country.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	The problem is that very little consideration is given to the crime 
and its impact on the victims which made it necessary for society to 
imprison the offender in the first place.
<P>
	Reform is sympathetic to opponents of the status quo correction 
and parole system who argue that substantial crime savings can be 
made through deterrence rather than through programs of 
temporary release and legislation such as Bill C-53. I do not see 
deterrence in Bill C-53. Nor do I see accountability mentioned in 
Bill C-53.
<P>
	The key instruments of deterrence are the certainty and severity 
of punishment. Deterrence prevents crimes from occurring when 
the potential offenders, considering the risks and severity of 
punishment, decide to commit fewer crimes.
<P>
	When I joined the police department over 25 years ago we were 
instructed as new recruits that having a man in uniform in a marked 
police car travelling about a community, going to the parks and 
playgrounds, had a deterrent effect. The law was clear. If a 
pedophile was out there among children he would be arrested. That 
was a deterrent effect. The pedophile would be taken off the street, 
charged and held in prison until he went to court and, once 
convicted, that was where he stayed. That was a deterrent. The 
certainty of punishment and the enforcement agency's clear 
concern for community standards and safety were deterrents.
<P>
	That does not exist today. The pedophiles that happened to be in 
my city over the summer had no fear. Finally, through the efforts of 
the community, one was removed because he was getting 
aggressive when walking among children in a wading pool.
<P>
	Logically the number of people willing to commit crimes 
decreases as the danger of punishment increases.
<P>
	I reflect on another situation which occurred when I was 
investigating major crimes in Calgary. It was a situation where a 
store owner, a pharmacist, who had been robbed five times finally 
told the offender in court one day: ``Do not ever come back into my 
store. I will get you. I will be ready for you''.
<P>
	It just so happened that the criminal was brazen enough to take 
him up on the dare. He went into the store to rob him for the sixth 
time. What the criminal did not realize was that the pharmacist had 
a shotgun behind the counter. When the offender walked through 
the door he was chased out of the store, shot and killed.
<P>
	That was a deterrent. The store owner was charged and went to 
court. A jury found him not guilty. There was not a drug store 
robbery in Calgary for two years. That is a deterrent.
<P>
	Business owners and homeowners are tired of having to put up 
with a non-committal criminal justice system which has no 
deterrent in it and no punishment.
<P>
<B>(1555 )</B>
<P>
	As an alternative to the status quo correctional philosophy to 
which Bill C-53 is simply an extension, we propose a dramatic and 
immediate overhaul of  corrections, parole and sentencing. 
Specifically we propose truth in sentencing for violent and repeat 
serious 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4316"> 4316 </A></B>
<P>
criminals. Those offenders would serve a minimum of 90 per cent 
of their court prescribed sentence.
<P>
	Truth in sentencing would apply to any individual who is 
convicted of an indictable offence or of any other crime deemed 
violent or serious under the provisions set out in the Criminal 
Code.
<P>
	Truth in sentencing is needed instead of temporary absence 
programs because convicted violent criminals and serious 
offenders are serving a fraction of their time in prison compared to 
the sentence received at trial. Truth in sentencing will increase the 
length of time convicted, serious offenders are incarcerated.
<P>
	In Canada, an offender who has served one-third or seven years, 
whichever is less of his or her sentence of incarceration becomes 
eligible for full parole. I think that is going to change. Inmates who 
have not been released on parole after having served two-thirds of 
their sentence are released by law to serve the final third of their 
sentence in the community.
<P>
	If required to serve at least 90 per cent of their sentence, violent 
criminals and serious offenders would serve longer sentences, 
resulting in the prevention of crime which would otherwise be 
committed by criminals out on early release. In short, Bill C-53 
wants to expand early release through the expansion of temporary 
absence.
<P>
	National Parole Board data confirms that even the most violent 
and serious offenders serve on average only about one-half of their 
prison sentence. One of its studies showed that individuals 
convicted of attempted murder, for example, served an average of 
48 months where the court ordered sentence was 94 months. In the 
case of manslaughter the actual time served by the offender 
averaged 44 months, where the original court sentence was 84 
months. In the case of rape or aggravated assault, the average 
offender was released after serving 49 months of a 79 month 
sentence. That is not truth in sentencing.
<P>
	Instead of expanding temporary absence programs and putting 
the rights of criminals ahead of the consideration for victims and 
law-abiding Canadians, the government should consider longer 
sentences for violent offenders because longer sentences will result 
in the reduction in the crime rate by preventing these offenders 
from recidivating. Requiring them to serve 90 per cent of their 
sentences will almost double the time they spend in prison and of 
course prevent crimes these offenders would likely commit in the 
community. The recidivism rate, as I pointed out, is somewhere in 
the neighbourhood of 70 per cent, most wardens tell us.
<P>
	Two violent strikes and you are out. Reformers are proposing 
two violent strikes laws to which violent criminals and sex 
offenders would be subject. We say that  for every criminal who is 
convicted of a violent crime for a second time, he or she should be 
sentenced to imprisonment for life without eligibility for early 
release or parole.
<P>
	We believe that two violent strikes laws signify a tough, realistic 
approach to crime and would get multiple offenders off the street 
and into prison where they belong.
<P>
	Critics of two strike proposals raise the cost of incarceration as 
an issue. Indeed, many of these same critics use cost as an 
argument to further the case for temporary absence programs. 
These people say that it is less costly for society to release 
criminals on a temporary basis than it is to supervise them on 
extended temporary leave in the community. To this objection I say 
two things.
<P>
	First, it stands to reason that contrary to the claims by those who 
advance welfare state criminology, two strikes legislation will 
actually save societal cost by eliminating trial after trial of the 
same repeat offenders.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	As a police officer I saw the revolving door. I think of my time, 
for instance, in the robbery unit of the Calgary city police 
department and how offenders would come through. They would be 
picked up, convicted, into prison they would go and within two to 
three years we were picking up and putting into prison the same 
offenders. That is the revolving door and that is reality. Often they 
were on parole. Seventy per cent to seventy-five per cent were drug 
abusers. Even though they had spent their time in prison they were 
still plagued with a drug habit because they could not shake it 
inside the prison system due to the flow and availability of drugs. 
That is our system and people want it changed.
<P>
	This issue goes beyond statistics and projections of costs. The 
need to control violent crime is about who we are and what we hope 
to become as a society. Canadians deserve to feel safe in their 
homes at night and secure in the morning when they send their 
children off to school. Canadians will not live in the state of fear, 
our daily lives held hostage by a lawless few.
<P>
	Notwithstanding everything that has been said, we are aware that 
there have been problems with the American application of three 
strikes legislation. Critics of two strikes legislation often cite the 
discrepancy in the severity of crimes covered by the law. An often 
repeated story involves a California man who was sentenced to life 
without parole for stealing a slice of pizza.
<P>
	Let there be no mistake about that issue to which I speak today. 
Reform planned an alternative to legislation like Bill C-53. I point 
out that many of the proposals that I speak of here today will be 
brought before our caucus for final ratification at one point. The 
Reform plan clearly defines what is a violent offence. Hence, there 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4317"> 4317 </A></B>
<P>
will be little or no chance for a pizza thief to face a  mandatory life 
sentence upon conviction, which is what happened in California.
<P>
	We also propose hard time prison sentences. We have a proposal 
to return prison time to hard time. We believe that the time spent in 
prison should not be a place any criminal would ever want to return 
to. A prisoner should not want to go back. Amenities currently 
afforded to inmates such as colour and cable TV, taxpayer funded 
university education, lavish workout facilities, special meals and 
holiday pay should be eliminated. That is quite a list.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Canada pension?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> Yes, Canada pension is probably thrown in there 
too. That is quite a list for people who have offended in this country 
and tossed into prison. Those rights should be removed and 
removed now.
<P>
	Corrections Canada spends more than it ever has on costly and 
largely ineffective rehabilitation programs for prisoners. The drug 
rehabilitation program is one. Five million dollars was spent in 
1994 on drug rehabilitation. To what avail? Drugs still flow into the 
prison. Prisoners still leave with the drug habits they entered with 
because of the availability of drugs inside. Those are facts.
<P>
	Why is the Liberal government not addressing those concerns?
<P>
	It is also true for sex offenders. In the 1993-94 budget of 
corrections Canada there was a total of $98 million for inmate 
programs described as education and personal development, 
occupational development programs and employment, spiritual, 
social, cultural and special needs programs.
<P>
	We affirm as Reformers the government's responsibility to 
guarantee a minimal level of care to all convicted inmates: basic 
food and shelter, basic medical treatment, clothing and a 
rehabilitative framework based on the inmate's initiative. We also 
recognize that the rehabilitation of inmates shall be based upon 
incentives and merit. You earn your way.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	A guaranteed system of initiatives shall determine the level of 
discipline. We propose that the framework for this system shall be 
set up in a way that clearly presents the relationship between the 
severity of the crime for which they are imprisoned and their 
demonstrated willingness to seek rehabilitation.
<P>
	In other words, it is a self-rehabilitative program. Under our 
model, temporary absences would be a rare occurrence, especially 
for the violent offender. Maximum security institutions would 
house violent and serious offenders who are considered dangerous 
or who are serving true life sentences.
<P>
	The program would be guided by the following principles: 
labour intensive work details without pay or skills training, no 
conjugal visits, only a core duty of care,  restricted access on a very 
limited basis to entertainment and communications.
<P>
	That was the maximum prison. We suggest that medium security 
prisons should house non-violent offenders and only those who 
have a proven willingness to participate in rehabilitative programs 
out of the maximum security institutions.
<P>
	These positions would not be permanent. Any misbehaviour or 
loss of inmate initiative would result in the inmate's being returned 
to the maximum security.
<P>
	Right now the process is the exact opposite. The pressure is on 
the maximum-medium to keep pushing down the inmates lower 
and lower, to re-evaluate their risk assessment. That is what is 
happening inside right now. Change the risk assessment to get them 
out of those maximum institutions into the medium, change the 
risk assessment to get them out of the medium into the minimum. 
That is what is happening.
<P>
	The program should consist of the following. Inmates will work 
in print shops, carpentry, machine shops and garment production. 
Some of those things exist right now. Machine shops are being 
phased out in many institutions. What is replacing them? 
Educational programs. Prisoners will be given the opportunity to 
upgrade their formal education based on compliance with the 
prison rules.
<P>
	Authority must be turned back too to the staff that run these 
prisons. We suggest that minimal compensation commence at this 
level. We would also allow a pay and trust up to $5,000 for the 
inmate to ensure that he has adequate resources upon release from 
prison.
<P>
	What does it stand at right now? It is $80 after an inmate has 
served a substantial length of time. He has $80 in his pocket when 
he walks out the door. Is that adequate? What will he do if he 
cannot get a job right away? He will go back to crime.
<P>
	That direction must be taken away. That thought must be taken 
away from them and they should be given something productive 
inside. They are obliged to work in the system. At this point 
prisoners would earn increased access to entertainment and 
communications after they have earned it.
<P>
	With respect to minimum security facilities, we would propose 
they be run on the following principles. Minimum security prisons 
shall house non-violent offenders and those who have earned the 
privilege at this level, again the non-violent.
<P>
	Work crews and apprenticeship programs will be trade oriented. 
They will be required to participate in some fashion in a work 
program. There will be a day pass system to encourage 
employment in private industry.
<P>
	Sixty per cent of inmate pay would be applied to the inmate's 
room and board. Twenty per cent would be directed to the victim of 
the crime for which the individual is serving time and the 
remaining 20 per cent would be placed in trust for the inmate's
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4318"> 4318 </A></B>
<P>
family or for the inmate upon release. There would be increased 
privileges, in particular conjugal visits, and they would be only on 
the minimum security level.
<P>
<B>(1610 )</B>
<P>
	In addition, Reform believes the following reforms must be 
considered: non-voting privileges, no children in prisons. I have 
seen it said time and time again: ``I went to see daddy in prison''. 
How far do we carry that or the conjugal visit home? Is that a place 
to bring children? No pornography, personal TVs or stereos. All of 
these are on the commissioner's directives. Yet there is no 
enforcement in this area.
<P>
	Reform believes these are the concerns Bill C-53 should focus 
on and not a program of temporary absence whereby prisoners' 
rights are given higher consideration than the protection of society. 
One has to ask why this bill is coming into being? It would appear 
it is as a result of a financial concern. In other words, it is too costly 
to keep them inside.
<P>
	Reform believes a graduated system of accountability must be 
revisited in order to place the principle of individual accountability 
back into the prison system. Inmates no more than any other 
Canadian should not be able to take their position for granted.
<P>
	The Reform Party's vision for the future of Canadian corrections 
is that responsible and co-operative behaviour will lead to 
privileges and perhaps transfer of deserving inmates to a less 
restrictive facility. Misbehaviour and infraction will mean the loss 
of privileges and even the return to a higher level of incarceration.
<P>
	Canadians want to see some substantial reform in this whole area 
of incarceration. It is too bad these principles are not reflected in 
Bill C-53.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> We will now proceed to the 
next stage of Bill C-53, in which speeches are limited to 20 minutes 
and subject to a 10-minute question and comment period.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to 
Bill C-53 at second reading.
<P>
	This bill proposes amendments to the current Prisons and 
Reformatories Act that would strengthen and modernize the 
statutory framework that governs temporary absence programs for 
offenders in provincial and territorial custody.
<P>
	I think the hon. member for Calgary Northeast did not 
understand this. I hope Reform members will follow the example 
of their Bloc colleagues and support this bill.
<P>
	The bill would benefit the provinces and territories by providing 
them with a more flexible legislative framework to meet the 
diverse circumstances of their individual jurisdictions. It is a 
balanced response to growing concerns by provinces and territories 
that the existing temporary absence legal framework for offenders 
in provincial and territorial custody is too limited and outdated.
<P>
	It should be noted that many of the same issues such as the 
expansion of the types of temporary absences and their duration 
were addressed for penitentiary inmates in 1992 when the new 
Corrections and Conditional Release Act was enacted.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Now we have once again the member of Parliament from 
Calgary Northeast saying we should remodernize the whole 
correctional system. It was done in 1992. The provinces and the 
territories have recognized that similar changes are required for 
provincial and territorial inmates. That is what Bill C-53 addresses. 
It does not address the panoply of concerns the member raised. I 
think he is confusing the issue.
<P>
	These amendments were developed in full consultation with 
provincial and territorial governments. They were approved by the 
federal-provincial-territorial ministers responsible for justice in 
May of this year. I might add that they are an excellent illustration 
of federal, provincial and territorial co-operation.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As hon. members will know, the Prisons and Reformatories Act 
is a federal statute which governs how sentences under the 
Criminal Code and other statutes will be administered.
<P>
	This stems from the federal responsibility for criminal law. 
However, it is our provincial and territorial partners who must 
implement this legislation. It is therefore incumbent upon us to 
ensure that there is adequate flexibility for them to meet their own 
unique circumstances as they see fit, without undue limitation.
<P>
	Consequently, a joint federal-provincial-territorial task force 
was convened to develop the amendments we see before us today.
<P>
	As I said, the bill would make amendments to key areas 
governed by the Prisons and Reformatories Act.
<P>
	First, there is the addition of a statement of purpose and principle 
for temporary absence programs. This is something new for 
provincial temporary absences. It is modelled on the statement of 
purpose and principle which was created in 1992 in the Corrections 
and Conditional Release Act, which applies to parole and 
penitentiary temporary absences.
<P>
	From our federal experience, this statement of purpose and 
principles has been extremely useful in terms of adding both real 
and perceived consistency and integrity  to conditional release 
programs. In this day of increased scrutiny and accountability of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4319"> 4319 </A></B>
<P>
release decision-makers, such statements provide valuable 
guidance to both the system and the public.
<P>
	Second, the amendments would increase the maximum duration 
of temporary absences from 15 days to 60 days. This change is 
intended to reflect modern realities and give correctional 
authorities the necessary flexibility to manage their inmate 
populations. There is an express provision in the bill allowing for 
the renewal of temporary absences. But there is also an important 
safeguard, and it is this: where a temporary absence is being 
renewed, there must be a reassessment of the case prior to so doing.
<P>
	Third, the bill would set out explicit authority for individual 
jurisdictions to create additional types of temporary absences 
beyond those for the basic medical, humanitarian and rehabilitative 
reasons, so long as they are consistent with the overall purpose and 
principle of temporary absence programs as stated in the bill. This 
will give individual jurisdictions the flexibility required to fully 
administer their particular programs according to their unique 
circumstances.
<P>
	Fourth, the reforms would give individual jurisdictions authority 
to restrict concurrent eligibility for some types of temporary 
absences and parole. This authority is intended to prevent 
``conditional release shopping'', that is to say, to reduce 
opportunities for offenders to play parole off against temporary 
absence programs and vice-versa.
<P>
	Lastly, the bill would add other important safeguards that would 
enhance public safety. The amendments would set out explicit 
grounds for cancelling, terminating, or revoking a temporary 
absence and authority to apprehend and return the offender to 
custody. The bill would also allow for the electronic transmission 
of a warrant of apprehension anywhere in Canada.
<P>
	Another key feature of the reforms is that a peace officer who 
believes on reasonable grounds that a warrant of apprehension has 
been issued against an offender on a temporary absence would be 
able to arrest that offender without a warrant and hold him or her 
for up to 48 hours until the warrant is forwarded and executed. 
These measures will ensure that there is no question about the 
authority to return offenders to custody when required.
<P>
<B>(1620 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is important to emphasize that the legislative enhancement of 
the temporary absence program which this bill would introduce 
should not be viewed as minimizing the importance of parole. The 
provinces and the territories rely on both parole and temporary 
absences as important tools for assisting in the  reintegration of 
offenders. The changes that we are proposing would allow each 
jurisdiction to decide where the balance should be between these 
two forms of conditional release. It gives them the flexibility which 
they have been demanding.
<P>
	It is also important to point out that parole can sometimes be a 
time consuming process which is appropriate for qualified 
offenders serving sentences for six months or more. Temporary 
absences, on the other hand, are appropriate for the management of 
shorter sentences, that is to say, less than six months.
<P>
	Temporary absences are particularly appropriate in those 
jurisdictions without their own parole boards. Many provinces do 
not have access to parole boards. In those situations it is vital that 
jurisdictions establish a strong and credible temporary absence 
program. That is exactly what the bill does. It will enable the 
provinces and territories to do that.
<P>
	Some critics may say that the reforms will make the system 
more lenient, as members of the Reform Party have alluded, at a 
time when public sentiment is pushing for greater restrictions. I 
would like to respond by saying that the reforms provide stricter 
parameters and tighter controls for the temporary absence program.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	At the risk of repeating myself, the amendments set out clear 
criteria for ending a release and returning the offender to custody. 
They also impose the reassessment of the case as a precondition to 
any renewal of a temporary absence.
<P>
	I cannot emphasize enough that these changes are being 
introduced with the protection of the public in mind.
<P>
	The reforms are an effort to modernize the legislation as was 
done for federal inmates in 1992, and bring it into line with current 
practices in most provinces.
<P>
	The amendments will provide a more coherent system, in that 
certain important elements-such as the statement of purpose and 
principles of temporary absence programs-will for the first time 
be specified in statute.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to reiterate my earlier comments on the 
need to effectively address the gaps and rigidities in the existing 
legislation. The proposed reforms are an effective response to the 
concerns of all jurisdictions. This initiative is a thoughtful 
reflection of federal-provincial-territorial co-operation on a matter 
of mutual interest.
<P>
	It is a sound and balanced set of reforms which will allow 
flexibility to individual jurisdictions to tailor temporary absence 
programs to their needs while still maintaining national consensus 
around key elements, particularly public safety.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4320"> 4320 </A></B>
<P>
	All members of Parliament have an interest in ensuring that the 
concerns of Canadians are addressed in the most efficient and 
effective manner. This is so for matters concerning public safety. 
And this is what this bill does.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to thank Bloc members for 
supporting this bill and I would also like to take the time, if I may, 
to respond to the hon. member for Calgary Northeast, who, in his 
speech, asked the following question:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``Why is this bill being brought forward at this time?'' He led the 
public to believe that it was for budgetary reasons. If the member 
has been following the work of the provincial-territorial task force 
he would know that this group was established by the heads of 
corrections and is recommending changes to legislation governing 
temporary absences under provincial jurisdiction, which has been 
traditionally those convicted criminals serving a sentence of less 
than two years. The changes were approved by the federal, 
provincial and territorial ministers responsible for justice last May. 
Similar changes were been made in the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act in November 1992.
<P>
	It is at the request of the first ministers who are responsible for 
justice in their provinces that we are today introducing the required 
changes. They will help to add safeguards to the system to improve 
public safety.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	For example, the new legislation would establish clear criteria to 
be used by provincial authorities for cancelling, terminating or 
revoking temporary absences and returning the offender to custody. 
The provincial prisons hold offenders, as I have said, for less than 
two years.
<P>
	The member for Calgary Northwest was helter skelter, all over 
the map in his presentation. It shows that Reformers are not 
focused then it comes to criminal justice issues. I would ask them 
to reconsider and support Bill C-53 today.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to take my turn to speak to Bill C-53 before the House 
today. Since the position of the official opposition was clearly 
established by my colleague and friend, the hon. member for 
Manicouagan, I will merely elaborate on some of the elements he 
touched on just now, and I also intend to add to this some figures 
which the hon. member for Windsor-St. Claire was so kind as to 
pass on to me earlier, after quoting them in her own speech.
<P>
	Clause 7 of the bill refers to the conditions for conducting 
temporary absence programs, as they are commonly referred to.
<P>
	We should not forget that, when a court of law imposes a prison 
sentence, the primary purpose of the prison sentence is to protect 
society, while the second is to mete out punishment. We must not 
forget that. The rehabilitation aspect comes third, when we are 
certain that society is protected and that an individual is punished 
for an offence of which he has been found guilty or to which he has 
confessed. Subsequently comes the time for clemency and 
rehabilitation. The first two elements should not be overlooked: the 
protection of society and the punitive aspect. I think that clause 7 
should put more emphasis on one of the principles of sentencing, 
according to which society has both the right and even the duty to 
protect itself.
<P>
	That being said, I think that legislating rules for the guidance of 
authorities in charge of temporary absences is an improvement. At 
least there will be guidelines far more specific than what exists at 
the present time with respect to temporary absences.
<P>
	Second, the bill specifies the grounds for revocation of the 
temporary absence. Here again, this is certainly an improvement 
which we will have an opportunity to examine in committee, but 
clause 7 of the bill enumerates the conditions under which the 
temporary absence may be revoked.
<P>
	Of course, when we give people the power to grant temporary 
absences or revoke them, we cannot expect them to be faultless in 
their judgment of who should or should not be given a temporary 
absence. A temporary absence should be granted, of course, 
everyone or almost everyone will agree, when these people, for 
their own rehabilitation, when they are no longer a risk to society, 
when they can make a contribution to society to rectify mistakes 
that happened during their lives, can benefit from it.
<P>
	It is to be hoped the boards that will have to decide whether or 
not to grant parole or a temporary absence will use their judgement. 
Let us not kid ourselves. Ours is not an ideal world and there will 
always be errors. Errors that are often infrequent and not the 
general rule should not blind us to the primary purpose of this bill, 
which deals specifically with rehabilitation and also relieving 
pressure on the prison system.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	My colleague, the hon. member for Windsor-St. Clair, spoke 
earlier about a rate of incarceration in Canada of 130 persons for 
100,000 population, while the rate in western countries, excluding 
the United States, can vary, for example, from 51 per 100,000 in 
the Netherlands to 81 per 100,000 in Germany, much higher rates.
<P>
	It seems that, despite a decrease in crime in Canada, there is a 
rather strong trend for the courts to hand down firm prison 
sentences that are much more exemplary and to do so more often, 
particularly in cases of domestic violence.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4321"> 4321 </A></B>
<P>
	We know that there is social pressure, and a good thing too, 
for zero tolerance of domestic violence. Therefore, our judges, 
who are sensitive to public opinion, are generally much more 
severe. And this reflects an evolution in society that I commend. 
Here, as with alcohol and drug use, it is zero tolerance that we 
should be aiming for.
<P>
	In committee, of course we will try to pin down the scope of 
clause 7.2, which states that it is the lieutenant governor of the 
province who designates who is competent to authorize temporary 
absences in each of the provinces.
<P>
	My colleague, the hon. member for Vaudreuil, has just 
mentioned that we have a new lieutenant governor in Quebec. 
Although appointed by the federal government, and theoretically 
by the Governor General, the lieutenant governor is in fact named 
on the recommendation of the Prime Minister. And although the 
lieutenant governor acts, also theoretically, on the recommendation 
of the provincial cabinet, he is not legally obliged to do so.
<P>
	An old case from 1938, in a referral to the Supreme Court, on 
``-power of disallowance and reservation'', clearly established 
that constitutional conventions which may deprive the Crown of 
the exercise of some rights do not hold when these rights, reserved 
for the Crown, are effectively exercised despite those constitutional 
conventions.
<P>
	We just had such a debate in Quebec on whether, in a example A 
or B, the representative of the Crown could not prevent the people 
or the National Assembly, which represents the people, from 
exercising its democratic right. I hope that it will not happen.
<P>
	If we added the words ``in council'' after lieutenant governor in 
clause 7.2 and therefore used the expression ``lieutenant governor 
in council'', we would simply mean that a Cabinet decision signed 
by the lieutenant governor would be necessary in order to designate 
the persons responsible for authorizing temporary absences. This 
would be compatible with the provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	This is what the member for Vaudreuil was referring to when he 
talked about the overlap which existed in criminal law in 
Canada-an overlap which is not so clear cut as one would think. 
In sections 91, 29 and 92(14) of the Canadian Constitution, the 
British North America Act of 1867, renamed the Constitution Act, 
1867, as if it had never been called anything else, the BNA Act of 
1867 gives the federal Parliament the power to determine 
sentencing and to establish a criminal code, and of course related 
laws, and gives the provincial authority the responsibility of 
administering justice.
<P>
	But what administration of justice? Civil matters clearly are the 
responsibility of the province. This has not been disputed to date 
although according to some, an area of civil law falls under federal 
jurisdiction at this  stage of the evolution of the law. However, 
things have not yet gone very far at this level.
<P>
	As to areas of criminal law, is the provincial administration 
constitutionalized pursuant to subsection 92(14) or is it delegated 
to the provincial attorneys-general under the Criminal Code, and 
something that the federal Parliament may revoke at any time?
<P>
	I was simply trying to point out to the fact that, after 126 or 127 
years, after so much change, interpretation and discussion, we are 
still in a grey area, in a no man's land. We are still wondering about 
the distribution of jurisdictions among the different levels of 
government.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	Bill C-53 is a step forward or perhaps sideways, but certainly not 
backwards in improving the balance that, as long as we belong to 
this system, we must constantly be trying to reach in the sharing of 
powers between federal and provincial jurisdictions. The enacting 
of Bill C-53 will mean better coordination.
<P>
	With the flexibility afforded by this bill, we should be able to 
keep in custody those who really deserve to remain in prison, who 
are a danger to society and themselves and who have not earned a 
temporary absence or permission to go out. They must be earned, 
they are not automatic.
<P>
	There is one last thing, with which my colleague from 
Manicouagan dealt very eloquently, I will probably be less 
eloquent. My colleague is quite familiar with the system, not for 
having served time, but for having worked in the penal system. 
When he talked about the change in the reporting period from 15 to 
60 days, he touched upon a critical point we will have to look into. 
My mind is not made up at this time, but I have reservations.
<P>
	If a parolee, who now has to report every two weeks, finds 
himself in a situation where he only has to report every 60 days 
instead of 15, an added 45 days, a reporting period four time as 
long, is there not a danger of losing control over this individual, or 
at least the correctional officials' ability to follow up? I believe this 
is a real danger.
<P>
	If it is found that the individual is in breach of the terms of his 
parole, will it not be too late after 60 days to bring him back on 
track? Should his parole not be simply revoked? I think that a 
follow-up period of two weeks, even though it seems at first to be a 
rather cumbersome administrative measure, might be preferable to 
extending the reporting period to 60 days without any prior study. I 
presume that the committee will look into this issue with an open 
mind.
<P>
	I have one last question. I am not stating my position on the 
breach of parole, on the non respect of the parole terms, I am just 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4322"> 4322 </A></B>
<P>
wondering. Right now, under Bill C-53, a  law enforcement officer 
cannot arrest an individual who is clearly in breach of his parole.
<P>
	Therefore, if a policeman sees me in a bar in the middle of the 
night, while I am out on parole under the condition that I stay in my 
house from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m., the only thing he can do is write a 
report saying that I violated the conditions set for my parole but he 
cannot arrest me.
<P>
	Would it not be appropriate to change the policemen's powers in 
some instances? A private member's bill has been submitted to that 
effect. I do not know where it stands on the Order Paper, but we 
should also think about acting quickly in that case because the 
sooner we act, the less deviations from the rules there will be. This 
is one aspect of the 60-day rule I do not like; it will be very difficult 
to follow the individuals during those two months when they are at 
large. We are all aware of the problems created by budget cuts at all 
levels.
<P>
	If we reduce personnel, we also reduce the supervision. The 
person in need of help will receive less and less and he or she will 
probably want to test the limits of those conditions set for the 
temporary absence or the day pass.
<P>
	I submit that these points should be considered in committee. We 
will insist that they be. Since the parliamentary secretary was 
courteous enough to stay in the House to hear the official 
opposition's statements, I am sure he took note of our comments 
and he will transmit those comments so that everyone will know 
what issues are of concern to us.
<P>
	At the second reading, we will of course support Bill C-53.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
a pleasure to speak to Bill C-53.
<P>
	Contrary to some of the comments made by my Liberal 
colleague, the parliamentary secretary, I may surprise him and say I 
just may vote in favour of this. I remain to be convinced but I do 
want some assurances and it is only reasonable to ask in the House 
which is passing legislation that basically affects provincial 
jurisdiction. People like me are looking for some assurances that 
we are not being too liberal on allowing these people out for longer 
extended periods.
<P>
	That gives my community a great concern. The communities of 
Abbotsford, Langley and Aldergrove, which have really seen very 
little crime over the years, have just witnessed five people 
murdered last week at once, a young girl killed months ago and on 
and on it goes. The people in my area are not used to this but it is 
coming at them in waves.
<P>
	To stand here in the House of Commons and say yes, I might be 
for expanding temporary absences at the provincial, I have to be 
absolutely certain in my own  mind that I am doing this in the sole 
interest and protection of the people in my area. During my 
discussion today I will be talking about the assurances I am looking 
for.
<P>
	I recognize that the federal-provincial task force looking at these 
issues has come to the federal government asking why not put up a 
national standard on this kind of issue of temporary absences. I 
agree with national standards. I am looking for a national standard 
of victims' rights. The government said we are going to work on 
that this fall. I am looking forward to doing that.
<P>
	Just as much as victims' rights need a national standard, perhaps 
so do temporary absences with all provinces in the nation.
<P>
	If we are looking for national standards we are talking about 
increasing temporary absences from 15 to 60 days. I really have 
some questions to ask about that. I have some cases in my 
community of people who have been out on temporary absence 
who have done worse than what we could imagine. I really do want 
to know why the extension from 15 to 60 days. That is 45 
additional days. I know it does reduce the bureaucracy and that sort 
of thing. I have to be convinced that an additional 45 days is in fact 
a safeguard for potential victims out there.
<P>
	We are looking at a designated authority with the power to 
suspend, cancel or revoke a temporary absence. I do not disagree 
with that. I want to go through the EMP, the electric monitoring 
program the provincial government has, which I originally did not 
like. Since I have looked at it four times at length now I am 
beginning to like it more and more.
<P>
	We are also looking at a designated authority to provide for the 
apprehension and recommitment of an individual. I do not have a 
problem with that either.
<P>
	What is the difference between provincial and federal inmates, 
provincial and federal penitentiaries? If a person gets a sentence in 
excess of two years, two years plus a day, they go to a federal 
penitentiary. If they get less than two years, are they not that bad a 
convict? Are they the kind of guy who is going up to the big house 
some day and is just working at it or are they really a guy who has 
been at this for some time?
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	It happens in my area. I have met several inmates who are at one 
of the community corrections centres. The fence is four feet high. 
They are out in the daytime. They are not monitored. They have to 
be in at night. These are federal convicts on their way out to the 
street again. One guy I talked to said: ``I am not really that bad a 
fellow. I was in for sexual assault''. I said: ``Is that all, just two 
years plus a day is what you got for this?'' ``Well no, it was three 
years''. ``Have you had any prior convictions?'' ``Oh yes, I have 
had 35''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4323"> 4323 </A></B>
<P>
	Just because someone is in a provincial prison does not mean 
he is going to win the Mr. Congeniality of the year award. The 
fact is that people in provincial prisons in many cases are not very 
nice people.
<P>
	It is not the first time. It is not just selling drugs. We have to be 
careful when we expand temporary absences from 15 to 60 days 
that we are dealing with the right people. There are good and there 
are really bad, if someone can call any criminal good. There is a 
scale in there.
<P>
	The provincial system itself has some benefits that the federal 
system could use. Extended probation for instance. The federal 
system could use that rather than the statutory release and warrant 
expiry and they are out regardless of what crime they committed. 
There has to be a period where there is an extended probation.
<P>
	I often tell this story. I will not prolong it. A fellow in my area 
coerced a woman in Aldergrove, British Columbia to go and get a 
lawn mower in the garden shed. He beat her over the head with a 
hammer, he raped her and left her for dead. He injected her with 
cocaine. He got six years and was out in two. Statutory release was 
coming up anyway. They said: ``Gee whiz, he is getting out 
anyway''. Before statutory release came, this guy stabbed Angela 
Richards 26 times and killed her in my riding.
<P>
	Let us not make mistakes here even if we are starting to 
accommodate provincial governments. We have a duty and a 
priority to look after the safety and security of the victims and 
law-abiding Canadian citizens.
<P>
	The provinces employ an electronic monitoring program. It is 
used in the temporary absences within the provincial system. I kind 
of like the program actually. It has application for some federal 
inmates. The person is monitored by a central computer 
somewhere. There is a monitoring machine on the end of their 
telephone which constantly keeps in touch with the inmate or the 
person living in the House by an ankle bracelet. When they walk 
out of range of the monitoring machine, the communication is 
broken. It reports to the central computer. The person is picked up 
and is sent back into the cell. When someone is using that process 
with a temporary absence program, it may be very worthwhile.
<P>
	Another little story. I was out the other night on patrol with 
Corrections Canada folks. We were monitoring some individuals 
who are on the electronic monitoring system. One of the fellows 
had been caught selling cocaine for the first time. There was 
something wrong because the message from the telephone to his 
ankle bracelet was not getting through. We went to his house to find 
out what was going on. Had he disappeared or was he still in his 
house?
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	The value of his house I might say would be about $3.5 million 
to $4 million. It was the first time he got  caught selling cocaine. He 
was put in a provincial prison. His house was worth about $4 
million. It had a big pool which was half the size of this place and 
great tropical flowers. It was a nice place. It had a four-car garage 
which was big enough for trucks to load up with cocaine and 
heroin.
<P>
	We found out what the problem was. The house was too big. He 
was walking around in a house which was so big it was breaking the 
signal. They had to put a more powerful receiver on him. This guy 
was on the same sort of a temporary absence which we are talking 
about.
<P>
	There was a whole bunch of cars in the yard. Nice looking cars, 
too. They were new. There were lots of young fellows around. Who 
were they and what were they doing? They could not be selling 
drugs. It was the first time this guy had been caught, so that could 
not be the issue.
<P>
	Before I left he said: ``This electronic thing works great. The 
provincial government had a good idea. If you ever want to have 
one of these and you get stuck in your house, this is the kind of 
house you should be stuck in''.
<P>
	The trouble with the concept is that the house was likely built on 
the broken dreams of many parents. That house was built on the 
sale of drugs, in my opinion. There are young girls who are 
prostitutes in Vancouver who probably are the recipients of that 
drug trade.
<P>
	I wonder if we are sending the right message with temporary 
absences. Are we doing the right thing? We want to think about that 
when we extend temporary absences from 15 to 60 days without 
too much checking.
<P>
	What we really should be doing in addition to the temporary 
absence is taking his house. He should not be back in that house. I 
would seize the house and his assets and turn the house into a place 
for young people who are on drugs. It could be a transition house. 
We have to do more than just say there is rehabilitation and put him 
out on temporary absence from 15 to 60 days so he can be 
acclimatized to society. This guy is already acclimatized to society. 
The problem is he is selling drugs to society. That is what we have 
to look at.
<P>
	What do we know about rehabilitation? A member come over to 
me a while ago and mentioned the golf courses in the prisons. They 
are learning to be good golfers. That is rehabilitative, I suppose. 
The member said that the golf course is rehab. I suppose we could 
think of a golf course in a prison as rehab. I do not play golf. It is 
too expensive. And I never did need golf as rehab in the first place.
<P>
	I asked the prison warden to justify the golf course. This guy, 
who is the manager of corrections programs for the Pacific region, 
said: ``For one thing, the golf course at Ferndale was built by the 
inmates and that taught them about the landscaping business. It was 
a useful education''. Give me a break. That is not a useful 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4324"> 4324 </A></B>
<P>
education. It is not really teaching them anything. It is  building a 
golf course to keep them from being far too idle, which they are in 
prison.
<P>
	When we are talking about temporary absences, as we are in Bill 
C-53, and rehabilitation as a result of letting people out longer, we 
have to define what rehabilitation is. If the Liberal concept of 
rehabilitation is golf courses, then the Liberals are on the wrong 
track.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	What do prisoners think of rehabilitation? I found on a prison 
bulletin board the following notice about cognitive skills courses 
and rehabilitation of the prisoner. This I believe was on the bulletin 
board at Kent maximum security prison where the bad of the bad 
go. Let us find out what the prisoners who used their computers to 
put this up had to say about it.
<P>
	What is the boosting cognitive skills program, they asked? ``This 
10 session program is another in a series of useless programs which 
were formulated by a group of heavily medicated and bored 
criminology students, who after having sponged up all the funding 
available to them from the ministry of education, decided they 
would try a shot at feeding at CSC's billion dollar trough for a 
while''. This is the opening comment from the inmates in Kent.
<P>
	When we talk about rehabilitation and temporary absences from 
provincial or federal institutions, we have to understand that if this 
is meant for rehabilitation, what is rehabilitation? It is important 
for the Liberal government to address that issue.
<P>
	Let us just go on. It cannot be all bad for these guys. They say: 
``These sessions are for those who have already completed the 
cognitive life skills programs but who for various reasons are 
registered as low on the cogni-meter''. That is good, I suppose. ``If 
you like coffee and a different place to sleep in the morning, this 
program is for you'', the inmates say. ``For more information send 
a request to the programs department care of Bozo the Clown''.
<P>
	That is what inmates in this country think of rehabilitation. Not 
all of them do, but some do. The guards and staff in the prisons are 
telling me that is what the inmates think. We have to understand 
and keep in mind the need to mesh the right rehabilitation of an 
individual with temporary absences.
<P>
	I want assurances that when people leave on temporary absences 
that we are protected. The bill does go some way in doing that and I 
will acknowledge that. That is why I may just vote for this yet, 
unless I can find a real problem.
<P>
	Why the need to extend from 15 to 60 days? What are we 
actually doing? Are we trying to integrate for a longer period? Is it 
working? I wish it were working. If it were working Carol Goldy in 
my riding would not have been  stabbed six times by her husband 
who is already out and is on a restraining order.
<P>
	There was a fellow, a foster parent who sexually assaulted his 
children and he was out on a temporary absence as well. There is 
another lady in my riding who fled her house, ran away from her 
estranged husband who was out on temporary absence. He tried to 
burn the house down. Another lady's five-year old son was killed 
by her husband for revenge. He was out. On and on it goes. A 
sexual offender pleaded guilty to 13 counts of sexual assault. The 
police found a calendar detailing over 1,000 sexual contacts with 
children.
<P>
	We cannot at any time during any temporary absence in this 
country whether it is for 15 or 60 days afford to have any further 
damage done to law-abiding Canadian citizens or victims who have 
already been victimized at one time or another. Keep that in mind. 
Convince me that the best interest of the law-abiding Canadian 
citizen is held in this legislation and I just may vote for it.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before pursuing questions or 
comments, it is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform 
the House that the questions to be raised tonight at the time of 
adjournment are as follows: the hon. member for Davenport, the 
environment; the hon. member for Bourassa, immigration; the hon. 
member for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, Montreal airports.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will attempt to answer 
the concerns of the member for Fraser Valley West about the 
extension from 15 to 60 days since he directed his comments at me 
two or three times.
<P>
	I think the member is aware that a temporary absence is usually 
used by provincial authorities to manage the inmate population. It 
is usually used for medical reasons such as when an inmate has to 
seek medical treatment outside the institution. It is also used for 
humanitarian related purposes. In going from 15 to 60 days we 
have consulted the people who are front line.
<P>
	Quite often as politicians we are criticized because we legislate 
and do not take into consideration those aspects of the legislation 
that affect the front line people. They have asked us to increase it 
from 15 to 60 days for several reasons. First, when somebody is 
sentenced to a longer period of time there is a mechanism in place 
called the National Parole Board which most provinces have. They 
usually use that as the mechanism with which to administer the 
release of the inmate population. However, when we have a smaller 
period of time, a six month sentence for example, that process is 
too cumbersome. As a result they have asked for modifications in 
the law.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4325"> 4325 </A></B>
<P>
	The 60 days would be required, for example, for an inmate to 
seek treatment outside or follow programs that might have a finite 
period of time exceeding the 15 days which seems to be very 
restrictive.
<P>
	I want to reassure the hon. member for Fraser Valley West that 
there is an added safeguard in the legislation. There is a new 
provision that will require a reassessment of the offender's case 
prior to any renewal of any temporary absence. I hope that is the 
reassurance the member is seeking. Hopefully we can convince 
him later on to vote in favour of the bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will reserve 
my decision on this until I listen to the rest of the debate.
<P>
	However, again what I heard was that they are out for medical 
purposes but they are also out for rehabilitative purposes. I reiterate 
that rehabilitation in the minds of this government may mean 
something a lot different than rehabilitation in my mind. When a 
member comes across this room today and tells me that the golf 
course in a prison is rehabilitative I do not think we are on the same 
level. Hello, is anyone home over there? There is a problem with 
that kind of thought.
<P>
	I will reserve my judgment and critique it more when I hear 
more.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard St-Laurent (Manicouagan, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
before I was elected, I worked in a prison for five years, and I say 
this with humour, because it is rather strange. Five years during 
which we would take an inmate to court every day and hear all the 
incredible stories about what may have happened: from shoplifting 
to feed one's family to the foulest crimes, through extortions, drug 
dealing, major cases where tons of drugs had been shipped to the 
North Shore. This was no small operation; we do not do things by 
halves, where I come from. So, I heard these stories for five years.
<P>
	When I was elected, on October 25, I said to my wife, among 
other things, that there would be a change, that I would not hear 
about major murders any more. It could not happen. We were going 
to the House of Commons; we were not going there to tell stories, 
but to work, to improve the fate of a society we believe in.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	Well, I was wrong again. Every time a Reform member stands up 
to talk about a criminal case, he always tells a story about some 
foul crime that happened in his area. I have great respect for the 
Reform members, but other things happen as well. They always 
talk about the 10 percent failure rate, but there is a 90 percent 
success rate in social rehabilitation services. This means that 90 per 
cent of the people who go through a social rehabilitation process 
turn out well.
<P>
	Of course, I sympathize with victims of crime. Everyone 
sympathizes with them. It would not make sense to do otherwise. 
But if one believes in a functional system, at one point, one stops 
talking about a minority of cases and says: ``Let us do something to 
correct that''.
<P>
	From that moment on, one must have a positive attitude, and 
work at amending bills for the better. One cannot be content with 
voicing opposition, and make one's point by telling a story that 
happened in one's riding, by talking about the length of the knife or 
the pools of blood. Even Alfred Hitchcock did not go that far. We 
must draw the line somewhere.
<P>
	I would like to ask the member for Fraser Valley West to tell me, 
in no more than two or three sentences, what the Reform Party 
recipe for the ideal system of reintegration is. What is their recipe?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is one 
thing that my hon. colleague had better understand clearly. In my 
community we have serious concerns about people being out on the 
street. If he does not like the fact that I come in here and talk about 
the five murders in my community last week that is just too darn 
bad because that is what I am going to talk about.
<P>
	I spent some time explaining about what one would consider 
today as a relatively minor offence, the sale of drugs. I do not 
consider it all that minor but I did refer to that. It is just a little 
careless to stand up in this House and say every time a Reformer 
gets up he talks about murderers only. But if I do he had better keep 
in mind that I am damn well going to do it and there is nothing he is 
going to say about that.
<P>
	As far as the rehabilitation of individuals, what is required in this 
country, unlike that of the Liberal system, are prisons for drug and 
alcohol rehabilitation. There are none. There are none solely 
dedicated in this country. There are no prisons in this country for 
sex offenders solely dedicated to analyse and understand the 
problem. None.
<P>
	If you want some more time about the rehabilitation of prisoners 
you had better start looking at better programs because even the 
auditor general said they are no good.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to speak to Bill C-53, an act to amend the Prisons and 
Reformatories Act. This bill sets out the principles of the 
temporary absence program. It should be noted that these 
principles are similar to those set out in the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act.
<P>
	The bill also authorizes the provinces to develop additional types 
of temporary absences. Bill C-53 sets out the grounds for 
suspending, cancelling or revoking temporary absence.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4326"> 4326 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	Finally, the bill confers the power to apprehend and return those 
in breach into custody. This sounds like a worthwhile initiative 
because of what it provides for and of the leeway it affords the 
provinces.
<P>
	I must admit however that I am one of those who place more 
reliance on the social rehabilitation of offenders than on their 
imprisonment, except in very specific cases, such as for dangerous 
offenders, spousal abuse and a few other cases.
<P>
	I am concerned about the current overcrowding in our prisons. 
The imprisonment rate in Canada is second only to that of the U.S. 
Need I remind the House that, south of our border, the 
imprisonment rate is growing without causing a drop in the crime 
rate.
<P>
	The Association des services de réhabilitation sociale du Québec 
is right to be concerned, seeing just how extensive the problem is. 
Alternatives to imprisonment can be found in our society. It would 
be to everyone's advantage to stop and think about alternate 
courses of action in this area.
<P>
	Nonetheless, I support this bill, which promotes the 
rehabilitation and social rehabilitation of offenders, while at the 
same time stating principles aimed at maintaining a fairer, safer 
and more peaceful society. As other colleagues have pointed out, 
these two principles are not always easy to administer when one is 
trying, on the one hand, to protect society and, on the other hand, to 
promote the rehabilitation of inmates.
<P>
	I also support Bill C-53 because, while establishing a national 
regulatory framework for conditional release, it also gives the 
provinces a degree of flexibility. Indeed, this bill on prisons and 
reformatories allows the provinces to develop their own policy 
regarding temporary absence for reasons other than medical or 
humanitarian reasons, or to facilitate the prisoner's rehabilitation.
<P>
	I believe that extending the period of temporary absence from 15 
to 60 days complies with what the provinces want. This change 
will, among other things, help alleviate the problem of 
overcrowded prisons in our country.
<P>
	From a financial point of view, it will help reduce government 
expenditures relating to the inmate population. In spite of the 
reservations expressed by some colleagues this afternoon, I feel 
that extending the period of temporary absence from 15 to 60 days 
is a positive change.
<P>
	However, it is a fact that this change generates some concerns, 
particularly among prison authorities in Canada. For example, they 
fear that inmates who take advantage of the temporary absence 
program might present a danger to society. Therefore, it is 
important for the committee that will review this bill to hear these  
people, those who work in close co-operation with them, as well as 
the victims.
<P>
	Another issue which deserves particular attention is the place of 
residence of those who are conditionally released. Obviously, if 
these people are released for medical reasons, it can be assumed 
that they will go to a hospital.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	But where will the inmate released for compassionate reasons or 
rehabilitation go? It is important to point out that inmates serving a 
sentence of more than two years come under the federal system. 
Under this legislation, the inmates released on parole are housed in 
reformatories.
<P>
	It has to be pointed out also that Bill C-53 does not talk much 
about the principle of protection of society. It should be more 
explicitly developed.
<P>
	It would also be interesting to wonder whether it would be 
appropriate to include in this bill a specific clause about the right of 
victims. What these people, who often have been through dramatic 
situations, have to say about changing or cancelling parole should 
be taken into consideration by the authorities.
<P>
	I take this opportunity to point out the excellent work the 
Maisons de transition de Montréal Inc. have been doing for 30 
years, and especially their director general, François Bédard. The 
Saint-Laurent half-way house, located in my riding of Bourassa in 
Montreal North, is part of this organization. It provides support 
services, including room and board, for offenders and helps them 
reintegrate society. It can accommodate some thirty people. I wish 
it could have more money, more funding to be able to 
accommodate a larger number, because the results I have seen are 
very positive.
<P>
	Under the terms of federal-provincial service agreements, 
paroled inmates are referred to halfway houses and more 
particularly to the Maison Saint-Laurent. I have visited this 
institution and met residents, volunteer workers, and highly 
qualified professionals. I can attest to the efforts they make to help 
inmates, and I congratulate them.
<P>
	Let me remind members that in 1994-95, the federal and 
provincial governments spent $1.9 billion on prisons, that is 
$44,000 a year for each inmate in federal institutions and $39,000 
for each inmate in provincial prisons. Why does it cost $5,000 
more to house and feed an inmate in a federal institution? Could it 
be that the federal government is not as good a manager of prisons 
as the provinces?
<P>
	I do not agree with my colleague that the federal government 
manages detention centres better. I would also like to take this 
opportunity to mention the existence of detention centres for 
immigrants. As you know, I am the critic for citizenship and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4327"> 4327 </A></B>
<P>
immigration. I had the  chance to visit detention centres for 
immigrants in Montreal, Mississauga, and Vancouver.
<P>
	In some cases, these centres are really prisons, with security 
guards from private agencies. But there are no clear rules in these 
centres. Arrests are made without warrant. Nobody knows when an 
immigrant is eligible for release or temporary leave. In some 
instances, men, women and children live all together in the same 
institution.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	There is no judicial control over these arrests, usually made by 
immigration officers, and no control by the IRB, which is also a 
parajudicial court. Sometimes, the living conditions in these 
institutions are unacceptable. I was able to witness how awful the 
conditions are in Montreal, on Saint-Jacques Street, as well as in 
Mississauga, near the airport, and in Vancouver, also near the 
airport. Some of the inmates did not know why they had been 
arrested, how long they would be detained and when they would be 
entitled to be released or deported.
<P>
	I even met a young Kurdish woman, in Mississauga, who had 
been arrested at Toronto airport, because she was believed to be 
dangerous. When I visited her, she started crying and then she told 
me: ``I do not even know why I am being detained here. I never 
took part in any subversive activities, even though I am a Kurdish 
woman from-'' -I think she was from Turkey.
<P>
	I then asked why she was being detained. I was told: ``She is here 
because no one is showing any concern about her'', etc. But these 
are not valid reasons. No one knew when she would appear before 
an arbitrator who could order her release.
<P>
	In these detention centres, the human rights enshrined in the 
Canadian charter and any provincial charter are not respected. Why 
are minors arrested? They have to live together, men, women and 
children alike. Unfortunately, we do not read about these people in 
the papers. I already asked the Minister of Immigration to hold a 
public inquiry into these detention centres for immigrants. 
Unfortunately, since the residents of these centres are all 
foreigners, they are not aware of Canadian laws. Often they do not 
have access to a lawyer or to an appropriate defence. And we get no 
complaints from them because they end up leaving the country.
<P>
	I think we need to shed some light on this particular area. In a 
democratic society such as ours, we should not see people living in 
such unacceptable conditions.
<P>
	Like my colleagues from Manicouagan and Bellechasse, I would 
like to conclude by telling you that I am in favour of this bill, which 
will reduce the costs associated with the incarceration of offenders 
and which will give the provinces more power and more flexibility 
to implement their own temporary absence programs.
<P>
	Therefore, I will vote in favour of the principle of this bill at 
second reading.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
was rather taken aback by the comment of the speaker's colleague 
to the Reform member who just spoke when he said that every time 
a Reform member gets up, he or she talks about a murder.
<P>
	I would like to ask the member from the Bloc Quebecois whether 
he believes that talking about the ordeal, the concerns and the 
crimes that have been committed against innocent law-abiding 
Canadians is something that we ought not to bring into this debate, 
or whether he feels that it is a legitimate point to consider when we 
talk about the kinds of programs, early release and liberties allowed 
to convicted criminals.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunez:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think it is quite right for the hon. 
member of the Reform Party to mention murder cases but not quite 
right for the Reform Party to mention nothing but murder cases.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	For example, in the case of immigrants, something I am familiar 
with, they very often exaggerate things. The immigrant crime rate 
is lower than the rate for people who were born in this country, but 
they only speak of these extreme cases.
<P>
	As the hon. member for Manicouagan pointed out earlier, social 
rehabilitation has produced good results in most cases. Not all 
inmates are dangerous criminals or dangerous people. The problem 
with the members of the Reform Party is that they see only the 
extremes. That is how those on the right think, not only in Canada 
but in other countries as well.
<P>
	They leave no room for rehabilitation. They do not want inmates 
to have any rights whatsoever. They are citizens and, as such, they 
are covered by the charter and have rights that must also be 
defended. Some members only stick to the extremes and do not 
show any moderation in their remarks.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will not talk 
about an extreme case but about one that was in my local 
newspaper on Saturday night. I would like to hear the member's 
comments on it.
<P>
	An auction mart was broken into and vandalized. A lot of 
damage was done inside. The RCMP arrived and arrested the 
individual. The individual was a 20-year old who was just having 
some fun. The police comments were that he would probably get a 
suspended sentence because after all it was a pretty minor offence.
<P>
	The dollar value was not that much. The owner of the auction 
mart, on the other hand, felt that rather than  going through the cost 
of the court system and potentially putting the individual in jail for 
<P>

<B><A NAME="4328"> 4328 </A></B>
<P>
two days or fining him $100 that maybe a much better way to 
handle this sort of situation would be public service.
<P>
	The public service he suggested was this. He has a lot of cattle 
liners coming into his auction mart. A cattle liner after a 
1,000-mile trip with 100 cattle inside is not necessarily a pleasant 
thing to clean out.
<P>
	His suggestion was that a much better punishment might be three 
months of helping out at the auction mart cleaning out the cattle 
liners and that probably he would think twice about vandalizing an 
auction mart again.
<P>
	I wonder what the member might think about that sort of fair 
punishment for the crime, and does he think the individual would 
learn from that experience?
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunez:</B> Mr. Speaker, as I said earlier, there are cases that are 
very serious, and it is not up to us to judge their seriousness. There 
is a judicial system, there are judges, and it is up to them to impose 
the appropriate sentence in such cases.
<P>
	But I feel it is dangerous to generalize about such situations. I 
believe there are very few extreme cases. I am happy because, 
according to recent statistics, the crime rate has gone down in 
Canada during the last few years, fortunately.
<P>
	I believe that this is very positive and that the people should 
know about it. I also believe that in such situations, reporters have a 
big responsibility. When they write about horrible stories, I think 
they are doing society a disservice. At times, they are not cautious 
enough, do not show enough moderation.
<P>
	I would like to point out to my colleagues of the Reform Party 
some extraordinary cases of rehabilitation that occurred at the 
Maison de transition de Saint-Laurent in my riding of Bourassa.
<P>
	I met the offenders. I do not know their criminal record, but they 
seemed to be willing to change, to rehabilitate themselves, to be 
full of energy in order to start a new life. That encouraged me to 
pursue my efforts and to continue to help these people, the 
prisoners at the Maison de transition Saint-Laurent, in 
Montréal-Nord.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
wonder if you could advise me how much speaking time I have 
before Private Members' Business.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Given the time on our clocks 
you would have approximately one minute. Being there is a 
speaker wanting to continue the debate on this piece legislation, if 
the House gives its consent I am quite prepared to see the clock as 
being 5.30 p.m.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 5.30 p.m., the House 
will now proceed to the consideration of Private Members' 
Business as listed on today's Order Paper.

	<B>Mr. Bob Wood (Nipissing, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill S-7, an act to 
dissolve the Nipissing and James Bay Railway Company, be read 
the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>That, notwithstanding any standing order and the usual practices of the House, 
Bill S-7, an act to dissolve the Nipissing and James Bay Railway Company, be now 
called for second reading and that the House do proceed to dispose of the bill at all 
stages including committee of the whole.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Motion agreed to.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wood:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today on Bill S-7, an act to 
dissolve the Nipissing and James Bay Railway Company. This bill 
originated in the Senate and passed all stages of debate in one day.
<P>
	Therefore I will be seeking unanimous consent of the House to 
pass Bill S-7. However, I would like to take a brief moment to 
explain the bill for those who are unfamiliar with it.
<P>
	Nipissing and James Bay Railway Company was incorporated in 
1884 under chapter 80 of the Statutes of Canada. It acquired land to 
build a railway. However, despite numerous extensions no railway 
was ever constructed. The last extension expired in 1908 but the 
company was never formally dissolved. The company failed to file 
any returns to the federal government, despite numerous requests, 
and relinquished all responsibility for the property.
<P>
	No minutes of meetings remain regarding the business of the 
company and no stockholders could be located. Eventually the 
province built another railway which follows an almost identical 
route.
<P>
	Bill S-7 was initiated by Senator Kelleher at the request of the 
Corporation of the City of North Bay in my riding of Nipissing. 
City council unanimously passed a resolution asking that the 
Nipissing and James Bay Railway Company be dissolved. The 
reason for requesting this is that this company holds title to 
approximately 4,000 square feet of land within the city limits. By 
<P>

<B><A NAME="4329"> 4329 </A></B>
<P>
dissolving the company the land reverts to the crown whereupon 
the city can attempt to acquire it for its own uses.
<P>
	I should note there was no public opposition to this action by 
residents of the city of North Bay. It remains that this House must 
dissolve the 112 year old act which created the Nipissing and James 
Bay Railway Company so that this small piece of land can be 
returned to the crown.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the primary purpose of Bill S-7, as my colleague has just 
reminded us, is to dissolve the Nipissing Railway Company. The 
request to dissolve the company came from the City of North Bay, 
within whose limits it owns land, which is therefore unoccupied 
and not used, since the railway was never built, as it should have 
been before 1908, the last extension.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	One might wonder whether there are still, in Canada, other such 
pieces of land which are, or have been, unusable for long stretches 
of time because the government did not think to free them up.
<P>
	In my riding, in Blainville, in any event, I know of one case. 
Camp Bouchard, which covers 20 per cent of the municipality, 
belonged, until a few years ago, to National Defence. The camp had 
been equipped during the war with the complete infrastructure of a 
small city, in order to manufacture munitions. All these facilities, 
which would have made a wonderful industrial park for the city, 
were scandalously neglected, to such an extent that in the end they 
had to be dynamited, before the land could be sold back to 
Blainville, of which I was the mayor. This is another example of 
federal incompetence like the one before us today.
<P>
	We owe a vote of thanks to the senator and the member for 
Nipissing, without whose initiative the government would 
undoubtedly have taken even longer to realize that there was no 
reason to continue to hold land for a railway, when 88 years after 
the deadline for building it had passed, there was no railway in 
sight.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is therefore in favour of Bill S-17.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	(Motion agreed to, bill read the second time, considered in 
committee, reported, concurred in, read the third time and passed.)
<P>

consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired.

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="THEENVIRONMENT">THE ENVIRONMENT</A></H4>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on June 
19, I asked the Minister of Natural Resources to inform the House 
whether her department was on target to deliver our red book 
commitment to reduce carbon dioxide emissions which cause 
climate change. Our red book promise is clear, a 20 per cent 
reduction of carbon dioxide emissions below 1988 levels by the 
year 2005.
<P>
	As shown in Environment Canada's recent study, the Mackenzie 
Basin impact study, climate change is already having an impact in 
Canada. This six year study shows that the Mackenzie Basin in 
northwestern Canada has warmed an average of 1.7 degrees Celsius 
over the last 100 years. Scientists found historically low water 
levels for Great Slave Lake, localized melting of permafrost and 
increased erosion and landslides resulting from an historically high 
number of forest fires in the region. They also concluded that the 
area covered by Arctic sea ice decreased by 5 per cent between 
1978 and 1995.
<P>
	So far the response to climate change by the Department of 
Natural Resources has been the national action program on climate 
change and its voluntary challenge and registry program for 
industry.
<P>
	The same department estimates that carbon dioxide emissions in 
Canada will be 13 per cent above 1990 levels by the year 2000.
<P>
	It is clear that the voluntary challenge will not stabilize 
greenhouse gas emissions, let alone reduce them by 20 per cent 
beyond 1988 levels as indicated in the red book. Thus we have a 
long way to go if we are to honour our international commitment 
and our red book promise.
<P>
	There are alternatives. The rational energy plan developed by the 
Sierra Club of Canada with Informetrica provides a model for 
reducing carbon dioxide emissions while increasing employment 
for Canadians. Informetrica concludes that if the plan were fully 
implemented employment would increase, adding more than 
550,000 person years of employment between this year and the 
year 2000. In addition, the Department of Natural Resources 
concluded that the plan would result in Canada's secondary energy 
demand falling by roughly 13 per cent by the year 2010, reducing 
carbon dioxide emissions by 22 per cent.
<P>
	At present we seem to be working at cross purposes. We have in 
place subsidies which continue our dependence on non-renewable 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4330"> 4330 </A></B>
<P>
energy sources which, in turn, increase carbon dioxide emissions. 
In contrast, subsidies to the renewable energy sector, although 
slightly increased in the last budget, are insignificant next to those 
enjoyed in the non-renewable fossil fuel energy sector. It seems 
that little planning is going into the transition from non-renewable 
carbon dioxide producing energy sources to the renewable sources. 
That transition will have to occur because of climate change and 
eventual resource exhaustion.
<P>
	In her response to my question on June 19, the minister 
emphasized the government is committed to stabilizing carbon 
dioxide emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000 but made no 
clear commitment to the further reductions called for in the red 
book. Internationally we talk about the stabilization of carbon 
dioxide emissions and further reductions beyond the year 2000, but 
domestically we seem to be failing to meet even the first of these 
objectives.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	Can the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Natural 
Resources inform the House whether her department is on target in 
delivering on our red book promise to reduce carbon dioxide 
emissions by 20 per cent below 1988 levels by the year 2005?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Marlene Cowling (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in response to the hon. 
member's question of whether we are on track with respect to the 
climate change commitments outlined in the red book, let me 
assure the hon. member that we are making progress. I also 
acknowledge that stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 
levels by the year 2000 and achieving further reductions post-2000 
will not be easy.
<P>
	Climate change is a complex issue for which there are no simple 
solutions. Very few countries will be able to stabilize their 
emissions by the year 2000. The problem lies in the very nature of 
modern economics and consumer lifestyles. We must change many 
of the ways we live and do business. Turning on the lights, heating 
homes and driving to work all produce greenhouse gas emissions. 
It is a matter of making fundamental changes to the way we live. It 
will take time and no one government or sector of the economy 
alone can solve the problem.
<P>
	That is why the red book commitment on climate change states 
that the federal government will work with provincial and urban 
governments and major stakeholders with the aim of reducing 
carbon dioxide emissions. We are doing just that through the 
federal-provincial initiative known as Canada's national action 
program on climate change. This program takes a sustainable 
development approach, that is, balancing environmental and 
economic imperatives.
<P>
	The national action program encourages a mix of approaches: 
voluntary, regulatory and economic instruments. A key voluntary 
measure is the voluntary challenge and registry, VCR, program 
designed to engage the private and public sectors to undertake 
mitigative climate change plans on a voluntary basis. These plans 
are also registered for public scrutiny. This approach allows 
companies to undertake initiatives which make the most sense 
from their operational viewpoint.
<P>
	Over 580 companies and organizations have registered with the 
VCR. They represent about 70 per cent of greenhouse gas 
emissions originating from industrial and business activities. We 
have made climate change an important item on the agenda of 
corporate Canada. CEOs know there is a problem and are initiating 
mitigative plans and actions.
<P>
	Natural Resources Canada has a number of its own programs to 
address greenhouse gas emissions. It has implemented energy 
efficiency regulations on electrical appliances and motors; set up 
the autosmart and fleetsmart programs to teach fuel efficient 
driving habits; and implemented a range of programs to encourage 
energy efficiency in buildings. The last budget also announced 
changes to the tax rules to encourage renewable energy 
investments. Consultations are now in progress to examine 
improving the tax treatment of energy efficiency investments.
<P>
	The federal government's actions can make a difference. For 
example, by the year 2000 our new regulations on commercial 
lighting will reduce emissions annually by an amount equivalent to 
the carbon dioxide produced yearly by one million cars.
<P>
	The federal government is also showing leadership by getting its 
own house in order. It plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
from its operations by 20 per cent by the year 2005 through the 
Greening of Government Initiative affecting government buildings 
and motor vehicle fleets.
<P>
	However, the federal government cannot do it alone. All 
Canadians contribute to the problem of greenhouse gas emissions. 
All Canadians must contribute to the solution. Stabilizing and 
eventually reducing emissions will depend on the collective effort 
made by all governments, industry and business sectors and the 
general public.
<P>
<B>(1750 )</B>
<P>
	When and how we stabilize emissions are very much the subject 
of the joint meeting of the federal and provincial energy and 
environment ministers scheduled for early December. At that time 
ministers will review progress to date under the national action 
program on climate change and recommend the next action steps.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="IMMIGRATION">IMMIGRATION</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on May 8, I 
put a question to the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration 
concerning Victor Regalado, a Salvadoran national who was 
granted refugee status in 1982, status that was later taken away 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4331"> 4331 </A></B>
<P>
from him by the government because he supposedly constituted a 
threat to the national security of Canada.
<P>
	The processing of his case is a typical example of the negligence 
and lack of compassion shown by the successive immigration 
ministers and officials who dealt with it since 1982. How can we 
explain that an individual can live in this country for 14 years, 
study, work, start a family and raise children without having any 
kind of status? If that is not negligence and lack of compassion, I 
do not know what is.
<P>
	Finally, thanks to numerous interventions on my part, especially 
in this House, and to those of many organizations and public 
figures, Victor Regalado, who had been deported, was allowed to 
come back to Canada to submit an application for permanent 
residence after the Government of Quebec issued him a selection 
certificate. I ask the minister to act as quickly as possible on this 
case. Mr. Regalado has suffered enough as it is.
<P>
	I also hope that CSIS will apologize to Mr. Regalado and explain 
in what way he poses a threat to Canada. Holding secret files on 
individuals as peace-loving and law-abiding as Mr. Regalado is not 
the proper way to do things in a democratic country.
<P>
	I would like to salute the courage, determination and 
perseverance shown by Mr. Regalado during the 14 years he spent 
in Canada. I take this opportunity to congratulate him for the great 
battles he fought for social justice, freedom and democracy in his 
country of origin, El Salvador. I wish him well in all his future 
endeavours and I hope he will at last be able to live a normal life 
with his family.
<P>
	I also want to mention the invaluable work done on this case by 
the Quebec Civil Liberties Union.
<P>
	Furthermore, I would like to take advantage of this opportunity 
to condemn the unacceptable actions and behaviour of immigration 
officers posted at the Canadian embassy in Chile. Because as of 
June 5 this year, visas have again been made compulsory for 
Chilean visitors, Chilean nationals who want to come to Canada to 
visit their relatives, for business purposes or as tourists are faced 
with a lot of red tape. They have to fill out forms, be interviewed 
and present documentation, and then have to come back sometimes 
from quite far away, to provide additional documentation, pay 
costs and so forth.
<P>
	On top of that, these immigration officers are incredibly strict 
about the way they grant visas. As a member of Chilean origin, I 
was asked to intervene several times, either with the minister or 
directly with the ambassador, to try and convince them to show 
more judgment and fairness, especially in the case of visitors who 
had obtained visas before to visit members of their family living in 
Canada. I can therefore say that the  Chilean community in Quebec 
and Canada feels very uncomfortable about the situation.
<P>
	This unbending attitude on the part of those who grant these 
visas fails to reflect the excellent relations that exist between both 
countries and the increasing amount of trade and co-operation 
between Canada and Chile.
<P>
	I should point out that the President of Chile will visit Canada 
from October 1 to October 4. His activities will include signing a 
trade agreement aimed at facilitating investment and the exchange 
of goods and services between our two countries, but the problem 
of movement of individuals remains.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	Finally, I may point out that Chile does not require visas for 
Canadians who visit this South American country. I would ask the 
minister to review the situation and take the necessary steps to 
facilitate the movement of persons between our two countries.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration I consider it a privilege to respond to 
the question from the hon. member for Bourassa.
<P>
	I find it somewhat puzzling that the hon. member has asked this 
question be addressed as part of the adjournment debate. The 
Minister of Citizenship and Immigration was very forthright in her 
initial response to his inquiries. Her position and the position of her 
department is clear.
<P>
	The actions taken are in accordance with the law and regulations 
laid out in the Canadian Immigration Act. It is just that simple. 
There is nothing draconian or mean-spirited about the 
government's actions in this case. It is simply carrying out its 
duties by the rules. We have a good immigration system. It has 
served this country well over the years and it continues to do so.
<P>
	We have a duty to defend the integrity of this system. This means 
respecting the laws and regulations that govern it. I do not see why 
in this specific case we would ignore the acts and regulations 
relating to immigration. It is not up to the government to pick and 
choose which laws it enforces and which it disregards.
<P>
	I know that the hon. member for Bourassa would like me to get 
into more details of this case but I cannot do that. The Privacy Act 
simply does not permit me to do it.
<P>
	As the hon. member is aware from his own meetings with Mr. 
Regalado and from reading the newspapers, I can say that Mr. 
Regalado complied with the legal requirement to leave Canada and 
has now re-entered Canada on the basis of a minister's permit to 
allow him time to apply for permanent residence. Like anyone else 
<P>

<B><A NAME="4332"> 4332 </A></B>
<P>
who applies for permanent residence in Canada, Mr.  Regalado will 
have to meet all immigration requirements if he wants to be landed.
<P>
	The government has acted with compassion, understanding and 
fairness in this instance. It has fully respected both the spirit and 
the letter of the Canada-Quebec accord.

	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on May 29 1996, I asked the Minister of Transport a 
question regarding Aéroports de Montréal's responsibility to, and I 
quote: ``co-operate with the minister in responding to any 
questions, complaints or comments from the public regarding the 
airport''.
<P>
	Following that question, the Minister of Environment wrote in a 
letter that he was open to impact studies on the issue of transferring 
international flights from Mirabel to Dorval.
<P>
	The minister only has to use his power under the act, namely to 
ask ADM to co-operate with the minister in responding to any 
questions, complaints or comments from the public regarding the 
airport. Thus the minister has full responsibility. The minister 
cannot bury his head in the sand. He must obtain from ADM 
clarifications on the economic and environmental impacts of the 
present situation.
<P>
	All stakeholders in the Montreal airport area as well as those of 
Quebec as a whole want this situation to be clarified because this is 
a major economic decision.
<P>
	This is the thrust of representations made by the hon. members 
for Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, Laurentides and 
Argenteuil-Papineau. Recently, there has been evidence that the 
inaction of the Department of Transport has contributed to the legal 
mess we are now in.
<P>
	Representations made by the Coalition pour le maintien des 
services à Mirabel were received favourably by the courts. 
Increasingly in the future, unless the minister takes the political 
solution, that is to allow hearings on the Aéroports de Montréal 
decision, we will be bogged down right where we are, because the 
courts will take a long time to reach a decision. This will have 
harmful effects on the future of the Montreal airports, both Dorval 
and Mirabel.
<P>
	After all these months have passed, will the minister finally get 
around to implementing the recommendation made by the Minister 
of the Environment: an impact study, an overall assessment of the 
situation and public hearings to enable the public to find out what 
the best solution for international flights will be?
<P>
	Will the somewhat clandestine decision made by Aéroports de 
Montréal be maintained, or will we be able to find out exactly what 
the impacts of that decision will be?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Minister of 
Transport, I consider it a privilege to respond to the question of the 
hon. member for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup regarding the 
Aéroports de Montréal.
<P>
	Procedures have been put in place by Transport Canada to ensure 
that ADM respects the terms and conditions of all the agreements 
which it has entered into with the department.
<P>
	With respect to what the hon. member views as a lack of 
co-operation on behalf of the ADM concerning its project for 
changing the role of Dorval and Mirabel international airports, to 
the best of our knowledge ADM has made available to the general 
public all of the studies on which it based its decision to reorganize 
operations at Mirabel and Dorval airports.
<P>
	Aéroports de Montréal has also held many information sessions 
with the different municipalities surrounding these airports, the 
ones named by the hon. member. The general public was invited to 
attend these sessions and voice their concerns.
<P>
	Transport Canada has responded to each and every complaint or 
question received and where required has provided the name, 
address and telephone number of a suitable ADM contact who 
could provide information. Any information which has been 
requested to date has already been made public and generally 
available by ADM.
<P>
	At this point in time, to the best of our knowledge and based on 
the information that ADM has made available, there does not 
appear to be any violation of the terms and conditions of our 
agreements with them.
<P>
	If the hon. member has evidence of any non-compliance on the 
part of ADM we would be happy to receive it and examine in 
immediately.
<P>
	With respect to the environmental impact of ADM's decision, 
the Minister of Transport does not hold under the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act the authority to undertake or 
require an environmental assessment of Aéroports de Montréal's 
plans for Dorval and Mirabel.
<P>
	The Canadian Environmental Assessment Act does not apply to 
all projects regarding airports operated by local airport authorities. 
It applies when there is a project, as defined by the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act, involving a federal authority and a 
trigger under section 5.0 of the act. Triggers would include things 
like federal funding, federal licence or a permit or a decision under 
a lease.
<P>
	The transfer of international flights from Mirabel to Dorval does 
not involve any of these.
<P>

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before we adjourn for the 
day I would remind the House that, during the adjournment debate, 
both the members of the opposition and the parliamentary 
secretaries replying on behalf of the government must comply with 
the rules, which are that hon. members asking the question may 
speak for a maximum of four minutes, and parliamentary 
secretaries replying on behalf of the government are limited to a 
maximum of two minutes.
<P>
	The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been 
adopted. Accordingly, this House stands adjourned until tomorrow 
at 2 p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.03 p.m.)
<P>
