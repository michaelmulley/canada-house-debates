	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should consider the 
advisability of introducing amendments to the Income Tax Act so that taxpayers 
whose income may fluctuate from one year to the next would be able to average 
their income over five years.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1105 ) </B>
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, I introduced this motion some time 
ago and it was drawn within the last year. The reasons for the 
motion are fairly clear-cut. It is based on the assumption that the 
Canadian economy is much more diverse than what some of our 
policy makers perceive it to be over the last number of years.
<P>
	We still have literally hundreds of thousands of individuals 
who are basically self-employed, who work to fulfil a dream of 
producing what they want to produce on the hope and the 
assumption that the price or the value of that production will go 
up or on the hope that they will eventually be able to produce 
enough of the product to make it an economically viable entity.
<P>
	While the Canadian economy may have become more 
industrial and more global, there are still many people who work 
on this basis. They are farmers, fishermen, real estate brokers, 
builders, prospectors, architects, artists, musicians and a host of 
others who sometimes work years without any real 
remuneration. Eventually the big income year comes and they 
have in the past been encouraged in their activities which are 
useful to the whole of Canadian society with the concept of 
income averaging.
<P>
	There is a great deal of income fluctuation in some of the 
sectors of our economy simply because of changes in production 
due to cyclical weather patterns whether it is in fishing, farming, 
forestry or a whole host of other businesses attached to those. 
There is also fluctuation as world prices go up and down. No 
matter how efficient a producer one is of wood products or 
agricultural  products or fish products, when the world price is 
down one is going to show a loss.
<P>
	However those people do not give up and quit simply because 
they have a loss in one year. They know that it will turn around. 
They hope that it will turn around. They realize that their 
activities are of use to society in general. People have to eat. 
People need wood for their houses and for their shelter and so 
they continue.
<P>
	I brought the motion to the House because we once had three 
methods of averaging income for the diverse group of people 
who have up and down incomes. We had general averaging 
which was available to all taxpayers. At one point it was actually 
worked out by the department itself when incomes exceeded 120 
per cent of the previous year. It was almost automatic.
<P>
	We had for a while income averaging using annuity contracts 
which was introduced for a few years. We had five-year block 
averaging for farmers and fisherpeople.
<P>
	I want to do a bit of past history of these with a brief 
explanation because in 20 minutes one cannot do justice to the 
issue. Prior to June 1992 general averaging, as I said, was 
available to all. We could go back five years and pay not only 
income but losses in those five years. This was finally replaced 
in 1982 with something called forward averaging.
<P>
	However even tax experts admit this is only helpful when 
incomes decrease significantly so that a person can be put into a 
lower tax bracket. It is used by retirees, by athletes who are on 
their way out, by people who are pulling back rather than to 
encourage production which is what the original averaging plans 
did.
<P>
	Tax experts like Beam and Laiken conclude that the forward 
averaging has not been a suitable replacement and has not done 
the job it was hoped it would do.
<P>
<B>(1110 ) </B>
<P>
	The income averaging annuity contracts which I mentioned 
were available as well were of very limited use. They were used 
for the collapsing of RRSPs when people reached the age of 70 
or 71 years.
<P>
	It was used for the utilization of capital gains provisions 
which were changed in 1982. It is probably not used very much 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6412"> 6412 </A></B>
<P>
any more. It was basically a way of permitting people to adjust 
to the capital gains provisions in 1982 and some later budgets.
<P>
	The five-year block averaging which had been available to 
farmers and fishermen lasted a bit longer. Although it was 
announced in the budget of 1982 it officially ended in 1987, 
which means that the last year most people could use it was 
1991.
<P>
	There are some exceptions to that such as in cases in which 
taxpayers had such low incomes they did not bother filing a 
return. That is not considered to be one of the years. If they did 
not file a return in 1988, for instance, they could go until 1992. If 
they happened to miss three or four years they might still be 
eligible to pick up on those last remnants of five-year block 
averaging simply because they have to use five years when they 
file on time. These could have high incomes or losses and they 
could all be averaged out.
<P>
	We need to look at what the replacements for five-year block 
averaging were. The block averaging has been replaced with a 
form of forward averaging. There have been a couple of 
inventory rule changes that were supposed to pick up the slack 
for farmers and fishermen. While they are helpful in the short 
term they do not meet all of the advantages that were there for 
the five-year block averaging.
<P>
	There is a mandatory inventory adjustment for people with off 
farm incomes. This is almost all farmers now. Last year we are 
told that the average family farm incomes were in the 
neighbourhood of $43,000, of which just over $30,000 came 
from off farm sources. Therefore on average on farm income 
was about $13,000 and roughly $30,000 came from off farm 
sources.
<P>
	It is interesting to note that a lot of economists and 
government policy makers seem to think that the answer is to 
move to larger farms so that incomes can be generated from 
those larger farms. At least that is the theory. The reality is that 
when we look at the data the larger the farm, the larger the off 
farm income. It is virtually impossible to generate a family 
income from farms regardless of the size under the economic 
conditions that have existed for the last several years in Canada.
<P>
	The second inventory adjustment program allows bringing in 
livestock, which seems to be defined by the courts as anything 
that is a living, sensate being, from rabbits to fish to ostriches 
and llamas as well as the usual horses, cows, pigs, sheep, et 
cetera.
<P>
	Some difficulties with the program have been discovered, 
since a cash accounting method has been permitted. This is a 
good thing for most farm operators, especially individual 
operators who are not incorporated. That method of computing 
income is still available. It allows some transferring of income 
from one year to the next by selling in one year but collecting the 
money the following year for livestock sales and grains and 
oilseeds.
<P>
	This is a possibility in most regions of the country. These 
provisions do not recognize the fact of wide income variations 
that were handled under the old five-year block averaging 
system. It might mitigate a sudden income surge at the end of a 
year and allow some of that income to be shoved into the 
following year. It does not take into account the large cyclical 
changes in prices which are then reflected in huge cyclical 
changes to income for farmers and fishermen which usually ride 
for three to five years.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	The five-year averaging provision permitted people to hang 
in there. Perhaps they would lose money for five years, hoping 
they would recover in a subsequent five years. This allowed for a 
shifting of income over the five years and paying the tax 
accordingly.
<P>
	The new provision does not permit that kind of flexibility and 
has provided some real horror stories where the lives of farmers 
or ranchers are interrupted. They leave an estate which can find 
itself paying unwarranted amounts of taxes because of the legal 
work that may not have been done in the proper sequence 
according to the department of revenue. If step <I>a</I> is taken before 
step <I>b</I> the department will double tax.
<P>
	Paying taxes should not depend on a chance happening 
initiated unwittingly by so-called professionals acting on behalf 
of taxpayers or their estates. Rules should be as simple and as 
clear as is possible. The block averaging is relatively simple in 
its concept, in that it applies to the total income of the taxpayer 
and not just the part that exceeded a certain threshold amount. It 
permits a complete levelling of net incomes over the averaging 
period, including the offsetting of losses within the period 
against profits.
<P>
	Prior to its demise in 1982 block averaging had existed since 
1946. It had accomplished a fairly progressive and widespread 
growth in the economy. It should be used again in the 1990s in 
recognition of the continued need in our country for the 
recognition that there is a wide and diverse choice of economic 
activities that Canadians choose to be engaged in, or are 
sometimes forced into, which recognizes that some necessary 
and crucial economic activities have periods of poor returns but 
that society must permit some recognition through the tax 
system we continue to need that we need these people for the 
smooth and efficient working of our society in general.
<P>
	Most of the groups I have mentioned in regard to tax 
averaging are not eligible for most of the so-called safety nets 
that our society takes pride in providing. Most of them are 
self-employed individuals ineligible for unemployment 
insurance benefits. Most do not quality for welfare even though 
their 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6413"> 6413 </A></B>
<P>
incomes are definitely poverty level from parts of their income 
cycle, sometimes for three to five years.
<P>
	I argue that the government should consider the advisability 
of reintroducing income averaging provisions once again to 
recognize that fluctuating incomes are a reality for a great many 
productive individuals in our Canadian system. Fair treatment 
demands that it be given a higher priority if Canada is once again 
to flourish.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise to 
speak on private member's Motion No. M-256. I question the 
advisability of moving in this direction at this time.
<P>
	I am extremely concerned about further complicating the tax 
system and setting up a situation whereby those with money and 
in the higher income brackets have the ability to manipulate the 
tax system to their advantage.
<P>
	When I talked to Revenue Canada about the issue I was 
informed its previous experiences with income averaging has 
shown that such averaging may result in unfair tax advantages to 
those taxpayers who are able to arrange their affairs so as to 
control the amount and timing of their income and in turn their 
tax liabilities.
<P>
<B>(1120 ) </B>
<P>
	By checking the retirement savings system we will find that in 
extremely good years some individuals may make significant 
tax deductible registered retirement savings plan contributions 
based on income. Where an allowable contribution is not made 
for a year, it may be carried forward for seven years. RRSP 
contributions may be made in a year or within 60 days after the 
year ends.
<P>
	This system can help individuals to lessen any increased tax 
burden that might arise as a result of an increase in income, 
while at the same time fulfil its primary goal of encouraging 
Canadians to save for retirement. It is a very important point that 
we have within our tax system the ability for people in their 
years of good income, when they do not have to draw down on 
their funds for cost of living and so on, to contribute dollars into 
retirement savings. It helps them and society as a whole.
<P>
	Averaging provisions generally introduce a great degree of 
complexity into the tax system. If the government and Revenue 
Canada have time to look at the various issues, rather than 
spending a lot of time looking at block averaging over the years I 
would certainly favour spending time looking at ways to make 
those with larger incomes pay their fair share.
<P>
	I am surprised that greater emphasis is not placed in the 
motion on those who are somehow dodging the tax system in 
some way. We should be making those individuals pay their fair 
share. In fact I am worried about the motion opening up the 
possibility for wealthy individuals to manipulate the tax system 
again to their advantage.
<P>
	Talking about the complexity in the tax system, any income 
averaging formula entails detailed and often complex 
calculations in addition to very specific rules designed among 
other things to prevent its use for an unintended objective. That 
is what I am speaking about. Will the motion and its possibilities 
allow greater manipulation of the tax system? I am very worried 
about that.
<P>
	A formula would have to take into account and recalculate 
benefits and means tested tax credits in low income years, such 
as child tax benefits, goods and services tax credits and various 
provincial tax credits, and additional taxes and credit 
reductions, for example, minimum tax, reduction in age tax 
credits, and old age security clawbacks in high income years 
included in the averaging period.
<P>
	As well, where other supporting individuals have claimed tax 
benefits based on the income of a particular taxpayer, for 
example, spousal tax credits, their tax liability would also be 
adjusted based on the averaged income of the taxpayer.
<P>
	Those kinds of problems really open up the possibility of 
manipulating the tax system further to an individual taxpayer's 
advantage and cause a considerable number of administrative 
problems in terms of the government department's ability to 
administer these taxes to see that they are paid fairly and 
administered by the rules of the act.
<P>
	Averaging provisions would interact adversely with the 
alternative minimum tax. The purpose of that tax is to ensure all 
Canadians with significant incomes in a given year pay at least 
some level of income tax. Providing income averaging could 
increase the number of higher income Canadians who pay no 
income tax for a particular year. This is generally perceived to 
be manifestly unfair.
<P>
<B>(1125 ) </B>
<P>
	I do not have anything more than that to say on the issue. 
However I want to underline one point. I do not believe we 
should now be opening up the tax system to the possibility of 
further manipulations by individuals who have extreme amounts 
of income. We should be looking at other ways of improving the 
tax system by ensuring that the very wealthy in society pay their 
fair share. I do not believe the motion deals with that problem.

	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue):</B> Madam Speaker, before 
I start my speech on Motion No. 256, allow me to congratulate 
the people of my riding, especially those of Rouyn-Noranda, for 
making it into the <I>Guinness Book of Records</I> with the longest 
banner in the world. This 425-metre banner was made by 
several families to draw attention on the International Year of 
the Family. It was stretched in the streets of Rouyn-Noranda, 
yesterday. It was quite a sight, I congratulate them.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6414"> 6414 </A></B>
<P>
	Now, let us move to the motion of the hon. member for 
Mackenzie which I will read before commenting on it:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of the House, the government should consider the 
advisability of introducing amendments to the Income Tax Act so that taxpayers 
whose income may fluctuate from one year to the next would be able to average 
their income over five years.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The hon. member explained the objectives of this motion. At 
first glance, it would seem that it would benefit a number of 
people in very special job categories. For example artists can 
make a lot of money one year and very little the next. There are 
also those who are into production of some kind, like farmers or 
fishermen. Think of all the self-employed persons who, from 
one year to the next, do not know how much their income will 
be. This is the most positive aspect, which does not mean there 
are not others.
<P>
	We tried, through various schemes-be it unemployment 
insurance, crop insurance or others-to stabilize income as 
much as possible, with relative success, depending on the area 
of activity. These insurance programs are precisely income 
stabilization schemes which guarantee a certain income 
stability.
<P>
	The problem is that the motion is not restrictive in any way, 
and would apply to people with very high incomes in a given 
year, even though they do not belong to any of the categories I 
just mentioned. Does it mean that anyone with a sudden high 
income would be able to defer it at will? This might be a way of 
ensuring that individuals go on a sabbatical every four years. It 
just might be. But then again is that really the objective?
<P>
	I believe that the real objective is more to help people whose 
income fluctuates due to the type of economic activity they are 
involved in. On several occasions, the member referred to the 
fact that nowadays our economy is very diverse and that it 
should be taken into account. However, I doubt very much that it 
is appropriate to do so for everybody since, obviously, the more 
time you have to plan how to manage your taxes, the easier it 
becomes to evade them. Balancing revenues and expenses is one 
of the fundamental principles in accounting but this goes 
slightly in the opposite direction and the more you separate the 
two the more complicated it becomes.
<P>
	Of course, as the Liberal member mentioned later on, we must 
wonder whether the whole tax credit system and the entire tax 
structure would have to get adjusted to take the deductions into 
account? Should we allow the same income averaging? It would 
become extremely complex. This does not mean that we should 
not permit a certain level of income averaging in some specific 
economic sectors or for individuals involved in these sectors, 
but it should be done as simply as possible and only in a very 
limited and strictly controlled way. Obviously, this kind of 
measure cannot be very simple.
<P>
	The Income Tax Act allows companies to carry forward 
profits and losses, at times with some degree of success, but at 
other times, the government is depriving itself of significant 
revenues. Companies are allowed to do some tax planning and 
they certainly take advantage of it. You could say that they 
reinvest this money in the economy, except that, in some cases, 
they minimize the taxes they will have to pay.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	I have some concerns about extending this system to include 
all Canadians. I think that we should identify our target more 
clearly and even take a hard second look at the provision in our 
tax system that allows businesses to carry forward profits and 
losses over a certain number of years.
<P>
	Family trusts are another means used to defer taxes. We have 
been looking at this issue since our arrival in the House of 
Commons and this morning is an ideal time to speak about it.
<P>
	As you know, in the case of trusts taxes can now be deferred 
until the last beneficiary has died. In some cases, this represents 
80 years of tax deferral. With tax planning horizons as distant as 
this, you can be sure that the government will be seeing very 
little revenue indeed. There are limits-taxes cannot always be 
avoided-but the longer they can be deferred, the more 
possibilities there are and the greater the amount due will vary.
<P>
	I therefore have some reservations about the motion, and 
rightly so, in my opinion. Not that we need linger too long over 
the motive for the motion. I can recall people, particularly 
artists, calling for income averaging. Given that only people in 
certain sectors are affected by it, I think it should be looked at 
more closely.
<P>
	The hon. member seems to have examined the question very 
carefully because there was a similar system in the past. He 
should now focus his attention on specific groups in certain 
areas of economic activity rather than on all taxpayers. When 
this is done, it will be possible to comment with more assurance. 
At this stage, there are arguments for and against.
<P>
	We understand the reasons for the motion, but cannot give our 
support to something this broad. The goal is very obviously to 
allow all high-income earners to average their income, but it 
could lead to some odd situations. Would not those with high 
salaries or income from company profits-in other words, 
dividends from businesses they own-have an opportunity to 
average even more of their income than is already the case? 
They will have two ways of allocating their dividends or 
corporate revenues. This will produce rather surprising results 
at the fiscal level.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6415"> 6415 </A></B>
<P>
	Public finances being what they are at present, I doubt very 
much that such an idea could be put forward. Since allowing this 
would reduce the tax impact on certain clients-artists, 
self-employed and seasonal workers were mentioned-such a 
measure would deprive us of revenues.
<P>
	I think that we should secure revenues from other sources. Of 
course, a motion cannot pursue several goals at the same time, 
but we should keep in mind the need to look for revenues 
elsewhere. If we stay with the same approach, we may have to 
look at corporate or trust tax deferrals, particularly the 
extraordinary revenue losses from family trusts whose renewal 
had been allowed by the previous government. The current 
government, for its part, does not appear committed to 
correcting the situation as it does not seem to believe that there 
are large revenues to be collected from this sector.
<P>
	In conclusion, although the goal is commendable, the motion 
is much too broad and troubling because everyone would be 
allowed to average their income. It would be difficult to support 
the motion but, given its goals, the hon. member could explain it 
further and ensure that specific sectors are targeted, in particular 
the arts community. From there we could move on to a private 
member's bill or something more concrete in order to get good 
results.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
entrepreneurial spirit is a driving force to the Canadian 
economy. I say again that there is a particular group of 
Canadians who are a driving force in the Canadian economy. 
They are the entrepreneurs. They are the people who get up in 
the morning with a blank page in their diary and go to bed at 
night having filled that page by exhibiting personal initiative. 
They have filled that page with creative, productive activity.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	The entrepreneurial spirit moves forward with no boss 
pushing. These are the self-starters. Truly, if they do not do it, it 
will not get done. They are the farmers, ranchers, fruit growers, 
independent small business people, artists, writers, people in 
real estate sales or sales in general, freelancers and consultants.
<P>
	Let us define what we are talking about here. We are talking 
about taxation and the way it relates to the entrepreneur. Tax is 
an arbitrary confiscation of wealth by government so that it may 
provide services and under political direction redistribute that 
wealth. The wealth is in the form of dollars and cents. It is 
capital. We are talking about the confiscation of capital for 
altruistic purposes. What we are really talking about is fairness 
in the taxation system.
<P>
	I support the thrust of the motion because I believe the current 
tax system discriminates against entrepreneurs who are, I state 
again, a major driving force in the Canadian economy.
<P>
	Assuming that the government historically has not 
intentionally discriminated against the entrepreneur, this 
question still must be asked: Now that it has been drawn to the 
government's attention, why would it want to continue to 
discriminate against people who have the handicap of never 
seeing a steady month to month paycheque? Why should these 
people have to suffer the disadvantage of irregular income along 
with the other insecurities of trying to provide for their families' 
welfare, their children's education and their own futures?
<P>
	In debate in the House on September 20, 1991, Lee 
Richardson, member of Parliament and Parliamentary Secretary 
to the Minister of Transport, said in part:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When income of individuals fluctuates significantly from year to year, the 
total of the income taxes they pay over several years may be greater than if their 
income stream has been more constant over that period. This is because in those 
years, when incomes were high, they are subject to higher marginal tax rates and 
thus pay a greater portion of their income in tax. In such circumstances, 
averaging the income over a number of years would result in lower taxes each 
year, thus lowering the total tax burden over that period.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Using farmers as an example, in the same debate at page 2500 
of <I>Hansard</I> the member for Edmonton Southeast said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I would like to pick up a thread that was made, I think, yesterday by a 
member. Right now the average farmer in Canada produces food for about 95 to 
100 Canadians. At the same time, since most farmers are men, his spouse has to 
go off the farm to earn money to feed the family on the farm. That is a 
catastrophe.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I believe and support the point the member for Edmonton 
Southeast was making that currently the tax system 
discriminates against the family farm. In many cases it forces an 
undesirable situation within families.
<P>
	Staying with the same example of the farmer, in a letter from 
Mr. Ken Gadicke of Folkman and Gadicke, chartered 
accountants in my riding of Creston, British Columbia, he says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The taxpayer in question reports his income on a cash basis, meaning 
revenues are reported only when received and expenses reported only when 
paid. For the first time, the farmer has sold almost his entire crop prior to the end 
of his current fiscal year. Furthermore, in almost every sale case he would be 
able to collect the cash also prior to his year end. However, this would put him in 
the position of receiving two crop years of revenue in one fiscal period, the 
1993 and 1994 crop revenue. As this would mean a large absolute increase in the 
amount of income tax he would be paying, he has made the nonsensical business 
decision to ask his customers to not make their payments to him until after his 
year end. In turn, he has had to ask his bank to extend his line of credit, incurring 
unnecessary financing costs.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In a case such as this some form of averaging of income may have benefited 
the taxpayer by allowing him to collect the cash, reducing his need for financing 
from the bank and no increase in his overall tax burden.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	As shown in Mr. Gadicke's letter about farmers, the 
impediments are common with impediments to all small 
business 
<P>

<B><A NAME="6416"> 6416 </A></B>
<P>
people and individuals who are concerned about  cash flow or 
having to become involved with interest payments which result 
specifically from the action of the current burdensome taxation 
system that confiscates wealth or the working capital they so 
desperately need. This can lead to a situation where the business 
person or individual has to make some nonsensical business 
decisions.
<P>
	Other examples of individuals would fall into the area of real 
estate sales people and especially sales people who are on 100 
per cent commission. They frequently cannot control when their 
next commission cheque is going to arrive. This group includes 
writers who want to work on books, reporters who sell their 
columns by the word or staff people with professional skills or 
extensive background work and experience who, when they 
encounter layoffs, become consultants and work on contract.
<P>
	There is a growing pool of experienced contract workers who 
are serving the business community well. Additionally there are 
artists who have work in progress who may be forced to push 
forward a finished product.
<P>
	At the risk of overusing the agriculture example, in my 
constituency with the downturn of demand for Delicious red 
apples many orchardists in Creston pulled up their apple trees 
and replanted a specific form of Japanese cherry. This was a 
very prudent decision to build revenue for the future. However it 
has serious taxation implications because of the inability to 
average income.
<P>
	A parallel example would be that the inability to average 
income could hamper entrepreneurs as they try to improve or 
change their current situation. Business people need flexibility 
in the taxation system in order to retool or invest in response to 
market pressures. If they cannot rationally make changes it is an 
impediment to productivity.
<P>
	Let me restate that I support the motion because I fully 
acknowledge there is a particular group of Canadians who are a 
major driving force in the Canadian economy. I support the 
entrepreneurs and their entrepreneurial spirit.

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu): </B>As no other member 
wishes to speak and since the motion was not selected as a

	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage)</B> 
moved that Bill C-53, an act to establish the Department of 
Canadian Heritage and to amend and repeal certain other acts, be 
read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, I am delighted to move second 
reading of the bill to grant official legal status to the Department 
of Canadian Heritage created one year ago. Passage of this bill 
will enable the department to pursue its mandate with 
confidence and enthusiasm.
<P>
	At first, we had some reservations about the name of the 
Department of Canadian Heritage. What did Canadian heritage 
mean, and what reason could be given to justify consolidating in 
a single department such diverse elements as communications, 
cultural industries, official and heritage languages, national 
parks and historic sites, voluntary action, multiculturalism, 
state ceremonial and amateur sport? But if we think of the word 
``heritage'' in its broadest sense, that is to say the set of signs 
that enable us to recognize ourselves as individuals who belong 
to a group or even a country, then the department's name is 
fitting.
<P>
	Heritage is closely linked to questions of individual and 
national identity, which is why it can have such far-reaching and 
important influence. In today's world of changing geopolitical 
borders where the map of the world is being redrawn and 
nationalist groups around the globe are making constant 
demands, the Department of Canadian Heritage is in a sense the 
flagship of Canadian identity.
<P>
	Each and every unit of the department is connected in some 
way to the soul of Canada. Combined, these units form a striking 
picture of what we were in the past, what we are today and what 
we want to be in the future. It is therefore impossible today to 
limit the meaning of heritage to the legacy of years gone by. 
Heritage is far more than a collection of remnants of the past; it 
is the manifestation of a link between the members of a 
community and a means of defining the relationship between the 
community and the world around it. From this perspective, 
although the scope of the activities undertaken by the 
Department of Canadian Heritage may seem huge, it is entirely 
justified.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6417"> 6417 </A></B>
<P>
	The Department of Canadian Heritage is active in three main 
areas that have a common objective namely, promoting 
Canadian identity. First, the department is the chief custodian of 
the natural and physical heritage comprising our national parks, 
our historic monuments and canals; these sites highlight the 
uniqueness of our country and contribute to Canada's reputation 
as a tourist destination. Our rich natural and historic heritage 
includes 36 national parks, 750 historic sites, nine historic 
canals and four marine areas located throughout Canada. 
Stretching from Ellesmere Island National Park in the Artic 
Circle to Point Pelee National Park on the shores of the Great 
Lakes, from the Cape Spear lighthouse on the Atlantic coast to 
Pacific Rim National Park, they are among the most beautiful 
gems of world heritage.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	Parks Canada will continue to protect, preserve and promote 
these sites which Canadians hold dear. The traditions of the 
Parks Canada program, now embraced by the Department of 
Canadian Heritage, have very deep roots. They date back to 
1885, when Canada's first national park was created in Banff. 
Our network of historic sites was established more than 75 years 
ago. In a short while, we will be celebrating with joy and pride 
the 75th anniversary of Parks Canada.
<P>
	Canada's parks and historic sites are important to the national 
economy, generating annual revenue in excess of one billion 
dollars, including some $275 million from foreign tourists, and 
providing jobs for roughly 30,000 Canadian men and women. 
They are the lifeblood of the Canadian tourism industry; in 
1992, almost 27 million people visited our national parks and 
historic sites.
<P>
	Second, the Department of Canadian Heritage devotes much 
of its attention to promotion of the official languages, amateur 
sport, community support and participation and other cultural 
elements that enrich our own culture and set us apart in today's 
world economy.
<P>
	The history of this country has to a large extent been shaped 
by successive waves of immigration and the interaction between 
the newcomers and the society in their new country. The way 
immigrants adapt their way of life to Canadian society will 
continue to be a determining factor in the Canadian identity, and 
the Department of Canadian Heritage plans to take an active role 
in making their integration as sucessful as possible.
<P>
	We have to realize that the co-existence of cultures is one of 
the biggest challenges facing countries around the world as the 
century draws to a close. Canada has always been in step with 
the many cultures that can be found here. This diversity includes 
vast human resources that are part of Canada today and that 
could be, in a world with an increasingly globalized economy 
and culture, a definite asset in maintaining our place on the 
world stage. It is also a virtually limitless cultural resource that 
we can use to our advantage and that sets us apart from other 
countries.
<P>
	The Department of Canadian Heritage plans to tap these 
resources and encourage all cultural communities to contribute 
to the growth and development of Canadian society. We hope to 
rally the mighty forces of multiculturalism behind a cultural 
identity that is uniquely Canadian.
<P>
	Amateur sport and related events, like the Canada Games and 
the XVth Commonwealth Games held this summer in Victoria, 
are a fundamental vehicle for fostering and illustrating 
important Canadian values such as the pursuit of excellence and 
cultural diversity. In this regard, I would like to take this 
opportunity to say again how happy we are to be hosting the 
1999 Pan-American Games in Winnipeg. We also hope that 
Quebec city will be given the honour of playing host to the 
Winter Olympics in 2002 and are working to make that a reality.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	We have inherited a country whose strenght comes not only 
from its cultural diversity, but also its linguistic duality. 
Preserving and promoting our official languages do not make 
Canada a real Tower of Babel. It is important not only to protect 
the right of individuals to speak whichever language they prefer, 
but also to realize that the English and French languages open 
the doors to two of the greatest sources of universal culture.
<P>
	Canada's official languages are inextricably linked to 
Canadian identity and culture. For this reason, it is vital for a 
department like ours and for society as a whole to promote them 
and broaden their sphere of influence.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Moreover, in these days of market globalization, knowing two 
of the most widely spoken languages in the world is a definite 
plus. English is an official language in no fewer than 33 
countries around the world, French in 25 countries. From a 
purely economic standpoint our two official languages already 
give us an edge in our efforts to conquer new markets.
<P>
	Of course we must not forget the incredible number of 
international languages spoken by new Canadians. Their 
language skills are critical in expanding our trade and cultural 
relations to new countries.
<P>
	The fact remains however that the linguistic landscape in 
Canada is dominated by two official languages as English or 
French is spoken by 98.6 per cent of the population. To ensure 
that both languages continue to thrive in all regions of the 
country the Department of Canadian Heritage is committed to 
supporting the development and enhancing the vitality of 
linguistic minority communities in all sectors and encouraging 
Canadians to learn their second official language.
<P>
	Specifically the department's aim is to give these 
communities the means to ensure their own economic 
development which is the key to a better future. With this 
objective in mind it has taken measures to encourage all federal 
institutions to promote 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6418"> 6418 </A></B>
<P>
the full development of minority official language 
communities, measures  which I announced this summer during 
the Acadian World Congress.
<P>
	Third, the department is focusing its efforts on the 
management of cultural development in Canada and on means of 
communication which are crucial not only in ensuring our 
uniqueness but also as a powerful instrument of economic 
development. Culture is not an abstract concept separate from 
the real world, nor is it mere decoration. It is first and foremost a 
way of looking at the world and a manifestation of our 
civilization. This unique view of the world is one of the features 
that allows one group to distinguish itself from others. In short, 
without culture, there is no identity.
<P>
	In this age of trade globalization and amid the proliferation of 
information technologies, our cultural resources have become 
not only a means for Canada to carve out a place for itself on the 
world stage but also a powerful economic lever. The numbers 
speak for themselves.
<P>
	In 1991-92 the cultural sector accounted in total for 3.7 per 
cent of the gross domestic product or approximately $22 billion. 
In addition, the sector employed almost half a million people, 
which represents a rate of employment growth of approximately 
21 per cent between 1986-87 and 1991-92. The economic 
impact of culture is far too great to be left entirely to chance.
<P>
<B>(1215 ) </B>
<P>
	The rate of growth may be impressive but it must not 
overshadow the problems our industries have to address. I need 
not point out that cultural industries do not have the capital or 
the market to compete in Canada with the big producers of mass 
culture, namely our neighbour to the south, the United States, 
the richest cultural market in the world and one which is 
increasingly visible in Canada because of the new distribution 
technologies.
<P>
	Bringing all cultural functions together in a single department 
will enable the Government of Canada to take more concrete 
action, making it possible to defend the interests of the cultural 
community, our cultural community, on many fronts. From this 
standpoint the department's responsibilities are primarily 
national in scope. The department has a duty to contribute to the 
emergence of Canadian culture, foster a sense of belonging and 
instil national pride. It is responsible for providing funding for 
and encouraging the development of cultural agencies that have 
a national mandate such as the CBC, the National Arts Centre, 
the Canada Council, the National Theatre School, Telefilm 
Canada and the National Film Board. It is also responsible for 
museums, archives and the National Library.
<P>
	The department also has to spearhead legislation aimed at 
fostering the full development of creative activity in Canada. 
The aim of copyright legislation, for example, is to enable our 
authors, producers and performers to earn a decent living from 
their crafts and be fairly compensated for their work.
<P>
	Let us get one thing clear. After a very long period under the 
former government during which culture suffered from 
marginalization and was considered merely as a distraction, not 
to mention a luxury, we must bring back culture to the forefront 
of society's concerns, for it is essential to our identity, to our 
pride, to our unity and to our independence in international 
society.
<P>
	Culture contributes to our quality of life. It is part of the ever 
richer heritage that is our legacy to future generations. The 
Department of Canadian Heritage has international 
responsibilities relating to the promotion, distribution and 
marketing of Canadian culture. For example, the department is 
expected to negotiate agreements on cultural exchanges with 
other countries and identify foreign outlets for Canadian 
cultural products.
<P>
	In keeping with this mandate the department was actively 
involved in the development of TV-5, the international French 
language television network that serves as a cultural and 
commercial window for French language programs and 
francophone artists from Canada and other French speaking 
countries.
<P>
	The Department of Canadian Heritage also has a mandate to 
ensure Canadian participation in international exhibitions. The 
most recent Canadian initiatives of this type took place last year 
in Taejon, South Korea, one of Canada's largest export markets. 
It produced excellent results as Canada banked on economic 
partnership for the first time. Exhibitions of this kind are 
outstanding international fora that combine both culture and 
communications. They are also an important part of the mission 
of the Department of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	For example, the government's commitment to implementing 
a Canadian strategy for the information superhighway augurs 
well for the cultural industries. The super highway is far more 
than a technological infrastructure. It will be a powerful vehicle 
for Canadian content and will ensure wider distribution of our 
cultural products, making them more accessible to all 
Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1220 ) </B>
<P>
	The department is particularly sensitive to broadcasting 
issues, as broadcasting is without question the most popular and 
the most powerful of all cultural media. More than 99 per cent of 
Canadians own a radio; 99 per cent also own a television set; and 
more than 75 per cent own a video cassette recorder.
<P>
	Because broadcasters are among the companies most 
vulnerable to competition from their American rivals, the 
Department of Canadian Heritage has to be very vigilante and 
adopt policies and programs that make Canadian culture as 
accessible to Canadians as possible.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6419"> 6419 </A></B>
<P>
	Clearly the mission of the Department of Canadian Heritage 
is closely linked to the major issues facing Canada today. Our 
agenda is very full and our mission extends into many sectors of 
Canadian society.
<P>
	It is more important now than ever before to start thinking of 
Canada's cultural complexity as an asset in an age when 
openness to rest of the world is as important as the preservation 
of our identities. That is where the Department of Canadian 
Heritage comes in. The Department of Canadian Heritage does 
not deal exclusively with the past, but it is focused on the future. 
It is at the nerve centre of the major challenges facing 
contemporary society.
<P>
	The department I have the honour of overseeing must have 
official legal status if it is to continue its work of fostering the 
emergence of a strong cultural identity in Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> 
Madam Speaker, the Canadian government is coming to the 
House of Commons today for second reading of Bill C-53, an 
act to establish the Department of Canadian Heritage and to 
amend and repeal certain other acts.
<P>
	First of all, the surprising thing is that the government took 
nearly a year to draft Bill C-53, which for all practical purposes 
confirms what Prime Minister Kim Campbell announced when 
her cabinet was sworn in in the summer of 1993. In so doing, the 
present Prime Minister and his government are confirming the 
same mistakes in decisions made by the previous government 
when for economic reasons Ms. Campbell decided to reduce the 
size of cabinet and merge several departments; among those 
decisions was the creation of the Department of Canadian 
Heritage. This is totally unacceptable, both for Canadians and 
for Quebecers.
<P>
	At first glance, this bill seems to be a purely technical 
measure that should pass quickly without lengthy debate, since 
its primary purpose is to establish a department, Canadian 
Heritage, and amend all related laws accordingly. After 
thoroughly examining this bill, we unfortunately must come to 
the conclusion that such is not the case.
<P>
	This bill is more than a purely technical measure. It would 
create a department where the minister would have the 
following powers, duties and functions, under clause 5:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-initiate, recommend, coordinate, implement (and promote) national 
policies, projects and programs with respect to Canadian identity and values, 
cultural development, heritage-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Madam Speaker, through you, I draw the attention of 
members of this House to the fact that the adjective ``Canadian'' 
refers to the following four items in the list I just read, so it 
should be taken to read as follows: ``In exercising the powers 
and performing the duties and functions (assigned to the 
minister by section 4), the minister shall initiate, recommend, 
coordinate, implement (and promote) national policies, projects 
and  programs with respect to Canadian identity, Canadian 
values, Canadian cultural development and Canadian heritage''.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	Accordingly, you will not be at all surprised to learn that the 
Bloc Quebecois cannot support such a bill, for many reasons, 
but mainly these.
<P>
	First, this bill shamelessly infringes on what so far has been 
considered provincial jurisdiction: culture.
<P>
	Second, the steadfast obstinacy of the Canadian government 
in refusing to recognize the distinctiveness of Quebec society is 
totally unacceptable.
<P>
	Third, based on our reading of this bill and on the old saying 
that the past is a guide to the future, it is far from obvious that 
the Department of Canadian Heritage provides the guarantees 
required to defend the French language and culture, especially 
those needed for the francophone and Acadian communities in 
Canada to continue to develop, flourish and even exist.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> It is in the Constitution.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> Let me speak, please, sir.
<P>
	Fourth, Canadian culture is in danger, given the government's 
inability and lack of political will to correct its predecessor's 
mistakes.
<P>
	As regards cultural rights, telecommunications and the 
electronic highway, the government maintains the existing 
division of jurisdictional responsibilities between the ministers 
of Canadian Heritage and Industry.
<P>
	Put simply, this means that the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
will be responsible for the content, while his colleague from 
Industry will be in charge of the means required, such as wires, 
optical fibres, microwaves, etc. In other words, the former will 
be responsible for culture, while the latter will look after the 
business side of things. However, the recent experience with 
Ginn Publishing makes us wonder about this arrangement. The 
minister responsible for culture had only one thing to protect, 
culture, but he had no weight. Consequently, the influence of the 
Minister of Industry, who pledged allegiance to the U.S., 
prevailed. We think that maintaining the artificial dichotomy 
created by the previous government is to recognize the 
supremacy of the dollar over cultural and social values which 
apparently-but only apparently-do not always seem to be the 
most profitable ones. Consequently, the bill before us makes us 
fear the worse as regards the future of Canadian culture.
<P>
	Let us see what is meant by the provinces' jurisdiction. The 
Canadian Constitution, that of 1867, gives provinces certain 
powers regarding culture and communications. These powers 
are included in subsection 92(16) of the Constitution Act, 1867, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6420"> 6420 </A></B>
<P>
which provides that all strictly local and private matters fall 
under provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	Moreover, subsection 13 of the same section recognizes that 
Quebec has jurisdiction over civil law, which is a fundamental 
feature of our distinct society. Also, section 93 of the 
Constitution Act, 1867, confirms that provinces have 
jurisdiction over education, which is undoubtedly an essential 
element of the cultural sector.
<P>
	Finally, section 40 of the Constitution Act, 1982, provides 
that where an amendment is made under subsection 38(1) 
regarding education or other cultural matters, Canada shall 
provide, and I quote: ``reasonable compensation to any province 
to which the amendment does not apply''.
<P>
	So, in reality, provincial legislatures have exclusive 
jurisdiction over most cultural matters.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	The federal government has interfered in the cultural 
jurisdiction only because of its spending power, and we know to 
what extremes its uncontrolled spending power led it. The 
federal government must withdraw from that field, because it is 
using its power in a way that goes against the will 
Quebecers-and at times other Canadians-have expressed for 
the last 30 years.
<P>
	Let us look at the historical demands of Quebec in the cultural 
area. The federal government's refusal to recognize in this bill 
the distinct nature of Quebec society is unacceptable. In 
February 1994, in his address in reply to the throne speech, the 
hon. leader of the Official Opposition said, and I quote: ``Our 
cultural objectives are closely linked to our collective 
objectives. Culture is what unites the men and women who want 
to live together. It represents the essence and the basis of any 
society. Measures and policies must be undertaken to protect 
and reinforce Quebec's unique and specific culture''.
<P>
	The mandate of the Minister of Canadian Heritage, as defined 
in clause 4(1) of this bill being considered at second stage, is as 
follows: ``The powers, duties and functions of the minister 
extend to and include all matters -relating to Canadian identity 
and values, cultural development, heritage and areas of natural 
or historical significance to the nation''.
<P>
	This bill does not refer to Quebec as a distinct society nor 
mention its cultural specificity. Again, Ottawa deliberately and 
knowingly ignores Quebec's cultural reality by mixing it in an 
hypothetical pan-Canadian cultural identity based on 
bilingualism and multiculturalism, whose risks for Quebec's 
language and culture have often been denounced.
<P>
	In doing so, the federal government ignores the historical 
demands Quebec has made these last 30 years. In 1966, Mr. 
Daniel Johnson stated that Quebec must make its own decisions 
concerning its cultural development, in the arts, literature and 
linguistic areas. In 1969, Mr. Jean-Jacques Bertrand maintained 
that cultural affairs were a provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	In 1971, under Bourassa, when Quebec went through its 
cultural sovereignty period, Quebec asked for some changes to 
the jurisdiction pertaining to culture, under the Constitution. In 
1973, Quebec demanded total control over all cultural policy, 
including the budgets.
<P>
	In 1975-76, Quebec proposed that every province be able to 
legislate exclusively in art, literature and heritage matters. In 
1978, based on its primary responsibility in cultural and natural 
heritage matters, Quebec asked the Canadian government to 
negotiate the return to Quebec of the management of cultural 
property and historical sites and property located in Quebec.
<P>
	In 1985, Quebec requested that all grants and contributions 
given by Ottawa, pursuant to its spending power, to individuals 
and institutions involved in culture and education be approved 
by the Quebec government according to its spending power.
<P>
	In March 1991, the Bélanger-Campeau report said that 
Quebec should have the exclusive jurisdiction and 
responsibility over its social, economic and cultural 
development as well as language matters. In 1991, the Allaire 
report recommended that culture be Quebec's exclusive 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	In 1992, following extended consultations and discussions 
with major stakeholders, Quebec adopted its own cultural policy 
statement. On this point, in 1992, Ms. Liza Frulla, Minister of 
Cultural Affairs in Quebec's previous Liberal government, 
speaking before the Standing Committee on Culture, said: ``As 
for programs, the federal government does little or no 
consulting''. And also: ``When, as often happens, it is faced with 
a <I>fait accompli</I>, Quebec has to state its real needs after the fact''.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	As you can see with this brief historical background, Madam 
Speaker, successive Quebec governments all agreed in their 
demands concerning culture and communications. 
Unfortunately, the federal government almost always turned a 
deaf ear to these claims, giving way naturally to many a 
confrontation and overlapping. This kind of overlapping was 
criticized many times.
<P>
	Here is what can be found in the Arpin report on the Cultural 
and Arts Policy, which was submitted to Mrs. Liza 
Frulla-Hébert in June 1991. ``We can conclude that there is 
obvious duplication between the two levels of government in 
terms of program structure, in terms of clients and even in terms 
of legislative and tax measures. We can even say that this 
duplication is driving up the costs. There are differences in 
directions and priorities depending on the clients. Some 
measures taken by the federal government go completely 
against Quebec's options. The harmonization of interventions 
by both levels of government has always been difficult. The 
federal government has 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6421"> 6421 </A></B>
<P>
never been willing to recognize Quebec's supremacy with 
regard to culture''.
<P>
	It is not surprising that this government would introduce such 
a bill. The Prime Minister's whole career has been centred on 
one important thing: to counter the recognition of Quebec's 
unique character.
<P>
	Remember that during the 1980 referendum campaign, he 
made a lot of promises regarding the Constitution. Since then, 
he has refused any type of constitutional negotiations with 
Quebec and is doing everything possible to try and grab powers 
that have traditionally belonged to Quebec.
<P>
	Remember also that in 1982, without warning Quebec, the 
then negotiator who is Prime Minister today secretly concluded, 
in the middle of the night, a constitutional accord with the 
English-speaking provinces. The main purpose of this accord 
was to strip Quebec of an important cultural power, namely the 
power to legislate on language matters. That is why the National 
Assembly of Quebec voted unanimously against this federalist 
attack.
<P>
	The Meech Lake accord recognized Quebec's unique 
character. But an ambitious lawyer named Jean Chrétien, who 
already saw himself as leader of the Liberal Party and future 
Prime Minister of this country, joined forces with the known 
enemies of Quebec's unique character, worked hard in secret to 
kill in the womb any type of affirmation of Quebec's cultural 
identity and fought ferociously against the distinct society 
clause. The Prime Minister showed us then who he really is. It is 
very difficult to believe today that he is and still feels like a true 
Quebecer.
<P>
	The refusal by Jean Chrétien's federal government to 
recognize Quebec's unique character does not surprise me. It is 
obvious that his government has no desire to see to it that 
Quebec's culture and language can blossom within the Canadian 
confederation, but that it would rather see that province's unique 
character die a slow but sure death.
<P>
	All Canadians witnessed recently the situation where the 
Prime Minister tried to have Quebecers pay a double price 
because their government had wanted to hold a referendum 
according to their own specificity. That is totally unacceptable. 
The referendum legislation and election rules are part of the 
distinctness of Quebec. Its respect for democracy has led 
Quebec to adopt, in the area of electoral equity, a legislation 
which is comparable to no other in Canada or elsewhere in the 
world.
<P>
	This refusal by the federal government to admit the distinct 
character of Quebec has serious consequences and generates all 
kinds of duplication and overlapping.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	We must remember that duplication caused by the intrusion of 
the federal government in the cultural area, which normally is 
under provincial jurisdiction, cost Canadian taxpayers hundreds 
of millions of dollars. Acknowledgement of the distinctness of 
Quebec by the federal government would mean a repatriation of 
the cultural sector and of all the related budgetary envelopes. It 
would result in some important savings and would be more 
attuned to the logic which has been fundamental to Canadian 
cultural policy for many years.
<P>
	How can the Governor General explain the dual principle in 
terms of culture? Clause 4.(2) of the proposed legislation states 
that the Minister's jurisdiction encompasses jurisdiction over, 
and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(j) the formulation of cultural policy as it relates to foreign investment;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In other words, for the last thirty years, Canadian cultural 
policies have been aimed at limiting foreign investments in the 
cultural area in order to ensure the survival of the Canadian 
culture. At the same time, and according to the same 
fundamental principle, that is the safeguard of the Canadian 
culture, Canadian governments have tried to impose to the 
various media a minimum Canadian content and ownership.
<P>
	According to these principles, the Canadian government is 
saying that governments must defend their culture, that it must 
not be left in foreign hands or allowed to be submerged by a 
foreign culture. Canada should therefore recognize the fact that 
Quebec is in the best position to defend its culture, which is 
different from Canada's.
<P>
	When the subject is Quebec culture, all those high-sounding 
principles supported, for instance, by the Canadian intellectual 
elite, fall by the wayside. Then they call it isolationism, 
tribalism and narrow-mindedness. When one hears such 
vehement statements, one wonders why Canada, as a sign of 
protest and to deny any hint of narrow-mindedness and 
isolationism, does not simply put its culture into the hands of the 
Americans. If managing their culture is good for Canadians, 
why would it be so bad for Quebecers? Again, a double standard.
<P>
	Under Canadian federalism, English Canada has the right to 
defend its culture against the American invader, but Quebec 
should drop its own culture, according to the bill before the 
House today. They want to make us all one nation and deny there 
are two. There are two nations in this country, and the act to 
establish the Department of Canadian Heritage should reflect an 
awareness of the situation in Quebec and the flexibility that 
Quebec needs to develop and prosper.
<P>
	This bill contains no guarantees for the French language and 
culture in Canada. Instead of defending French language and 
culture, the Department of Canadian Heritage is being used by 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6422"> 6422 </A></B>
<P>
the Canadian government to undermine French language and 
culture in Canada.
<P>
	The Department of Canadian Heritage administers all 
programs connected with clause 4(2)<I>(g)</I> of the Act, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(g) the advancement of the equality of status and use of English and French and 
the enhancement and development of English and French linguistic minority 
communities in Canada;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	First of all, it is strange the legislation does not refer to the 
equality of French and English. According to the department, 
however, this kind of wording would be far too coercive, 
although the present minister is French speaking. The 
legislation therefore refers to advancement, to moving towards 
a hypothetical equality.
<P>
	Since for the past 125 years or more, we have been moving 
nowhere at all, francophones can hardly be expected to believe 
they will get there some day.
<P>
	Similarly, the Canadian government is careful to avoid any 
reference in this bill to recognizing and promoting the position 
of Canada's two founding nations, since such recognition would 
have involved genuinely defending the French language and 
culture in Canada. Inequality between francophones and 
anglophones in Canada is systematic. There are many examples, 
and I will mention a few that struck me after I got to Ottawa.
<P>
	Example No. 1: I suggest that members who receive their 
weekly green list of government publications compare the 
number of documents available to anglophones and 
francophones. On the list, it usually says that the French version 
will be available later on.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	Example No. 2: It is a fiction that a francophone can make 
himself understood and obtain services in his own language 
across Canada. Even some of our so-called bilingual public 
servants are unable to provide services in French. Even here in 
the federal government, in the national capital, once you get past 
the token francophone, there is a complete vacuum: almost 
everything is in English. So much so that even the Assistant 
Deputy Minister for Cultural Affairs of the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage is losing his francophone roots and testifies in English 
before the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage. 
Thousands are being assimilated every day within the very 
precincts of the federal government, because they know that 
English means more status, more advancement and, as a result, 
better pay.
<P>
	I challenge the government to order a private company that is 
serious and strictly impartial-which automatically excludes 
the Commissioner of Official Languages-to find out to what 
extent a francophone can expect to receive the same level of 
service from the federal government in his own language. If the 
government refuses to take up this challenge, I am prepared to 
prove my point by revealing a number of bilingual positions 
held by people who do not know a word of French. When people 
find out what positions are involved and which citizens are 
affected by these positions, they will be flabbergasted.
<P>
	Example No. 3: Contrary to their anglophone colleagues, 
francophones working for the federal government must, for the 
most part, work in what is for them a second language. It is a 
whole class of citizens who are being assimilated. In this 
respect, the federal government behaves exactly the same 
way-especially in the national capital region-that private 
companies did in the late 1960s in Quebec, when francophones 
were not allowed to speak French even while smoking in the 
cafeteria. As soon as they entered the plant, they had to speak 
English. I demand an independent and earnest inquiry into this 
matter. This of course excludes the Commissioner of Official 
Languages.
<P>
	Moreover, I am asking all French speaking civil servants, 
especially those in the national capital region, who are required 
to work exclusively in English, to systematically complain to 
the Commissioner of Official Languages so that he can no 
longer hide behind the lack or small number of complaints to 
avoid taking action and severely reprimanding a government 
which claims to promote French language and culture but which 
forbids a significant number of its French-speaking employees 
to work in their own language. I will add that it would be useful 
to send me a copy of the complaints so that I can act upon them, 
while preserving the complainants' anonymity, and defend in 
the House of Commons French speaking civil servants who have 
been deprived of their fundamental rights.
<P>
	Similarly, how can it be explained that the federal public 
service in Quebec, excluding the Outaouais region, is made up 
of 54 per cent bilingual positions, which are truly bilingual, 
whereas in Ontario, excluding the national capital region, only 8 
per cent of positions are bilingual? Given the respective 
minority, English in Quebec and French in Ontario, to be fair, 25 
per cent of positions in the Ontario federal civil service should 
be bilingual.
<P>
	This shows how little the federal government cares about its 
French minority and how great his concerns for its English 
minority in Quebec are. As a matter of fact, the federal 
government is using its civil service to impose bilingualism on 
Quebec. After all, when every francophone can speak English, 
who will need French?
<P>
	I will remind my hon. colleagues that the promotion and 
development of French and English minorities in Canada is one 
of the responsibilities of the Department of Canadian Heritage. 
The only minority in Canada which does not have its own 
schools-and when it does they do not have toilets or running 
water-, which hardly has any cultural instruments, which does 
not have health services or social services in its own language, is 
the French-speaking minority. The maximum of services should 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6423"> 6423 </A></B>
<P>
go to this minority. If cuts are necessary, they should not be 
made at the expense of the neediest.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	I am surprised that this principle, considered so sound in other 
areas, should not be acceptable when it comes to francophones. 
The minister wants to cut $25 million from cultural minorities in 
Canada, on top of the other 5 to 8 per cent cut that the Minister of 
Finance is considering and which will not spare the minorities.
<P>
	The minister confirmed these cuts in a document he called 
``Confidence in the future''. When I see such a title and when I 
consider the content of this document, I wonder how the 
French-speaking minority will make out.
<P>
	Indeed, like the English-speaking minority, it must decide 
itself where the axe will fall and it must cut to the same extent as 
the English-speaking minority in Quebec. Yet, the minister, 
who has discretionary powers, should make his savings at the 
expense of those who can afford it, that is the English minority 
in Quebec.
<P>
	The minister must cut where the need is least, and not across 
the board. The English minority has its own school system, its 
health system and social services, its cultural network. So the 
minister, ever respectful of social and cultural justice, should 
put the burden of the cuts on those who can support them, 
irrespective of the language they speak.
<P>
	Moreover, all input of public money intended to promote 
bilingualism: immersion classes, scholarships and so on, should 
be cancelled. On the issue of cuts the minister is acting like a 
doctor who can choose between giving a cardiac massage to a 
patient in danger or teaching a person in very good health how to 
give a cardiac massage.
<P>
	The lack of logic in the distribution of jurisdictions between 
the departments is a threat to Canadian culture. As I said earlier 
in my statement, Bill C-53 aims at establishing legally the 
Department of Canadian Heritage. Canadians could rightly 
expect the government to put some order in its house. One would 
have expected the government to take this opportunity to 
organize a bit more strictly the various jurisdictions dealing 
with heritage. But it seems to be asking too much of the Liberal 
government. For instance copyright, which is directly linked to 
culture, will come under the jurisdiction of the Department of 
Industry as provided in Bill C-46.
<P>
	Remember that the Prime Minister and the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage stated officially and unequivocally that the 
adoption of phase II of the copyright legislation was a priority. 
Apparently this was only baked wind since by favouring the 
Department of Industry over the Department of Canadian 
Heritage, the government is forcing Canadian Heritage 
officials, who are defending the copyright, to submit to the 
dictates of their colleagues at Industry who think first of all in 
terms of dollar bills.
<P>
	As a matter of fact, the latter will always be able to argue, 
during the numerous interdepartmental quarrels that will ensue, 
that it is their right and that they have the last word since 
copyright comes under their jurisdiction. The most tragic aspect 
of that story is what it underlies. The government has already 
told us in the Ginn case that the cost effectiveness of culture, be 
it American or another, must come before the need to protect the 
Canadian culture. In other words, the Department of Industry is 
willing to sell large segments of the Canadian cultural industry 
to Americans.
<P>
	This is why the Department of Canadian Heritage has 
approved the sale of the important Canadian publishing house 
Ginn Publishing to an American company. Once more, having to 
choose between Canadian cultural integrity and its wish to not 
displease the Americans, this government has chosen to grovel 
before the Americans.
<P>
	I remind members that the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
tried to justify his actions by saying that there had been a verbal 
agreement between a junior official and Paramount.
<P>
	For obvious reasons copyright reform that the cultural 
industry is waiting for so impatiently because it is crucial to its 
survival will probably be shelved. The same lack of logic which 
seems to be the trademark of the governing party has prevailed 
in the case of telecommunications which were cut up into so 
many pieces. The government could have taken the opportunity 
to answer the industry's long standing request and regroup the 
whole of telecommunications in the Department of Canadian 
Heritage and, in so doing, make up for the mistakes of the 
Campbell administration.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	Even when I arrived in Ottawa, the deputy minister told me 
that this was a monumental mistake, that he intended to 
recommend to the present minister that it be corrected when the 
department was created. Once again, the Department of 
Industry, no doubt a heavier player in the cabinet, inherited the 
lion's share of jurisdiction in the field of telecommunications.
<P>
	Chances are that the Liberal government, who so staunchly 
defends federalism, and by extension, the duplication of 
services, continued overlap, and the waste of money, will see 
this division of the field of telecommunications as an 
opportunity to form joint committees of civil servants seconded 
from here and there. It will be an opportunity to increase the 
numbers of civil servants, committees, meetings, all those 
things that are a waste of taxpayers' money, but that for the 
Canadian government, and its deficit in the hundreds of billions 
of dollars, is the federalist thing to do.
<P>
	For why simplify when it is so easy to complicate matters? In 
this bill, the government, true to form, is merely ratifying 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6424"> 6424 </A></B>
<P>
reform put forward by others. What did we expect? It has done 
nothing new since it came to power one year ago.
<P>
	Fortunately, in the near future-and I will not mention dates, 
that would only stir things up-the people of Quebec will be 
asked to choose between an unlikely cultural existence as part of 
Canada and a cultural existence as a sovereign state. The 
federalists will point to venerable institutions like 
Radio-Canada as proof of the cultural viability of the Canadian 
federation.
<P>
	When we know that the endangered culture in Canada is the 
French culture, we cannot believe that this very federal and very 
federalist imbalance will ensure its survival in the Canadian 
context. No wonder that in a 1980 survey conducted by the 
Fédération des jeunes Canadiens français, the reply of young 
French-speaking Canadians when asked in which language they 
listened to television, radio, video games and videocassettes 
was ``mostly in English''. Perhaps it would not be so, had the 
federal government not treated them as second-rate citizens 
culturally.
<P>
	If Quebec is to survive culturally, it must repatriate all 
culture-related powers and monies. I should point out in that 
regard that all the governments in Quebec have been asking for 
just that for 30 years and that for the past 30 years, this has been 
denied to everyone of them by the federal government.
<P>
	Basically, at the next referendum, Quebec will have a choice 
between two alternatives: cultural death within the Canadian 
federation and development as a French speaking sovereign 
state in North America.
<P>
	That is why I would like to introduce a motion at this time. 
Seconded by the hon. member for Québec, I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by striking out all the words after the word 
``That'' and substituting the following: ``Bill C-53, An Act to establish the 
Department of Canadian Heritage and to amend and repeal certain other Acts, 
be not now read a second time but that the Order be discharged, the Bill 
withdrawn and the subject-matter thereof referred to the Standing Committee 
on Canadian Heritage.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I will take your proposal 
under advisement and advise you in a moment as to its 
admissibility. I would suggest that you continue with your 
remarks in the meantime.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> Madam Speaker, the main thing about our 
motion to defer second reading, to not read this bill a second 
time but to refer it instead to the committee, is that it is 
absolutely essential in our view that all the overlapping in the 
cultural area be reviewed and really reported on to this House. 
This bill, which had probably been drafted by the previous 
government, meets Ms. Campbell's wishes. It must be amended 
to avoid all sources of conflict, all overlapping, all unnecessary 
expenditure of Canadian taxpayers' money, and particularly to 
ensure that the Quebec community can see its uniqueness 
reflected in this bill.
<P>
	Understandably, Madam Speaker, it is impossible for a 
Quebecer to feel at ease as part of the Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Your motion is 
admissible, hon. member.
<P>
	Before giving the floor to someone else, I would like to 
remind the House that sometimes, with motions, we forget that 
it is not our practice to name individual members of this House. 
We can refer to them by their titles or ridings but not by name. I 
did not rise but that was done several times and I would ask all 
hon. members to be more careful.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> When I named the Prime Minister, I was 
referring to him when he was a lawyer. I could not say ``Prime 
Minister'' as he was just a lawyer at the time-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I will check the ``blues'' 
but I think you are mistaken. If I am wrong, I will get back to 
you, but I would first like to see the blues for that part of the 
debate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to speak to Bill C-53, an act to establish the 
Department of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	Before I begin my speech I would like to state for the record 
that in order for a reasonable and conscientious debate to take 
place, as we are hoping to do with this bill, it would be greatly 
appreciated rather than receiving an amendment 20 minutes 
before rising to speak in the House that we be given an adequate 
response time. This has happened continuously throughout this 
session of Parliament and I do object most strenuously.
<P>
	The bill is intended to establish legislatively some of the 
changes to government that the member for Sherbrooke and his 
Conservatives bequeathed to us in Parliament. In reality it is 
nothing more than moving the tables and chairs of a bloated 
bureaucracy. There is no downsizing, no cost savings. It is the 
status quo once more, the consistent refrain of a Liberal 
government that has become one of review, study, consult, 
discuss. Quite frankly it is do nothing mumbo-jumbo.
<P>
	I am going to address a number of issues today explaining 
why my colleagues and I will oppose the bill. Further I will 
address those changes that should be made to the bill which 
would allow my Reform colleagues and I to support it. Having 
just heard the Bloc amendment, in principle I can say we will 
support it because it will move the bill to committee for further 
extensive examination.
<P>
	With respect to the bill itself we oppose it for a number of 
reasons. First, it will legislatively entrench multiculturalism 
spending, national enforced bilingualism and the funding of 
special interest groups, all of which the Reform Party is 
ideolog-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6425"> 6425 </A></B>
<P>
ically opposed to. Second, the establishment of the department 
will not streamline, will not result in downsizing and will not 
result in any  financial savings. In fact the bill will end up 
costing Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	In June 1993 shortly after taking office then Prime Minister 
Kim Campbell announced what were supposed to be sweeping 
changes to government. The changes were intended to 
streamline the bureaucracy to make it more efficient and more 
cost effective. As the bill demonstrates, none of these objectives 
were accomplished by the changes which the Progressive 
Conservatives proposed.
<P>
<B>(1305 ) </B>
<P>
	The Tories had put forward a concept which was simply 
window dressing in an attempt to satisfy voters who were 
looking for leadership in a government that had continually 
demonstrated its arrogance by showing it did not care about the 
size of government, the accountability of government, the 
responsibility of government, or the cost of government. 
Canadians continued to believe as I do that they remain 
overgoverned.
<P>
	Attempting to change that impression the Tories decided to 
reconstruct a smaller cabinet, to downsize government. We all 
know what a good job they did to change public perception. 
They did such a good job that they suffered the largest electoral 
defeat in the history of the country.
<P>
	Now we have the Liberals who inherited these proposed 
changes to government. It is astonishing but they actually 
appear satisfied with these leftover, stale Tory ideas, satisfied 
enough to implement the changes left to them. It epitomizes a 
government which has resigned itself to the status quo. There 
are no new ideas, no creative solutions to the problems we face 
and there is continued disdain for the best interests of 
Canadians.
<P>
	I find it difficult to understand why the Liberals have 
introduced Bill C-53 at this time. The president of the Queen's 
Privy Council is undertaking his program review which is 
purported to be laying the groundwork for the government's 
restructuring and downsizing. This review is not expected to be 
completed, so it is reported, until sometime this fall. Why is the 
Liberal government establishing departments prior to the 
release of the results of the program review? A number of 
possible answers come to mind.
<P>
	Perhaps the government is not planning to make any 
restructuring changes at all, but this would contradict the 
Minister of Finance who has already promised there will be cuts 
made in next year's budget. Perhaps there are some interim 
results of the review which the government is acting upon but 
has not yet made public. This action is quite conceivable given 
the events in the House of the past two weeks. Perhaps the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage has heard from the President of 
the Privy Council about the restructuring of the Department of 
Canadian Heritage but remains very content at this time to 
symbolically move the tables and chairs.
<P>
	The Department of Canadian Heritage is a mishmash of 
responsibility, a helter-skelter of activities, programs, 
departments and bureaucrats. The department is responsible for: 
the Canada Council; the CBC; Telefilm Canada; the Museum of 
Civilization; the Museum of Nature; the CRTC; the National 
Archives; the National Arts Centre; the National Battlefields 
Commission; the National Capital Commission; the National 
Film Board; the National Gallery; the National Library; the 
Museum of Science and Technology; the Public Service 
Commission; the Advisory Council on the Status of Women; 
Status of Women Canada; amateur sport and official games; 
official languages; Parks Canada, historic sites and monuments; 
Canadian Race Relations Foundation; Canadian Heritage 
Languages Institute; multiculturalism; and copyright.
<P>
	There is no strategy, no evident plan for the management of 
this department. It simply serves as a grab-bag for anything that 
smacks of heritage. The Liberals have spent no time planning an 
effective and downsized ministry but have rushed headlong to 
put Bill C-53 in place giving the minister broad and sweeping 
powers.
<P>
	Copyright is a good example of this poor planning. Presently 
copyright is split between the Departments of Industry and 
Canadian Heritage. Industry is responsible for the technical side 
of copyright; heritage is responsible for copyright in so much as 
it relates to heritage issues. This duplication of responsibility is 
extremely inefficient.
<P>
	In fact phase two of the copyright legislation was due last 
spring, but it was postponed until this fall. Now we hear that 
phase two of copyright will not be tabled in the House until next 
spring. The duplication of the responsibility for copyright has 
resulted in administrative and territorial hassles which have so 
far put the legislation more than one year behind schedule. It is 
this kind of inefficiency that Canadians want to see eliminated.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	Copyright is not a heritage issue. Copyright is commercially 
based. It is the exclusive legal right granted for a specified 
period to an author, designer, producer, or another appointed 
person to print, publish, perform, film, or record original 
literary, artistic or musical material. All these artistic activities 
relating to copyright do fall under the auspices of the 
Department of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	However, when creators apply for copyright protection they 
are essentially protecting a business enterprise. Publishing and 
distribution rights as well as protection under copyright laws 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6426"> 6426 </A></B>
<P>
create a commercially based business enterprise. This is a view 
that I support, encouraging more artists to take a business 
approach to their work. When copyright protection is acquired 
or sought an artist becomes a businessman or businesswoman.
<P>
	Currently our copyright laws are antiquated and completely 
out of sync with other areas of the globe. There is a need for 
worldwide harmonization. This becomes far removed from the 
focus of Canadian heritage. In fact it moves copyright beyond 
the mandate of this ministry.
<P>
	Support for copyright changes will be driven by financial 
considerations, irrespective of anything the Bloc Quebecois has 
put forward. It will come from the business community, both 
domestic and international. This scope is externally driven as 
our copyright laws must interface with those that exist both 
within and without the country of Canada. It first must be 
appreciated that it is essential that copyright responsibilities be 
delegated to only one ministry.
<P>
	As I have said, copyright is a business issue which is 
commercially based and externally driven. As such it should 
remain within the portfolio of a ministry that deals primarily 
with the performance and regulation of business and that is the 
Department of Industry. This same conclusion is drawn from the 
following example.
<P>
	Consider a computerized accounting package that is 
developed in New York, patented there and distributed 
internationally, including to Canada. Whoever and wherever are 
the business considerations given to the marketing of that 
product.
<P>
	The pirating of such computer programs is reported to cost the 
computer industry some $7 billion a year in lost revenue in 
North America. Whose responsibility should it be to protect the 
copyright laws in this instance? Surely not the Department of 
Canadian Heritage. Copyright is part of the international 
information highway. It should be in the ministry that deals with 
the organizations that are most affected financially by the 
legislation. That department is the Department of Industry.
<P>
	I repeat that I cannot support Bill C-53 at all. As I stated at the 
outset the intent behind all of this departmental shuffling is to 
downsize government and to save money. At the briefing for this 
bill the question was put categorically: Will this bill cause any 
downsizing of personnel or decreases in spending? The response 
was equally categorical. It was no.
<P>
	This fact alone should be sufficient to merit the bill a 
unanimous rejection by all members of the House. The original 
intent is now muddied because there will be no downsizing and 
no reduction in expenditures. The bill failed dismally on its 
original intent. How can we support a bill which is so 
fundamentally flawed?
<P>
	The taxpayers of Canada told the last government in no 
uncertain terms what they thought of a government that does not 
keep its promises, that fails to balance its books and that fails to 
pay its debt.
<P>
<B>(1315 ) </B>
<P>
	We have in the bill another example of the Liberal 
government failing to learn from past mistakes. The government 
does not care about balancing the budget or addressing the 
national debt. If it did it would begin by restructuring and 
downsizing government departments.
<P>
	The state of Canada's finances is shocking. The Liberal 
government spends over $110 million more every day than it 
generates in revenues. Instead of doing something about it, it 
continues to introduce bills which do not save any money. Nor 
does it cut spending. Instead it introduces legislation like Bill 
C-53 that costs Canadians more and more money.
<P>
	Despite this reason, which is in itself reason enough to oppose 
the bill, there are others. In fact the bill should have another 
name. Instead of Bill C-53 it should be short titled the special 
interest funding bill.
<P>
	The special interest funding bill grants to the minister the 
power to spend millions and millions of hard earned taxpayer 
dollars on such things as grants for thousands of special interest 
groups.
<P>
	Canada is in a fiscal crisis. The federal debt is more than $532 
billion. What is needed is a plan to address this dire situation.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance continues to ask members of the 
Reform Party for constructive ideas for cutting the deficit. The 
minister should wake up and pay attention because my 
colleagues and I have been responding since the beginning of 
Parliament with good ideas about where to find a whole lot of 
spending cuts. The Minister of Finance can begin by cutting all 
federal funding to promote multiculturalism in Canada.
<P>
	The Reform Party supports a number of principles that I fully 
endorse and believe in. We believe that the legitimate role of 
government is to do for people whatever they need to have done 
but cannot do at all or do as well for themselves individually or 
through non-government organizations. We believe in the value 
of enterprise and initiative and that governments have a 
responsibility to foster and protect an environment in which 
initiative and enterprise can be exercised by individuals and 
groups. We believe that public money should be regarded by 
governments as funds held in trust and that governments should 
practise fiscal responsibility, in particular responsibility to 
balance expenditures and revenues.
<P>
	Having said that, one can understand why I believe in the 
principle that individuals or groups should be free to present 
their cultural heritage using their own resources. The Reform 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6427"> 6427 </A></B>
<P>
Party opposes the current concept of multiculturalism and 
hyphenated Canadianism pursued by the Government of 
Canada. We would end funding of the multicultural program and 
support the abolition of the department and the Secretary of 
State for Multiculturalism.
<P>
	If the Minister of Finance sincerely wants ideas on how to cut 
his deficit, he will get rid of this aspect of special interest 
funding and immediately save the Canadian taxpayers some 
$38.8 million a year. If we include official languages in this 
special interest cash cow we can save close to one-quarter of a 
billion dollars.
<P>
	Multiculturalism is an idea that is fundamentally flawed and I 
will spend the next few minutes explaining this point. 
Multiculturalism was introduced in the House of Commons on 
October 8, 1971. In the 23 years that have followed it has been 
politically incorrect for anyone to criticize it, especially in the 
House of Commons.
<P>
	In fact members of Parliament from the Tories, the Grits and 
the NDP have all used the multiculturalism policy in an 
insincere, superficial and shallow manner to garner political 
support from ethnic communities. There is now a new voice, 
another voice of reason in the House of Commons, a Reform 
voice that takes the wishes of the majority of Canadians to the 
House on any and all issues. That includes expressing a 
categorical rejection of the federal government spending money 
on multiculturalism.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	We all want the right to retain our roots but what we have is 
Trudeau's enforced multicultural scams. The costs have been 
excessive. Ethnic group is pitted against ethnic group and the 
country is fragmented into 1,000 consciences. Trudeau's ideas 
about multiculturalism continue to contribute as a primary 
factor in the erosion of federalism and Canadian unity. Catering 
to special interest groups à la Trudeau and company smashes the 
spine of federalism. This destructive outcome is almost 
inevitable so long as we officially encourage large groups to 
remain apart from the mainstream.
<P>
	The multiculturalism policy was designed to recognize and 
promote the understanding that multiculturalism reflects the 
cultural and racial diversity of Canadian society and 
acknowledges the freedom of all members of Canadian society 
to preserve, enhance and share their cultural heritage. It is 
intended to promote full and equitable participation of 
individuals and communities of all origins in all aspects of 
Canadian life, including equal treatment and equal protection 
under the law while respecting and valuing their diversity. The 
language of the policy is fairly innocuous and well meaning but 
in practice it endorses the agendas of special interest groups at 
the expense of the taxpayer.
<P>
	Before continuing, let me quote from Philip Resnick's book 
<I>Thinking English Canada</I> as he reflects on multiculturalism and 
its limits:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The emergence of multiculturalism as a force in Canadian politics was a 
belated response to a sociological transformation going back to the turn of the 
century. Waves of immigration pouring into Canada at that period from central, 
eastern and southern Europe could not with time dilute the overwhelmingly 
Anglo-Saxon character of Canada outside Quebec. The further migration of 
millions to this country in the post World War II period and the removal of de 
facto barriers to non-European migration in the 1960s would deeply alter the 
face of Canada and its urban centres in particular. Visible minorities from the 
West Indies, Central and South America, the Far East, the Indian subcontinent, 
the Middle East, even Africa have taken on a new importance to a point where 
they will constitute 15 per cent of the total population of Canada by the year 2000. 
Audible minorities speaking over 100 different languages and mirroring a 
myriad of cultures have become an integral part of the Canadian mosiac. To deny 
their specificity and their presence is to play ostrich, redneck or worse.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>At the same time, people of diverse backgrounds have chosen to migrate to 
Canada and, in most cases to become Canadian citizens. This decision means that 
they and their offspring subscribe to the political, legal, and other features that 
characterize this country and cannot expect special treatment or recognition as 
groups apart, nor can they simply import with them blood feuds and hatred from 
countries from which they originate and give them new expression on Canadian 
soil. The price of forging a new nationality out of diverse elements is a fair degree 
of tolerance and goodwill all around.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Reznick continues on multiculturalism:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In one way multiculturalism opens up wonderful opportunities to tap the 
diversity of Canada's ethnic heritage, itself a microcosm, more and more, of the 
planet as a whole. To the degree that English Canada, moreover, has become less 
European or less white, to the degree that it has shed a predominantly British 
Isles tropism, it has gone beyond ethnicity in laying the foundations for national 
identity.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Such developments, in Resnick's opinion, are reason for 
celebration. He says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>English-Canadian society represents a remarkable amalgam of cultural 
communities and people; wisely it does not require that each of these surrender 
its identity in order to become Canadian. If English Canada is to develop a sense 
of itself as a nation, it will be through continuing to foster such open 
mindedness in the years to come.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Where I would draw the line, however, is with a multiculturalism that might 
seek to deny a specifically Canadian or English-Canadian identity altogether.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In a world where nationality remains a primary source of identity-whatever 
the 21st or 25th centuries may bring-English Canadians must be careful not to 
deny themselves the ability to think of themselves as a nation. National identity 
requires a primacy for English against any other language, a minimal sense of 
our past and of the political traditions we have developed, a sense of place, here 
in the northern part of North America and nowhere else. English Canada is 
multicultural but it must be based on something more than multiculturalism.</BLOCKQUOTE>

	Resnick's ideas capture the need we have in Canada for a new 
vision of federalism.

<P>
	The member for Port Moody-Coquitlam placed a question 
on the Order Paper which requested for 1993 the total amount of 
funds received by individuals and groups from the Department 
of Multiculturalism, who these individuals were and how much 
they received. The response to the question staggered me and 
should sicken taxpayers.
<P>
	The response from the government was a 703-page document 
that detailed 1,350 grants at a cost of $25,041,939. Let me share 
some of the outrageous grants that are doled out in the so-called 
interests of promoting multiculturalism.
<P>
	Lu Hanessian Productions received $19,254 to produce a 
musical review of 27 songs and musical vignettes about human 
relationships. That is 20,000 taxpayer dollars wasted on a 
montage of songs that could, indeed should, have been produced 
with support from the private sector.
<P>
	The Ottawa-Carleton Learning Foundation spent $9,044 to 
study the feasibility of offering engineers courses that integrate 
first generation Canadian engineers into the profession. 
Engineers by virtue of being engineers are already fairly 
privileged. I doubt that they need any further special integration 
courses. This is an example of the government giving grant 
money to individuals who do not need it but who should seek 
professional support from their peers.
<P>
	The Multicultural Society of Ontario spent $40,000 on 
activities related to the Montreal venue of the national tour of 
many rivers. We do not even know what the activities are, but 
$40,000 is a lot of money for a tour of some rivers.
<P>
	The Folks Arts Council of St. Catharines Multicultural Centre 
is spending $28,000 to study the needs of the community with 
respect to folk arts. This $28,000 is not even going to 
multicultural groups themselves. It is going into the pockets of 
self-appointed experts to determine what the needs of the 
community are with respect to folk art. This is ridiculous. We 
have a government spending more time and more money 
worrying about satisfying folk art needs than it does addressing 
the debt and deficit.
<P>
	The Dance Centre will spend $30,000 bringing dancers 
together to meet and create a list of dance resources. Here is the 
Liberal government giving $30,000 so that dancers can meet and 
create a list of themselves. This money is not even going to help 
dancers dance.
<P>
	As I said, the grants fill 703 pages. This list of outrageous 
grants goes on and on. This is a 703-page example of 
government wasting taxpayers' money. These are the kinds of 
special interest handouts that have to stop.
<P>
	Canadians remain unsure of what multiculturalism is, what it 
is trying to do and why and what it can accomplish in a free and 
democratic society such as ours. Multiculturalism can 
encompass folk songs, dance, food, festivals, arts and crafts, 
museums, heritage languages, ethnic studies, ethnic presses, 
race relations, culture  sharing and human rights. Much of the 
opposition to multiculturalism results from the indiscriminate 
application of the term to a wide range of situations, practices, 
expectations and goals, as well as its institutionalization as state 
policy, an expensive one at that.
<P>
	Public support for multiculturalism has been difficult to 
ascertain. In the early 1970s when the Royal Commission on 
Bilingualism and Biculturalism recommended the government 
introduce some ethnocultural policy, public support for 
multiculturalism was at around 76 per cent. An Angus Reid poll 
in 1991 shows that figure has not changed much. It remains at 78 
per cent. But what can we make of this level of support? Little to 
nothing, I suggest. For at the same time that this poll was being 
done, the Citizens' Forum on Canada's Future reported some 
uneasiness about the Canadian public's attitude toward 
multiculturalism policy.
<P>
<B>(1330 ) </B>
<P>
	It stated: ``Overwhelmingly, participants told us that 
reminding us of our different origins is less useful in building a 
unified country than emphasizing the things we have in 
common. While Canadians accept and value Canada's cultural 
diversity, they do not value many of the activities of the 
multicultural program of the federal government. These are seen 
as expensive and divisive in that they remind Canadians of their 
different origins rather than their shared symbols, society and 
future''.
<P>
	Further, a Decima survey was commissioned by the Canadian 
Council of Christians and Jews and carried out in October 1993. 
The survey found that three out of four Canadians expressed a 
preference for an American style melting pot approach to 
immigration over the multicultural mosaic that has been 
officially promoted in Canada since the 1970s.
<P>
	The survey also disclosed that Canadians generally are 
increasingly intolerant of interest group demands and that there 
is a relatively strong view that particularly ethnic, racial or 
religious minorities must make more efforts to adapt to Canada 
rather than insist upon a maintenance of difference, especially at 
federal expense.
<P>
	Roughly similar proportions of visible minorities expressed 
the same sentiments. This poll would suggest that it is the 
prevalent opinion among the groups targeted to receive 
multiculturalism grants that such grants are divisive and not 
uniting.
<P>
	As I mentioned, criticism of the status quo has been 
increasing from the policy's supposed beneficiaries. Jimmy 
Wong who emigrated from Vietnam in 1980 and is now a 
technician at a photo processing lab commented: ``The 
government spends too much money on something that is not 
necessary. Canada has freedom and work for anyone who wants 
it and that is all newcomers need''. Richmond magazine editor 
Anthony Choy 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6429"> 6429 </A></B>
<P>
agrees that government sanctioned segregation is no good for 
Canada.
<P>
	What seems to be clear is that there is an erosion of support 
for multiculturalism by the citizens of Canada. This erosion of 
support for the multicultural approach, particularly given that 
minorities themselves concur, does nothing to promote harmony 
and unity in Canada because it does not recognize that all 
Canadians are equal.
<P>
	Earlier I referred to the Citizens' Forum on Canada's Future. 
This royal commission is better know as the Spicer commission. 
Mr. Spicer's views were well enough respected to earn him the 
chair of the royal commission on Canada's future.
<P>
	We should take a brief look at his views on the future of 
multiculturalism. Mr. Spicer clearly saw the need for 
integration. In 1987 he said: ``Isn't the time coming to stop 
making a religion of mosaics altogether and to start fostering a 
national spirit we can all identify with? With constant 
intermarriage, for how many generations more must an English 
or Ukrainian Canadian revere his presumed roots?'' Spicer went 
on to accuse the government of making a virtue of a weakness, a 
glory of a hindrance to nationhood. We pay people to have 
foreign roots.
<P>
	Two years later, just before he was given the chair of the royal 
commission, he wrote an article which appeared in the Montreal 
<I>Gazette</I> stating that state funded multiculturalism encourages 
not Canadians but professional ethnics and that 
multiculturalism was an anthology of terrors: Balkanization, 
ethnic politicians siphoning off political protection money, 
ghetto mentalities, destabilization of Quebec leading to 
secession-look where we are today-reverse intolerance for 
Canadian culture and institutions and a devaluation of the very 
idea of a common nationality.
<P>
	At first blush the armies of the politically correct would have 
us think that Mr. Spicer's views are extreme and 
unrepresentative. However, nothing could be further from the 
truth. I referred earlier to the 1991 Angus Reid study on 
multiculturalism in Canada. It is the most comprehensive and 
the most recent evaluation of Canadians' attitude toward 
multiculturalism. Its findings echo the comments made by Mr. 
Spicer.
<P>
	In a section of the study on multiculturalism policy and the 
federal government in general, groups knew little of the federal 
government's policy on multiculturalism and most of those who 
claimed familiarity were, upon further probing, unable to 
provide substantive details of the policy. Further, the study 
dispels the myth that it is only the west where we find people 
opposed to multiculturalism spending. The report states clearly 
that there was a widespread feeling that the government should 
not be involved in multiculturalism especially in Toronto and 
Calgary and the notion that multiculturalism policy was 
ultimately divisive was expressed clearly in Montreal, Toronto 
and Calgary.
<P>
<B>(1335 ) </B>
<P>
	The study also evaluated the Canadian Race Relations 
Foundation and the Canadian Heritage Languages Institute, both 
of which are large components of the multicultural program.
<P>
	Regarding race relations, respondents did not believe that it 
was the task of government to eliminate racism. They believed it 
should be handled within the community or one on one. 
Regarding the languages institute, respondents in Toronto, 
Winnipeg and Calgary expressed the view that ultimately the 
responsibility for preserving heritage languages resides at the 
family or the community level.
<P>
	Importantly many participants noted that funds to any of the 
organizations should come from private not public funding 
sources. When people begin to criticize multicultural federal 
funding, the liberal left often trot out section 27 of the Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms to justify the continuous pouring of 
taxpayers dollars down the multicultural drain. Section 27 of the 
charter states: ``This charter shall be interpreted in a manner 
consistent with the preservation and enhancement of the 
multicultural heritage of Canadians''.
<P>
	For the Liberal left any reference to the charter is meant to be 
an immediate conversation winner as it serves as their Bible. 
Any reference to it is as such deemed to be incontrovertible. 
However, in this instance section 27 will not save them. Peter 
Hogg, understood to be the leading constitutional expert, even 
by the liberal left, doubts the utility of this section, calling it a 
mere rhetorical flourish.
<P>
	I must share the words of another Canadian author, Richard 
Ogmundson. He writes:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Times have changed and we have moved on, apparently in the most 
accidental fashion, to a new social policy called multiculturalism. My visceral 
understanding of this is that the old social contract, upon which I based my life, 
has been terminated. It has apparently been replaced with a new social contract 
that emphasizes ``old world'' cultural identifications. It would appear that the 
cultural ideal has become that of a hyphenated Canadian. Apparently, one is 
now supposedly to identify primarily as Aboriginal, French, British, Italian, 
Sikh or whatever, and only secondary as a Canadian. In this view, it would 
appear that there is no cultural space available for someone, like myself, who 
wants to be a Canadian. At best, this category is considered secondary, residual 
or anomalous. At worst, someone who wishes to identify as a Canadian is likely 
to be considered chauvinist, reactionary, racist, and bigoted.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>My visceral reaction to this sequence of events is that I have been deprived of 
my primary cultural identification by the opportunists who run this country. In a 
way, one might consider the multiculturalism program to be a form of cultural 
genocide aimed at the destruction of a pan-Canadian identity.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I feel an acute sense of betrayal. I feel a sense of demotion. I feel that I have 
been told that, by virtue of my ethnic heritage, I'm not good enough to be a 
full-fledged member of Canadian society.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

<P>
	Our vision of Canada should be committed to the goal of 
social and personal well-being that values individuality while 
emphasizing themes like family and community assumption of 
responsibility, problem solving and communicating these value 
sets to a means of better group life. However, at no time should 
the rights of a group supersede the rights of individuals unless 
the group happens to consist of a majority within Canada.
<P>
	This discussion of multiculturalism serves as an example of 
how Bill C-53 really is a special interest funding bill. I have 
shown how the federal government's interpretations of 
multiculturalism support must come to an end. We can no longer 
spend money we do not have financing such a notion. The Angus 
Reid study from 1991 clearly showed that not only has the 
multiculturalism program failed but Canadians oppose it.
<P>
	Bill C-53 gives to the Minister of Canadian Heritage the 
power to spend money on programs which fundamentally 
undermine the unity of this country. Canadians are tired of a 
status quo government. Canadians will not support or tolerate 
further special interest funding and they will not support the 
bill.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Secretary of State 
(Multiculturalism) (Status of Women)):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
very pleased to join this discussion in the House today and to 
speak to Bill C-53, the Department of Canadian Heritage Act. 
The bill is designed to give legal status to the amalgamation of 
five predecessor organizations, the Secretary of State, the 
Department of Multiculturalism and Citizenship, the 
Department of Fitness and Amateur Sport, the parks 
departments of Canada, a component of Environment Canada, 
and the cultural broadcasting and heritage components of the 
Department of Communications.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	This profound reorganization reflects the government's 
commitment toward more efficient and effective government. 
Under the new arrangement one department is responsible for 
delivering a critical mandate. The Department of Canadian 
Heritage brings together many elements that define us as 
Canadians, as who we really are, a multifaceted, dynamic and 
diverse nation with a very rich cultural and natural heritage. Our 
geography and our culture are as diversified as one could 
possibly find. We should not be asking the question of who is a 
real Canadian. That is answered as a matter of citizenship. We 
must ask ourselves what are our Canadian values and how do we 
appreciate and communicate their importance to all Canadians.
<P>
	I would say that those I have just been listening to have been 
communicating a tremendous degree of misinformation. I hope 
my remarks will put proper information in the hands of all 
Canadians.
<P>
	The fact is that we have always been a multicultural, 
multilingual nation, from the many native communities and 
native peoples that existed here before the founding of our two 
nations, that is the British and the French who came here and 
later joined the aboriginal people and the Inuit. We were later 
joined by people from around the world to build a bilingual and 
multicultural Canada and that is our reality. This new 
department is responsible, and I will quote from the legislation, 
for ``the promotion of a greater understanding of human rights, 
fundamental freedoms, and related values as well as 
multiculturalism''.
<P>
	Canada's multicultural nature is something we have already 
entrenched in section 27 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
It is one of which all Canadians can be proud. No one has been 
asked to remove their roots. Everyone has been told they are 
welcome here in Canada and please bring their culture with 
them, not their ancient angry patterns.
<P>
	We have codified our commitment to respect the diversity of 
this nation by unanimously passing the world's first 
multiculturalism act. By placing this policy, this program, this 
name, whatever we wish to call it, by placing multiculturalism 
within the context of the Department of Canadian Heritage we 
are ensuring that this is a policy that addresses the needs of all 
Canadians.
<P>
	Everyone in the House, regardless of colour, race, language, 
creed or religion is a Canadian by right of birth or by right of 
choice if they hold a Canadian citizenship passport.
<P>
	My vision of today's multiculturalism relates as a word to its 
policy, to its program, how it describes our reality. It is one that 
encompasses the full diversity of our people. It includes those 
whose families arrived from Europe many centuries ago as well 
as those who recently arrived from the four corners of the globe. 
Canada reflects the world for the world is here in the nature of 
our people and the citizenship that they hold.
<P>
	The mandated program is to provide and promote a greater 
sense of intercultural and interracial understanding and that is 
not laissez-faireism. That is active understanding of who we 
are, how we came to be, and an appreciation of the uniqueness of 
this Canadian mosaic. That is what I would have liked to have 
heard from across the floor. It is most unfortunate that was not 
the language of the discourse.
<P>
	We must all recognize that in order to achieve this goal of 
social cohesion, social understanding and acceptance, the 
government is only spending $1 per year per Canadian. It is 
barely enough I believe to ensure social cohesion, social 
harmony and the great country that we are.

<P>
	It is a broad but essential mandate, if we want to consolidate 
the elements needed to foster a sense of Canadian identity. The 
place of multiculturalism in this context shows the paramount 
importance of this policy in strengthening our national identity.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	A great deal has been said about the situations that caused 
deep disagreements within our society. The so-called break-up 
of the family, the greater visibility of our multicultural 
population, the prolonged recession from which we are only 
now emerging have all led us to ponder who we are and what we 
represent, even though the United Nations still rates our country 
as the best in the world.
<P>
	The Department of Canadian Heritage was created to promote 
understanding of our diversity, active involvement in Canadian 
society and knowledge of our cultural and natural wealth. It 
carries out this mandate by implementing policies and programs 
designed to help resolve disagreements, clear up 
misunderstandings and make us proud of our personal and 
national identity.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The increasing diversity of our population is only one of the 
dramatic changes that we are facing. Efforts to deal with these 
demographic changes are occurring in the face of a number of 
destabilizing and worrisome dilemmas: world recession, 
structural changes in the economy, poverty, job losses and other 
global moves, youth alienation and the difficulty of achieving 
political consensus on major issues.
<P>
	Our response to these challenges demands adjustment by and 
for our people, both as individuals and in their national 
institutions. Achieving progress can be a daunting task but a 
worthy challenge.
<P>
	For example, since taking on the responsibility of Secretary 
of State for Multiculturalism and travelling across this land and 
speaking with the people, I have become aware as never before 
that nation building in a culturally diverse society is a 
formidable but necessary challenge. The importance of this task 
must not be underestimated because it involves reconciling 
cultural diversity with national goals, with national identity. It 
involves ensuring respect, understanding and appreciation for 
differences. It involves ensuring that the tapestry which we have 
woven together with its multicultural colours and its uneven 
surface is one to be appreciated and one to be admired, with the 
overwhelming need to ensure that national unity is understood 
as a common value of which we can be very proud, talking about 
a national unity, talking about a sense of pride.
<P>
	I listened earlier to some of the remarks and I do not feel there 
is a sense of betrayal. I certainly do not feel like a fractionated or 
hyphenated or disembowelled individual who has to cut off my 
roots and sense of belonging in order to have a sense of pride and 
belonging in order to be seen as a Canadian with all the 
attributes I bring in that personality and in that persona.
<P>
	I am just not a hyphenated Canadian. I am a Canadian who is 
proud of her cultural heritage. In Quebec I am a Montrealer. In 
Canada I am a Quebecer and around the world I am a Canadian. 
If anyone asks me it is with pride that I say I am a Canadian 
almost anywhere in this world including in my own city or 
province.
<P>
	Let me make it quite clear that none of those identities is 
incompatible with the strong sense of national identity and 
pride. It is very much what I am. It is very much that which I am 
first and foremost, a proud daughter with Jewish roots. I am a 
mother. I am a grandmother. I share my care, my love and 
concern and can spread it equally, evenly and as need be. For me 
that is no conflict. For Canadians, I have spoken to all origins. 
Whether Italian, Greek, Hungarian, Romanian, from Sri Lanka, 
Indo-Canadians, whether they are Chinese or Chilean, Catholic, 
Protestant, Muslim or Jewish, this is not the issue.
<P>
<B>(1350 ) </B>
<P>
	The issue is that there is a social contract in Canada that says 
we share together, learn together, appreciate what we have here 
and protect it. It is like a very tender young flower. It is a 
democracy that is messy sometimes but it is the finest thing in 
the world. We have every reason to be proud of our families, our 
roots, our heritage. It is through the family and through 
volunteerism and with participation with the state and the 
institutions and structures of the state that we can accomplish 
the kind of country we have all inherited, are inspired by and 
have a responsibility to protect.
<P>
	That is why we work closely and in partnership with other 
levels of government and with key stakeholders in the 
community. By bringing together various institutions we work 
to assist them in becoming more responsive to the access needs 
of our people, to the sense of belonging, to the need for 
employment and housing, and respect in our health institutions 
and all aspects of our daily living tasks. By working as 
mainstream Canadians with newly emerging Canadians as well 
as others we help to build a Canada that is inclusive of all 
people.
<P>
	Our partnership with organizations such as the Canadian 
Ethnocultural Council, the Canadian Association of Chiefs of 
Police, the Federation of Mayors and Municipalities, the 
Conference Board of Canada, Multicultural Canada, the 
Canadian Advertising Foundation, the Asia-Pacific 
Foundation, the Canadian Association of Broadcasters and as 
well with the mayors of major cities we work and give our funds 
to these organiza-

<P>
tions in shared partnership as leverage so that we can promote a 
better understanding and destroy myths  and stereotypes such as 
have been promoted from across this floor this morning.
<P>
	We work with these partners to break down prejudice, 
misinformation, disinformation and to ensure fairness and 
equality for all people, to build understanding and create that 
sense of belonging.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Fortunately, Canada's experience in the last 20 years 
generally offers a positive viewpoint on multiculturalism 
issues, on bringing cultural communities together. What is 
needed to bridge the gap between new arrivals and the Canadian 
community receiving them is to build a society based on a 
consensus about what constitutes the common good for people 
with diverse interests, backgrounds, origins and beliefs; give 
everyone a role to play in the big issues; and identify peaceful 
solutions to potentially explosive problems.
<P>
	In short, social peace is behind all the efforts we make through 
multiculturalism goals and strategies.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I have travelled across the country. I have listened sometimes 
to the misunderstanding but I have listened to the people and 
have heard what they have said about our diversity. I have heard 
about the economic advantage of a diverse population, 
advantages when we have such increases in foreign trade. We 
have also learned that when business is responsive to and 
reflective of its diversity it can be profitable as well.
<P>
	The advertising council's colour your money study showed 
that by producing representative advertising companies such as 
the Bay, Zellers and McDonald's increased their revenues 
because people felt welcome. They felt they could be received 
behind the counter and were perceived as clients when the 
advertising was put out; they belonged as Canadians and would 
be served by Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This and other experiences have convinced me that the 
programs and policies under my responsibility are a great help 
in dealing with the problems facing us as a country with a very 
diverse population comprised of many different groups and 
peoples.
<P>
	As you know, at least 46 different countries and ethnic 
communities are represented in my riding of Mount Royal, 
while Canada has over 100 ethnic communities.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Frank Rutter, a foreign affairs writer for the Vancouver <I>Sun</I>, 
has described multiculturalism as sweeping the world and as 
trying to balance a multicultural heritage with a national soul.
<P>
	The implications of not achieving that balance are very 
worrisome, if not horrific. We only have to look at what is 
happening in the world around us to see the results of not trying 
to reconcile different realities of diversity and ensuring a sense 
of unity, a sense of belonging and a sense of pride.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I stated the obvious because Canada must clearly approach the 
issue of cultural diversity with rigour, sensitivity and 
broad-mindedness or be willing to suffer the consequences. The 
approach adopted by our country in dealing with 
multiculturalism is an asset that has allowed us to avoid the 
ethnic tensions plaguing other countries.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Let us realize the real picture of whom we are today. 
Forty-two per cent of all Canadians have origins other than 
British and French. With respect to our people of colour, those 
statistics are often referred to in Statistics Canada reports as 
visible minorities in Canada. Nationally these were 6 per cent in 
1986, 10 per cent by the year 2000. In our major cities, 17 per 
cent in 1986 and 30 per cent by the year 2000. However in 
Toronto alone there will be approximately 50 per cent 
non-English and non-French backgrounds with 30 per cent 
visible minorities. Other major Canadian cities are undergoing 
similar changes.
<P>
	Therefore the increasing diversity of Canada has broad 
ranging implications. Given an increasingly multicultural 
reality, Canadian governments and institutions face a number of 
practical challenges.
<P>
	Let me close this part of my remarks by saying that fostering a 
national sense of belonging does not mean asking people to cut 
off their roots. It does not mean asking mainstream Canadians to 
forget their origins. It means telling, asking, expecting, 
teaching, training and educating so that we have an appreciation 
of where we started, with aboriginal, multicultural, multilingual 
peoples, whom we added and how we have lived together in 
peace and understanding.
<P>
	I would hope that as I continue talking about the Canadian 
mosaic people will learn and appreciate the role that we play for 
a dollar a year for each Canadian.
<P>
	We have to talk about how we ensure and promote growth and 
understanding of our diversity while recognizing our common 
values. I believe we have to find and implement effective ways 
to eliminate discrimination, prejudice, racism and bigotry based 
on the colour of our skin, our religious beliefs or our cultural 
differences. We have to learn how to encourage individuals and 
institutions to make a commitment to work toward eliminating 
and erasing racism.
<P>

	These are all programs and projects which we undertake 
jointly with community groups to ensure that people can get 
together to understand and know each other in a much more 
neighbourly way.
<P>
	How to involve people in welcoming and facilitating the 
integration-

	<B>The Speaker:</B> We will await the hon. member's words with 
great anticipation.

	It being 2 p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 30(5), the House

Mr. Speaker, yesterday in Bosnia, Warrant Officer Tom 
Martineau, who is serving in central Bosnia with the Lord 
Strathcona's Horse Battle Group, was injured during an 
exchange of fire between Bosnian government and Bosnian Serb 
forces.
<P>
	Warrant Officer Martineau received a single gunshot wound 
to his left side while working at an observation post in the 
Bosnian Serb side of the confrontation line about eight 
kilometres east of Visoko. He was observing warring faction 
activity from a Cougar armoured vehicle when he was struck 
during an exchange of fire between the opposing sides. We are 
very proud of the useful work that our Canadian forces are doing 
on the international scene.

Lumby, B.C., for assistance in deterring criminal acts such as 
those committed against Rodney Bell, an Oyama who had his 
skull smashed by an axe wielding youth, or an RCMP officer 
who was crippled for life after he was intentionally struck by a

be a priority for a Liberal government''.

guns owned by responsible citizens.

government to enact legislation which will protect Canada's

<P>
	It will be important for all of us to pick up the call begun by 
these groups. In order for future generations to have a 
sustainable environment we must do everything within our 
power to protect species, both plant and animal, which are in 
danger of becoming extinct.

years ago today saw the dawn of German unity, when the 
governments of east and west Germany forged one republic. 
Heralded by the fall of the Berlin wall, the coming together of 
the two halves of that nation hastened the end of the cold war.
<P>
	The process was not easy. The political differences which 
separated the two halves were formidable. But the will to 
achieve a united nationhood and to act on it was stronger. Unity 
of effort is no less important than unity of purpose.
<P>
	I call on my colleagues to join in today's celebration of 
German Unity Day. It marks the triumph of a people's freedom 
to live in a democracy and the end of a tragic part of German

set immigration and refugee policy are like this government's 
other consultations: while the people are being consulted, the 
real decisions are made by a small group chosen by the minister.
<P>
	The minister's questionable strategy of openness clearly 
shows that he intends to keep the major stakeholders, namely the 
organizations which defend the interests of immigrants and 
refugees, away from the implementation of this policy.

	How can the minister claim to really consult the people when 
the decisions are made by a chosen few? When will the

every year through RRSPs many Canadians manage to put aside 
a small portion of their income for retirement.
<P>
	This nest egg does not mean they are wealthy. But it does 
represent their hard work and gives them some assurance about 
their future. Today that nest egg is in jeopardy of being taxed 
because of a government which cannot find a better way to 
balance the budget.
<P>
	Instead of encouraging Canadians to provide for themselves, 
taxation of RRSPs in effect says, do not earn, do not save, do not 
invest and do not plan for retirement.
<P>
	To tax our RRSPs is to tax our future. It is a short-sighted 
solution that will provide for the migration of Canadians and 
their money out of this country.

the government will be bringing forward its long-awaited social 
policy reform paper. Certainly poverty is increasing in this 
country, not decreasing, and there needs to be real change in the 
way that we deal with these issues.
<P>
	However, I would say that while we see lots of hype about 
welfare reforms, let us take a look at whose welfare really needs 
reform. Each year thousands of corporate companies get away 
with paying no income tax and receive millions of dollars in tax 
credits.
<P>

<P>
	There are no means or income tests for the corporate sector as 
there are for those on unemployment insurance or welfare.

income tax and 48 per cent came from personal income taxes.

government has decided to hit the middle class yet again through 
social policy reform while continuing to let the corporations off 
scot-free.

agricultural industries, worth over $50 billion. The unabated 
growth in greenhouse gas emissions will lead to more frequent 
and severe weather events costing billions of dollars for all 
Canadians.
<P>
	The government recognizes the nature of the threat and is 
committed to having an action program in place on greenhouse 
gas emissions by 1995. Furthermore, Canada is committed to 
table its plan. A draft report on options for such action will be 
before the Canadian public. Consultations are being held this 
week and next week and comments collected then will be 
incorporated into the report.
<P>
	Once a credible program for stabilization is achieved the 
government will work with urban and provincial governments 
with the aim of reducing emissions. Climate change represents a 
tremendous opportunity for Canadians to propose creative and 
credible solutions. Our children's children are looking to us. Let

neither Quebec nor Ontario are on the team?

his commitment to co-operate with the new Quebec government 
seriously, when at the first opportunity, his attitude is so 
uncompromising and so inflexible that he refuses to let Mr. 
Parizeau be replaced by one of his senior ministers?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister

that if the Premier of Quebec was elected on a promise of 
economic growth, is it important enough to him to play on Team 
Canada?

<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	I think none of the other Premiers were given an opportunity

department was involved in the preparation and monitoring of 
the operation to clean up sediments contaminated by PCBs in the 
St. Lawrence River, across from the city of Massena. This 
operation has in fact been put on hold because of serious safety 
problems.
<P>
	Will the minister confirm the direct involvement of her 
department in this extremely delicate operation, or is her 
department merely receiving and blindly approving plans made 
by American authorities?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister

contacted the Canadian government representative regarding 
this issue. Indeed, I was informed that the curtain is not working 
and that the operation has been delayed. The Canadian Minister 
of the Environment was on hand every day. I personally wrote to 
the U.S. EPA administrator to ensure that no operation would be 
undertaken in Massena without our approval.

the minister claim that her department is fully involved in the 
clean-up operation when a memo provided by her department to 
SVP and dated September 23 indicates that no emergency plan, 
in case of a disaster, had yet been made public, this on the eve of 
the PCB clean-up?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, the note from my ministry 
made it quite clear that the Canadian government was on site and 
that the curtain which was supposed to contain the sediment was 
not functioning. That is the reason the operation did not begin.
<P>
	I personally contacted the administrator of the EP in the 
United States to advise her that the Canadian government was 
taking the very firm position that no dredging would go forth

	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for her question.
<P>
	The hon. member has to understand that Canada's social 
security system dates back almost 40 years. There have been 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6438"> 6438 </A></B>
<P>
many changes in our system. I think this will give the hon. 
member an opportunity to debate fundamental issues.
<P>
	One thing is certain however. The hon. member can rest 
assured that this government on this side of the House is not 
advocating the lion's bite as stated by the Reform Party to cut 
$15 billion, taking away student programs, taking away seniors' 
programs, taking away all the programs Canadians have grown 
accustomed to.
<P>
	Early on in the debate it was quite clear that the Reform Party 
only cares about who is paying. The Bloc Quebecois only cares 
about who controls. The only people who truly care about the 
quality of life of Canadians is the Liberal Party.
<P>
<B>(1425 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
members opposite lose no opportunity to distort what Reform 
says on social programs.
<P>
	Reform's deficit elimination plan calls for reductions in 
transfers to provinces and now so does the government's social 
policy paper. For years Reformers have proposed restoring UI to 
its original role as a short term insurance support in case of job 
loss and now so does the government policy paper. For years 
Reformers have proposed a voucher system for distributing 
federal education dollars and now so does the government's 
policy paper.
<P>
	I ask the minister this: When did the government stop reading 
its red book and start reading the Reform policy blue book?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member once again for her question. I want to 
clearly outline to her that we have not tabled the discussion 
paper yet. I think it is only a couple of days away. She can wait. 
The member can rest assured that there is only one measuring 
stick on this side of the House, the discussion paper. The 
implementation of the legislation thereafter will only be 
successful if it improves the quality of life for Canadians. That 
is what this government is all about.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North):</B> Mr. Speaker, I only 
wish that we could hear about these proposals here first instead 
of in the media. The government has obviously been reading the 
Reform policy book but it has been reading it backward. We 
recommend reductions to social spending only after there have 
been cuts in other areas, including reductions in subsidies to 
businesses, interest groups, crown corporations, government 
operations and Parliament itself.
<P>
	Now that the government is proposing cuts how long will 
Canadians have to wait for cuts to MPs' pension plans?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member has to understand that far too many of our 
children live in poverty, far too many of our students are having 
a hard time finding that very first important job, far too many of 
our workers are having problems with the transition from work 
to work. The social security review is about bringing positive 
change to the lives of Canadians and I am sure that the hon. 
member will participate in this historic debate.

question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. During the 
Gynaecologists and Obstetricians Conference held in Montreal 
last week, the physicians confirmed they have on occasion 
treated young girls suffering from the after-effects of genital 
mutilations done right here in Canada.
<P>
	These statements show that excisions and infibulations are 
more widespread than we would have thought. Is the Deputy 
Prime Minister still of the opinion that the current provisions of 
the Criminal Code are sufficient, as the Minister of Justice says?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment): </B>Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Justice said 
in this House, and it is our opinion, that according to the 
Criminal Code, in Canada, to mutilate a person's genitalia is a 
criminal act. However, the Minister of Justice also agreed to 
make sure the Criminal Code was properly enforced in the case 
of genital mutilation and if not, he said he could take other 
actions. He will be presenting a report to this House on that 
issue.
<P>
	In Canada, it is already a crime for anybody, including a 
physician, to perform an operation mutilating a girl's genitalia.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec):</B> Mr. Speaker, is the 
Deputy Prime Minister not of the opinion that the best way to put 
a stop to those inhuman practices is to criminalize them through 
specific clauses leaving no possible margin for doubt?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment): </B>There is no doubt possible. It is definitely 
against the law as it stands today. In Canada, it is a crime to carry 
out any mutilation of a woman's or a girl's genitalia. The 
minister has promised to make sure the Criminal Code is 
properly enforced. It is already a matter of fact that in Canada 
nobody has the right to mutilate women's genitalia.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House

concerned many Canadians. I will bring her question to the

under review.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River):</B> Mr. Speaker, the House

<P>
	A sane society should move toward zero tolerance of drinking 
and driving, not away from it. A sane society puts rape victims 
ahead of rapists.
<P>
	Will the minister urge upon his government a constitutional 
amendment or the use of the notwithstanding clause to ensure 
that when the rights of victims and the rights of criminals 
conflict that the rights of the victim will always prevail?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to

	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport. On 
September 22, Canadian Pacific put out a proposal to buy all of 
the CN rail network east of Winnipeg. The federal government 
responded on September 29 by setting up a parliamentary task 
force on the privatization of Canadian National.
<P>
	Does the minister not think he was cavalier announcing the 
creation of such a task force just days before the 
federal-provincial conference of transport ministers, while the 
future of rail transport depends to a large extent on its 
connection with highway transport, which comes under 
provincial jurisdiction?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
first of all, I would like to point out to my hon. colleague that the 
task force in question is not a parliamentary one, but rather a 
group of government members who were asked to examine the 
possibility of marketing Canadian National activities across the 
country.
<P>
	Naturally, if the government received a counter-proposal 
from CP, such a proposal would have for effect, if accepted, to 
privatize all railway operations in eastern Canada, east of 
Winnipeg. I think that we must make sure we are in a position to 
submit -not only to the government and to Parliament, but to 
all Canadians- any alternative contained in the unsolicited 
proposal from Canadian Pacific.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport again. 
Why did the minister not give directly to the Standing 
Committee on Transport, in which the opposition is represented, 
the mandate of reviewing the CN privatization plan, instead of 
assigning this responsibility to a special task force made up 
exclusively of Liberal members?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
there is no doubt that the last thing we would want to do, whether 
as a minister or government, would be to tell the Standing 
Committee on Transport what to do.
<P>
	As my hon. colleague and my friends from the Reform Party 
know-they announced just last Friday that the committee 
would be holding hearings on airport transfer, on the air 
navigation system and on bilateral talks with the United States; 
this makes for a very busy schedule- nothing stops this 
parliamentary committee on transport from reorganizing its 
schedule to review the whole issue of how the railway system is 
going to operate in Canada. Nothing is stopping it from doing 
that.

Pacific Salmon Commission. This is a bilateral commission

which is jointly funded and  jointly authorized by both countries

	He also knows full well that on Friday past the executive 
secretary of the Pacific Salmon Commission acknowledged the 
counting procedures of the commission and that the numbers 
which are provided to both countries are off this year. The 
commission announced its own internal review.
<P>
	He should know as well that this morning this same 
commission held a press conference in Vancouver. The 
commission expressed its deep regret and offered to co-operate 
fully with the independent review already announced by this 
government last week.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta):</B> Mr. Speaker, the review the 
minister refers to is not an independent review. It is a review by 
people with deep DFO connections. We had an in house inquiry 
after the disaster in 1992 and obviously it proved nothing.
<P>
	We need an independent judicial inquiry which would 
consider not only the scientific evidence but also the human 
factor, the management of the resource. Why will the minister 
not commit to an independent judicial inquiry?

networks of Radio Mutuel and Télémédia merged, resulting in 
the sudden lay-off of over a hundred news employees.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Heritage agree with the merger of Radio 
Mutuel and Télémédia, given that it concentrates the news 
media in Quebec's regions?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are never glad when jobs are lost anywhere. What I 
can say is that at last report, the CRTC received an application 
for this merger from Télémédia and Radio Mutuel. The case is 
before the CRTC, which will hold public hearings; under the 
circumstances, I think that it would be inappropriate for the 
Minister of Heritage to comment.

certainly not going to do it for them.

Acadian World Congress, the heritage minister announced that 
the Cabinet had just approved an overall policy on the 
development of francophone and Acadian communities. 
However, what was announced is nothing more than the 
minister's usual commitment to fulfil his own obligations. 
Unfortunately, the minister did not put in place a real 
comprehensive policy for developing the francophone 
community.
<P>
	While the heritage minister is wasting time on the merits of 
his action plan, francophones' rights continue to be flouted. 
How does he account for the systematic obstruction of Ontario 
francophones' educational rights as is the case in Kingston and 
Longlac?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, first of all, the heritage minister is not stalling 
anything. The previous government, a Conservative 
government, had commitments under the Official Languages 
Act that it never honoured. So how could a government that 
respects minorities and takes all necessary steps to enforce the 
law be accused of stalling? If that is what you accuse it of, I do 
not understand your language at all.
<P>
	Of course, some provincial governments do not behave like 
the federal government. They have responsibilities to those they 
must serve, particularly in the field of education. I am very

$50-odd million that defence made available on a regional basis

commission an independent public inquiry into his department 
to clear up this matter and enable him to resolve any problems it 
reveals?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National 
Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
colleague, the parliamentary secretary, when he gave his 
response last week in my absence was absolutely correct in that 
he believed the question was pertaining to allegations of 
wrongdoing by senior officials in the department such as the 
deputy minister or assistant deputy minister.
<P>
<B>(1455 ) </B>
<P>
	I want to assure the House that no such wrongdoing has been 
proven in any way and I have full confidence in the senior 
officials and my deputy minister.
<P>
	Second, on the question of the renovations of the deputy 
minister's office this is really an Order Paper question that is 
separate from the larger question that the hon. member-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Collenette:</B> If he would listen, it is separate from the 
larger question that the hon. member has a right to be concerned 
about. There were irregularities in contracting. There was 
harassment. There were management practices that were wrong.
<P>
	The Lagueux report, an arm's length report from a senior 
ADM in the department, uncovered these wrongdoings. In one 
case there was a criminal prosecution. In the other there were 
dismissals.
<P>
	The hon. member has all the facts. I think he now has read the 
Lagueux report. In no way does this implicate any of the senior 
officials in the department. The fact is in a big organization like 
defence or any corporate organization there are going to be 
problems. When we see that the problem is there, where we find 
irregularities, we deal with them. Some people were dismissed, 
one person was charged and subsequently convicted.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to thank the minister for his forthright response and I want 
to go on record as saying I am not accusing anyone of anything, 
nor have I ever meant to do that.
<P>
	I would like to say that a confidential memo dated April 13, 
1994 and released under the access to information reveals that 
officials in the defence department informed the minister that 
the media might be asking questions about the deputy minister's 
office renovations.
<P>
	If his own staff felt compelled to warn him about media 
interest, will the minister not admit that there was at least a 
perceived problem with this matter and move to resolve it by 
getting on with an independent inquiry?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National 
Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, one 
of the problems we have in government is that there are from 
time to time disgruntled employees. In this case there was a leak 
from the department about certain renovations.
<P>
	Those renovations to the executive suite of defence I believe 
can be fully justified. I will make all the documents available to 
the hon. member. I will table them in the House.
<P>
	We have to keep some perspective here. It is not cheap to run a 
government. It requires that administrative measures be taken. 
In this case the expenses were fully justifiable.

	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport.
<P>
	I know that all Canadians were shocked last week by the tragic 
sinking of the ferry <I>Estonia</I> and that they join me in extending 
our deepest sympathy to the families of those so tragically 
affected.
<P>
	Could the minister give Canadians his assurance that our 
Canadian ferries are safe?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Fontana (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sure that this is not a laughing 
matter.
<P>
	I join with my colleague who has just expressed our deep 
sorrow and regret at the tragedy of the <I>Estonia</I> and therefore the 
question is quite appropriate.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="6444"> 6444 </A></B>
<P>
	I want to take this opportunity to convey to Canadians that our 
passenger ferries are absolutely safe. Since 1987 Canadian 
passenger ferries have been subjected to independent audits to 
ensure that safe operating procedures are followed.
<P>
	I must also add that Canadian standards for inspection of 
ferries exceed those of international communities so that the 
Canadian public and this House can be assured that our ferries 
are safe.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the absence 
of the Minister of Transport and the Prime Minister, my question 
is for the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am sure that the hon. member inadvertently 
made his first statement. We do not refer to the presence or 
absence of anyone in the House. Would he please put his 
question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Althouse:</B> Mr. Speaker, the Western Grain Transportation 
Act was presented by a past Liberal government as a new 
balance between the needs for railway revenues and the 
legislative guarantees to farmers in the historic crow benefit.
<P>
	The Minister of Transport has made cuts to the farmers' side 
of the equation and is proposing to stop the payments altogether.
<P>
	What is the government proposing for the various lucrative 
formula induced revenues that the railways receive under that 
same legislation?
<P>
<B>(1500 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member 
again does not have his facts straight. The minister has not made 
any statement as to the future of the WGTA. He has made a 
statement and has put in process the opportunity for all of the 
participants in the grain industry to take part in a debate in the 
consultation process regarding the future of that type of support 
to Canadian agriculture.

contained in the Criminal Code are so convoluted as to be legal 
fiction and twice removed from reality.
<P>
	I ask the Minister of Justice to comment on Judge Demetrick's 
declaration and to tell us how such convoluted legislation can 
have any impact upon the criminal use of firearms.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Justice, when going across the country 
this summer to speak to groups concerned about these proposed 
changes to the firearm laws, assured the people with whom he 
spoke that he would undertake a review of what was Bill C-17 
and the regulations to assure that the language and the intent of 
those laws and regulations were pertinent and of value. If they 
were not, if they were convoluted, he gave the assurance that he 
would either change the wording or remove the regulations 
altogether.

	Previous attempts at recognizing this holiday have referred to 
the day as heritage day. However I believe flag day more 
appropriately reflects a symbol which unites us as a nation. This 
is a flag that is recognized throughout the world. The fact that 
1995 will represent the 30th anniversary of our flag is one more 
reason to take this occasion to reflect on our traditions and

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-53, an act to establish the Department of Canadian Heritage 
and to amend and repeal certain other acts, be read the second 
time and referred to a committee; and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Secretary of State 
(Multiculturalism) (Status of Women)):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
addressing the challenges that were before us as a society to 
erase racism, to ensure social cohesion and to also assure that 
there would be shared responsibility between different levels of 
government, between citizens and industry and the private 
sector to enable Canadians to live in peace and harmony with 
respect and understanding.
<P>
<B>(1515 ) </B>
<P>
	The questions I had been addressing, as members have heard, 
include those about how to address the special problems faced 
by disadvantaged minorities, by immigrant women, by women 
of colour, by youth caught between two cultures, by dislocated 
seniors, by those who look different from the majority, by those 
seeking medical assistance who face language and cultural 
barriers and how to ensure fairness and equity of access and 
equivalent accreditation of skills and educational undertakings 
learned in other places but brought to bear, to enrich and to 
enable our country to grow and develop.
<P>
	Last, how do we marginalize those groups which would 
actively promote hatred against others. In that regard, I would 
like to warn members of the House and the public of the 
activities of the Nationalist Party in the promotion of European 
Heritage Week. This group is clearly racist in its intent, white 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6447"> 6447 </A></B>
<P>
supremist, and we must not support the activities that they are 
undertaking.
<P>
	Do not be fooled by fancy posters. Look at the group behind. 
They have become very sophisticated in their approach. I 
particularly want to thank Mayor Rowlands of Toronto for 
bringing this matter to my attention.
<P>
	These are the important questions that together we want to 
answer at all levels of government and institutions. I believe 
those institutions that we have put in place are there to protect 
our democracy, which I pointed out earlier is very fragile. With 
the non-governmental organizations and our community-based 
volunteer groups, we can make a difference.
<P>
	After nearly a year on this job, I have to report that it works. I 
have travelled to hear and to listen. The framework that brings 
together the wide-ranging concepts of our society associated 
with heritage are in place, for example, our cultural policy, our 
official languages policy, the policy on multiculturalism, the 
physical properties of national parks, the importance of human 
rights, charter challenges, volunteerism, sports and a number of 
others.
<P>
	Despite the fact that Canadians have diverse backgrounds and 
origins, they are united by a shared sense of values and an 
attachment to Canada which we have built together, in English 
and in French, as well as with respect for the heritage, language 
and customs of our Canadian citizens.
<P>
	It is also apparent that Canada's increasingly diverse 
population provides a unique resource, a resource base actually 
for successful development and expansion of our economy on 
domestic and international levels. We all know that business is 
international today, that business is multicultural today.
<P>
	We have found in Canada people from all languages, cultures 
and religions who understand the culture of business around the 
world. They could help us develop and expand our economy at 
the domestic and international level.
<P>
	What this implies is that we will fully use those cultural 
languages and skills and the knowledge that people have, and 
the fullest potential of everyone who comes to this country, 
recognize the personal contacts and the means that people have 
to open doors to business, to new markets, to new products and 
new services.
<P>
	If we have the collective will to use the potential of all our 
citizens, and in a sense of fairness and equity for the individual 
and in an undertaking in the best interests of all Canadians, I 
believe we will move forward with a great sense of prosperity 
and understanding.
<P>
	To close off, I want to talk for one moment about this. Canada, 
in its very multicultural mosiac, has a set of laws that are unique 
in this world. They have been coalesced under the proper kind of 
umbrella for their added protection. We wish to all share in the 
development of the experience that we have had here, in the way 
we have the machinery of government in place and that is to be 
shared with the rest of the world.
<P>
	We have been asked to do that. Australia has just copied us. 
We have been asked to go elsewhere where things are even more 
sensitive. Here at home I want people to recognize that we have 
built a constructive model with enormous potential to ensure the 
future success of our society but we should always keep in mind 
the aphorism ``if you're in the business of shining shoes, your 
shoes had better shine''. Our programs need constant upkeep, 
tender loving care and appreciation by the people in the House 
and the people in the country.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	We must not undervalue the civilizing influence of our 
multicultural policies. They may be more lasting than many of 
our great monuments. These policies are about the quality of 
life, about the power of humanizing nations, about people living 
together with hope and a sense of understanding, respect and 
appreciation for the future with a sense of belonging.
<P>
	Canadians must be ever more vigilant. While those who 
promote hatred and bigotry use even more sophisticated 
technology and high tech, we must redouble our efforts in 
promoting a truly just, inclusive and representative society. We 
cannot afford to do less. Giving us this right in the Department 
of Canadian Heritage under Bill C-53 is a status that I believe is 
important. Canadians will learn to treasure the great resource we 
have in all our cultural diversity and give it respect and 
understanding.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with great interest to the member's 
statements. I have a couple of comments and questions I would 
like to ask.
<P>
	In this great country one of the real freedoms we have for 
people who immigrate to Canada from other countries is the 
freedom to preserve their cultural heritage and cultural 
traditions. One of the questions we are asked by Canadians as we 
talk to them about multiculturalism is: Why does the federal 
government feel it is necessary to provide taxpayers' money to 
these groups in order for them to pursue their cultural heritage?
<P>
	Some comment that if a particular ethnic group felt so 
strongly about preserving their cultural heritage they do not 
need federal taxpayers' money to do so. It is provided in the 
freedoms that they enjoy in this country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6448"> 6448 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to ask the member what specifically is the 
government's justification for providing taxpayers' money to 
these cultural groups in order for them to preserve their cultural 
heritage?
<P>
	I have another question or perhaps a comment. I am sure I 
heard the member earlier say that when she was in Quebec she 
was a Quebecer and when she was in Canada she was a 
Canadian.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Finestone:</B> I did not say that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> I would like to ask the hon. member if in fact she 
did say that and if she did not would she refer back to that 
portion of her speech because I thought I had a question for her?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Finestone:</B> Mr. Speaker, the end result of whatever it 
was that I said-I would have to look at the ``blues'' because I do 
not have everything written down-is the fact that I said I am a 
proud Canadian everywhere and anywhere and that is what I am.
<P>
	With respect to the freedoms that the member spoke about, 
with respect to the importance of the federal government 
lending a hand to groups across this land, particularly new 
Canadians, Canadians who have arrived from countries where 
they have suffered terror, trauma, torture and lack of 
understanding of the role of the police when they arrive here 
because they have lived in a police state, I would say to the 
member that as a government, as a people and as human beings it 
is important for us to help them understand the structure of our 
society to enable them to integrate into this society.
<P>
	I have not noticed that without some help major groups have 
volunteered so quickly to go in and help them. I would also like 
to point out that if the member is from an immigrant group-and 
I know from his riding he has had requests and received and 
given grants for immigrant and visible minority women-I 
wonder if he would believe that those visible minority women 
have triple discriminations, have a difficult time adapting to our 
society and have some skill re-learning to do while at the same 
time helping their children get settled.
<P>
	As the member well knows, this country is not famous and 
businesses have not been famous and are just learning to hire 
people who are of colour as one of the equality measures as well 
as on their competence and ability to do the job. We have not 
recognized skills that are learned outside of this country. We 
have accredited to them the equivalences of what they have 
learned elsewhere. Now you do not want to give money to those 
kinds of groups, the visible minority groups who have come to 
him, the Abbotsford youth commission that has come to you, the 
native friendship centres that need money, the anti-racist and 
anti-hate education councils. These are the groups you would 
like to deprive of doing work both at the public, the volunteer, 
and at the institutional level. Well I do not agree with your 
perspective.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Before I continue the period of 
questions and comments I would like to remind everyone to 
direct their comments through the Chair.
<P>
	There are occasions, and maybe in most instances, when you 
could exchange comments very cordially. I know you all debate 
very well and are very respectful of one another but there are 
times when it is awfully critical to go through the Chair. I think 
it is a good practice for all of us when intervening to direct our 
comments through the Chair.
<P>
	With the few moments left in questions and comments, the 
hon. member for Elk Island.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with real 
interest to the speech. I am very interested in the direction the 
government is taking Canada with respect to equality of our 
citizens.
<P>
	Over and over when I have been speaking to groups I ring a 
chord of agreement when I say we need in government policy to 
remove totally any reference to gender, colour, race, or to 
culture because only then can we treat people equally.
<P>
	I have an example of racial and gender discrimination in my 
riding in the person of a young man who in applying for an 
RCMP position for which he was qualified in every way was 
disqualified because he happened to be white and he was male. 
That is sexual discrimination. That is racial discrimination. I do 
not care how you cut it.
<P>
	The direction we are taking where we name certain races, 
certain colours, and female gender as having special privileges 
is perpetuating the kind of apartheid that brought South Africa 
down. We need to remove that. That will be the healthy 
direction.
<P>
	I would really be interested in the minister's comments on 
that.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Finestone:</B> Mr. Speaker, you were in this House when 
we spent a great deal of time studying section 15 of the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms. That was such an important 
section that we delayed the application of section 15 for three 
years. It came into effect April 15, 1985.
<P>
	We do not have time to undertake an extensive examination of 
why section 15, the non-discrimination section of the charter 
and the right to affirmative action given equal competence and 
equal skills is of fundamental value in this country because it is 
equal to the question of fairness, access, respect and 
appreciation for differences.
<P>
	I would suggest, if I may, that the ``Equality for All'' report be 
given to my hon. colleague. I am sure he would like to read it and 
understand why it is not discrimination and is only in the sense 
of the best action, not only in pay equity but employment equity, 
that one would want to move forward anyone who has compe-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6449"> 6449 </A></B>
<P>
tence regardless  of colour, regardless of language, and it is 
antithetical to what South Africa did.
<P>
	It is too bad that this member and the member sitting in front 
of him did not have the opportunity to read the report that could 
have enlightened some very biased disinformation that was 
given this morning.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to participate in the debate on Bill C-53. This 
legislation, described as a mere technicality, provides an ideal 
opportunity to explain Quebec's perspective to our fellow 
Canadians.
<P>
	As you know, the Bloc Quebecois has the mandate to protect 
Quebec's interests at the federal level. Those interests are 
largely dependent on the development of Quebec's own cultural 
life as well as on its exclusive control over it. This is what Mr. 
René Arpin, chairman of the advisory group on Quebec's 
cultural policy, said at the hearings of the standing commission 
on culture, in June 1992.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	He said that ``Quebec's distinct character and sound 
management of priorities require that the province have 
complete control over its cultural choices''. Mr. Arpin added 
that ``the federal government must completely withdraw from 
the cultural sector, regardless of Quebec's constitutional 
future''.
<P>
	Around the same time, the then Quebec minister of Cultural 
Affairs, Mrs. Frulla-Hébert, who can certainly not be labelled a 
sovereignist, said: ``When it comes to programs, the federal 
government does little or no consultating''. Genuine 
consultation is practically non-existent, and, when it does 
occur, it is often at Quebec's request. When, as often happens, it 
is faced with a <I>fait accompli</I>, Quebec has to state its real needs 
after the fact''.
<P>
	Since Bill C-53 mainly concerns federal activities in the 
cultural sphere, I will discuss certain aspects of federal 
encroachment in this area and, more specifically, the causes of 
this intrusion, how it is expressed in the bill, and its harmful 
impact on Quebec's development as an autonomous State.
<P>
	Federalism or the invasion of Quebec: the origin of Quebec's 
problems lies in the very nature of the federal system. In fact, 
Quebec is considered to be just another province, one of ten, 
which is a denial of reality. Federalism means a central 
government that must reconcile the usually divergent interests 
of various regions and cultures.
<P>
	Because the Canadian government, in its infinite wisdom, 
decided that some day we should have a Canadian identity, it 
blithely ignored the situation in Quebec. Now this situation is 
quite different from Canada's. Quebecers are not concerned 
about their identity. Studies keep reminding us that Quebec's 
identity is alive and well, thank you very much. Canada's 
existential problems do not concern Quebecers.
<P>
	Quebecers worry more about their economic and cultural 
development. However, since English Canada is seeking its 
elusive identity, Quebecers will have to contribute financially to 
this quest for the Holy Grail. This, without any decision-making 
power, since the power is shared among representatives of the 
ten provinces. That is one of the ways in which the federal 
system has an impact on Quebec.
<P>
	Another side of federalism we cannot ignore is the negative 
consequences of the federal government's tremendous spending 
powers. These spending powers were gradually granted to the 
Canadian government by the courts which were, and still are, 
dominated by the legal profession from English Canada. 
However, as constitutional expert Gérald Beaudoin has pointed 
out, the courts are uneasy about with this power.
<P>
	After analysing the jurisprudence in this area, Beaudoin noted 
that judges often issue formal warnings to the effect that 
spending powers should not be legislated in an area under 
provincial jurisdiction. He wrote that it was clear that abuse of 
spending powers confused the issue of government 
responsibilities in a federation and could upset a sometimes 
fragile balance.
<P>
	The message is clear. Spending powers which initially were to 
be exercised only in exceptional circumstances are now used, at 
the drop of a hat to intrude in areas under provincial jurisdiction. 
Professor Beaudoin also quoted Professor Jean Beetz, former 
Justice of the Supreme Court, and we found his comments very 
revealing. The former Justice wondered about the financial 
power of federal institutions. Despite ineffectual warnings in 
the jurisprudence, a new kind of legislation had been created 
that allowed the federal government to influence provincial 
jurisdiction by dispensing its largesse as it saw fit.
<P>
	The minister's powers, duties and functions under this 
legislation mostly concern matters of provincial jurisdiction. I 
am referring to the arts; the status of the artist; cultural heritage 
and industries; the conservation, exportation and importation of 
cultural property; and, to a lesser extent, amateur sport.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	The federal government will be investing more than a billion 
dollars a year in Quebec on culture only, and we contend that 
this legislation is a form of back door intervention and an 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6450"> 6450 </A></B>
<P>
encroachment on provincial jurisdiction. We strongly denounce 
such federal schemes in Quebec.
<P>
	As I said earlier, Quebec officials have been asking for years 
for the exclusion of the federal government in the area of culture 
and the transfer of all powers to Quebec. Yet, section 4 of Bill 
C-53 would give Heritage Canada full power in the area of 
Canadian cultural development. Subsection (2) lists the areas of 
jurisdiction, and I will give you some which worry us: the arts, 
including cultural aspects of the status of the artist; cultural 
heritage and industries, including performing arts, visual and 
audio-visual arts, publishing, sound recording, film, video and 
literature; the formulation of cultural policy as it relates to 
foreign investment; the conservation, exportation and 
importation of cultural property. This is not just encroachment, 
this is a full-scale invasion.
<P>
	The predatory attitude of the federal government illustrates 
very well the impossible Canadian duality. On one side, English 
Canada is seeking a national cultural umbrella, hoping it will 
bring about a Canadian identity-a national obsession-and 
hence a Canadian culture. On the other side is Quebec, where 
identity and culture are alive, dynamic and strictly our own.
<P>
	Quebec does not need federal intervention. On the contrary, to 
ensure that Quebec culture continues to blossom, we must be 
free from federal intrusion. We must be given the money spent 
in Quebec by the central government to use as we choose and 
according to priorities that we would set ourselves to meet our 
needs.
<P>
	There are at the present time an astounding number of 
overlaps and duplications between the cultural institutions and 
programs of Quebec and Canada. Here are some: the arts 
councils, the state television networks, the archives, the 
national libraries. Why not save millions for the taxpayers by 
eliminating these duplications and giving Quebec sole 
responsibility in an area so vital for its future as a nation?
<P>
	Culture is what drives society. In a publication entitled <I>Le 
Québec dans un monde nouveau, </I>the present Quebec Premier 
said it in these words: ``Our culture is the blend of our common 
history and heritage, of our common values and institutions. Our 
life as a community, our solidarity and collective vision are 
based on our culture''. He then added: ``Culture is the 
expression of a feeling of belonging to a community, it is the 
very fibre of our people. It is incarnated in our way of life, our 
way of thinking and creating. Within the particular North 
American context, Quebec culture must continually assert 
itself, promote creation expressing its originality, and seek 
enrichment by assimilating contributions from outside its 
borders. These are the requirements necessary to our vitality and 
survival''.
<P>
	Within such a context, it is easy to see how different the 
Quebec culture is from the Canadian experience. We must 
promote the development of our culture, but not within a 
framework imposed by a government representing the other 
group.
<P>
	This was the conclusion reached by two well-known 
Quebecers who followed one another as Quebec Minister for 
Communications and Cultural Affairs. In 1992, Mr. Jean-Paul 
L'Allier and Mr. Denis Vaugeois wrote: ``Political 
subordination and economic inferiority can only breed an 
atrophied and diminished cultural life. It can be artificially 
sustained for a certain period of time as is the case in Canada and 
Quebec. But money is not enough. Inspiration is needed. We 
must be able to rely on our own resources. True development 
cannot come from outside''.
<P>
	It is imperative for the federal government to withdraw from 
Quebec culture and to compensate the Quebec government 
accordingly.
<P>
	Multiculturalism is another area under the jurisdiction of the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage. Here again, Quebec's specificity 
is not being respected.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	There is in Quebec a consensus on how to deal with our fellow 
citizens from outside Quebec. The position adopted 20 years ago 
and systematically maintained since then is based on integration 
and respect. Quebec society favours the full involvement of all 
its members, whether they were born here or elsewhere. 
However, in order to meet this goal, integration into Quebec 
society is emphasized. We expect new immigrants to learn the 
national language, French, and to familiarize themselves with 
our traditions. This position does not imply in any way that 
racism or discrimination in any form is tolerated. On the 
contrary, Quebec society makes it a point to respect differences 
and individual rights.
<P>
	Yet, respecting differences is not the same as officially 
promoting and institutionalizing these differences, as the 
Canadian multiculturalism policy calls for. Quebec has chosen 
to integrate its new members into Quebec society rather than the 
opposite. There is a major and, in my opinion, irreconcilable 
difference.
<P>
	This is another area in which the central government flouts 
Quebec policy. The federal government legislates, creates 
programs and spends considerable amounts to promote the 
opposite approach. While, in our opinion, respect for individual 
rights clearly comes under provincial jurisdiction, the federal 
government continues to encroach on Quebec jurisdiction. We 
denounce and will always denounce this situation. That is 
another fine example of federalism's benefits.
<P>
	Before closing, I will point out another insidious aspect of 
this bill, namely the Canadian heritage minister's duty to 
promote and develop English-speaking minorities. No one 
needs a history lesson to know that only Quebec has an 
English-speaking minority.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6451"> 6451 </A></B>
<P>
	Quebec anglophones are the best-treated linguistic minority 
in Canada, a fact that some of them even recognize. 
Representatives of French-speaking groups from outside 
Quebec would be easily satisfied with the status enjoyed by 
English-speaking Quebecers. Of course, I am not saying that 
there is no room for improvement. However, Quebec treats its 
minority with a very open mind.
<P>
	It is in that context that we question the federal government's 
intentions in this area. In pursuing the objective of promoting 
the development of that so-called minority, does the 
government intend to legislate against Quebec's policies, even 
though these policies are very generous? Since federal 
legislation takes precedence over provincial legislation, 
Quebec's language policy could thus be subverted.
<P>
	Does the government intend to spend large amounts to 
promote English in Quebec? Does it intend to give anglophones 
social and cultural facilities that are out of proportion to this 
linguistic minority's share of the population?
<P>
	Let me reassure you that neither I nor my colleagues in the 
Bloc Quebecois nor the government in power in Quebec have 
any intention of reducing in any way the advantages that our 
English-speaking fellow citizens enjoy. On the contrary, the 
Constitution of a sovereign Quebec would confirm the rights 
and advantages that the English community enjoys now. That is 
public knowledge.
<P>
	However, I am concerned about what the federal government 
actually intends to do in Quebec. The government has no 
obligation to consult the provincial government and would 
probably feel no obligation to do so, as history shows. These 
issues are too important to give the central government 
complete power in this area in Quebec without saying a word.
<P>
	Another issue raised by the bill is equal treatment for French- 
and English-speaking minorities. How can we ensure that 
francophone minorities will benefit fairly from federal 
largesse? How can we ensure that they will be able to catch up 
with Quebec's anglophone minority to some extent? Bill C-53 
remains silent on this fundamental aspect of the treatment of 
minorities in Canada.
<P>
	Quebec knows what to do; it knows what to do for its culture 
and for its minority. The central government should restrict 
itself to its own field of jurisdiction. Perhaps that is what good 
government means!
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish first to inveigh against such a 
lampoonist speech! What it described is very far from the reality 
of the federal contribution, which is extremely generous in 
Quebec, to the promotion of the French Canadian culture across 
the country and around the world.
<P>
	Tell me something: how is it that Telefilm Canada, which 
comes under this department, subsidized Mr. Falardeau's latest 
film, <I>Octobre</I>, with the participation of the NFB as well?
<P>
	I wonder if there is another country in the Western hemisphere 
that would subsidize a film produced, written and directed by a 
separatist, a fellow who is bent on breaking up his country. Do 
you know of any other country that would do the same thing, a 
country with the will to finance such a project? Name one.
<P>
	Tell me something else: did the hon. member know that over 
40 per cent of the National Film Board's budget goes to Quebec 
productions, to productions in French?
<P>
	I would also like to know this: on the subject of the federal 
contribution, we could also mention the Canadian Broadcasting 
Corporation. I learned recently that the CBC produces more 
hours of original programming than France does for its own 
programming, its own culture. In a country with 6 million 
francophones and a total population that is half that of France, 
the Canadian government spends more than France on this. And 
then, some say this is a ploy on the part of the federal 
government. Some people have the nerve to talk about 
interference. When you look at the figures though, they speak 
for themselves: the federal government is the one promoting the 
Quebec culture and I think that many creative artists recognize 
this.
<P>
	Finally, I understand what the Bloc Quebecois is driving at, 
but let us not forget that opinions are divided in Quebec. You 
have producers, directors and people who would readily admit 
it. As a matter of fact, we saw in certain documents last year that 
the involvement of the federal government should be 
maintained because it is generally more responsive to the 
aspirations and legitimate financial needs of our producers in 
Quebec.
<P>
	I am prepared to take questions from the opposition, Mr. 
Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Gagnon (Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, given the questions 
asked by the hon. member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, it seems like he did not 
understand the points I was making.
<P>
	Earlier this afternoon, in my speech, I talked about the federal 
government's involvement in what should be provincial 
jurisdictions. What we want in Quebec is to manage our own 
money and to decide what we want to do with regard to 
promotion in Quebec, outside Quebec and throughout the world.
<P>
	For the federal government to implement institutions is one 
thing, but to decide what to do in the province of Quebec is quite 
another thing.
<P>
	As a matter of fact, I sit on the Standing Committee on 
Canadian Heritage where many questions will be raised. We 
have met with artists' associations which are complaining about 
the decisions made by the government and the federal 
institutions, because these decisions do  not completely allow 
the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6452"> 6452 </A></B>
<P>
government of Quebec to maintain its own institutions and 
jurisdictions.
<P>
	I can see that the hon. member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine did not understand a thing 
I said. We do not want to hear about how many millions were 
invested; we want to decide, by ourselves, how to spend that 
money.
<P>
	I think I have answered the questions put by the hon. member 
for Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon (Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I was just saying that 40 per cent of the National Film 
Board's productions in Montreal are French productions. So, if I 
understand the opposition's logic, if Quebec were to separate 
tomorrow, funding would fall to 22 to 25 per cent. Quebec would 
be the loser in this situation and that is what the opposition does 
not seem to understand.
<P>
<B>(1550 ) </B>
<P>
	Where will the people on the other side get the money to 
organize trips and trade shows? Let us not forget that a lot of 
money comes from federal grants. I was just talking about the 
Monument national, Les Grands Ballets Canadiens, 
Radio-Canada and Telefilm Canada. The Canadian government 
has never questioned the work of our artists from Quebec.
<P>
	As I was saying earlier, the hon. member does not want to 
admit to this 40 per cent, to the fact that Quebec receives more 
than its share of funding for its cultural institutions. She cannot 
give me an example of a film like Mr. Falardeau's <I>Octobre</I>, a 
film about the FLQ that was funded by Telefilm Canada and by 
the National Film Board. I challenge you to give me an example 
from another country. Do you know of any film about the 
Corsicans or the Bretons that was funded by the government of 
France?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Gagnon (Québec):</B> I can see that the hon. member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine still has not understood 
the meaning of my intervention. The federal government 
invested in the movie <I>Octobre</I> because that is where the money 
is. If Quebec had had the money, then Quebec would have been 
asked to fund this type of production.
<P>
	I am sorry, but I have to say that this bill will just aggravate 
the problems related to Quebec's cultural identity.
<P>
	I am also aware that these funds come from the money we give 
the federal government to manage our country, which means 
that Quebec pays for these federal grants. We would like to see 
how we could manage our own programs. Of course, it would 
look bad if the federal government did not give anything to our 
producers and artists from Quebec. Nevertheless, it is an 
historic event. We could have a debate about the October Crisis 
here in this House, show you the movie, show you how some 
Quebecers were treated and how Mr. Trudeau sent in the army. 
This crisis-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. This debate generates a 
lot of passion, which is good, but the Chair would appreciate it if 
hon. members showed more respect to those who express their 
views.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was saying that the purpose of 
this bill is to promote, with our own money, a single vision 
which melts Quebec's culture into a multiculturalism program 
which presents problems for Quebec and which will also present 
problems for English Canada.
<P>
	In fact, there is no consensus regarding this multiculturalism 
program. We should have a debate on the objectives of such a 
program. We want newcomers to adopt Quebec's culture, to 
learn French and to respect our institutions and customs. Indeed, 
it is one thing to know these institutions and customs but quite 
another to respect them.
<P>
	This is what we mean when we say that we want to manage our 
own programs. We want to have control over the programs and 
the money used to promote the distinct character of our society. 
We speak French and we want to promote our own culture.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure and a privilege to speak 
on Bill C-53, An Act to establish the Department of Canadian 
Heritage. I believe the best way to use the time at our disposal is 
to review the programs and responsibilities which fall under the 
jurisdiction of this new department.
<P>
	First, I want to point out that the Department of Canadian 
Heritage has actually been in existence for over a year. Since its 
inception, which goes back to the general government 
reorganization of June 1993, officials of that department have 
discreetly but confidently succeeded in strengthening the links 
between the various and excellent programs which fall under its 
scope. This ``growth stage'' has been exciting and enriching. 
The fact is that it is not over yet.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	There is still a lot of interesting work and progress to 
accomplish before the Department of Canadian Heritage is fully 
recognized and plays its important role among other federal 
departments. Obviously, the tabling of this bill was a major step 
in that direction, as will its second reading.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I have just alluded to the range of programs within Canadian 
Heritage. I want to elaborate upon the department's composition 
and the scope of its activities. Before I begin let me add a caveat. 
Because of time constraints, my review of Canadian Heritage 
program areas cannot be all-inclusive. Nonetheless I am 
confident that the members present will find this description 
illuminating.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6453"> 6453 </A></B>
<P>
	Undoubtedly, one of the most visible programs administered 
by Canadian Heritage is Parks Canada, one of the department's 
three principal sectors. Many Canadians, and for that matter 
many visitors to Canada, have been fortunate enough to 
experience the splendour and richness of the country's system of 
national parks, national historic sites and historic canals.
<P>
	A steward of these unmatched examples of our national and 
cultural heritage, Parks Canada is charged with the protection 
and interpretation on behalf of all Canadians. Given the nature 
of its mandate, Parks Canada is primarily a regional 
organization. It has strong and respected presence in every 
region of this country, including the Gaspé Peninsula, 
contributing significantly to the local economies of 
communities all across Canada directly through expenditures on 
its own operations and indirectly through the tourism and 
economic benefits generated as a result of those activities.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The second major departmental component is centered around 
the Canadian identity and the contribution of all citizens. 
Without question, it represents one of the largest series of 
responsibilities and incentives throughout the government. It 
includes programs promoting the official languages, excellence 
in amateur sports, human rights, the welfare of aboriginal 
communities living in large urban areas, the development of our 
cultural diversity, and finally, the full contribution of all 
citizens, including recent immigrants, to our society. In brief, 
these programs are of interest to each and every one of us, since 
they deal with what it means to ``be Canadian''.
<P>
	We live in an era marked by major social and economic 
change. No one can deny that. In this context, initiatives 
undertaken by this departmental component are considered even 
more important. In fact, by promoting and increasing our sense 
of community and identity, these programs can truly help us to 
understand today's goals and to prepare for tomorrow's 
challenges.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The purview of the third major departmental component can 
broadly be described as encompassing cultural development and 
heritage. The responsibility of this sector extends to the arts, 
broadcasting and heritage conservation programs as well as the 
cultural industries pertaining to film, video, sound recording 
and book publishing.
<P>
	In an age of unparalleled technological advancement where 
adaptability to change has become a prerequisite for success and 
where globalization of markets presents both potential for 
growth and new competitive challenges, Canada's creators, 
artists and producers are looking to government to provide 
leadership in formulating the legislation and policies that will 
allow them to compete and thrive.
<P>
	To cite but two examples it means taking action to ensure that 
creators are justly compensated for the use of their works. It 
means fashioning a policy framework that will ensure a place for 
Canadian content and cultural products on the information 
highway of the future.
<P>
	In general, it means ensuring that Canadians continue to see 
themselves reflected in a strong and vibrant culture.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I have briefly described the department, the activities of 
which are far-reaching and of significant importance to all 
Canadians. Although these programs may seem disparate at 
first, a slightly deeper examination would dispel these doubts. I 
hope I have managed to demonstrate, to some extent, that the 
various components of this new department have much in 
common, that, given their purposes, they complete each other 
and generate a kind of synergy that truly makes it more than the 
sum of its parts.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I look forward to the enactment of the Department of 
Canadian Heritage Act. That step cannot fail to have beneficial 
and enduring effects in enhancing our sense of Canadian identity 
and participation in society, in furthering our cultural 
development and ensuring the continue appreciation and 
protection of our priceless array of natural and cultural heritage 
resources.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like the hon. member to explain a couple of things emanating 
from his speech.
<P>
	He talked about the department being ``successful in 
cementing relationships in this reorganization''. If that was 
exemplified by the previous exchange between the hon. member 
and the member for Quebec Est then I would have to question the 
validity of that comment. He might wish to expand on that point.
<P>
	The member also went on to give a lengthy list of all of the 
departments and all of the responsibilities of Canadian heritage, 
but he glossed over one point: the well-being of native peoples. 
I would like him to explain how and why he believes that 
Canadian heritage is indeed addressing this point. Our 
aboriginal people really do constitute involuntary citizens of 
Canada. They were never asked their opinions on the French or 
British regimes nor on Confederation and what really 
constituted their disenfranchisement.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to please give some thoughtful 
reasoned debate to the question of the well-being of native 
peoples. I would also like an explanation on the first comment 
he made regarding the successful cementing of relationships in 
the reorganization of his department.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to inform the hon. 
member that we also have a department for Indian and northern 
affairs. We have a most capable minister with a budget who tries 
to address the varying issues that touch upon aboriginal 
communities.
<P>
	I can speak for my area where the Ministry of Indian and 
Northern Affairs promotes various school programs for 
youngsters trying to lead very interesting lives as full partners in 
Canadian society. We may have to make a distinction however 
because when it comes to cultural affairs there is probably more 
that can be done in trying to enhance aboriginal culture.
<P>
	In my speech I was speaking in terms of aboriginals in urban 
areas such as Toronto, Montreal and elsewhere. There is much to 
be done in trying to give them the opportunity to express who 
they are and their culture to fellow Canadians.
<P>
	On the second point the hon. member quite correctly pointed 
out there are various views and opinions in terms of the role of 
the federal government in Quebec. As members know the Bloc 
Quebecois may have the majority of seats on the opposition side 
but it does not have the majority of votes in the province of 
Quebec. We are talking of only between 44 and 48 per cent.
<P>
	We should also take these things into account. We do not 
speak for all Quebecers. I have tried to inform the hon. member 
that the federal government has been a most productive and 
viable force in my home province of Quebec in terms of 
encouraging cultural development.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> And everywhere else.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> And everywhere else. It is important to note 
that the federal government has invested heavily in French 
culture to a point that our investments in CBC productions are 
far superior to what the French government invests in its own 
TV broadcasts. That is astonishing.
<P>
	Forty per cent of the productions by the National Film Board 
are French Canadian. Regrettably, the hon. Bloc member is 
saying that Quebec wants it all for itself. However it would have 
to settle for 25 per cent if it opted for independence and right 
now it is getting 40 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	What I am trying to tell the two hon. ladies is that the federal 
government is doing its part in promoting arts and culture in 
Quebec and across Canada and it is doing a fantastic job.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> I rise on a point of order, 
Mr. Speaker. This is a small point but it has occurred time and 
time again that we are not referred to in this House all of the time 
as hon. members and that is what we are. We are not hon. ladies, 
girls or anything else. We are hon. members.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> While it is not a point of 
order, I think it is a point that has been made and should be taken 
as such and rightfully so. In the most respectful parliamentary 
fashion we refer to one another as hon. members.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think my colleague likes very much to listen to 
himself talk. He talks and talks and talks. I also like to talk, but 
at least I do not deny it. What is important here is that as much as 
I recognize the member's expertise in some of these areas, I 
have to say that he is talking through his hat with regard to 
Canadian heritage. The CBC costs us a fortune. It costs us 65 per 
cent of the $1.5 billion spent, and it is watched by only 13 per 
cent of English Canadians. This is not a good price-quality 
ratio. There is too much money paid to too many people for 
nothing. It is simply too expensive.
<P>
	I would like to know what information the hon. member has 
on that. I am a bit tired, and so are Canadians, of hearing that we 
are the greatest country in the world. That is all very nice, but 20 
per cent of our children live in poverty, the unemployment rate 
is at 25 per cent and we have a debt that grows larger by the 
second. When will the government stop saying that we are such a 
great country and start doing something to really make Canada a 
great place to live? Do you not think that our country is going 
bankrupt?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon (Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if I had been asked to comment on the country's 
economic situation, I would say that the hon. member for 
Rimouski-Témiscouata is right. Much remains to be done. I 
think that together, united and strong, we stand the best chance 
of putting this country on the road to economic recovery.
<P>
	However, and I am nevertheless mindful of what was said by 
the hon. member and by my department, and I am referring to 
the department I represent here today. The Canadian 
Broadcasting Corporation has done a lot for culture in Quebec 
and for the culture of the francophone minorities outside 
Quebec. Thanks to the CBC, people know what this country is 
about. I do not know the exact ratings, but I do not think anyone 
can deny that Canadian productions are worthwhile. I think we 
have made some very good films with producers from Quebec 
and from English Canada. We have promoted the expression of 
Quebec culture, and I think this is largely thanks to the federal 
government, which gave Quebecers a chance to express 
themselves and say who they are, to Canada and to the whole 
world.
<P>
	I think the Government of Canada is to be commended for 
having invested so much in Quebec, and what probably bothers 
the opposition is the fact that more and more performing artists 
and producers are aware of the positive role played by this 
department, and especially by the Government of Canada, in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6455"> 6455 </A></B>
<P>
promoting  French Canadian and Quebec culture throughout the 
world.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to participate in the debate 
on Bill C-53.
<P>
	The debate we just listened to reminds me very much of the 
failure of federal spending. It is no different on job creation 
from what it is on cultural matters. If federal spending created 
jobs, every Canadian would have two. If federal spending 
helped on some of these cultural matters, people would not be 
voting by turning off their television sets when it comes to a lot 
of the programming on CBC.
<P>
<B>(1610 ) </B>
<P>
	Bill C-53 is one multifaceted attempt to right every perceived 
wrong in the government's quest for political correctness. It is a 
continuation of hyphenated Canadians and funding of special 
interest groups which in the final analysis has hardly promoted 
unity and has only been a drain on the public purse.
<P>
	Nowhere in Bill C-53 can I detect any change in this litany of 
throwing money at something we are desperately trying to 
understand. It seems that government thinks it can buy peace 
and unity by entrenching more rights and latitude for special 
interest groups. When are we going to become Canadians rather 
than a mishmash of individuals with a particular axe to grind?
<P>
	While I am on that topic of special interest groups, it might 
not be as bad if more members of the special interest groups 
were beneficiaries. Too often a few greedy, self-serving 
individuals who head up the leadership of these groups are the 
main recipients.
<P>
	I am told that one individual who is paid a $60,000 a year 
salary to head one of these groups, a person in their thirties is 
nearly a millionaire. Is this where the funding for some of these 
groups is going: membership at the Rideau Club, first class air 
travel, cottages in the Gatineau?
<P>
	Bill C-53 will not correct this injustice but will only entrench 
it further. One has to simply take a cursory look at the 1994-95 
estimates for Canadian heritage. Every conceivable special 
interest group is on the payroll. What is the effectiveness of 
these programs? Is there demonstrable success to parallel their 
mandates? Are they accountable or merely sinkholes of 
largesse? My Reform colleagues will chronicle the 
misplacement of funding in this debate.
<P>
	I would now like to turn to an element of responsibility of the 
Department of Canadian Heritage as contained in Bill C-53, 
specifically Canada's Metis. The department mandate states 
that the programs for Metis are designed to help the Metis define 
and participate in the resolution of the social, cultural, political 
and economic issues affecting their lives in Canadian society.  A 
common feature of the program is that projects are community 
based and are initiated and managed by aboriginal people.
<P>
	I can count some $40 million directed at those programs. Is it 
being used on what is intended? Is it accountable? One does not 
have to do much research before one's antennae beam on 
specific examples where accountability is questionable. I refer 
to the Metis nation of Saskatchewan.
<P>
	Last March and April headlines in regional Saskatchewan and 
national newspapers screamed out headlines of mismanagement 
of funds, accounting anomalies and refusal by Metis leaders to 
co-operate with audits. At one point over $1 million was 
unaccountable. No one questioned the legality of the Metis in 
this circumstance; they did question accountability and proper 
management of funds.
<P>
	It seems in government quests to keep everyone happy, we 
make the cheques and never ask another question. When 
someone stumbles over some anomaly regarding procedures, we 
get the whitewash. The bureaucrats and some antsy national 
Metis council officials get on the damage control mode. This is 
not good enough. Bill C-53 does not improve on it. What the 
cloud of uncertainty over the Metis Society of Saskatchewan did 
was create a splinter group of concerned Metis citizens. It seems 
they too felt that those Metis leaders handling the funds at the 
local level did not have the capacity to do it and it reflected 
badly on the members. Bill C-53 does not address this; it 
entrenches further mismanagement.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	In preparation for this debate, my office called a few 
departmental people, research officers appointed to and in these 
debates, and naturally talked to others interested in this subject 
matter. Is it not interesting that I still do not have a bottom line 
on funding through Heritage Canada to the Metis. I really do not 
think Bill C-53 will contribute to enlightening the House any 
further on this issue.
<P>
	Other newspaper headlines suggest that Metis leaders are 
ignorant of public trust, that funding provided through Heritage 
Canada for programs and activities of Metis groups, often for 
worthy undertakings, may not be trickling down from the Metis 
leaders in charge of disbursing funds. It is simply not good 
enough to concentrate control of funds with the leadership. It 
would be better to have these funds administered by a council or 
committee made up of all strata within the Metis society.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6456"> 6456 </A></B>
<P>
	The very thing I speak of is what prompted the RCMP 
investigation of the handling of funds by the Metis Nation of 
Saskatchewan. I ask how window dressing the plethora of 
multiculturalism undertakings into the department of heritage 
will solve this disbursal and accountability of funding for Metis 
societies.
<P>
	Bill C-53 merely complies with political correctness and 
assures a supply of government funds to be doled out by 
sometimes incompetent individuals.
<P>
	I would be remiss if I did not touch on one other aspect of 
funding that should trouble us greatly. What Bill C-53 manages 
to accomplish is to again ensure continued funding for the 
industry that has been created around the Metis societies. Make 
no mistake about it, this is an industry unto itself, secret, 
paranoid and accountable to no one.
<P>
	There was an instance this last spring in the midst of 
investigation into the Metis nation of Saskatchewan that 
funding cheques were still being issued to the same individuals 
under investigation, so-called representing a specific Metis 
society. What kind of power and control do these individuals in 
this industry have on this government? Instead of codifying 
more programs, which in the Saskatchewan Metis experience 
have caused disunity, not harmony, we should be drafting 
accountability guidelines for these bureaucrats handing out the 
largesse and establishing disbursal guidelines for these Metis 
bodies.
<P>
	I am not breaking any new trails here. I have asked a series of 
questions of the minister of heritage, the Prime Minister and the 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development regarding 
the Metis and aboriginal funding. I have attempted to enlighten 
this administration about who is really getting rich. With the 
current method, rank and file Metis are not the recipients. Bill 
C-53 will ensure it is business as usual.
<P>
	Mr. Jim Sinclair, president of the Native Council of Canada, 
in testimony before the Standing Committee on Aboriginal 
Affairs stated in April of this year that he would welcome his 
books being audited by the Auditor General, not the Secretary of 
State now Heritage Canada. There has to be an arm's length 
relationship when it comes to the auditing function. Again Bill 
C-53 ensures that Heritage Canada will continue to audit itself. 
I call it vertically integrated bureaucratic control. It should be 
eliminated by the government.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	The federal interlocutor for Canada's Metis, the Minister of 
Natural Resources, is another participant in the process. She 
indicated that the federal government is prepared to assume 50 
per cent of the cost of establishing and maintaining a registry of 
the people of the Metis nation.
<P>
	We had a census in 1991. Why would the federal government 
want to encourage further racial divisiveness by committing to a 
racially based census? Surely such an undertaking is another 
instance of the potential for more  misunderstanding of the 
government's uncontrollable urge to create special rights for 
various groups within our society. Does anyone know how to say 
no?
<P>
	At the same time that the federal interlocutor is committing to 
this census, the Metis leadership is proposing a national 
legislative assembly, a capital in Batoche, a flag, an anthem, an 
emblem, Metis and Canadian citizenship and Metis law making 
authority. Does the minister want to encourage all this by 
providing funding for an as yet undefined census based on racial 
characteristics where the proponent has a vested interest in 
inflating the membership qualifications as much as possible? 
What is the federal interlocutor of the Metis doing by 
committing funding to create another group on which to confer 
special rights?
<P>
	Either the Minister of Canadian Heritage through Bill C-53 is 
the minister responsible for Metis or he is not. Clearly 
responsibility for Metis is outside the purview of the minister of 
Indian affairs. It should also be outside the purview of the 
Minister of Natural Resources. Why do we need two ministers 
responsible for the same issue?
<P>
	We have a litany of funding and accounting problems in not 
only the Metis society in Saskatchewan, but there are problems 
in other jurisdictions as well. This is what Bill C-53 should be 
addressing.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alfonso Gagliano (Secretary of State (Parliamentary 
Affairs) and Deputy Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with pleasure that I address this 
House on Bill C-53, which confirms the structure of the 
Department of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	The Canadian government has used this bill to bring together 
under one roof several elements of our Canadian identity. Of 
course, when we speak of heritage, there are those who think of 
the past, of historic sites and buildings, of monuments and 
museums.
<P>
	But there is much more than that. Our heritage is also the 
present and especially the future. That is why the new 
department includes: the development and promotion of our 
unique culture; communications and the development of the 
information highway; the cultural industries, which are taking 
their place, with much success, on the world scene; official 
languages, multiculturalism and heritage languages, essential 
elements of our national affirmation; amateur sports, which give 
expression to our search for excellence.
<P>
	All these elements play a role in making us what we are, proud 
Canadians who are respected and envied the world over.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6457"> 6457 </A></B>
<P>
	I came to Canada at the age of 16. I chose this country for its 
promise of a future, social stability and a tradition of welcoming 
new citizens. And I must say that I was not disappointed.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	Yes, Canada's doors are open. Yes, Canada is full of 
opportunities. Yes, Canada is a land of justice and sharing. Yes, 
it is the best country in the world!
<P>
	And even if the Canadian Heritage critic for the Official 
Opposition does not agree, I would like to tell him that there are 
millions and millions of human beings in the world who would 
give everything they have to be admitted into Canada and to live 
here with us. Despite our difficulties, our differences, our 
economic and financial problems, this country is still the best in 
the world. And in Quebec, it is a minority that wants to separate 
Quebec from the rest of Canada and destroy this country.
<P>
	Let us not be misled, this country is still the best in the world. 
This fact has been recognized twice by the United Nations and 
most importantly it is acknowledged by all of us who, day after 
day, live in peace and prosperity on this vast North American 
territory.
<P>
	I am a Canadian proud and aware of the considerable benefits 
that this country provides. I am also a full-fledged Quebecer 
who realizes how beneficial it is for us to be part of the Canadian 
entity.
<P>
	There are few places in the world where two great cultures can 
blossom out in such harmony and with such autonomy as in 
Canada. And this is where the role of the Department of Heritage 
becomes so important. Our government recognizes that culture 
is not an abstraction detached from reality but a vital link that 
binds us all together.
<P>
	As a matter of fact, in our red book, we say that ``culture is the 
very essence of national identity, the bedrock of national 
sovereignty and national pride''.
<P>
	Several of our major cultural institutions, namely the CBC, 
the Canada Council, the National Film Board and Telefilm 
Canada contribute year after year to bring to the fore artistic 
talents from Quebec.
<P>
	Heritage Canada supports, finances, develops markets for 
francophone cultural products that are essential to our artists in 
Quebec. The Canadian Museum of Civilizations in Hull, as well 
as the Quebec Citadel, trace the history of the first inhabitants 
and the first settlers that came here. Our parks and historic sites 
give the millions of tourists who visit our country an idea of the 
richness of our natural heritage.
<P>
	The works of Michel Tremblay, Alice Parizeau, Antonine 
Maillet and many others have reached far beyond the boundaries 
of Quebec and of Canada. Those works are translated in several 
languages and have become the delight of readers all around the 
world.
<P>
	The Cirque du soleil, a unique cultural product, conceived and 
realized by Quebecers, fills with wonder the young and not so 
young on several continents.
<P>
	Quebec films, songs and plays have extensions on all 
continents. In television, the TV5 channel opens a window on 
the French-speaking world. This international cooperation 
allows also the francophonie to learn what goes on in our 
country. Programs produced in this country are broadcasted in 
Rome, Warsaw or Cairo.
<P>
	The Canadian government plays a leading role in the 
expression and promotion of French culture in Canada and in the 
world.
<P>
	We support creation. We support production. We encourage 
young artists. We negotiate agreements regarding export of our 
cultural products.
<P>
	In the day-to-day life of French-speaking creators, the 
federal contribution is irreplaceable. Without the contribution 
of the Canadian government, many of our famous writers, our 
established actors and actresses, our renowned movie producers 
would have never taken off. We know it and this is why, despite 
our limited resources, we give particular attention to cultural 
development. This is part of our mandate, part of our 
responsibilities.
<P>
	We should not underestimate the economic value of our 
cultural sector. Today, cultural enterprises rank ninth among our 
national industries. They generate direct revenues amounting to 
$22 billion a year.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	About 600,000 Canadians work in this field. This clearly 
demonstrates that our cultural industries are closely linked to 
the economic development of our country and actively 
contribute to our prosperity. In addition to preserving and 
promoting native, French and English cultures, Canada 
officially recognizes its multiculturalism.
<P>
	Moreover, the building of this country has largely been 
influenced by several waves of immigrants who made their 
homes here. Thousands of immigrants have developed Canada's 
natural resources. They have settled vast territories. They have 
helped build our cities.
<P>
	Most regions of Canada have developed their own 
characteristics inherited from different cultural groups. This 
diversity is the hallmark of the Canadian identity and culture. 
Canadian multiculturalism is two-pronged. It encourages all 
Canadians to take an active part in society, in either official 
language. It also urges society to get rid of all obstacles 
impeding full and equal participation.
<P>
	Cultural harmony is being promoted through initiatives such 
as teaching heritage languages, assisting ethnic artists and 
encouraging cross-cultural activities. While recognizing that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6458"> 6458 </A></B>
<P>
our roots are an important part of our identity, Canadian 
multiculturalism urges us to make a commitment to Canada. It 
respects everyone's cultural identity. It encourages creativity 
and cultural exchanges. It helps us to realize not only what our 
rights  are as a member of society, but also what are our 
responsibilities.
<P>
	In Canada, we do not ask newcomers to leave their culture at 
the door to be welcome. As the Prime Minister would say, you 
can be proud of being a Canadian as well as a Quebecer. That is 
what makes us Canadians so unique.
<P>
	The role of the Heritage Department is precisely to support 
the development of our national identity. Having grouped all the 
means of expression of this identity under one department, the 
government is being consistent. In so doing it is ensuring sound 
management of our investments and greater efficiency. It proves 
that federalism can be adapted to our society's changing needs. 
It proves that several cultures, living in harmony and sharing, 
can flourish on the same territory. It proves that, together, we 
can create and share a reality which is unique in the world, and 
that is the Canadian identity.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This is a time when we have to pull together. Yes, we have 
some financial difficulties. Yes, we have some serious problems 
that we have to solve. However, we should look at the number of 
people outside Canada who are waiting in line in different parts 
of the world in different Canadian embassies. Think of the 
millions of human beings who would give everything they have 
to be here in Canada, to be a Canadian resident, to be a Canadian 
citizen. Yes, we have problems. Yes, we have a lot of 
differences. I think that as in the past we can work together, pool 
our resources and continue to ensure that this is a country of 
generosity, a country of understanding.
<P>
<B>(1635 ) </B>
<P>
	It is only by working together in this globalization that we are 
going through that we can survive and maintain this unique 
Canadian way of doing things. We have the Canadian way of 
welcoming new Canadians in this country and a Canadian way 
of making sure that our seniors are protected. We have a way of 
protecting our health system. This is unique if I may be allowed 
to say that.
<P>
	That in a way represents Canadians' generosity. Look at me. I 
came to Canada when I was 16 years old. Today I am a member 
of Parliament, the highest tribunal in the land. I speak the two 
official languages. I am of Italian origin. I raised a family. We 
worked together and we are proud of our achievements.
<P>
	I was able to achieve because our country and our system 
allows me to achieve. Therefore I will work hard in future 
months to make sure that the federal system that we have 
ensures equality and protection for everyone. We have 
prosperity and hope that our children will have it.
<P>
	I am sure there is a solution to all the differences and all the 
problems that we have. The only way we can solve this is 
working together. We look forward to solving these problems. A 
lot of countries look at us and at the way we have been solving 
and will continue to solve our differences. This is the future of 
the world. This is where the rest of the world is going.
<P>
	It would be a shame to depart from this tradition, the way we 
have been doing things for 125 years.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I congratulate my colleague from Saint-Léonard. It is 
the first time I have had the honour to listen to him in this House 
and I did so attentively. Other duties prevented me from hearing 
him before. I do not want that to be taken in a negative way.
<P>
	I listened to his speech attentively. What struck me the most is 
that to define himself as a Canadian, the hon. member for 
Saint-Léonard only spoke about Quebec francophones, which is 
rather surprising. So I went to see my colleague from Calgary 
Southeast to ask her the name of an English philosopher, which 
she could not remember either. There is an English 
Canadian-whose name you probably know-now living in 
Vancouver who has asked out loud what many people quietly 
think: Is there a Canadian identity? The answer is no. There is no 
Canadian identity. What is a Canadian? Who is a Canadian? Is it 
someone who lives in Canada? I myself live in Canada because I 
do not have a choice but I am a Quebecer and not a Canadian. 
The Premier of Quebec made a mistake; he did not know any 
more if he could be a Canadian or a Quebecer, a Quebecer or a 
Canadian.
<P>
	A Canadian is defined as someone who lives in Canada, in a 
country with two languages, multiculturalism and everything. 
Come on! That is not what defines a Canadian. So he spoke only 
of Quebec's French-speaking writers. We never denied 
Radio-Canada's part in Quebec's francophone culture. We 
never denied this or any other roles. But what is the heritage 
department doing now? It is cutting off all funding to the 
National Film Board. They are strangling the NFB. Telefilm 
Canada was ordered to cut from 5 per cent to 8 per cent. They 
will no longer be able to produce films.
<P>
	It is the same everywhere. Let us stop deluding ourselves. It 
may be the most beautiful country in the world, but I have seen 
the Rockies and they are nothing compared to Charlevoix.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for her 
initial remarks. She is trying to define what it is to be a 
Canadian. I have always defined myself as a Canadian, a 
Quebecer of Italian descent. That is the beauty of it. I tried to 
explain it earlier. I started to in English, and I will now continue 
in French.

<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	That is the difference. I think that I am a product of what we 
could call a Canadian. I came to Canada when I was 16 years old. 
I have no problem with this country that may mean nothing to 
you because you do not care much about the Rockies, but 
Charlevoix is quite beautiful. As far as I am concerned, the 
Rockies are beautiful and so is Charlevoix. I have no problem 
because I feel like a Canadian, like a Canadian and a Quebecer, 
and it is this country, this country's federal system that the 
Official Opposition, the Bloc Quebecois, criticizes day in and 
day out and are trying to destroy.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> You are talking about a single culture.	
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano: </B>I am not talking about a single culture, but 
rather two official languages, the French culture-as I indicated 
in previous speeches-the English culture, and a multicultural 
culture. That is the Canadian reality, its cultural identity, with 
both the French and English cultures and the multiculturalism 
that make Canada a tolerant country, as I said in my speech, if 
only the hon. member had listened.
<P>
	When you come to Canada, you must not leave your culture at 
the door; you must bring it along, protect and nurture it, and 
together with other cultures continue to build this great country. 
Globalization is a world-wide phenomenon. We must not fence 
ourselves in as the Bloc Quebecois and the Parti Quebecois are 
trying to do in Quebec.
<P>
	We have faith in this huge country stretching from the 
Atlantic to the Pacific.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
point of order. The member cannot say that the Bloc Quebecois 
wants to keep Quebec inside a small culture. I ask him to 
withdraw his remarks right away.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I am listening carefully to 
the speeches on both sides of the House, and with all due respect 
to all hon. members, I do not believe that this is a point of order. 
I again give the floor to the Hon. Secretary of State.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not know if the hon. member 
understood me or if I expressed myself poorly; I was talking 
about fencing oneself in and said ``clôture''; I did not wish to 
imply that it is a small culture, and did not say ``culture''. 
Perhaps my colleague was not wearing an earphone; I said 
fencing, because I have great respect for the French culture. In 
the ten years that I have been here, I have always defended the 
French language and culture and Quebecers' rights and the 
interests of the Canadian Confederation. She needs only refer to 
the <I>Hansards</I> which report everything that is said in the House 
and even what is said outside the House. So she thinks I said 
small culture, but I was talking about fencing. Either I 
mispronounced the word or she misunderstood.
<P>
	Personally, I respect the hon. member's option. I believe in 
this Canada. I feel comfortable defining myself as a Canadian. I 
am Canadian. I feel confident. I believe that in spite of all our 
differences, Canada will continue to exist and will continue to 
develop. Canada will become a model in the world because it is 
the only way, with a strong Quebec inside Canada. That is the 
difference! A strong Quebec inside Canada; that is the 
difference and that is how Canada will be a model for the rest of 
the world. When we see what is happening in the rest of the 
world, people will look to Canada, and the Canadian federal 
system will still be the best. In the future, you will see that 
Canada's federal system will continue to progress and succeed 
despite our differences; the whole world envies us and will 
continue to envy us.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too 
appreciated the comments of the hon. member.
<P>
	I am going to phrase the context of my remarks within the 
history of my family. My grandfather came from Croatia as a 
very young man. He was thinly clothed, he had very little money 
and he certainly did not have any government waiting to give 
him a handout when he came here. He came alone, without his 
young wife and without his baby daughter, my mother. They 
stayed behind in Croatia. He worked his heart out for three years 
and he paid their way over here. In all of the years I knew my 
grandfather until he died at 68 years old he worked and paid his 
own way. Our family learned that tradition of paying your own 
way. You do not go to government for handouts. If you have a 
problem you go to your family, you go to your friends and you go 
to your community support and that does not mean a federal 
handout.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	I am also quite concerned that this debate is grinding down 
into a Quebecer and English Canadian issue. This is not the issue 
today. The issue is the legislation of Bill C-53 which 
means-and let me say it again-we are looking at entrenching 
multiculturalism funding and we cannot afford it. We are 
looking at national enforced bilingualism and we cannot afford 
it. We also cannot afford the funding of special interest groups.
<P>
	When the hon. member speaks about the economic impact of 
some of our cultural industries bringing $22 billion into our 
coffers that is a drop in the bucket against a $532 billion deficit 
whereby this government will only bring in revenue of $110 
million per day. It spends more every day than it brings in. It 
does not take very long to eat up $22 billion. I would like the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6460"> 6460 </A></B>
<P>
hon. member to perhaps refer to a cross benefit analysis that he 
has done to substantiate his remarks.
<P>
	Finally, the hon. member has not addressed the real issue 
here. In this legislation there is no downsizing, no streamlining 
and no financial savings. That quite frankly is what Canadian 
taxpayers are looking for from this government. Those are the 
things they are looking for because those are the promises of that 
infamous Liberal red book.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question. I 
would like to tell my hon. colleague that when I came to Canada 
I did not receive anything. Everything I did I paid for. I went to 
night school and I paid for the lessons. I shovelled snow in the 
winter and delivered groceries. I did these things and I am proud 
of it. However, that does not mean that because some years ago 
we were in a certain situation people in need should be 
forgotten.
<P>
	I agree with the hon. member that there is abuse in the system 
and we are trying to correct it. I believe the hon. member does 
not draw a line of what the legislation is and what she would like 
the legislation to do.
<P>
	This is a bill to organize a department. This bill is to legalize, 
to put in perspective of the law the departmental reorganization 
that the Prime Minister announced in November 1993 when we 
took office. She mentioned the red book. We had a promise that 
would cut expenses right away from the top, from the Prime 
Minister's office down to all the ministers of $10 million a year. 
I think so far we have accounted for $13 million. This part of the 
reorganization.
<P>
	In terms of funding that the member is talking about, the 
member should take note, probably next week when the Minister 
of Finance goes before the finance committee and presents his 
budgetary vision on the next budget and consults with 
Canadians, of the estimates. That is where funding is provided 
for every program and for every department.
<P>
	What we are talking about here is the legal frame of a 
department. We see here 40 departments that we had in 1984 
reduced down to 22. These are the savings and the promise that 
we kept in the red book.
<P>
	I invite the hon. member to wait until Wednesday when the 
minister of human resources will table his discussion paper on 
social programs. I am sure she has a lot of things to say there and 
I am sure she will contribute to the debate, not only in this House 
but also across the country. I am sure she is waiting patiently for 
the Minister of Finance to come to this House and go to the 
finance committee to give reference of his consultation for the 
next budget. There hopefully altogether we will continue to 
reduce expenses and look at ways we can serve our citizens more 
with less.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before continuing debate 
on Bill C-53 it is my duty pursuant to Standing Order 38 to 
inform the House that the questions to be raised tonight at the 
time of adjournment are as follows: The hon. member for 
Mercier-unemployment; the hon.  member for The 
Battlefords-Meadow Lake-low level flights.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
express my views on Bill C-53, An Act to establish the 
Department of Canadian Heritage and to amend and repeal 
certain other acts. The Department of Communications, the 
Department of the Secretary of State and the Department of 
Multiculturalism and Citizenship were abolished following the 
government reorganization announced on June 25 and 
November 4, 1993. This exercise resulted in the creation of a 
new portfolio, the Department of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	For the first time, all federal agencies in the cultural sector, 
including the Canada Council, CBC, the National Film Board, 
Telefilm Canada, the national museums and parks of Canada, 
the National Archives and many others, are part of a single 
superdepartment.
<P>
	I want to quote an important provision regarding a field which 
comes under the minister's jurisdiction. Clause 4(g), on page 2, 
states that the Minister of Canadian Heritage must promote ``the 
advancement of the equality of status and use of English and 
French and the enhancement and development of the English 
and French linguistic minority communities in Canada''.
<P>
	That clause provides a good description of the federal 
government's objective to promote a Canadian cultural identity 
primarily based on the main features of a bilingual and 
multicultural Canada. However, no reference is made to Quebec 
as a society, nor to its cultural and linguistic specificity.
<P>
	Once again, Ottawa denies the distinct cultural reality of 
Quebec by attempting to dilute its French status and culture in a 
supposedly bilingual and multicultural Canadian cultural 
identity. The creation of that department is in compliance with 
the defunct Charlottetown Accord, which proposed an artificial 
and false recognition of the provinces' exclusive jurisdiction 
over culture.
<P>
	Never in the past, much less now, did the federal government 
consider withdrawing from the cultural sector despite Quebec's 
demands for the transfer of cultural jurisdiction and related 
budgets from Ottawa. The establishment of this new department 
is proof positive of this: the federal government is turning a deaf 
ear to Quebec's demands concerning language, education and, 
most of all, culture.
<P>
	The federal government will continue to use its spending 
power to play a role in Quebec without any regard to the 
priorities and demands of the Quebec government in matters of 
language, education, and culture. How many more times will we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6461"> 6461 </A></B>
<P>
have to fight for Quebec's interests and demands? Why is the 
federal government ignoring Quebec's jurisdiction over culture 
and language?
<P>
	My colleagues on this side of the House received a clear 
mandate to stand for the interests of Quebecers. Quebec's 
demands concerning cultural and linguistic jurisdiction are part 
of that mandate, and I will fight for them with conviction and 
determination.
<P>
	I would like to quote what the late member for 
Brome-Missisquoi, Gaston Péloquin, was forever repeating to 
us and trying to convey to his constituents. It is a true depiction 
of the Canadian situation.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	``The fundamental difference between the two solitudes is 
that Canada is a country looking for a people, and Quebec is a 
people looking for a country''. The fact that my federalist 
friends refuse to talk about sovereignty does not mean it will not 
happen. Quebecers will be deciding for themselves, and the 
other nine provinces will have to accept that decision out of 
respect for justice and democracy.
<P>
	The federal government keeps encroaching on exclusive 
Quebec jurisdictions. It can offer no guarantee about language, 
education and culture.
<P>
	The Canadian Heritage Department is a typical example of 
this kind of interference in an area of jurisdiction claimed by 
Quebec. Essentially, the policies and priorities of the 
department, which were designed without consulting Quebec, 
are more in line with the prospect of an hypothetical 
country-wide cultural identity which seeks the outright 
assimilation, sooner or later, of the French language and the 
Quebec culture. I believe that is the real objective of the federal 
government.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The notion of cultural identity is what brings people together 
in a society. This notion helps to build and establish on a 
permanent basis the institutions that constitute a given society. 
What this government must understand is that the notion of 
cultural identity cannot be commanded or imposed in a 
democratic system or regime.
<P>
	Thus the federal government cannot make an abstraction of 
the French culture and language that give distinct identity to 
Quebec society. The fact is that Canada is constituted by two 
nation states. Canada is not composed of a unique culture as the 
federal government would like us to believe.
<P>
	These are the facts and the Minister of Canadian Heritage will 
have to deal with them.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	History clearly demonstrates this. The federal government 
has always been trying to ignore the cultural identity of 
francophones, and its bilingualism policy is the proof. 
Bilingualism in Canada is a myth, a beautiful dream, a policy 
that has never really worked. We must say it: the bilingualism 
policy has proven to be a real failure.
<P>
	The fact is that francophones cannot live and get an education 
in French everywhere in Canada. We have the example of 
Franco-Ontarians. Their history is marked by struggles, by 
legal battles and, indeed, a resistance to assimilation. And we 
have the most recent example of Longlac, in northern Ontario, 
where the francophone community is unable to get services.
<P>
	A second example are the francophone and Acadian 
communities in the rest of Canada. In a submission to the 
Standing Joint Committee on Official Languages in the House of 
Commons in May, the Fédération des communautés 
francophones et acadiennes sounded the alarm, sending out a cry 
of distress and demanding that the federal government emerge 
from its indifference.
<P>
	I quote the federation: ``The emergency situation in which 
members of our communities are living is unacceptable. The 
assimilation rate, which is increasing from one census to 
another, and the social and economic situation, which is 
deteriorating, do not seem to worry the government overly-''
<P>
	On a five-year period, the assimilation rate has increased by 
4.5 per cent in the overall francophone regions outside Quebec. 
That is a fact. If we do not act immediately, assimilation will 
continue on its irreversible course, whatever people think and 
say here.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	A third example: the closure of the Collège militaire royal de 
Saint-Jean. This decision is, I believe, the worst the federal 
government has taken in a decade.
<P>
	How can the federal government justify the closure of the 
only French-speaking military college in the country and 
continue to promote its bilingualism policy? How will the 
federal government be able to ensure progress towards equality 
of status and use of the French language in the armed forces 
without a single French-speaking institution in this country?
<P>
	According to reports the Kingston military college is not at all 
ready to accommodate French-speaking servicemen and to offer 
them the necessary training.
<P>
	Those are the facts. This is the reality. The federal 
government denies francophones an equal status.
<P>
	To continue on the same subject, I would like to give the 
House some statistics. Out of 13,000 so-called bilingual 
positions in the armed forces, only 6,000 are held by individuals 
sufficiently fluent in French and in English. The other 7,000 
so-called bilingual positions are held by individuals who speak 
only English.
<P>
	This again shows that the bilingualism policy has failed in 
Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6462"> 6462 </A></B>
<P>
	Here is another figure. The great majority, 85 per cent, of the 
63,870 designated bilingual positions across the country are 
along the Ottawa-Montreal-Quebec axis.
<P>
	As a consequence, the budget cuts that would lead to the 
elimination of the annual bilingualism bonus advocated by the 
Commissioner of Official Languages would affect mainly 
francophones working in the federal public service. It would 
mean approximately $43 million in lost wages for francophone 
bilingual employees working in the federal public office.
<P>
	Such is the initiative to promote a cultural identity based on 
bilingualism as a main characteristic of Canada from coast to 
coast.
<P>
	Ottawa's lack of global vision considerably hinders the 
development and prosperity of francophone communities 
throughout the country.
<P>
	When answering a question from the opposition about this 
claim, the Minister of Canadian Heritage admitted that 
presently, his government had no global policy for the 
promotion of the development and prosperity of the French fact.
<P>
	The attacks the current Liberal government carries out in 
reaction to the Bloc Quebecois's demands simply seek to blind 
us to the failures of its policies to promote French in the 
English-speaking provinces.
<P>
	Those who suggest the status quo should know that, for a lot 
of francophones outside Quebec, in the long term, that means 
assimilation.
<P>
	How can we deny that the fundamental difference between 
Quebec and Canada is precisely rooted in the fact that English 
Canada is unable to recognize the existence of French-speaking 
Quebecers as a nation?
<P>
	Quebec's aspirations to develop as both a distinct nation and a 
full member of the Canadian federation were always repressed. 
Today, Quebec has chosen to develop within its own political 
infrastructures, as would a truly sovereign country.
<P>
	Quebec's sovereignty is not a goal per se, it is rather the 
means to achieve the coherent development of our potential. It is 
the most appropriate means we have to make efficient use of our 
resources.
<P>
	As long as it is in Ottawa the Bloc Quebecois will keep on 
denouncing the federal institutions' indifference regarding 
Quebec and French language, education and culture.
<P>
	I was sent here to shake up the political inertia of the federal 
government and to bring to the attention of the House of 
Commons the concerns of francophone communities wherever 
they may be in Canada.
<P>
	The federal government must correct all its deficiencies in 
order to better answer the aspirations of francophone 
communities.
<P>
	Quebecers have used most of their political energy over the 
last three decades to build a political structure that will allow 
them to develop as a people. It must be understood that if 
something binds Quebecers together it is their refusal of the 
status quo.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	Quebec's political and economic context has changed 
radically over the last fifteen years. Those changes explain the 
strong comeback of the sovereignist movement in Quebec after 
the referendum defeat in 1980, the Meech Lake Accord and the 
Charlottetown Accord.
<P>
	Since the days of Jean Lesage, all the federalist premiers have 
struggled hard to provide the Quebec State with the 
decision-making powers which it needed to exercise a real 
control over our collective destiny.
<P>
	The vast majority of Quebec federalists refuse the system in 
its present form. What made them different from sovereignists 
for a long time is that they hoped that the system could be 
modified, especially by transferring powers from Ottawa to 
Quebec and recognizing the distinct nature of the Quebec 
people.
<P>
	For their part, sovereignists had come to the conclusion that 
Quebecers could never fully develop as a nation within the 
federal framework the structures of which were frozen in time.
<P>
	After 30 years of fruitless efforts and countless attempts to 
change the federal system, even federalists in Quebec have to 
face reality: the failure of the Meech Lake and Charlottetown 
accords have put an end to any hope for a renewed federalism.
<P>
	Today, Quebecers, both federalists and sovereignists alike, 
can be sure of one thing regarding the status quo: they can either 
take it or leave it. Everyone will have to make this choice. 
Nevertheless, when it comes to the mandate of the Department 
of Canadian Heritage, we cannot have just one cultural policy 
since we have two distinct cultures.
<P>
	As such, the policy of the Department of Canadian Heritage 
cannot be developed and applied uniformly across the country. 
Consequently, the Bloc Quebecois will make sure that the 
various measures taken by the federal government are in tune 
with the general direction of Quebec's cultural policy.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois will demand that Quebec get its fair share 
of federal funding through the main cultural institutions such as 
museums, the National Film Board and the Canadian 
Broadcasting Corporation.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois will also make sure that cuts in the 
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's budget will not be made 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6463"> 6463 </A></B>
<P>
at the expense of its French network and, therefore, of Quebec 
artists.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois will also ensure that the Quebec cultural 
community receives its fair share of grants from federal 
agencies such as the Canada Council and Telefilm Canada and 
from the resource envelopes of the program.
<P>
	Such is the mandate I received from Shefford constituents and 
I intend to be worthy of their trust.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am always interested to hear members of the Bloc Quebecois 
talk about their culture and about other French Canadians, 
especially Franco-Ontarians, and how they are going to be 
assimilated, saying that the federal government has no role to 
play.
<P>
	I must tell you that I am a French Canadian, born in northern 
Ontario in a family which has been living there for generations. I 
was raised and educated in French.
<P>
	Let me tell you that my roots are the same as theirs, even 
though for economic reasons, my ancestors chose to go and 
build a country, Canada. Some stopped in Ontario, others 
continued further west. We now have our schools, several of 
them in fact. There are programs to teach English to 
francophones and French to anglophones.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	It is certainly not perfect, but it is a lot better than it was 30 
years ago. Do you think for one moment that without a federal 
government we, francophones from outside Quebec, would have 
had anything from people like the members opposite who 
choose to deny our very existence, and claim they are the only 
francophones in Canada? May I ask them what role they intend 
to play in the life of my children or my grand-children with their 
activities? To resort to such trickery is a disgrace.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Shefford):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank my 
colleague for her comments. I simply quoted figures in my 
speech. When you hear about the assimilation process taking 
place in Canada and see figures, real figures, like the ones I 
quoted, I think there can be no doubt. We are all entitled to our 
opinions and to think that things are actually better around us, 
but in the light of objective figures-those I quoted were from 
Statistics Canada if I am not mistaken-I would say it is 
undeniable.
<P>
	As the minister said, she is, of course, bilingual. As far as I am 
concerned, I used to teach English as a second language before I 
was elected to this House. I must tell you that I have a great deal 
of respect for the English language, and the English culture in 
general. My thinking regarding Quebec changed progressively; 
it was not a choice made overnight.
<P>
	When I was younger, I did not belong to a sovereignist 
political party; I was a federalist. Then, in 1980, I voted yes in 
the referendum, and this was the proudest day of my life. I am 
very proud of having voted yes. Since then, I have matured. I 
think that is the right thing to do. I would like francophones 
outside Quebec to be provided better protection. I would like 
them to have rights.
<P>
	During Statements by members under Standing Order 31 
today, I rose to point out that, in Northern Ontario today, 
francophones are having problems getting recognized. I do not 
know where the hon. minister is from or what newspapers she 
reads, but this is a fact and I think it is important to point it out. 
Canada as a country will continue to exist; I have no doubt about 
that.
<P>
	I remember reading a book that said that birds migrate to the 
south and that Canada was a fictitious country because it 
stretched from East to West while the normal axis was 
North-South. I think it must be true.
<P>
	When Canada was an English colony, the English had lost the 
whole southern part and they wanted to protect the North; that is 
how a fictitious country with two founding peoples was born. Of 
course, many other cultures came and joined them and they must 
be respected.
<P>
	People tend to think that minorities are poorly protected in 
Quebec. I would like to tell you that the English courses given in 
our schools in Quebec are improving. Our English-speaking 
fellow citizens have good facilities, like hospitals in Montreal, 
schools, three universities in Quebec territory. No other 
province does as much for its minority, except possibly the 
national capital, with the University of Ottawa and Saint Paul 
University. Except for that, there is nothing. I think that it is 
important to say so.
<P>
	I want to tell you that I want Quebec to be a sovereign country. 
Yes, Quebec and Canada should have good relations; we should 
learn to live together side by side in harmony and trade with 
each other. As you know, one side cannot do it alone. We in the 
Bloc Quebecois are in this debate and we will win.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jane Stewart (Brant):</B> Mr. Speaker, I feel compelled to 
follow the line of questioning of my colleague, the Minister of 
Health. I am sure I heard the hon. member talk about his 
commitment, his responsibility and his party's responsibility 
for francophones outside Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1715 ) </B>
<P>
	If they are successful in creating a country called Quebec, 
how do they expect to honour those commitments to 
francophones outside of Quebec? Instead of focusing on 
francophones and their needs in this great country, are they 
focusing instead on the creation of a country for the self-serving 
politicians who in fact want to lead a nation?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Shefford):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. 
colleague for her question.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6464"> 6464 </A></B>
<P>
	In the same way that Quebecers treat their minorities well, I 
believe that in a separate Canada Canadians will treat their 
minorities well. It will be both sides treating their minorities 
well. That is important for the future of our maybe two 
countries. I do not think there is a problem.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened very attentively to 
the hon. member's comments and I find it strange that he did not 
mention that, while there are 1 million francophones outside 
Quebec, 250 anglophones are now enroled in French immersion 
classes. We were even told that young Chinese are enroling in 
large numbers in Vancouver's French-language schools, a fact 
that should not be forgotten. I still think that they forgot to tell us 
about Canadian realities. Despite what they say, this is not a 
fictitious country. This is a wealthy country that belongs to the 
Group of Seven and that has achieved a great deal. We helped 
liberate France, Belgium and the rest of Europe in World War II. 
I think that Canadians have demonstrated their maturity, their 
know-how. They got involved when other countries did not heed 
the call. I think that we were able to accommodate Quebecers' 
needs and desires, because the federal government has invested 
heavily in Quebec to enable it to express its identity.
<P>
	Our Quebec includes Natives and anglophones. The Quebec 
forest that their PQ friends in Quebec City talk about is not only 
French-speaking; it also includes several cultural communities. 
Yet, I hear the hon. member speak as though only those people 
descended from the 60,000 settlers identified by Lionel Groulx 
were real Quebecers.
<P>
	I would like to know if, in his opinion, today's Quebec 
includes other cultures. We often hear about a Quebec open to 
the world but the hon. member would have us forget this 15 or 20 
per cent of the population that is an important part of Quebec as 
we know it today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Shefford):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will respond to my 
hon. colleague simply by quoting figures to show him that the 
tree always falls on the same side here in Canada. Of the 13,000 
so-called bilingual positions in the armed forces, 6,000 are held 
mainly by bilingual francophones, while the other 7,000 are held 
by anglophones for lack of bilingual candidates. Yet they 
decided to close the military college in Saint-Jean where 
anglophones could have been trained in French, where they 
could have taken immersion classes and gone outside the 
military community to experience a little Quebec culture and 
practice their French. But no, they will be taught French in 
Kingston where there is no immersion, where they will stay in an 
English-speaking environment and try to learn French as best 
they can.
<P>
	That is an example of this government's bad decisions. The 
tree always falls on the side of the majority. If we look at what is 
happening in Canada, it is very difficult for a majority to 
understand a minority. However, since  Quebecers are a 
minority in Canada, we understand well the problems of the 
anglophone minority in Quebec and we have given anglophones 
their own institutions. I challenge anyone in this House to find 
better anywhere else in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1720 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak 
on this legislation. I begin by saying that as I sit and listen to the 
Bloc Quebecois I continue to wonder whether we have lost our 
minds.
<P>
	We are looking back over the last 25 years. I had the great 
privilege and opportunity to work for the greatest Prime 
Minister this country ever had, Pierre Trudeau. I think of what 
this one Quebecer did to make sure that the presence of the 
francophone culture permeated every region of this country. I 
think of the fights and the battles and the commitment that he led 
to move and expand opportunities for Quebecers right across 
this country, not just in the public service.
<P>
	By his example and by his presence, he created an 
environment where Quebec business leaders are now running 
companies in every part of our country. I think of the Public 
Service of Canada right across this country. Maybe it is not a 
majority but a very high percentage, very close to 50 per cent of 
the public service positions right now are managed by 
francophones. In fact most of these senior positions are 
bilingual imperative.
<P>
	I know that the system is not perfect, but there are signs 
regarding the great experiment, the great drive to respect so 
much of what the members in the Bloc are fighting for, respect 
for their culture and respect for their language. I cannot believe 
that they do not really believe in their heart of hearts that it has 
moved forward tremendously.
<P>
	Could one imagine 10 or 15 years ago that in the province of 
Alberta today, as we now have, there are lineups to get into 
French immersion schools? If 15 years ago someone stood up in 
Alberta and predicted that in 1990 there would be lineups to get 
into French immersion schools, the person making that 
statement would have been thought out of his or her mind. But 
that is the reality of Canada today. There are lineups to get into 
French immersion schools in nearly every part of this country, 
including my own community.
<P>
	I do not want to suggest that the system is perfect, but we have 
moved a long way. I will tell this House what bothers my 
constituents. We are trying to build this country, trying to 
develop national programs and a national spirit. We have tried to 
move the French language into radio, television and into senior 
positions in the public service. Now, all of a sudden, we have a 
small group here from the province of Quebec who would say to 
all of Canada: ``Well, it was a nice try''. In spite of the billions 
and billions of dollars that all Canadians have paid to make this 
great experiment work,  we now have a small group of people 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6465"> 6465 </A></B>
<P>
here who want to say: ``We quit. We quit this great experiment''. 
It is more than an experiment; it is working.
<P>
	I am very excited about this bill because I have always 
believed in the Government of Canada presence being promoted 
right across this country. One of the reasons why I ran to be a 
member of Parliament in downtown Toronto was because I 
opposed the Meech Lake accord.
<P>
<B>(1725 ) </B>
<P>
	I opposed the Meech Lake accord because I do not believe in 
dismantling national programs and national institutions. I do not 
believe in giving any group preferential status in this country. I 
believe in a multicultural society. A multicultural society means 
to me that no culture is less than or greater than another culture.
<P>
	When one wants to talk about a distinct society that has 
special status, do not count on me to support that kind of thrust 
where one gives a special status to any particular culture in this 
country. Respect for bilingualism? It is the law of the land. I 
support that fully. However, to give special status to one culture 
over another, no way. That is not on.
<P>
	One of the reasons the Bloc Quebecois does not like this 
legislation is that it will once again reinvigorate the department 
that is so important in our rebuilding the Government of Canada 
presence in the province of Quebec.
<P>
	We talk in this bill about making sure that our parks and all of 
our Canadian symbols, our broadcasting and our cultural policy 
reflect the fact that we are a country from coast to coast. We do 
not just go from the west coast and jump over Quebec to Atlantic 
Canada. This is a country from coast to coast.
<P>
	Nothing should please Canadians more than making sure that 
the federal presence is reinvigorated in the province of Quebec. 
I believe, and this is where I come apart from my friends in the 
Reform Party, that if we want to keep this country together, we 
have to spend some money.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Your grandchildren's money.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> The member is 
absolutely right. The Reform Party says that it will be my 
grandchildren's money. I don't have any yet, but hopefully.
<P>
	There will not be anything for our grandchildren if we do not 
rebuild the national presence, the Government of Canada 
presence, and the symbols of Canada in the province of Quebec.
<P>
	This is what I cannot understand from the Reform Party. For 
10 years we had a Prime Minister, Mr. Mulroney, who basically 
retreated from building, exposing or showing what the 
Government of Canada did in Quebec. He was quite happy to 
shovel off and devolve responsibility to the operating province 
of Quebec.
<P>
	One of the reasons we have such a strong separatist feeling in 
Quebec right now is that the Government of Canada presence, 
the services, the programs, the symbols and the things that all 
Canadians pay for, is not realized by Quebecers. It is in the 
billions. In no other province in Canada do we have a situation 
like that.
<P>
	When government programs, government services and 
government activities happen in all the other provinces and in 
the Northwest Territories, they are plainly and clearly 
identified. However, in the province of Quebec we basically 
dismantle the federal presence. That of course is the reason as I 
said earlier why the Bloc Quebecois does not like this 
legislation. With this legislation we are going to once again try 
to rebuild that presence.
<P>
	If we go to Quebecers and ask: ``Do you want to continue to be 
a part of Canada?'', let us at least let Quebecers know what we 
are doing.
<P>
<B>(1730 ) </B>
<P>
	It has nothing to do with the heritage department. It has to do 
with all those symbols, services and programs that right now are 
not known as Government of Canada services and projects. 
Once again I stand here and say we in this Chamber are trying to 
rebuild the spirit of this country. We are trying to make sure 
there is a national feeling shared by all Canadians right across 
the country. I hope that one day a large majority of Quebecers 
will see that the best opportunity for their language and culture 
is by being a part of the whole nation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I feel my temper rising, but I will try to stay calm. 
Really, that is the absolute limit! That is dreadful! Where does 
the parliamentary secretary come from? Toronto, surely. He 
apparently visits Ottawa, but he never goes anywhere else 
because what he says is totally false.
<P>
	For nine years, the Right Hon. Brian Mulroney did everything 
in his power to bring Quebec back into Canada. Take Meech 
Lake, for example, who blocked it? Who stood in the way? The 
Grits did, the hon. member in particular. He just admitted it. 
There was a lady whom we cannot name, who is now 
somewhere, but we cannot say where, and who has just been 
rewarded for doing the good deeds requested today by the lady 
whom we cannot name. I refer to Sharon Carstairs. We will not 
name her. That was one.
<P>
	Two, the sorry tale of Charlottetown. What a farce. What a 
pity there was no Mr. Lisée in 1867 to tell us how Canada was 
built. What about a railway system right across Canada? And a 
ferry to Prince Edward Island in perpetuity; so we amended the 
Constitution for the ferry. The deed was done in a business-like 
fashion by a bunch of businessmen with no long-term vision 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6466"> 6466 </A></B>
<P>
about the chaos they were sending this country into. We no 
longer have a railway system. That was the only cross-country 
link we had, and it does not exist any more.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais:</B> Thanks to the electronic highway, 
we have made progress, in our part of the country.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata): </B>We will see 
what happens in New Brunswick. He says that Canada is not 
visible in Quebec. This is why they want to implement their 
social reform. They want to give students a cheque with a red 
flag on it. They want to bring together the young and the old. 
They scare old people when they give them a cheque with a red 
flag. But seniors in Quebec are no dummies. They know what is 
going on. They realize that whether the cheque is blue or red, the 
money comes from our pockets. There is no pot from which to 
hand out money to Quebec seniors every month. There is no such 
thing and seniors have figured that out a long time ago.
<P>
	Actually, Canada is visible in Quebec. There are big signs 
now. But they never thought of putting up such signs before Mr. 
Lévesque's government decided to do just that. Such an idea had 
never occurred to them. Only when Mr. Lévesque got his blue 
signs out did we start to see nice red signs go up. Now, those 
signs are black and white; they are as bleak as can be. Like the 
future of Canada. Completely shut out in total darkness. Such is 
Canada's visibility. Canada never gave us our fair share. This is 
what we said; this is what Quebecers know; this is what we will 
show and demonstrate to them. Canada has no future in Quebec 
and Quebecers will remember that on referendum day.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, I did not 
mean to get the member upset.
<P>
	The member stated that Canada has no place in Quebec. If I 
understood the member correctly, she implied that the rest of 
Canadians have not done that much to contribute to the 
development of Quebec within the context of Canada. It is sad 
the member believes that because we are all doing our best to 
make this work. Today several members on this side of the 
House have stated that the system is not perfect but it has been 
getting better. By refusing to work at building the country the 
member will only make the situation worse because the facts 
will eventually be communicated to Quebecers.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	We are entering a very tough period where not only Quebecers 
are doing the substantial in depth analysis of government 
programs and services and fiscal transfers. We are talking about 
programs and transfers of all the things related to our heritage 
not only in the province of Quebec but right across the country.
<P>
	When all of those analyses are done, as the Bloc so often likes 
to do line by line, Quebecers will see that Canada is a much 
better deal than most of them ever realized. Certainly when 
every member in the Bloc goes through the line by line exercise 
in relation to the whole, they are going to see that Canada is the 
place to be.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am a 
westerner and I am from Alberta and I heard-
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, excuse me. Remarks such as those are out of 
order. I have an opportunity to speak on this floor.
<P>
	In my view the hon. member who just spoke did not speak of a 
long term vision that addressed all of us in Canada. Is his view 
that what is required now is to continue to increase program 
spending to pacify Quebec? Quebecers appear to have made a 
decision here. The hon. member is suggesting that indeed we 
have not yet spent enough to facilitate and support Quebec to 
keep it in this federation, which quite frankly is falling apart.
<P>
	This bill is about legislating and entrenching 
multiculturalism which we cannot afford, national bilingualism 
which we cannot afford, and special interest group funding 
which we cannot afford. As an Albertan and a westerner I take 
great exception to the fact that this debate keeps wallowing in 
the issue of Quebec separation.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to address these points and to 
remember that Canada does extend beyond the Ontario border. 
There is a whole other part of this country called Canada and it is 
the west. The west is getting really fed up with all of this talk as 
well because it is all just talk. I am equally as disgusted and fed 
up as the hon. member from Quebec who just spoke. I am fed up 
with this whole debate as well, because it is going nowhere. It is 
grinding down into a ridiculous discussion about more spending 
and Canadian taxpayers will not tolerate any more spending.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not 
sure whether the member was suggesting that more resources 
were needed in Alberta to augment the bilingualism line-ups. Is 
that what she meant?
<P>
<B>(1740 ) </B>
<P>
	One of the greatest issues in western Canada which the 
western members especially those in the Reform Party talk 
about is eliminating the grants, program funding and all of those 
other things that help us develop as a nation. But very rarely do 
we hear members, especially those from Alberta telling us to cut 
the oil tax grants that are buried in the tax act of Canada. I cannot 
wait for the day when the hon. member says: ``Cut those oil and 
tax grants''. That is the day I am waiting for.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East):</B> Mr. Speaker, for the 
benefit of people reading <I>Hansard</I> I will tell them that I am 
wearing a tartan tie which I purchased in Scotland this summer. 
It is my family tartan and I am very proud of it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6467"> 6467 </A></B>
<P>
	I just want to make a couple of comments about this whole 
business. The Liberals have permitted this debate to fall off the 
tracks. It has ended up in a squabble match between them and the 
Bloc over whether the Bloc is right or they are right or whatever.
<P>
	As I said, my wife and I visited Scotland this summer. I was 
very impressed that the people of Scotland, who have much 
blood on the ground over various things which have happened in 
their history, are very, very proud of their Scottish heritage. I 
can only hope after we are successful in defeating the separatists 
in their referendum whenever they want to bring it, that the 
Quebecois in exactly the same way that the Acadians have, will 
say: ``I am proud to be a Quebecer,'' in the same way that the 
people in Scotland say: ``I am proud to be Scottish, but boy am I 
happy to be a part of the United Kingdom''. I can only hope we 
will see a move in that direction.
<P>
	The member for Broadview-Greenwood finally mentioned 
the word parks in this debate. Surprisingly in the grab bag that is 
Canadian Heritage, national parks are actually included. I 
suggest that parks possibly have more in common with the 
Department of the Environment. I have a couple of thoughts 
along that line in terms of the reorganization of the Department 
of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	The Canadian Parks Service objective for national parks as 
enunciated in 1991 is to protect for all time representative 
natural areas of Canadian significance in a system of national 
parks and to encourage public understanding, appreciation and 
enjoyment of this natural heritage so as to leave it unimpaired 
for future generations. It is for this reason that I suggest because 
of the very obvious close connection to the Department of the 
Environment that perhaps parks would be better served in a 
different department.
<P>
	Let me also read from the 1990 publication ``State of the 
Parks''. The introduction says in part: ``The national park 
profiles and national historic site profiles are designed to 
identify basic data for each park and site in the system. As such 
they will provide a context for the first state of the parks report. 
They represent a first attempt to provide a comprehensive 
reference list of the values, conditions and threats which occur 
throughout the system''.
<P>
	At another point it says: ``At this stage the data for the profiles 
are preliminary and reports of conditions are generally based on 
professional judgments rather than definitive criteria. This 
report fills an important function in that it identifies quite 
specifically gaps in the information systems which need to be 
addressed''. And this is the specific connection: ``Canada's 
green plan will provide resources to take an ecosystem approach 
to the management of national parks. In co-operation with other 
services of the Department of the Environment, the parks 
service will be developing indicators to measure  the condition 
of the natural resources and the stability of the cultural 
resources''.
<P>
<B>(1745 ) </B>
<P>
	It is important to note that the introduction to this 
presentation in 1990 was done at a time when parks were 
actually a part of the Ministry of the Environment. Under Kim 
Campbell's regime she made this grab bag of Canadian heritage 
that now happens to include parks.
<P>
	For reference let me also read from the news release from the 
current minister dated March 24, 1994. In its background, 
national heritage considerations, ecological integrity: ``In the 
establishment and management of national parks, Parks Canada 
strives to maintain the ecological integrity of those protected 
areas. Ecological integrity is defined as a condition whereby the 
structure and function of an ecosystem are unimpaired by the 
stress of human activity and are likely to remain so.
<P>
	The 1994 Parks Canada guiding principles and operational 
policies provide the framework for achieving this condition 
within national parks in conjunction with their sustainable use 
and enjoyment by visitors''.
<P>
	Parks are of great interest to me because I have three parks in 
my constituency; Kootenay National Park, Yoho National Park 
and Glacier National Park. Therefore I am quite interested in 
them. I have also taken time to read the current and most recent 
study from the Glacier-Mount Revelstoke National Park 
management plan.
<P>
	In summary this very good document tells me the direction 
the park wants to go. Basically it is leave it alone, do not touch 
it. Leave it in its natural state. It also talks about the fact that if 
certain flora or fauna or smaller animals or birds have been 
removed through the mismanagement of the parks, the parks 
would like to add them back.
<P>
	Interestingly though, they say that they will only let wild fires 
burn if they are in very remote areas and would simply go 
straight up the mountain. I can appreciate that where we have the 
Northlander Lodge and other buildings of that type, even parks 
buildings and camp sites with washroom facilities and so on and 
so forth that you would want to protect that area. However the 
difficulty is because we do not have a really clear definition of 
what we want to do in our parks. Because we have a Disneyland, 
Bambi kind of an idea about what a forest looks like, we are 
saying: ``Leave it alone, except we will suppress fire''.
<P>
	The difficulty is that even in Glacier National Park there is an 
area of the park that has a campground in it that has root rot. 
Root rot is something perfectly normal that is going to happen to 
trees. Therefore, due to lack of understanding, people from 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6468"> 6468 </A></B>
<P>
Canada, the United States and Europe travelling through will 
say: ``Oh my, how awful, this part of the forest has died''.
<P>
	Forests live and die in the same way that populations or 
people within populations live and die. We have a situation right 
now in Kootenay National Park-and I would suggest that this 
would be applicable to parks on the east coast and on the west 
coast-where we have a bug or a blight. We have in quite a 
number of trees an infestation where the trees are all turning red. 
How terrible. No, it is not terrible. That is part of nature's plan, 
of regeneration.
<P>
	As a matter of fact the reason why we have dominantly 
lodgepole pines up through Banff, Kootenay Park, Yoho Park 
and on up through Jasper is because around 1885 for a 
three-year period fire actually started as far south as Mexico 
and slowly worked its way up so that we have this monoculture 
of lodgepole pine. The trees have now reached a point where 
they are attracting disease or bugs.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	If we as human beings have not learned anything from what 
was in many cases an explosion in Yellowstone National Park 
where the place turned into an absolute inferno with no 
conceivable way of being able to control that inferno, then we 
have not learned very much. Particularly in Banff National Park 
they have tried burning some of the undergrowth and 
underbrush, to try to maintain this Disneyland kind of Bambi, 
Smoky the Bear, approach to what a forest is supposed to look 
like.
<P>
	I also read in the same report under sustainable use that 
throughout the consultative process leading to a revision of 
Parks Canada policies, discussions surrounding national parks 
underwent the most scrutiny. There was concern about which 
activities and facilities are appropriate within the confines of 
national parks.
<P>
	In response a revised policy reflects the role of national parks 
as part of larger ecosystems. Therefore decision making must be 
based on an understanding of surrounding environments leading 
to partnerships for the protection and sustainable use of the 
whole ecosystem. In the national parks context this means that 
people gain direct and indirect benefits from heritage resources 
over the long term without destroying them.
<P>
	Herein lies the conundrum. Herein lies the problem. In fact, in 
my judgment in many situations in our national parks-again I 
direct this to whether we are talking about the east coast, the far 
north, central Canada, because of our Disneyland approach to 
parks-we are actually letting the parks act as an incubator for 
bugs and disease where the trees are being killed. As a 
consequence we are loading the fuel and when it takes off there 
is going to be no stopping it. Commercial forests outside of 
parks are going to be negatively impacted either by disease, 
bugs or fire.
<P>
	Glacier National Park has a budget of $7.3 million and 99 full 
time people. Yoho National Park has a budget of $5.8 million 
with 81 full time people. In the case of Glacier National Park the 
vast majority, 75 to 80 per cent, of the budget is for road 
clearing. I would like to know what in the world Heritage 
Canada is doing in the road clearing business when we have 
perfectly competent, capable, equipped departments, 
subcontractors or contractors to the provincial government?
<P>
	To give an idea of where this is going, I have a press release in 
my hand of September 12 from Doug Martin, regional 
vice-president, Public Service Alliance of Canada and it reads: 
``Parks Canada is contemplating centralizing Yoho National 
Park highway crew to Banff and Lake Louise. Also being 
considered for transfer are the finance and store operations. 
Yoho employs approximately 60 full time and seasonal 
employees. The proposed transfer affects upwards of 40 
employees who will be required to move to Alberta''. It goes on 
and raises some very legitimate concerns.
<P>
	I was speaking about an hour ago with the mayor of the town 
of Golden which is in my constituency. The mayor was asking 
me: ``What is going on, what is happening''. He is going into a 
council meeting tonight. They want to know. They need to know.
<P>
	I lay at the door of the Liberal government the fact that this 
area of parks management is completely up in the air, is rolling 
over, is appearing to be completely out of control. We are into a 
process of redirection and there is no direction from the top; the 
top level being the minister of parks.
<P>
<B>(1755 ) </B>
<P>
	Furthermore, in taking a look at the whole issue of highways 
and asking why Parks Canada is in the highway business, I read 
in a note from the Northlander Lodge, which is up in Rogers 
Pass: ``The Alberta Truckers Association lobbied long and hard 
and advanced the position that they should not have to pay to 
transport commercial goods across Canada on the Trans-Canada 
Highway just because the highway happened to go through the 
federal park''. Parks Canada made a policy decision and in a 
speech in Calgary the minister announced that through 
commercial traffic would no longer have to pay a toll to go 
through the parks. He is asking if there is going to be a 
reimposition of the toll in the parks because it very directly 
impacts on his business.
<P>
	If there is a reimposition of the toll for the vehicles going 
through the parks, then people coming through are going to be in 
a position of saying: I am not going to stop at the Northlander 
Lodge because I did not pay my permit; I am not going to stop 
for a cup of coffee, I am not going to stop for that extra gas that I 
think I need, I am going to bypass it. This directly affects him.
<P>
	The reason why I am asking if it makes sense for parks to be in 
the highway business is that the last time I looked commercial 
vehicles, for that matter passenger  vehicles, are presently 
paying to all the provinces diesel and fuel taxes that should be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6469"> 6469 </A></B>
<P>
going to the capital cost of maintaining roads as well as the day 
to day maintenance of roads.
<P>
	I believe in user pay. The Reform Party believes that those 
who are using a service should be paying for it. I understand that 
and I support that. However if it works to the detriment of the 
businesses that are located in the parks, then that is just plain 
wrong-headed thinking.
<P>
	Right at the moment we have a situation in Kootenay National 
Park-again let me put in parenthesis that I am referring to some 
specific situations I am personally familiar with. I have every 
reason to believe that the same kind of situation is in place in 
virtually every park across Canada. We are talking about a 
management situation, what should we be doing. With the 
greatest respect to my friends across the way, the people are not 
getting direction from the top.
<P>
	For example we are looking at enterprise units in parks. What 
is an enterprise unit in a park? If you have hot pools in Radium, 
in Banff and in Jasper and the revenue from the visitors to those 
pools is just going into consolidated revenue, that does not 
generate efficient management of those pools. As an example, 
that is the first of the enterprise units. They have hired an 
individual and the revenue coming in from the pools is going to 
be segregated so that they can use it to manage the park facilities 
related to the pools.
<P>
	Here again, we have an issue of hiring practices. Should we 
not be making sure that the parks are in a position to be able to 
hire people with pool management backgrounds rather than 
being forced to hire from within the civil service, still with the 
civil service mind, to be able to get the job done?
<P>
	In conclusion, I believe for dollar efficiency that the heritage 
department should turn over parks back to the environment 
department. I also believe in the concept of enterprise units, 
where you would have user pay so that you get the dollars to 
provide the service.
<P>
	Finally, may I suggest that Canada sell the parks building in 
the very high rent district in Calgary, get out of Calgary, move 
the people into a town like Golden which is right in the centre, 
and manage the parks from a low rent district and a district that 
more reflects the area than the area the bureaucrats in Calgary 
are presently in.
<P>
<B>(1800 ) </B>
<P>
	I thank you for the opportunity to speak to this issue, Mr. 
Speaker. These are a few ideas that I have with respect to parks. 
In summary I say I believe parks should be moved from heritage 
back to environment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with 
great interest to the hon. member's comments. I was studying 
today's material about our national park system because my 
riding of Algoma is one of the most beautiful areas in the 
country and should have been looked at seriously for a national 
park, parts of it anyway.
<P>
	I wonder if the hon. member would comment on my concern 
and impression that he would like to see parks totally 
self-sufficient in a fiscal sense. Truly there are parks in this 
country that must be preserved for the good of our children that 
will never be sustainable on a purely fee for service basis.
<P>
	Does he believe that the heritage of our country in its natural 
areas can only be preserved on a fee for service basis? Does he 
not believe that we cannot look at these resources only from that 
point of view?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his question 
because it is very valid. If we were just talking about a fee for 
service basis and we were losing sight of the fact that the parts of 
the parks that people most frequently want to go to, like the 
Burgess Shale in Yoho Park, and I am sure there are some other 
specific areas that people want to go to, there must be a control. 
There must be a park warden. There must be people who are 
actually going through the process to make sure that the 
integrity of that area is under proper control.
<P>
	I would suggest that for those areas in particular that where 
we have to be spending dollars using resources to give special 
protection to those areas, those areas should be not only 
preserved for the good of our children which would happen, not 
only totally self-sufficient but I believe they could actually be 
profit-making so that some of the cost of doing the general work 
that the member refers to would be able to come out of that 
revenue and thereby be less draining on our bankrupt treasury at 
this point.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
member. I listened very intently to his concept of parks. I have 
been to a number of parks in his riding.
<P>
	I guess the concern I have which follows along with the 
previous comment is whether our parks are ones that we want to 
prevent people from using based on their income. In other 
words, I think most people look at our parks in Canada as part of 
our national heritage. I suppose that is what we are debating 
today.
<P>
	To the extent that a poor person possibly cannot access some 
of these areas, I think of the sulphur pools and so forth that the 
member is talking about, because the maintenance cost is such 
that they become prohibitive to do so, only wealthy people or 
middle class people, however you want to define that, will have 
access to our national parks. I wonder if that is not somewhat of 
an abuse of the concept of user pay.
<P>
	I noted one other point. The hon. member talked about the 
roads that would not be user pay but that some of the facilities in 
the part should be. I wonder how he gets around that 
contradiction.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6470"> 6470 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Mr. Speaker, handling the last point first, the 
roads currently are user pay and that is currently going into 
provincial coffers by way of fuel taxes.
<P>
	What I am attempting to find out is the relationship between 
the amount of fuel tax that goes into the coffers of the province 
of B.C. and the fact that basically the province of British 
Columbia at this point appears to get off scott free from the very 
excessive costs of trying to keep Rogers Pass open which is a 
real chore. It is the same thing in Yoho Park.
<P>
	The member's point is well taken and I have given a lot of 
thought to his question.
<P>
<B>(1805 ) </B>
<P>
	In the area of the pools I do not think there would have to be an 
excessive charge. If they are handled on an entrepreneurial basis 
as their own enterprise unit, which is the experiment currently 
being tried, we would find that the prices probably would not 
have to go up. If there were an entrepreneurial spirit on the part 
of management it would end up taking care of itself.
<P>
	It is just that previously when the dollars were coming in and 
then going into consolidated revenue, there was no connection 
between the dollars coming in and the maintenance required 
because the maintenance required did not have anything to do 
with the dollars coming in. That is why I support the concept of 
the enterprise unit.
<P>
	I would suggest that the member and others consider the 
Tatshenshini which is an area as far north and west in British 
Columbia as one can go. It is a large triangle shape that fits into 
the top corner of the province, right behind the Alaska 
panhandle. This is an area that the province of B.C. has now 
turned into a class A provincial park.
<P>
	I cannot afford to go there. I literally cannot afford to go there. 
I do not happen to have $5,000 for a helicopter. I do not have 
another $1,500 for the rafting. It is there if I have the resources 
and I want to go there. If I have the $5,000 or $6,500 I can get 
there, but I do not have those dollars.
<P>
	I suggest that the member consider that what we have done in 
the case of Tatshenshini in the province of B.C., recognizing that 
it is not a national park but still in concept, is to take an area, set 
it aside, take it out of the mining grid and turn it over to people 
who happen to have $6,500 so that they can raft down the river.
<P>
	This concept of user pay for specific areas I do not think 
anybody is going to find too difficult when they put it against the 
cost of actually providing the service on a park by park basis.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières):</B> Mr. Speaker, as critic 
for the Industry, I am pleased to take part in this debate on the 
Department of Canadian Heritage Act, particularly since last 
Monday, exactly a week ago, I also raised, as critic for my Party, 
to speak on the Department of Industry Act, a piece of 
legislation aiming at  combining former departments which was 
drafted by the Campbell government and copied by the current 
government.
<P>
	At the time, we said that the Department of Industry had so 
many responsibilities and such a scope that the Parliamentary 
Secretary, who unfortunately has left, called his minister 
``superman''. We said that we will leave it to the voters to decide 
whether or not the Prime Minister has made a wise decision.
<P>
	During the debate, we recognized that the mandate of the 
Department of Industry was wide-ranging and that there was a 
lot of duplication with Quebec's regional development 
programs as well as with other federal institutions dealing with 
regional development, particularly the NRC.
<P>
	But the reason I wanted to speak on this bill is that there is also 
a lot of duplication and overlap, and very little progress, where 
Canadian heritage and this bill are concerned. Indeed, when it 
comes to jurisdictions and the powers, duties and functions of 
the Minister of Industry, clause 4(1)(h) of Bill C-46 provides 
that the powers, duties and functions of the Minister extend to 
and include all matters over which Parliament has jurisdiction, 
not by law assigned to any other department, board or agency of 
the government of Canada, relating to
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(h) patents, copyrights, trade-marks, industrial designs and integrated circuit 
topographies;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	And pursuant to clause 4(1)(k), the powers of the Minister 
also extend to
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(k) telecommunications, except in relation to (i) the planning and 
coordination of telecommunication services for departments, boards and 
agencies of the Government of Canada, and (ii) broadcasting, other than in 
relation to spectrum management and the technical aspects of broadcasting;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Thus, we see two important areas where there is duplication 
and a little overlapping concerning copyrights and 
telecommunications.
<P>
	As for copyrights, it has to be either a chance mishap that 
should be corrected without delay or a deliberate decision. If it 
is a deliberate decision, it is very tendentious and significative 
to entrust the Department of Industry with the whole issue of 
copyrights.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	Everybody knows, since they have their own personal culture, 
that when you delegate a question like copyrights to the 
Department of Industry, you are going against a whole culture. 
Just as a business has a culture, a department has one, and in this 
case it is a business culture.
<P>
	Writers were familiar with the Department of 
Communications which was the organization previously 
responsible for everything pertaining to ``Canadian'' culture. 
These people, in Canada and Quebec, were in the habit-a good 
habit-of dealing with people who understood their problems 
and with whom they had probably established relationships.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6471"> 6471 </A></B>
<P>
	Now, the government supports the Conservative Party's 
approach of treating copyrights like any other commercial 
product; this approach was condemned in English Canada as 
well as in Quebec. We have information on the subject. The 
whole situation gives rise to so much unease, discomfort and 
unfairness that it strains the relationship between the artistic 
community and the Canadian government, as represented by the 
Department of Industry.
<P>
	But even worse, we must know that Industry Canada is 
beholden to American interests, and this is part of the 
international problem. That was the case with the Conservative 
Party and the Liberal Party, in spite of all its pretensions, is no 
better. It seems that the arts community feels very affected by 
the situation. For reasons of efficiency and respect for 
individuals and organizations in the field, bringing the whole 
issue of copyrights back under the responsibility of the 
Department of Canadian Heritage has been suggested.
<P>
	The other aspect concerns communications and 
telecommunications. There is a lot of duplication and it is very 
tendentious and revealing. And again, form is favoured over 
substance. The tools used in the world of telecommunications 
today are very sophisticated, whether we are talking about 
optical fibres or coaxial cables, and it is the tools that are the 
government's main concern.
<P>
	The Department of Canadian Heritage deals with 
communications and telecommunications, but it has to take into 
account the business concerns of Industry Canada. When we say 
that Industry Canada is beholden to American interests, it is 
important to know that, according to the information we have, 
the situation has completely changed in the United States, which 
means that the cultural sovereignty of both Canada and Quebec 
is at stake.
<P>
	There was a time when the Americans' own market was 
enough to meet their financial needs. They just had to export 
part of their output to cover their costs and make profits. Today, 
they have to export a lot more because production costs have 
become excessively high, as we can see in the world of sports for 
example.
<P>
	That is why the cultural pressures from the United States that 
we have always felt since the Second World War have become 
even greater over the past few years. Today, the Americans have 
no choice. This is very serious for us in Quebec, and maybe even 
more serious for English Canada.
<P>
	In Quebec, as far as cultural sovereignty is concerned, we, the 
sovereignists, are in the process of settling the matter. We are 
taking steps so that the issue of Quebec cultural sovereignty, as 
well as its full sovereignty, could be settled in a matter of eight 
to ten months.
<P>
	But the situation is not the same as far as the cultural 
sovereignty of Canada is concerned. Instead of putting 
sovereignists on trial here in this House, if members opposite do 
not realize that the cultural sovereignty of Canada itself is 
threatened because of the overpowering influence of 
telecommunications, they will soon have to deal with problems 
of great magnitude.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	On the week end-as luck would have it-I was listening to a 
public affairs program of an economic nature, dealing precisely 
with cultural development. They were saying that Toronto, 
which had fallen on hard times because of problems in real 
estate and because of the recession, seems to be recovering 
much strength, thanks mostly to the cultural sector. Toronto is 
indeed regaining its demographic and economic weight because 
of billion-dollar developments in that area. So much so that 
Toronto has become the third largest cultural city in North 
America, after Los Angeles and New York, but it is Toronto, 
American style.
<P>
	That is a problem people across the way should be concerned 
about because they face a giant that will smother whatever is left 
of the distinct personality Canada claims it has. I hate to think 
what would happen if Quebec decided to go its own way. We are 
playing our role as the Official Opposition when we tell 
Canadians that they should shape their own future the same way 
Quebecers will, shortly.
<P>
	Since we are talking about broadcasting, telecommunications 
and communications, I would be remiss in my duty as the 
member for Trois-Rivières if I did not mention the recent 
decision broadcasters in Quebec made, almost arbitrarily, it 
would appear, or at least without notice or with very little 
consultation, to close down six AM radio stations overnight. I 
am dismayed to see this happen, and I want my constituents in 
Trois-Rivières to know it. I already had an opportunity to 
comment on those radio station closures.
<P>
	Such a decision raises two concerns. One is the media 
concentration in Quebec and the attendant curtailing of freedom 
of expression through various channels. As a result of that 
concentration, those who work in the media will have to abide 
by their code of ethics even more strictly in order to do their 
work properly.
<P>
	At noontime, the Minister of Canadian Heritage rejected all 
responsibility. We could very well blame the CRTC or question 
its decision to grant too many new FM licences, because those 
new stations slowly but surely eroded the advertising revenues 
the AM stations depended on. We now see the results of this 
laxism.
<P>
	Lastly, in the communications sector, there is also the 
electronic highway which, likewise, has a commercial aspect. 
The vehicle is given much more importance than the content and 
Quebec is completely excluded. This responsibility is assigned 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6472"> 6472 </A></B>
<P>
to Industry Canada. In Quebec, however, Mr. Parizeau recently 
assigned it to his Minister of Culture. I believe that is the right 
way to go about it  and Canada takes a different approch to 
government, which is not necessarily sound.
<P>
	I would like to conclude on the fundamental question of what 
pertains to Heritage Canada. We can argue that one activity 
should come under this jurisdiction or that another activity 
should under that jurisdiction, but for us, as sovereignists, 
Heritage Canada is a major tool of a supposedly profitable 
federalism, a major tool for the assimilating Quebecers or 
attempting to assimilate them and intrude in a field which 
clearly is in provincial jurisdiction, especially in Quebec, where 
it should come under the sole jurisdiction of the Quebec 
government. All the money for Quebec administered by 
Heritage Canada should be given to the Government of Quebec, 
as soon as possible.
<P>
	Therefore, I support the amendment presented by my 
colleague from Rimouski-Témiscouata.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thought the hon. member's comments 
were most interesting. There was some discussion of the 
technical aspects, since according to him, copyright should be 
patriated from Industry Canada to Culture Canada, and I thought 
that was very interesting.
<P>
	However, according to his last comments, the role played by 
federalism, Culture Canada, the CBC, Telefilm Canada, the 
National Film Board and all agencies concerned with promoting 
French Canadian culture in Montreal and Quebec is an attempt 
at assimilation. I think that is strong language that does not 
reflect the real situation at all, because I explained in the 
House-and I got no reaction-that 40 per cent of the films 
produced by the National Film Board were French. I think that is 
a very real aspect of our Confederation.
<P>
	Again, I got no reaction when I said that the National Film 
Board and Telefilm Canada largely subsidized Falardeau's last 
film about the October crisis. I asked them if they could find an 
instance in which France provided funding for a Corsican or 
Breton nationalist to produce a similar film. I believe that the 
role played by the government reflects a wide-ranging, 
generous and comprehensive approach, and the maturity and 
confidence to consider the views of the opposition, as we are 
doing today.
<P>
	We are still discussing the pervasiveness of American culture 
in our cultural industries. Sure. It is a fact of life that we, a 
nation of 6 million francophones, are like an island in a sea of 
anglophones. Incidentally, I was interested in the references to 
France, a country which I know fairly well. In 1984, when 
people went to the cinema in France, more than 70 per cent of the 
films they saw were French productions. Unfortunately, today, 
only 30 per cent of the films seen by French movie goers are 
French productions. It is clear that France has lost control of its 
national production, while we in Quebec, thanks to the generous 
participation of the federal  government, have been able to 
produce quality films and support French Canadian songwriters 
and composers.
<P>
	I am thinking of Canadian productions like Roch Voisine and 
Céline Dion, good singers all of them. The Canadian 
government has also helped small producers who were not a big 
international success and who were not a big success in the 
United States. I do not think these small producers really have to 
go and produce in the United States. We are here to encourage 
them to develop French culture in Quebec and Canada and to 
provide them with a market, not only in this country but also 
internationally.
<P>
	Today, unfortunately, the opposition failed to take this 
opportunity to recognize that the federal government, thanks to 
its grant system and participation, has been a major factor in the 
growth and development of Quebec culture.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rocheleau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very happy to see the 
member for Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine is adopting 
that point of view on the issue because if, in their longing for 
sovereignty, there is one area where Quebecers can be proud and 
sure of themselves, surely it is the arts. The very existence of 
Telefilm Canada means there is great talent in Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	We saw it again, yesterday evening, during the Gala des 
Gémeaux: we had the opportunity to celebrate dozens of people 
who make us sincerely and spontaneously proud and who are 
part of our own. I think this is an element on which Quebecers 
will have to base their judgment; the ability in arts and sports of 
this small group perched in the northern part of North America. 
Recently at the Olympic Games, we showed the world how good 
we were. And we showed it also in the economic sector with 
Québec Inc. We can be sovereign in all areas; we can take our 
fate into our own hands and take the necessary steps to reach full 
development.
<P>
	I think we owe nothing to the Canadian government because 
the help we received from Telefilm Canada and other agencies 
was due to the presence of talented francophones who were 
appointed there and had the insight to see talent and promote it 
with taxes paid by Quebecers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to pursue a little 
further the member's expressed concerns about the invasion of 
American 
<P>

<B><A NAME="6473"> 6473 </A></B>
<P>
culture which might overwhelm all of Canada including his 
province, according to his thesis.
<P>
	I really wonder if he believes that in an independent Quebec in 
the English cultural sea which the hon. member opposite 
mentioned they could hope to resist these forces without the 
protection, care and nurturing that French Canadian culture gets 
outside of Quebec? This is the buffer zone and we pay for it. We 
westerners pay for it at enormous cost.
<P>
	I do not say I like it, but it is happening. I think the hon. 
member should be duly grateful.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rocheleau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I just want to go over the things 
that could threaten the Quebec culture and the Canadian culture, 
if it exists, because I really think there remains some doubts 
about that in some circles. In Quebec, in part for historical 
reasons, we are in a process of taking over our own destiny and 
making sure that our culture, which is unique in the world, will 
survive and develop.
<P>
	It seems that the same cannot be said of the Canadian culture 
and that the Canadian stakeholders have not yet understood how 
critical the situation is. It is high time, given the 
communications systems in place today and the American 
domination over this small country which is Canada, north of 
the United States, and what will be left of it after Quebec 
separation, that these people take their future in hand and 
understand how critical the situation is. For us, as far as the 
francophones outside Quebec are concerned, we are going to 
take care of them like people of the diaspora and perhaps we will 
demand more than provincial and federal governments do today. 
We could cite the example of the anglophone minority and the 
other minorities in a sovereign Quebec and legitimately demand 
that the rest of Canada be as generous as we are. 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciated a lot the comments of my colleague from 
the Reform Party. It is a bit disappointing to see that the debate 
is getting out of hand. We have clearly stated our positions, we 
have said that we are against that bill for very fundamental 
reasons and all day long, members of the government kept on 
rising to tell us again and again how wonderful our country was, 
how beautiful and how great it was. Both Telefilm and the 
National Film Board make lots of films.
<P>
	The National Film Board no longer has the money to make 
films and this is no secret. It makes films like Léolo. When 
Telefilm Canada makes a film like Octobre, it is not investing in 
the culture of Quebec, but an historical event that took place in 
Canada, in October 1970. Who is the one who introduced the 
War Measures Act? It is Trudeau. Who caused us to make that 
movie? Who sent the army to Montreal? The army, that is 
Canadian for sure. Thus, even if the event took place in 
Montreal, it is Canadian. We must never forget that. It is not 
because Telefilm Canada gives money to Quebec to make films, 
it also gives money to Toronto. We have never denied that 
cultural aspect. However, we are sick  and tired of hearing 
people talk all day long about how beautiful Canada is while 
those same people will not admit that this department is going to 
divide our country instead of unifying it.
<P>

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT DEBATE</H2>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="LOWLEVELFLIGHTS">LOW LEVEL FLIGHTS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last week I raised the question of the federal 
environmental assessment panel investigating a proposal to 
expand low level military flight training in Labrador, 
specifically flying over the territorial land of the Innu.
<P>
	In asking the question I noted that all the public interest 
groups, including the Innu and the Sierra Club, have withdrawn 
from the hearings, rendering the process nothing short of a 
farce. The public has demonstrated by withdrawing from the 
process a lack of confidence in that process.
<P>
	I asked the minister what the federal government would do to 
fix this so that the public and the most disadvantaged group in 
the area, the Innu, could participate.
<P>
	Since the question, the Minister of the Environment has met 
with representatives of the Innu people and with Mr. Paul 
Wilkinson, a former and recently resigned member of the 
assessment panel in question. At that meeting and in a letter, Mr. 
Wilkinson said: ``I was forced to conclude that I had outlived my 
usefulness on the panel when the chairman was effectively 
telling me that my opinion as a member of the panel carried less 
weight than that of the Department of National Defence''.
<P>
	The issue of the panel's bias is only one reason why the Innu 
and others are justifiably not participating in the hearings. 
According to the Innu, the panel seriously compromised the 
integrity and independence of the process when it failed to 
require the Department of National Defence to table critical 
information before the start of the public hearings so that it 
could be reviewed by the interveners.
<P>
	The panel also prejudiced the hearing process by not requiring 
DND to provide an analysis of the impact of low level flight 
training on aboriginal rights, including the negotiation and 
settlement of land rights in Quebec and Labrador.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="6474"> 6474 </A></B>
<P>
	The Innu requested the right to cross examine DND technical 
experts but they were denied by the panel. They are therefore 
saying that they cannot participate in a hearing process in which 
their land, their lives, the environment around them and their 
rights are at stake but in which the proponent is not required to 
put information on the table or stand accountable for other 
information that is in question.
<P>
	The Minister of the Environment has heard the arguments and 
has indicated that mediation may be needed to make the 
hearings more fair and visibly impartial.
<P>
	I once again ask that the federal government suspend the 
flights and suspend the hearings until the Innu rights and 
concerns are addressed and that after addressing those rights 
with or without mediation the federal government put in place 
an independent environmental review process that is fair both to 
the Innu and the land in question.
<P>
	The minister has indicated in other places that Canada's new 
environmental assessment legislation may be proclaimed within 
two weeks. That new legislation sets out a process that may be 
fairer. Perhaps the minister would suspend the present hearings 
until what we know as Bill C-13 is proclaimed and then 
establish a new panel under the auspices of the new agency and 
do things right for a change.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
intervention on the low level military flying activities in 
Labrador and Quebec.
<P>
	The Minister of the Environment met recently with 
representatives of the three native groups who have decided not 
to participate to hear firsthand their concerns with the panel's 
review procedures.
<P>
	The minister listened very carefully to their views. She 
respects their perspective but considers that the panel is 
conducting its proceedings fairly and in accordance with its 
mandate and the long tradition of independent federal 
environmental assessment hearings.
<P>
	The minister has stated in this very Chamber that if she is 
presented with any evidence of bias on the part of any panel 
member she would not hesitate to remove that member. 
However, to date there is no evidence of any bias among the 
panel membership. The panel will hear from those who are 
interested in participating in a process that is important to the 
government's decision making on this issue.
<P>
	The participation of the First Nations and Inuit among others 
is an important aspect of the public review process. The member 
will be happy to know that the panel has indicated its 
willingness to be flexible in its procedures and in responding to 
the interests of key stakeholders.
<P>
	Thus far there has been valuable participation of 
stakeholders, including First Nations and Inuit  representatives, 
in the review process. It would be unfortunate if important 
groups continued to choose not to participate but no group or 
individual can be forced to be part of this open process.
<P>
	The panel has received substantial written information from 
the groups that will not be participating in the hearings and will 
be using that information to the extent possible. The government 
encourages all affected groups and individuals to participate in 
the public hearings and I hope I can count upon my colleagues to 
also urge all affected groups to participate rather than to abstain.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 38(5), the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to 
have been adopted. Accordingly, this House stands adjourned 
until tomorrow at 10 a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.36 p.m.)
