	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-55, an act to establish a 
board having jurisdiction concerning disputes respecting 
surface rights in respect of land in the Yukon territory and to 
amend other acts in relation thereto, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the House on Bill 
C-55, the Yukon Surface Rights Board Act.
<P>
	My hon. colleagues are very familiar with the issues relating 
to Yukon, particularly to the rest of the native peoples of Yukon. 
The House passed legislative initiatives in June that will shape 
the political and economic future of the territory today. We are 
being asked at this time to ensure that those efforts were not in 
vain by putting in place the final legislative building block to 
allow implementation of the land claims settlement in the 
Yukon.
<P>
<B>(1005) </B>
<P>
	Just before the House recessed this summer we dealt with two 
important pieces of legislation: the Yukon First Nations Land 
Claims Settlement Act and the Yukon First Nations 
Self-Government Act.
<P>
	Hon. members will recall that the first act when proclaimed 
into force will establish a territory wide framework for the 
implementation of land claim settlement agreements with each 
of the 14 Yukon First Nations. It will give effect to four final 
agreements under the framework.
<P>
	The second act will give effect to the Yukon First Nations 
self-government agreements which are successfully negotiated. 
Self-government agreements have been negotiated with four 
First Nations for final land claims agreements: the Vuntut 
Gwich'in First Nation; the First Nation of Na-cho-ny'a'k-dun; 
the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations; and the Teslin 
Tlingit Council.
<P>
	Those two bills were approved by Parliament. They have 
received royal assent and are now awaiting proclamation into 
force. Before that can occur however and before Yukon residents 
can begin to benefit from the certainty their land claims 
agreement will bring, the government must establish a new 
surface rights regime in the territory which is what we are doing 
today. Bill C-55 will do that.
<P>
	With the new surface rights bill, Canada is delivering on its 
commitment set out in the land claims settlement agreements 
which as hon. members know were signed by the federal and 
territorial governments and the Council for Yukon Indians in 
May 1993. That is after 21 years of negotiations.
<P>
	The umbrella final agreement as it was called required 
separate legislation to enact a new surface rights regime which 
is why Bill C-55 is now before the House. Separate legislation 
will also be required within two years to establish the Yukon 
development assessment act which will evaluate the 
environmental impact of development proposals.
<P>
	It is important for the House to be mindful of the changes that 
are occurring in the Yukon in order to fully appreciate the need 
for a new surface rights regime.
<P>
	Over the coming months and years large tracts of lands in the 
Yukon will be confirmed as lands held exclusively by individual 
First Nations as their final agreements are implemented. This 
will signal a significant change for the territory and its residents 
as most land is currently held by the crown. In future the 
Government of Canada will no longer be calling the shots or 
laying out the ground rules for use of land throughout Yukon. 
More and more crown land in Yukon will become private land 
owned by either Yukon First Nations or by private citizens as is 
the common situation in much of Canada.
<P>
	Under the land claims agreement Yukon First Nations will 
have title to both the surface and subsurface mines and minerals 
on some of their settlement lands known as category A lands. On 
category B lands the First Nations will own the surface but the 
crown will retain its interest in the subsurface. However, to get 
at minerals below the surface, companies will require access 
over the surface.
<P>
	As hon. colleagues know from our debate on the Land Claims 
Settlement Act, we anticipate that mining and petroleum 
companies will be eager to begin developing Yukon subsurface 
resources. In fact the desire to establish certainty of land 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7022"> 7022 </A></B>
<P>
ownership and rights so that resource developments can go 
forward is one of the  driving forces behind the land claims 
settlement agreement.
<P>
	The government must do everything in its power to support 
economic development while respecting and protecting the 
rights and interests of both aboriginal and non-aboriginal 
Yukoners. That means looking ahead, preparing for change and 
working with the various parties to ensure fair and reasonable 
treatment.
<P>
	Years of uncertainty concerning land title in Yukon will now 
end with the completion of the land claim. The surface rights bill 
concludes the package necessary to bring the land claim 
agreement into effect.
<P>
	The bill will require people to attempt to negotiate 
agreements before bringing a dispute before the board. It will 
also establish a process to obtain access to private and public 
lands that will put in place a mechanism to deal efficiently with 
disputes between the surface owners of the land and the owners 
of the subsurface resource.
<P>
<B>(1010) </B>
<P>
	The bill is important. It is procedural but it is important 
because without this bill the other two bills will not come into 
play. It is our responsibility not only to do the first two bills but 
to ensure that all the bills we undertook to bring in are brought 
before the House.
<P>
	The Yukon First Nations land claims have been discussed in 
Yukon for over 21 years and it is going to take me another year to 
get all these bills through. The Council for Yukon Indians 
submitted its claim in 1973.
<P>
	The bill in particular is the result of extensive consultations 
with representatives of the First Nations, the territorial 
government, the mining industry, including the Chamber of 
Mines and the Klondike Placer Miners Association.
<P>
	Sometimes I think all they do in Yukon is discuss these bills. I 
keep referring to the same people. If they are watching on 
television they must be getting a chuckle out of this. 
Consultations have taken place for more than a year and many of 
these parties have been directly involved in drafting this 
legislation.
<P>
	Under Bill C-55 the surface rights board will be given a range 
of powers, including the power to establish terms and conditions 
of access on both settlement and non-settlement land, and the 
power to award compensation for access and for damage 
resulting from that access.
<P>
	There are a number of instances in which the surface rights 
boards might become involved in dispute resolution. For 
example, if a new mineral rights owner and a First Nation or 
surface rights holder cannot reach a negotiated agreement-and 
there must be an attempt at negotiation or they cannot get to the 
board-permitting access to the land and minerals, the operator 
can apply to the Yukon surface rights board for a right of entry 
order. In such a case the board might issue an interim access 
order while compensation and other issues are addressed either 
by the parties or by the board.
<P>
	The board could also award partial compensation when 
issuing an interim access order. It would establish an entry fee to 
be paid to the Yukon First Nation on settlement land before the 
access order could be finalized. There could be no entry fee for 
access to non-settlement land.
<P>
	Bill C-55 will provide that an order of the surface rights board 
will be enforceable through the Supreme Court of the Yukon 
territory. The board may review its own decisions if it believes 
there has been a change in the facts or circumstances.
<P>
	Decisions made by the board may be appealed to the Supreme 
Court of Yukon on limited grounds such as bias or a lack of 
procedural fairness, much the same grounds that are prevalent 
on any board. It is a procedural appeal on bias, fairness or lack of 
cross-examination, those types of appeals, but not on fact 
finding or things of that nature. Our objective is to keep surface 
rights issues out of the courts as much as possible. Litigation is 
costly and time consuming for all parties.
<P>
	Hon. members should also be aware that resolving disputes 
through the surface rights boards will be used only as a last 
resort. People will be required to attempt to negotiate 
agreements and possibly to seek mediation before bringing a 
dispute before the board.
<P>
	The surface rights board is not adding another layer of 
government in Yukon; in fact the opposite is true. In other 
words, we are not creating more government; we are helping to 
build better government. We are ensuring that all sectors of 
Yukon society will have a respected voice and direct 
participation in the decision making process that in the past has 
been exercised by government alone.
<P>
	This is clearly a time of change in Yukon, but change that is 
properly planned and managed. Bill C-55 is part of the process 
of managing change. I am confident that the surface rights 
regime will work to the benefit of all Yukoners.
<P>
	It is time, as has been pointed out in the red book, that we 
devolve jurisdiction to Yukon. This was our commitment; this is 
what the Prime Minister said. There is a series of initiatives and 
legislation that will come before the House this fall. Hopefully 
within the term of this government Yukon will have all the 
powers that a normal province would have.
<P>
<B>(1015 ) </B>
<P>
	The leader of Yukon wants to proceed. I talk to him on a fairly 
regular basis. He really has an idea of where he wants to go. With 
the DIAND employees he wants to be fair. He is trying to befair with us, dealing with the federal government, even though 
we do not have the same political stripe. He is a very fair
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7023"> 7023 </A></B>
<P>
leader. Within three or four years this will be done and Yukon 
will fulfil its destiny.
<P>
	We hear so much about Yukon. We read so much about Yukon. 
We run Yukon from Ottawa. I do not think it is right and I do not 
think it is something that we want. This is one more building 
block to do exactly what the Prime Minister and the party said in 
its red book, to evolve Yukon and let it take its destiny into its 
own hands.
<P>
	The Government of Yukon, the First Nations of Yukon, the 
Chamber of Commerce in Yukon and the rest of them we are 
consulting with on a regular basis.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with 
pleasure that I rise on behalf of the Official Opposition to speak 
to Bill C-55, to establish a board having jurisdiction concerning 
disputes respecting surface rights in respect of land in the Yukon 
Territory and to amend other acts in relation thereto.
<P>
	This bill was introduced after two other pieces of legislation, 
namely the Yukon First Nations Self-Government Act and the 
Land Claims Settlement Act, were passed by this House last 
June.
<P>
	Before getting into my analysis of Bill C-55, I would like to 
describe these two acts to show how important they are and, 
because of its connection with these acts, how important it is 
that the bill before us this morning be passed, even if it means 
making appropriate amendments, which we will consider in 
committee.
<P>
	All bills concerning Yukon Indians arise from an extensive 
process started in Canada, and in Quebec, in particular, two 
decades ago, when the government of Quebec signed with the 
James Bay Cree an agreement that came to be known as the 
James Bay Agreement. This agreement resulted at the time from 
negotiations conducted in good faith. The Cree were happy, the 
government of Quebec was happy, Hydro-Québec was happy 
and the federal Parliament had assented to the enabling 
legislation for the James Bay Agreement.
<P>
	I want to make it quite clear that what is going on in the 
Yukon, as well as what happened in the Northwest Territories 
and is happening in several parts of Canada in terms of 
negotiations with native communities, is nothing new. It is not 
to be dreaded. We are not breaking new ground here. This is a 
process that was initiated a while back. Certain experience was 
gained, especially in Quebec, and I would think that it was a 
pleasant one in the case of Quebec.
<P>
	In June, we passed two acts concerning Yukon Indians. The 
first one was designed to provide certain guidelines regarding 
self-government. It is a self-administration agreement. Some 
areas of the Yukon have been inhabited from time immemorial 
by Native peoples. Over the years, these peoples have seen the 
south expand onto their lands. Mining companies came, trappers 
came and people from abroad came to the Yukon. The natives 
saw this happening and thought to themselves: ``These people 
are on our land''. I think that it was legitimate for them to want 
to be masters in their own house so to  speak. So, negotiations 
commenced and from these negotiations arose, among other 
things, an agreement respecting self-government for first 
nations. I think it is important to point this out.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	The first nations have their own personality, existence and 
cultural identity, and I think no one here questions the existence 
of an Aboriginal, Indian and Inuit identity in Canada, which is 
destined to grow and assert itself.
<P>
	The agreement on self-government would allow Aboriginal 
people to make decisions in a number of areas concerning them. 
They were given-I will go over this quickly as it is not 
necessarily the subject matter of the bill before us but I think it is 
important because it is related-some legislative powers, for 
example for local and private laws relating to social programs 
and services. It is very important for Native people to be able to 
set up social services meeting their needs.
<P>
	I read in this morning's newspapers that Mohawks in Quebec 
have been given responsibility for job training, which is one of 
Quebec's traditional demands. We in Quebec have always said 
that, as a people, we wanted to develop our own workforce, and 
we see in this morning's newspapers that the federal government 
will examine how it will be done and the objectives it is 
pursuing, at least in the case of Quebec's Native people. At the 
outset, however, we note that the federal government agreed that 
it is important for a nation, a people to control some aspects of 
its workforce and social programs.
<P>
	Mohawks in Quebec will have responsibilities in this area, 
similar to those given in the agreement on Yukon Indians. I say 
given because, if we look at what is happening with Canada's 
Native peoples, I think that in the last century and the first part 
of this one the federal government put itself in the position to 
give such responsibilities to the people. Even the Indian Act is 
very clear on this.
<P>
	The Yukon Aboriginal people were given some elements of 
self-government such as responsibility for social programs and 
citizen services and the power to impose fees and to collect 
certain taxes. In addition to all this, each first nation will have 
its own constitution and citizenship code. Each will be able to 
have authority in the administration of justice.
<P>
	You can see how all this was done: peoples with their own 
identity were given certain tools to ensure their autonomy. This 
House should be congratulated for having passed Bill C-34 last 
June. It is all very well to have some self-government, to have 
responsibilities, but you also need a territory on which to 
exercise those responsibilities and over the past 20 years, the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7024"> 7024 </A></B>
<P>
Yukon Indians, as the minister said, negotiated to reach a land 
claims agreement.
<P>
	This agreement was the subject of Bill C-33, which this 
House passed in June. It is a framework for 14 Yukon First 
Nations-the Yukon Indians are divided into 14 First Nations 
with a population of 8,000 or 9,000. The agreement provided for 
a certain division of lands. Yukon is a vast territory covering 
over 41,000 square kilometres. On some of the land, the native 
peoples were granted ownership of the surface and sub-surface, 
or should I say that their ownership was recognized.
<P>
	On other parts of the territory, they have only surface rights. 
This means that the jurisdiction they obtained in the 
self-government agreement can be exercised on certain 
territories.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	The land claims settlement gives the native peoples some 
other benefits; for example, Canada conceded $242 million in 
compensation divided among the 14 nations for a certain 
number of years. They also obtained rights to exploit the 
wildlife for purposes of subsistence within the territory. They 
obtained exclusive hunting rights within other territories.
<P>
	That law gave them a territory and clarified the question of 
surface and sub-surface rights. That is important because for 
many years Southerners like me thought that the North was a 
place where very little happened. There was snow and nothing 
else. We did not know that it was the homeland of native peoples 
who had been living there since time immemorial.
<P>
	But the North became topical, in Quebec and in the rest of 
Canada, when natural resource development attracted 
individuals and companies interested in oil or hydro-electricity. 
From that point on, it was necessary to define who was entitled 
to what territory and who could do what within it. I think that we 
are well on the way to determining that with the two laws on 
self-government and land claims.
<P>
	It is important in the Yukon, the Northwest Territories and 
everywhere in Canada to reach a sort of friendly agreement 
among the various population groups on how the land will be 
occupied. Groups which have their own identity must be able to 
maintain and affirm that identity without interfering with the 
activities or identity of other Canadian communities.
<P>
	Whether in Canada or in Quebec, and this is particularly true 
in the case of the aboriginal issue, I think everyone will agree 
that there is good will on both sides and that a satisfactory 
agreement for all concerned will be reached.
<P>
	I referred to agreements regarding self-government. I also 
said that Yukon first nations had obtained rights regarding the 
definition of territory. However, once certain rights are 
recognized, there may still be disputes and controversies. At 
some point, certain issues will have to be settled, whether these 
concern some corporations from the South interested in 
promoting northern development or Canadians wishing to do 
things in the Yukon. Someone will have to make decisions 
regarding  the rights of everyone concerned. As is always the 
case, laws and regulations are passed, but there has to be a court 
of law or an administrative tribunal to render decisions, 
otherwise things simply do not work.
<P>
	Let me give you an example. In recent weeks, the Committee 
on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development looked at what 
happened in Manitoba when Hydro Manitoba tried to build a 
number of dams to generate hydroelectric power on the 
Churchill and Nelson Rivers. The committee found that an 
agreement existed but had not been implemented. I hope to have 
the opportunity to provide more details to the House on this 
issue when we will look at Bill C-36, which deals with the Split 
Lake agreement, in northern Manitoba. The problem with 
hydroelectric development on the Churchill and Nelson rivers in 
northern Manitoba is that a rather vague agreement was reached 
but never implemented. The result is that, almost 20 years later, 
the issue has to go back before Parliament and new agreements 
must be reached so that the original one from 1977 can be 
implemented.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	As you can see, it is important, when establishing new 
definitions of territory and rights, to make it very clear that a 
body is also created to settle disputes.
<P>
	This is exactly what Bill C-55 does by establishing the Yukon 
Surface Rights Board. As its name indicates, the board will have 
jurisdiction over surface rights. In other words, it will be 
established to settle any discussion, dispute or argument 
individuals or corporations may have on this issue.
<P>
	The board members will be designated by the federal 
government. The bill provides for up to eleven members to be 
appointed, one half on the recommendation of the Yukon First 
Nations. I think this is very important, because the disputes the 
board will have to settle directly affect the Natives, the first 
people of the Yukon.
<P>
	So, I think it is important for the Yukon residents, as well as 
for the people of Canada and of Quebec, to know that, when such 
disputes will arise, there will be some members on this tribunal, 
which is not really tribunal, but a board authorized to arbitrate in 
this type of disputes, who will know what life is for Natives. 
This is important, because those who pass judgment on a justice 
issue or any other matter must understand the point of view of 
the various people from different backgrounds appearing before 
them.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7025"> 7025 </A></B>
<P>
	Fortunately, this bill provides for half of the board members 
to be appointed on the recommendation of the Native people. 
I would have expected nothing less but I would hope that the 
Yukon First Nations will recommend people from their own 
communities.
<P>
	However, one section of the bill says that board members do 
not necessarily have to come from Yukon. Does that mean that 
somebody from Montreal, Ottawa or Saskatoon, for example, 
could sit on this tribunal? It makes you wonder. Surely, there are 
in Canada people who are quite competent to rule on the issues 
that will be put before the Board. But I, for one, would prefer to 
see Yukon residents on this board, as they are in a position to 
make a judgment on the facts they are presented with in the 
light, again, of the cultural point of view of aboriginal people, of 
the first nations who will ask the board to make a decision.
<P>
	As I said, this bill essentially provides for the creation of the 
board and stipulates how it will be set up, how it will work. It 
defines its responsibilities, its jurisdiction and its funding. The 
federal government will take care of its funding.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	Maybe this issue will be discussed further in committee 
because, when we talk about costs these days in Canada, people 
become nervous. They have the impression that the 
government's main objective is to cut spending. But we know 
that, in reality, all the money that the government collects is 
used to provide adequate services to Canadians. After all, the 
important thing is to make the people happy, and not necessarily 
to make bankers, creditors and financiers happy. As politicians, 
we have to consider what is best for Canadians. But I am getting 
away from the issue here.
<P>
	When we study this bill in committee, some people may 
wonder how come the government is paying for this board. I 
think it is quite normal that the government should pay for this 
board, the same way it pays for the courts and for a number of 
other agencies which have to be financially independent to be 
able to exercise their jurisdiction. I do not think that it would 
serve the interests of Canada, Quebec or the Yukon first nations 
if the board established under Bill C-55 were ineffective 
because of inadequate funding.
<P>
	You certainly can infer from my remarks that my party 
supports the adoption of Bill C-55. Obviously, we will examine 
a number of its provisions more closely in committee. After all, 
it is a complex piece of legislation. In all these situations, the 
average Canadian who looks at the issue wants justice to be 
served. The average Canadian agrees that aboriginal people 
should get all the guarantees they need for their collective 
survival and development. The importance of that has been well 
understood in Quebec.
<P>
	The Quebec government did recognize the first nations in its 
jurisdiction through a motion passed by the National Assembly. 
There have also been new  developments since the election of 
the Parti Quebecois. Proposals have been made, and, despite 
radical positions by first nations in Quebec that may be more 
negotiating positions or posturing for the media that anything 
else, a new spirit has emerged. The Quebec government has 
made firm proposals, and there will be more.
<P>
	People in Quebec are open to the concept of making new 
proposals, and Canadians would also like to find a basis of 
agreement that would be acceptable to all peoples in Canada, 
whether it is the Quebec people, the Indian peoples or nations, or 
all other groups in Canada.
<P>
	The bill should be examined closely in committee so that 
Canadians can be sure that their federal Parliament did its 
homework and that the content of the act is reasonable. In 
matters such as self-government and land claims, it is all too 
easy to be destructive. Passion and prejudice can come into play, 
and there is always a risk of disinformation.
<P>
	Since I became a member of the Aboriginal Affairs 
Committee, I have a better understanding of the status of 
aboriginal nations in Canada, although like many Quebecers and 
Canadians, I was already very sympathetic and very receptive to 
certain aboriginal claims. Recommendations and requests 
submitted to the committee were linked with the very survival of 
these nations as such.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	As a Quebecer, I am on very familiar ground when people talk 
about self-government, nations, territory and rights, because in 
Quebec, ever since I became aware of the political situation, at 
least since the early sixties, that is the kind of language we have 
heard. It is a language I understand, and these positions are ones 
I have taken myself. I think it is important for nations to keep 
their identity, to survive and develop their potential.
<P>
	When a nation disappears, when a culture disappears and 
when an identity disappears, this weakens us all, because in 
today's world we must realize that uniformity and levelling 
differences are not the answer to our problems. The futur 
belongs to those who recognize the rights of others and that all 
nations, languages and cultures should be allowed to live and 
thrive.
<P>
	When we consider this kind of legislation and discuss it in the 
House and in committee, we should carefully examine what is at 
stake. Obviously, all committees, whether we are talking about 
the Committee on Human Resources or the Defence Committee, 
are expected to do a good job, but when we are talking about 
aboriginal issues in Canada, I think it is very important for 
parliamentarians to proceed carefully in order to make the right 
decisions and do a good job of informing the public.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7026"> 7026 </A></B>
<P>
	In fact, there are a lot of rumours and a lot of biased 
information going around. When I mentioned to my 
constituents that we had a land claim settlement agreement 
involving fourteen Yukon nations, they said: ``What is going 
on? Are you splitting up the country, are you giving Canada and 
part of our taxes to aboriginal nations?'' I told them: ``Of 
course not''.
<P>
	Then you explain the situation. There are aboriginal nations in 
Canada who have certain rights. There are territories, and these 
territories must be shared. We have to live together, so we have 
to decide how and this means negotiating agreements, which is 
what happened in the Yukon. An agreement was negotiated and 
will now be ratified by the Parliament of Canada. We had the 
same procedure for James Bay. Today, agreements are being 
negotiated in Northern Quebec and with other aboriginal nations 
in Quebec.
<P>
	In my region we have a Montagnais nation, the 
Lac-Saint-Jean Montagnais, who are negotiating a land claim 
settlement. Last year, they concluded an agreement with 
Hydro-Québec on payments in connection with power 
transmission. I think we are moving slowly toward a mutually 
acceptable way of life which will benefit all Canadians.
<P>
	However, I feel we should keep people informed so that they 
can understand fully what is going on, what our goals are and 
within what framework we are going to proceed. Otherwise, 
people harden their position and oppose everything. They then 
set conditions which virtually amount to outright rejection. And 
so I think it is important to establish a framework, as we are 
doing in Quebec, especially on the issue of border immutability. 
I believe my party, the Bloc Quebecois, said it quite clearly 
recently. The Parti Quebecois also said it. The issue of 
negotiations with the native people is open, but when it comes to 
Quebec's territory and the future of its borders, that is not 
negotiable.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	I trust that, just as an agreement has been reached with the 
native people regarding the Yukon, Nunavut and other regions of 
Canada, Quebecers will reach agreements with native peoples in 
Quebec, because we share a territory. Quebecers have lived 
there for over 350 years. Personally, my ancestors came to 
Canada in 1636. I do not come from France or anywhere else. I 
come from Quebec. I cannot imagine that I could live anywhere 
else or that I could not live on this land, which is mine.
<P>
	I consider Quebec as my homeland, but I know perfectly well 
that some people in Quebec consider parts of that territory to be 
their own. Since we are together and we must live together, we 
must negotiate and come to an agreement.
<P>
	I have every confidence that, throughout Canada we will 
reach agreements similar to the one that came about in Yukon. 
We will do the same thing in Quebec and we will finally find 
common ground. But in order to do so,  we must express clear 
objectives and the agreements must be examined closely, and 
everything must be explained thoroughly. That is why we will 
study the bill carefully in committee. Many questions come to 
my mind and I certainly do not want to debate in this House 
topics that will be discussed in committee. We will want to 
clarify a few points; for example, we will want to know why one 
clause specifies that, if board members were in a major conflict 
of interest situation, they could not vote on a given issue. I feel 
that when you are in a conflict of interest, you should not rule on 
any matter whatsoever.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois still supports the substance of this bill, 
because it will create an organization which will resolve or 
alleviate problems in the implementation of agreements that 
were reached on self-government and land claims. I think that it 
is important to create an organization which will be able to 
operate in the best interest of everyone.
<P>
	That is what we will be examining in committee. We will ask 
some questions. From what I can see, first of all, we will 
possibly move some amendments so that the board can function 
in the best way possible. We do not want to use opposition to the 
bill, or to some of its clauses, as an excuse to indirectly cause the 
failure of the agreements that were reached in the Yukon. These 
agreements must be implemented. That is absolutely necessary. 
We do not have the right to disappoint some people, the Indian 
nations, to disappoint the people of Yukon who were expecting 
these agreements.
<P>
	Let us keep in mind what happened on the Nelson and 
Churchill Rivers in Manitoba. I think that situations such as the 
ones that happened there should not occur elsewhere. That is 
why there must be some organizations that are able to rule on the 
implementation of agreements. And the bill before us is aimed 
at defining an organization such as these.
<P>
	Rest assured that the Bloc Quebecois will do everything that 
is possible and imaginable to make that organization as 
functional as possible, as efficient as possible, so that the 
agreements that were reached in good faith between the 
government of Canada, the government of Yukon and the 
nations of Yukon are implemented to the benefit of the people of 
Yukon, of the nations of Yukon, of the people of Canada and of 
the people of Quebec.

<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to begin second reading debate on Bill 
C-55 on behalf of the Reform Party. It is important to recognize 
the importance of the mining industry to Yukon. It is a major, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7027"> 7027 </A></B>
<P>
non-government industry in a jurisdiction that is more than 70 
per cent dependent on federal government spending.
<P>
	In some ways one could look on debate of Bill C-55 as the 
end, the resolution, and the confirmation of the principles 
contained in Bill C-33 and Bill C-34.
<P>
	The mining industry has a current campaigned called ``Keep 
Mining in Canada''. Governments have tended to take the 
industry for granted in many jurisdictions where it has made 
operations very difficult, expensive, time consuming and 
uncertain. Also we have a Canadian tax regime that can be 
considered unfriendly in international terms.
<P>
	Within my riding there are several operating mines. The BHP 
Utah mine, the Westmin mine, Texada mines and Quinsum Coal. 
Quinsum Coal has 25 employees who previously worked at the 
Westray mine in Nova Scotia. We all know Westray is where 
they had the disaster. These people feel very abused by actions 
of government.
<P>
	I understand, accept and realize that there is pent up 
investment in the Yukon waiting for the uncertainty of Bills 
C-33, C-34 and C-55 to be over and done with so that 
investment can take place. This is a situation where the 
bureaucracy knows best.
<P>
	In Whitehorse, to my surprise, the Department of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development vehicles say Indian and 
Northern Affairs Canada. There is a tendency within the 
bureaucracy toward the native affairs side rather than the 
northern development side. The focus is changing from one of 
servicing mining industry needs to other priorities. I see this 
symbolized. The rationale is that it translates better into the 
French. I do not view that as reason enough. I have viewed this 
in a previous life in Parks Canada where I always had an 
understanding that Canadian parks were set up for Canadian 
taxpayers to enjoy a park like setting.
<P>
	Within the parks service, the group primarily oriented to 
servicing the public was the park warden service. What we 
viewed within the bureaucracy was competition between the 
park wardens and the naturalists. The naturalists have won those 
competing agendas. If we want to progress within that 
bureaucracy our opportunities are much higher if we come from 
the naturalists side. That has now impacted on the mission 
statements of Parks Canada in many ways.
<P>
	This has been foisted on the Canadian public without their full 
knowledge. One could ask the question: Why does the Minister 
of Natural Resources have the mandate for the Metis in Canada 
and the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development 
have the mandate for mining north of 60 degrees, in other words, 
the territories. The north is already suffering because it is the 
playground of the federal government and the federal 
bureaucracy. I recommend that we do not reinforce this by 
making it one minister's playground.

<P>
	Yukon has only 28,000 people. I am sure they will make bad 
rules work. I understand last year the Yukon economy dropped 
by 19 per cent due to the closure of one major operating mine, 
the Faro mine. I also  understand that the economy of the 
Northwest Territories shrank.
<P>
	Bill C-55 is meant to fulfil commitments to implement the 
constitutionally protected final land claim settlement agreement 
known as Bill C-33. Bill C-55 may confirm the principles 
contained in Bills C-33 and C-34 but it in no way ends disputes 
or in itself resolves conflicts that may arise.
<P>
	Mechanisms or boards put in place are only as good or as 
confident or as well intentioned as the people we place on these 
boards. We have only just begun.
<P>
	Since Parliament began in January 1994 we have concluded 
massive land claim settlements for the Sahtu, Dene and Metis to 
the tune of $197 million. We have concluded the Yukon 
settlement for which we are here today to the tune of $163 
million.
<P>
	This is not the total dollar amount. The implementation costs 
will run another $263 million for these claims for a total of $596 
million, according to the public accounts released this week. 
According to these same public accounts, there are contingent 
liabilities of $8.3 billion in claims in pending and threatened 
litigation.
<P>
	Despite the finance minister's declaration that we are in hawk 
up to our eyeballs, the government continues to ignore the 
perilous fiscal situation we have created and continue to sustain 
in land claim settlements.
<P>
	In addition to the $8.3 billion I just mentioned, there are 
another 460 specific native claims and lawsuits that currently 
have no dollar figure and currently do not form part of the 
known liabilities.
<P>
	Frankly no one knows what the total amount may be. That is 
the frightening part. If the Minister of Finance is that concerned 
with the fiscal situation he might want to start a review of the 
policy and settlement mandate the minister of-

about time that Bloc members recognize and give credit to 
efforts made by both levels of government and concerned 
Quebecers to find a new vocation for the Collège militaire royal 
de Saint-Jean.
<P>
	On July 19, both governments reached an agreement under 
which the federal government will provide $25 million over five 
years to set up a university study centre. Starting September 
1995, Quebec will be in charge of the centre's operations. 
Everyone agrees that this plan will boost the local economy.
<P>
	Moreover, a working group made up of representatives from 
the business world, labour, financial institutions, and 
socio-economic agencies came on board in early September 
with a view to drawing up an action plan concerning labour 
re-training and the economic diversification of surrounding 
communities.

House that Breast Cancer Week is coming to an end. I hope that, 
this week, all stakeholders in the political and scientific 
community have had the opportunity to stop and reflect on the 
importance of research and of funding support groups as a way 
to find a cure for this disease, which affects an increasing 
number of women.
<P>
	Such reflection is important because, notwithstanding lofty 
statements in support of medical research in this area, several 
women's groups are questioning the health minister's sincerity. 
For example, the federal government is going to sink $12 
million in a forum on health which is bound to fail, while 
research on breast cancer needs additional money to be able to 
make important inroads.

Canadian Alliance of British Pensioners in their fight to get their 
United Kingdom pensions indexed here in Canada. These 
British pensions are already indexed in the United Kingdom, the 
United States and Europe.
<P>
	Were these pensions indexed to today's levels, Canadian 
taxpayers would be relieved of some of their responsibility to 
support many of these people who may receive as little as $10 a 
week after a lifetime of mandatory contributions.
<P>
	Many British pensioners living in Canada today were our 
allies or support personnel during the second world war but 
today find themselves in poverty despite their own best efforts 
because of worldwide inflation which has eaten away at the 
value of their retirement income.

Speaker, almost a year after the election of a Liberal 
government, the economic recovery is well under way and 
Canadians are regaining their confidence. This recovery is being 
acknowledged by consumers. According to a recent report from 
Statistics Canada, consumption this year had gone up almost 10 
per cent. More than 240,000 new jobs have been created over the 
last year, 60,000 of them in Quebec. Exports are on the rise, and 
so are company profits.
<P>
	Confidence is spreading to the whole country, and this is 
proof that the Liberal government has fulfilled its electoral 
promises. I urge my colleagues in government and in opposition 
to co-ordinate their efforts to continue giving Canadians equity, 
expertise and leadership.

<P>
	The four main regulations for the enforcement of the act have 
been amended to make them stronger than the versions released 
by the previous government.
<P>
	The minister also announced that three amendments would be 
submitted to the House in order to improve some important 
provisions of the legislation. First, we will confirm the principle 
of financial help to groups wishing to be heard by the assessment 
boards.
<P>
	Second, board recommendations will have to be submitted to 
Cabinet. However, should Cabinet decide not to follow the 
recommendations, it will now have to answer to the people and 
explain its reasons.

maintaining such a requirement, given that the department is

	<B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
October 19 the Minister of Natural Resources in the House 
assured hon. members that her government anticipates a 
reasonable and fair rate of return on Canada's investment in 
Hibernia. However, in a letter from Ken Hull, president of the 
Hibernia Management and Development Company, dated June 
1994, he said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Sufficient revenues will be generated to cover all gross capital and operating 
costs, but no return on investment.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Even this statement is suspect. If one cares to do some simple 
arithmetic on the project simply take $16 billion, which is the 
total cost of the project, divide it by 615 million barrels of 
recoverable reserves and one gets a figure of $20.75 per barrel. 
With today's oil priced at $17.55 per barrel, it is not only 
difficult to see any return on investment, it is difficult to see how 
the project will cover capital costs.

which is celebrating its 70th anniversary in community service.
<P>
	The Women's Institutes of Canada was founded as an 
educational organization based on principles of sound nutrition, 
safe food, health and fitness and the right of women to have 
access of up to date information on issues that affect themselves 
and their families.
<P>
	There are over 16,000 members in Ontario alone. The 
organization has been instrumental in accomplishing a number 
of improvements in our way of life.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, did you know that it was women's institutes that 
fought for the pasteurization of milk, signs at railroad crossings, 
buses stopping at railroad crossings, clear marking of poison on 
containers and the painting of white lines on our highways for 
safety? These are just some of the things that we take for granted

part of his employment contract a $400,000 performance bonus, 
but he gave it back.
<P>
	Algoma Steel is still struggling and the workers who own 60 
per cent of the common stock have their wages frozen. Mr. 
Hopkins realized that taking the bonus would have eroded the 
team spirit he was trying to build. In his own words: ``The basic 
thing is trust. Once you establish a base of trust you can do a lot 
of things''.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday, when the Deputy Prime Minister was questioned in 
the House, she merely drew our attention to the fact that 
espionage activities in Canada were subject to Canadian laws. 
At no time was she able to confirm who was in control of the 
Communications Security Establishment in Canada. I may 
recall that the RCMP officers who planted bombs and stole Parti  
Quebecois membership lists were subject to Canadian laws.
<P>
	Could the Prime Minister confirm that no government 
democratically elected in Canada, no political party, including 
the sovereignist movement in Quebec, was spied on by foreign 
intelligence services, at the request of the Government of 
Canada?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, all security services in Canada, which are necessary in 
any democracy, abide by the rules set by the Parliament of 
Canada.
<P>
	Personally, I can confirm that I never asked them to spy on 
any party or politician in Canada. I am a democrat, and I do my 
fighting out in the open. As for the opposition parties, there are 
not that many problems, and I do not need spies. I will go into 
battle with weapons everyone can see. And we are going to win!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, you will 
notice that the Prime Minister refused to confirm or deny that 
the Government of Canada might have asked foreign 
governments to spy on political parties in Canada or on 
democratically elected governments. He simply said he did not 
do so himself. That is not very reassuring.
<P>
	Yesterday, the Deputy Prime Minister said in this House, and I 
quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>[-] that the activities of the CSE are totally subject to Canadian laws, 
including the Criminal Code, the Canadian Human Rights Act, the Privacy Act 
and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and they obey the law.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is what she said, and I want to ask the Prime Minister 
whether he could explain how his Deputy Minister could be so 
positive about what she said, when it is clear the CSE is 
controlled by no one and is accountable to no one?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the line of authority is well known. The Minister of 
National Defence is responsible for this agency, and if there are 
any particular problems, the Minister of National Defence can 
bring the matter to the attention of the Prime Minister. That is 
the line of authority.

<P>
	When all is said and done, the ultimate responsibility for this 
government always lies with the Prime Minister. What the 
minister was saying yesterday is that we ask all these agencies 
to abide by the law. There is no country that is more democratic 
than Canada. You are here to prove it. This is the only country 
where the Leader of the Opposition and his party want to 
destroy the country in which they live. This does not exist in 
any other democracy.
<P>
	I can stand here and say without any hesitation that Canada is 
the most democratic country in the world. I ask all federal 
agencies to obey the law. Canada will continue to be the greatest 
democratic country in the world, the only country that allows the 
Leader of the Opposition to be someone who wants to destroy 
the country when his duty would normally be to serve that 
country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I simply 
want to remind the Prime Minister there was an election 
campaign, the stakes were clear and we are the result of that 
campaign. But that is not the point.
<P>
	The point is this: How can the Prime Minister expect his 
evasive answers on this issue to reassure Quebecers, when we 
know perfectly well that all illegal activities by the RCMP in 
Quebec, including stealing the Parti Quebecois membership 
lists, were subject to federal laws and took place under a Liberal 
government, of which he was a member?

Such tragic events are a reminder of the urgent need to institute 
better control of firearms in Canada. An undertaking to this 
effect in the red book was reiterated by the Prime Minister at the 
Liberal Convention last May.
<P>

bill?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is 
quite right in saying that the tragic and troubling  events in 
Toronto yesterday merely serve to remind us of the importance 
and the urgency of this challenge. Far from holding back 
proposals in this regard, the Department of Justice is busy 
preparing them in detail.
<P>
	I returned this week from a trip to Alberta and the Northwest 
Territories; before that to British Columbia and Yukon; before 
that to the maritimes and Quebec; and before that to Ontario and 
the central part of the country. Everywhere I have gone I have 
spoken with interested groups, putting together a package of 
proposals that will be introduced in the House in the near future 
which will deal not only with illegal firearms but also with the 
criminal penalties for the misuse of firearms, and which will add 
further sensible and needed regulation to the control of firearms 
in private ownership. That is our proposal.

smallest legislative measure seems to have become inexplicably 
complex. Everything is used as a pretext to justify the 
government's failure to act. This is an urgent matter. Seven 
people nearly lost their lives yesterday.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Justice admit that the delays in tabling his

<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney

discuss every aspect of the issue to make sure we get it right.
<P>
	There are varying points of view. We are not embarrassed by 
it; we are proud of it. It reflects the diverse nature of the 
population. In caucus, in cabinet, we will discuss every aspect of

thought out and for which we have prepared the country through

inces that have the constitutional responsibility in this area are 
not very much involved.

	It is clear to us that the Prime Minister is using this forum to 
avoid addressing the problems of the health care system rather 
than addressing them.
<P>
	I ask the Prime Minister: Is there not one concrete action that 
he can propose today to demonstrate his government's 
commitment to really reforming the health care system?
<P>
<B>(1125 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we launched a forum yesterday and we invited experts 
from many fields to advise us on it. In discussions with them we 
said they have up to four years and that everyone serving on the 
commission should do it voluntarily. None of them will be paid.
<P>
	I told them that I would like to receive reports as soon as they 
cover one element so that we can act. The health care system that 
we have in Canada is a very good system but it is getting very 
expensive. We want to make sure that we maintain universal free 
medicare for all Canadians.
<P>
	We have to do that in consultation with the provinces. It is 
what the Minister of Health is doing. I wanted to have people 
who are not representing the self-interest groups within the 
system to look into that. That is exactly what they will be doing.
<P>
	They will report every six months or so, whenever they are 
ready. They will make some concrete suggestions that will help 
us to maintain free medicare for all Canadians, not a good 
system for the rich and a bad one for the poor like the Reform 
Party would like to do.
<P>

have access to hospitals free because they are citizens of 
Canada.
<P>

<P>
	Then there is the finance minister who talks and talks and 
consults and consults and shows charts and charts. He admits 
that the additional spending cuts are urgently required but he 
continues to defer action.
<P>
	I ask the finance minister: Is there not one major new 
spending reduction that he could put forward today to 
demonstrate to the Canadian people his seriousness about 
reducing the deficit?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I fail to 
understand the

do want to have some input into the budget making process.
<P>

want to join into what is really a-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> He is not the opposition.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (LaSalle-Émard):</B> That is right. We could cut 
the opposition's research budget.
<P>
	We are engaged in a unique experiment in Canadian economic 
history and that is opening up the budget process, getting rid of 
budget secrecy. Why is it that the Reform Party seems to think 
that only within its narrow executive is the repository of all good 
thinking? I do not understand.
<P>
	We in the Liberal Party believe in the common sense of 
Canadians and we are going to tap into it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, no concrete action.
<P>
	Then there is the Solicitor General who has a lot of problems 
he could be fixing. CSIS and the Communications Security 
Establishment, two agencies that are virtually unaccountable, 
have been accused of basic violations of human rights.
<P>
	When the Solicitor General is asked about these matters there 
is the standard routine: ``This is a serious matter'', blah, blah, 
blah. ``We are investigating'', blah, blah, blah. ``I cannot 
comment any more'', blah, blah, blah''.
<P>
	If his only response is that, he should not bother to get up, but 
can the Solicitor General tell us one concrete change that he has 
actually made to improve the accountability of CSIS and the 
Communications Security Establishment?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Usually when we start on a line of questioning, 
the supplementaries are in the same area. I am going to permit 
the question today, but I would ask all hon. members to please in 
their supplementaries try to tie them to the first question posed.

doing their work.

	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The Prime Minister said yesterday in the opening speech of 
the Canadian Forum on Health, and I quote: ``Unless we take a 
broad view of health, we will not succeed in reducing costs''.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister make such a statement, when 
those with health-care planning expertise and responsibility, 
that is, the provinces, were not invited to participate fully in the 
discussions at the Forum on Health?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I find this very funny because it is a panel of experts. 
The provinces said that they wanted to be there. So the Minister 
of Health told them, ``Fine. How many members do you want on 
the panel?'' They said, ``Five''. So we said, ``Fine''.
<P>
	They then decided that was not what they wanted; they wanted 
to co-chair with the Prime Minister. Unfortunately, there are not 
two Prime Ministers of Canada, there is only one.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice, Lib.):</B> Yes, and he is there for 
a long time, too. No problem.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice, Lib.):</B> Then I thought that I 
should be a nice guy and that if a premier wanted to come or if 
they all wanted to attend these meetings, they would all be 
welcome. After arguing all summer about their attending the 
forum, despite very generous offers, they decided not to come. 
So we went right back to square one. But we listened to them and 
they understood in the end that these experts will make 
recommendations that will apply not only to us but also to them. 
It is their mandate.
<P>
	Every day, decisions are made by health ministers, and the 
conference of federal and provincial health ministers will 
continue. Nothing has changed in that regard. We can work 
together but, to find a long-term solution, a review such as this 
one was needed. We in Canada cannot afford to lose our health 
insurance system because we did not take the time to plan for the 
future.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we recognize the Prime Minister's commendable 
efforts but since he claims that this is not a decision making 
forum and that the real decisions will be made at health 
ministers' conferences, why does he stubbornly insist on 
wasting $12 million taken directly from the pockets of Canadian 
taxpayers?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the health forum is a very useful exercise. We  have to 
look at the problem of health care in Canada. It is now costing 
about 10 per cent of the GDP, the highest after the United States. 
We have to look at the problem because if we do not we will be 
facing some very difficult choices.
<P>
	We have asked some experts to look at the medium and long 
term problems of the national health care system. They are 
doing just that. I can guarantee that this forum is a very good 
investment to guarantee that eventually we will keep a health 
care system in Canada that is free. There will not be one for the 
rich and one for the poor, but a system that gives the same rights 
and opportunities and the same guarantees to all citizens of 
Canada.

lead to lower interest rates, more investment, higher

<P>
	This week a group of economists gathered in this building to 
present their views on the finance minister's budget initiative. A

not good enough. There is a high probability that by then the 
economy will enter the next recession. Deficits and the debt to

GDP ratio will rise again, just like they did for other

and issue a plan for time specific spending cuts that will 
eliminate the deficit during the present economic prosperity?

very clear that we are prepared to deal with time specific 
spending cuts. In fact that is very clearly what we did in the last 
budget. It is the specific reason for the 3 per cent target.
<P>
	In an initial conversation with the Prime Minister as to what 
tactic ought to be used it was pointed out to me-and I must say 
thank God I can now raise this-that where the Tories went 
wrong was in setting out medium term targets and not hitting 
them. It is absolutely important that government set out and hit 
short term targets and that is exactly what we are going to do.

question is for the Minister of Indian Affairs.
<P>
	Today's newspapers report an agreement between the federal 
government and the Kahnawake Mohawks on the labour force 
training program. Under this agreement, the federal government 
would entrust the Mohawks with these responsibilities, for a 
more efficient allocation of these programs' financial resources.
<P>
	Can the Minister of Indian Affairs tell us if the agreement in 
question provides for the transfer to the Mohawk community of 
all federal powers for employment and labour training 
programs?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, no, it does not. This is one 
of several agreements that have been negotiated over the last 
three or four years with various Indian bands across Canada 
whereby we simply transfer planning responsibility for human 
resources training programs that apply particularly to aboriginal 
people. The terms and conditions of those programs must be 
maintained. We do try to work out a partnership with the Indian 
bands so that they can have a real responsibility for determining 
what the priorities are.
<P>
	It is very much within the spirit of the proposals we made in 
the green book on social reform that we want to establish a much 
broader range of co-operative arrangements and to decentralize 
many of the program responsibilities to various community 
organizations, provinces and others. In that way there can be a 
much more grassroots level of development and decision 
making for the important training initiatives we sponsor.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, since the 
government seems to be finally realizing the obvious fact that 
manpower training programs are better administered by 
authorities who are more sensitive to people's real needs, can he 
tell us why these same principles were not followed by the 
federal government in answering the consensus in Quebec, 
which calls for Quebec to take back control of the whole labour 
field?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is. As the hon. member 
would know if he had read the green book, last June we tabled a 
series of propositions to all provinces that include substantial 
transfer of responsibilities to provincial governments.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The federal government is proposing to the provinces that 
they take over the majority of labour market programs. There is 
$500 million earmarked for Quebec for example, to manage the 
purchase of courses in training institutes-another $140 million 
for Quebec-to manage and establish ``one-stop'' information 
centres and manage other manpower programs bringing in $12 
million to the province.
<P>
	I hope, therefore, that the members from the Bloc Quebecois 
will ask their partners in Quebec for a response to a new

leaning on the commissions. We are not prepared to do that

Code that make the mutilation of children illegal are enforced.

that factual question today. However I will be happy to inquire 
and let the hon. member know when I am certain of the facts.
<P>
	Speaking to her point more generally I can say that in the 
spring when this matter was raised in the House I undertook to 
take several weeks to inform myself and respond to the 
suggestion that we need a separate provision in the Criminal 
Code to forbid this deplorable practice. I made those inquiries, 
including conversations with colleagues and other ministries 
that share the responsibility, particularly with provincial and 
territorial attorneys general. After doing that I concluded and 
informed the House that the better view is there are provisions in 
the code at present which already make it clear that this is 
criminal conduct. I said at the time that  what we need is not only 
vigilant enforcement of those Criminal Code provisions but also 
a program of information to educate immigrants and others that 
this is impermissible and will be prosecuted.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	We are continuing to monitor that. In fact, as recently as last 
week I asked to be briefed with respect to the present state of the 
practices in Canada with respect to education and enforcement.
<P>
	I assure the hon. member, if I may conclude, and I will just 
take a moment to say it, that if the practice is continuing 
notwithstanding the efforts on education and enforcement of the 
present provisions, I do not rule out a separate section of the 
code if I believe it is necessary to bring this deplorable practice 
to an end.

he is merely repeating the answer he gave back on April 12, and I 
quote: ``The focus of the federal government at this time should 
be on education in partnership with the provinces and 
community groups''. He says he is monitoring, waiting, making 
inquiries. These are all fine words.
<P>
	However, what I would like to know is: when does the 
minister plan to act on this issue, to take positive steps and, 
above all, to table a plan of action in this respect? In spite of the 
fact that the minister has to collect all this information, action is 
required immediately and urgently, and we need to know what 
his immediate plans are in this area, notwithstanding the

that I share the hon. member's concern and sense of urgency, but 
I want to emphasize that it is not a situation in which nothing is 
being done.
<P>
	The issue gained prominence in the spring primarily by virtue 
of the report by Dr. Glenda Simms and the national committee 
which she chairs. When I inquired about it, I found that the 
provincial attorneys general in the provinces where this practice 
is an issue are hard at work with task forces, with police and 
enforcement efforts and they continue.

<P>
	It is not the government's policy nor that of the armed forces 
of Canada to pick sides in this conflict. We are there under the 
auspices of the United Nations to help with humanitarian aid to 
give the peace process a real chance. It is easy to assume that one 
particular side is guilty of an attack or another. Quite frankly 
sometimes we are not sure whom to believe in these cases.
<P>
	It is better for us to concentrate our efforts to try to protect our 
soldiers the best way possible, and where we do know that an 
attack has come from one side or another, make a protest 
through the United Nations.

Manitoba to discuss in particular the issues of how we can help 
refinance higher education, put more money back into the 
system and give  students much broader support for the 
continuation of their education.
<P>
	The response of the students as well as of most Canadians is to 
engage in a very active debate. Canadians really are ready for a 
change. They recognize the status quo does not really exist and 
that we have to reform structures. I would encourage all

	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and

minister responsible for co-operatives, I wish to recognize 
National Co-op Week in Canada and to pay tribute to these 
unique, democratic institutions and organizations that play such 
a significant role in the socioeconomic fabric of Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7040"> 7040 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Furthermore October 20 is recognized worldwide as 
International Credit Union Day.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Prime Minister in his co-op week message mentioned 
that co-operatives strengthen the community and the country as 
a whole. This is nowhere more true than in the 900 communities 
in which credit unions or caisse populaires are the only financial 
institutions providing service. In northern Canada, after 
government institutions, co-operatives are the largest 
employers.
<P>
	On the national scene, roughly 40 per cent of Canadians are 
co-op members. In the province of Quebec as in my own 
province of Saskatchewan some two-thirds of the population 
belong to a co-operative of one form or another. All together the 
10,000 Canadian co-ops provide employment for 133,000 
Canadians and represent total assets of $134 billion.
<P>
	This year is of particular significance to co-operatives around 
the world because it represents the 150th anniversary of the 
formation of the first consumer's co-op in Rochdale, England.
<P>
	As Minister of Agriculture and Agri-food, I recognize the 
important role that co-ops play in the agri-food industry. It has 
been estimated that co-operatives account for 48 per cent of the 
market share for poultry, 60 per cent of the market share for 
milk, and 70 per cent for grains.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	To conclude, I want to congratulate the Canadian 
co-operative movement on its achievements and I urge this 
House to pay tribute to co-operative organizations during 
National Credit Union Week.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is a great pleasure for me to speak on National 
Co-op Week.
<P>
	As an anecdote, I could mention that all primary schools in 
Quebec have a school savings bank and I remember that one of 
the first things I did as an organizer was to look after the savings 
bank in our school. For that reason, I am especially pleased to 
speak on this statement.
<P>
	As the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, who seems to 
have held a similar position, said, the importance of 
co-operatives throughout Canada is evident. In view of the size 
of the co-op movement in Quebec's economy and the place it 
has held in Quebecers' recent history, let me point out the work 
this movement does and its special contribution to our society.
<P>
	Co-ops played and still play a vital role in Quebec's economic 
development. Voluntary membership, democratic organization, 
training of members, redistribution of surpluses in the 
community and limits on return on capital are all principles that 
square with  Quebecers' thinking and explain the development 
of this movement in Quebec. Furthermore, co-ops are part of the 
lives of Quebecers from primary school until they die-there are 
even funeral co-operatives.
<P>
	Whether we talk about financial, farm, housing, consumer, 
labour or any other kind of co-op, the co-operative movement is 
healthy and continues to grow in Quebec. Moreover, a new 
generation of co-op members is assured with the rise of co-ops 
in the student community through ``interco-operation'', 
twinning co-ops from different fields of activity; the Société de 
développement coopératif in particular promotes this.
<P>
	The Desjardins movement is, of course, the pride of Quebec's 
co-op community. Stretching across Canada and involved in 
international co-operation projects in many other countries, the 
Desjardins group manages total assets estimated at over $75 
billion. Quebec's co-op movement comprises over 3,300 
co-ops with more than 5.9 million members and in excess of 
60,000 employees. A major success story.
<P>
	The vigour of the co-op movement in Quebec is due to the 
strong feeling of solidarity among Quebecers. We have always 
stuck together to ensure our own growth, often under difficult 
conditions. This solidarity will soon bring Quebecers to 
sovereignty, which must be based on economic sovereignty. The 
Desjardins movement, among others, has played a significant 
role in this by giving us confidence in one another.
<P>
	In closing, I wish to thank and congratulate all co-operators 
in Quebec and Canada for their volunteer work, without which 
the co-op movement would not be what it is today.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is my honour to rise on behalf of the Reform Party to 
recognize and pay tribute to the co-operative movement in 
Canada.
<P>
	I take this opportunity to congratulate and compliment the 
pioneers in the co-operative movement for having the vision 
and the dedication to fashion their dreams into reality.
<P>
	The co-operative and credit union movement has had a very 
positive effect on this nation. Co-Op Vegetable Oils Limited of 
Altona, Manitoba, is one of the many examples of where a co-op 
has been a leader in its field. Not only did it help develop a 
vegetable cooking oil but it was also instrumental in 
encouraging and developing trade between the United States and 
Canada.
<P>
	Co-ops and credit unions must be congratulated for being 
present to help communities develop and improve themselves. 
They must also be recognized as a player in our economy that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7041"> 7041 </A></B>
<P>
provided competition and has given people another choice, 
something that makes a democracy work very well.
<P>
	It is with gratitude that on behalf of the Reform Party I 
acknowledge the accomplishments of co-ops and credit unions. 
We wish them well in future endeavours and encourage them to 
continue their innovative example of leadership.

outstanding land claims, but there is no argument. The Reform 
Party supports an early and mutually satisfactory conclusion of 
outstanding land claim negotiations. Our argument and our 
opposition is because of a lack of any recognition of the cost of 
concluding these deals. The federal negotiators are exhibiting a 
blank cheque mentality. This is not only wrong; it is 
irresponsible. Here we are being asked to endorse this mentality.
<P>
	We have heard today how the minister does not think he can 
order the royal commission to table its report on aboriginal 
peoples. The government has written additional cheques to keep 
this royal commission alive. Surely those who write the cheques 
have as strong a mandate as those on the royal commission who 
want to keep it alive.
<P>
	Bill C-55 gives impetus to Bills C-33 and C-34, including the 
area of financial compensation. As well, Bill C-55 will create a 
process to resolve disputes between parties guaranteeing rights 
of access to private lands. It will also create the Yukon surface 
rights board which will implement the process of dispute 
resolution and allow orders of the board to be enforceable in 
court. Bill C-55 will also confirm that the legal rights of minors 
are unchanged.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	I recognize that the bill is the normal progression of what was 
introduced and debated last spring. While House procedure and 
standing orders preclude me from raising the contents of Bills 
C-33 and C-34, it does not disallow me from reinforcing 
Reform Party opposition and concern over the manner in which 
we conclude agreements of this magnitude. It is too bad the
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7043"> 7043 </A></B>
<P>
government did not choose to consult as extensively on Bills 
C-33 and C-34 as it appears to have done in this enabling 
legislation contained in Bill C-55.
<P>
	Business, particularly the very important mining sector in 
Yukon, was not given the same opportunity to participate in the 
deliberations leading up to the introduction of the Yukon final 
land claim. While drafts of Bill C-55 were circulated to the 
mining community and groups representing them, at no time 
was the same courtesy extended on Bills C-33 and C-34.
<P>
	I have had individuals in Yukon tell me they were caught 
unaware of the previous provisions of the federal government 
Council of Yukon Indians agreement that they are paid to know 
about until it was signed.
<P>
	In view of some of those preliminary comments it behoves me 
to turn to some concerns the Reform Party has with Bill C-55. 
Let me assure the House that my party's contribution to the 
debate will not be obstructionist. However I would be remiss if I 
did not offer some constructive criticism of some clauses of Bill 
C-55 and my colleagues will add other comments.
<P>
	Part I of the bill establishes a process to resolve disputes 
between parties concerning surface rights and access to 
subsurface rights. More specifically clause 8 establishes a board 
to be called the Yukon surface rights board consisting of a 
chairperson and not less than two or more than ten other 
members to be appointed by the Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development. Half the members other than the 
chairperson should be appointed on the nomination of the 
Council of Yukon Indians.
<P>
	Part I is really the essence of the bill. Part I and the manner 
and type of appointments that are made will make or break the 
credibility of the board and hence the bill. The minister has 
enormous power in the appointment of members. While five 
members are to be nominated as potential candidates to the 
board by the Council of Yukon Indians the minister is 
omnipotent. With this power can come the tendency to politicize 
the board.
<P>
	The greatest fear industry has in Yukon is that the minister 
will be tempted to place some good old Liberals on the board to 
ensure things go the right way or his way. I implore the minister 
to exercise a non-partisan approach in his decision making on 
board appointments.
<P>
	I have some concerns that I expressed earlier in the House. I 
give the example of Michel Robert who was the Liberal 
appointed this spring with a non-tendered $249,000 contract to 
negotiate at Oka for the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development. Mr. Robert is also the appointee to SIRC, the 
so-called watchdog for CSIS.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	The board will decide which dispute can be brought before it 
only after the parties attempt to resolve the issues themselves. It 
is contingent on the success of this clause that board members 
exercise good judgment and possess a real sense of 
responsibility.
<P>
	Otherwise we could have obvious favouritism on spurious or 
vexatious issues brought before the board that will consume not 
only valuable time but valuable resources in the form of per 
diems that will be paid board members, in the case of the 
chairperson $300 per day and $250 per day for members.
<P>
	This could become costly if we have board members or a chair 
who is looking for something to do. In short, the board cannot 
become a hotbed for patronage appointments. Before we know it 
we could have Joe Clark appointed to another chairmanship.
<P>
	At our departmental briefing, Reform Party MPs were told 
that no staff shall be appointed to the board. Clause 19 of Bill 
C-55 clearly allows the board to employ such officers and 
employees and engage the services of such agents, advisers, and 
consultants as are necessary for the proper conduct of its 
business and may fix the terms and conditions of their 
employment or engagement and pay their remuneration.
<P>
	What we were told in our briefing runs contrary to not only 
clause 19 from which I just quoted but also clauses 20 and 21 
which grab further latitude for the board to acquire personal 
property in the name of the board and enter into contracts in the 
name of the board. Just what is the budget allotted to the board 
beyond per diems for members and why were we given 
misinformation in our briefing?
<P>
	The board will be empowered to set the amount of 
compensation for expropriation of settlement lands and the 
amount of compensation for pockets of government land 
retained within settlement lands.
<P>
	The board's orders will be final and binding, enforceable 
through the Supreme Court of the Yukon territory. This is 
awesome power beyond reproach and I can only hope we know 
what we are doing and start right by appointing on merit not 
politics.
<P>
	Part II of the bill deals with rights of access on settlement 
lands. The terms and conditions for the board's operation are 
clear in this area. The mining industry in Yukon appears 
confident that part II is drafted in such a way as to avoid 
interpretive problems. However, part III, mineral rights disputes 
on non-settlement lands, is ill-defined and therefore 
troublesome. The jurisdiction and powers are ambiguous in 
clauses 65 and 66 which constitute part III. What is of major 
concern with these clauses is that 50 per cent of the board be 
designated by the Council of Yukon Indians as specified in part 
I.
<P>
	Therefore what we have is a 50 per cent aboriginally 
designated commission having jurisdiction in matters related to 
non-settlement lands. I can foresee the possibility of nothing 
but turf wars as a result and a counterproductive exercise based 
on race and cultural interpretation. Perhaps it is not wise to have 
the majority Yukon residency requirement on the board and the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7044"> 7044 </A></B>
<P>
50 per cent nominations list from the Council of Yukon Indians. 
Perhaps we are creating unnecessary racial strife.
<P>
<B>(1230 ) </B>
<P>
	At the outset of my remarks I said that Bill C-55 may confirm 
the principles contained in Bills C-33 and C-34 and put them 
into effect. However in no way does it end dispute or in itself 
resolve conflicts that may arise.
<P>
	Bill C-55 may conclude the land claims process but it opens a 
new vista with many new problems requiring many new 
solutions. I realize the veil of uncertainty that has stifled 
investment in Yukon must be removed. Industry in Yukon has 
expressed a desire to put this issue and uncertainty behind it. 
The Reform Party appreciates this need for clarification and 
stability in land claims. Now at least industry in Yukon knows 
the rules but that does not say it or the Reform Party has to like 
those rules.
<P>
	The Reform Party is on the record as supporting the early and 
mutually satisfactory conclusion of outstanding land claims. In 
the Reform Party's opposition to the process of establishing the 
land claim settlement as contained in Bills C-33 and C-34, we 
feel we articulated our vision and pointed out the deficiencies in 
the legislation.
<P>
	In good conscience we cannot support holus-bolus all facets 
of Bill C-55, particularly the jurisdiction of the board on 
non-settlement lands. We will not impede economic 
development in Yukon and the enunciation of the rules that will 
dictate this development.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Iyerak Anawak (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, 
Lib.):</B>
<P>
	[<I>Editor's Note: Member spoke in Inuktitut.</I>]
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am happy to rise to address the issue of Bill C-55, the Yukon 
Surface Rights Board Act. I must say I was going to oblige the 
member for Capilano-Howe Sound by wearing my Bermuda 
shorts and dark glasses, however the dress code of this House 
does not permit me to do so in talking to the bill.
<P>
	I do have a comment to make on the speech of the member for 
North Island-Powell River. He mentioned the participation of 
the Yukon Indians as being over 50 per cent on the board and 
talked about some racial problems that might arise. This seems 
like a judgment even before the board is off and running. There 
is no confidence in the Council for Yukon Indians being able to 
make up its mind and determine who is going to be on the board 
and what kind of board it is going to be. If we had a little more 
trust in our aboriginal organizations, this country would be a lot 
better off.
<P>
	I want to join the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development in urging support for this legislation. I believe the 
House has an obligation to move as quickly as possible on Bill 
C-55 so that residents of Yukon can begin to benefit from the 
certainty and the confidence that land claims settlement will 
bring to the territory.
<P>
	After more than 21 years of negotiations, we finally reached a 
framework agreement to settle the land claims of the 14 Yukon 
First Nations. The establishment of a new surface rights regime 
which will be accomplished through Bill C-55 is the next 
critical step in implementing the agreement.
<P>
	This is a pivotal day for Yukon. Yukon residents expect us to 
proceed responsibly and without further delay. They want us to 
address our moral and legal obligations to the First Nations 
people.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	As the minister has stated we have already adopted legislation 
to put in place a territory wide framework for First Nations land 
claims settlement agreements and to implement 
self-government for the Yukon First Nations. We have before us 
today the final piece of legislation that will allow the 
finalization of these acts.
<P>
	Bill C-55 is significantly different from the two acts we 
approved before the summer recess. The bill deals with very 
specific matters and is extremely technical. I can assure 
members that Bill C-55 has been drafted with the interests of all 
Yukoners in mind. It is fully in keeping with the Government of 
Canada's obligation under the umbrella final agreement 
negotiated by governments and Yukon First Nations.
<P>
	Bill C-55 provides for the establishment of the Yukon surface 
rights board and a new surface rights regime that reflects the 
changing realities of land ownership in Yukon. I know some 
hon. members on the other side of the House have been 
expressing concern about the role and the powers of the board.
<P>
	The role of the Yukon surface rights board is straight forward. 
It will deal with disputes relating to land access, use and 
compensation throughout the territory. However the board's 
services will be called upon only when direct negotiations 
between the affected parties have failed. There will be more 
certainty for everyone in Yukon when the bill is enacted and we 
begin to implement First Nations final agreements.
<P>
	Bill C-55 will put in place a new regime for obtaining access 
to private and public lands that will put it on a level playing field 
with other Canadian jurisdictions. It provides for clear rules and 
regulations.
<P>
	This is not a scheme that has been pulled out of a hat. This 
approach to dispute resolution has been applied elsewhere in 
Canada and is working well. In fact the Yukon surface rights 
board has been modelled on similar boards that are currently 
operating in Alberta, Saskatchewan, B.C. and Manitoba. The 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7045"> 7045 </A></B>
<P>
provincial boards were established to address disputes between 
surface owners who were generally farmers and subsurface 
developers such as oil and mining firms.
<P>
	In Yukon we anticipate that when disputes do arise they will 
primarily involve mining companies that hold mineral rights on 
non-settlement lands where others have surface rights or 
interest on land owned by First Nations, similar to the situations 
in Alberta and Saskatchewan. The same basic principles of 
reasonable access, responsible use and fair compensation can 
and will apply to resolving disputes in Yukon.
<P>
	Once the Yukon surface rights board is formed the 
government intends to take its members to Alberta, 
Saskatchewan, British Columbia and Manitoba where they will 
observe the provincial boards in action. The government may 
also invite a senior official from the provincial boards to Yukon 
to provide training or other assistance.
<P>
	As the minister has noted this is a cost effective alternative to 
using the courts to resolve disputes. It will encourage mining 
and petroleum companies as well as governments to work in 
partnership with First Nations and other land users so that all 
parties can benefit.
<P>
	The board will not even hear a dispute unless it is convinced 
that a serious effort has been made by the parties to come to an 
agreement. In addition to reducing costs for all parties, the 
provincial boards have enabled quicker resolution of disputes 
than would be possible through the courts. This in turn has 
helped prevent lengthy and costly delays in resource 
development.
<P>
	I think the minister would agree that the Government of 
Canada, Yukon First Nations, the mining and petroleum 
industries and the territorial government would be happy if the 
surface rights board never met, in other words if there never 
were any disputes to resolve. However this is not a utopian 
world and we cannot sit back and hope that everything will work 
itself out. We cannot expect that there will never be a 
disagreement between two parties, both of whom may have 
reasonable and legitimate concerns.
<P>
	In the interests of good public government we must be 
prepared to deal with issues as they arise. This is why it is 
important to proceed now to create a surface rights dispute 
resolution mechanism in the Yukon.
<P>
	I am extremely confident the surface rights board that will be 
put into place by Bill C-55 will be an effective institution of 
public government. It will operate in a fair and responsible 
manner to ensure that economic development proceeds in Yukon 
in accordance with the letter and the spirit of the umbrella final 
agreement. It will also protect existing rights including mineral 
rights of third parties in the settlement area.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	Let me remind hon. members that Yukon First Nations have 
never resisted development. Rather, they have said only that 
they want a voice in how resource development will proceed. As 
land owners they will have that voice. Guaranteeing 50 per cent 
of the board's members will be nominated by First Nations 
ensures that  First Nations and other Yukoners will have input 
into the important decisions that need to be made.
<P>
	In addition, third party rights or interests on non-settlement 
lands are recognized in the bill and the umbrella final 
agreement. The need for this board was clearly identified in the 
umbrella final agreement. It simply replaces the government 
officials or courts now identified in the mining legislation as the 
dispute resolution body.
<P>
	Let me assure the House that the Yukon surface rights board 
will be created in a manner that is financially responsible as well 
as responsive to the needs of the people of Yukon and Canada. 
Obviously costs are involved in setting up new institutions of 
government, but through careful planning and management 
these costs can be controlled. The Yukon surface rights board 
will be kept as small as possible. Staffing will be kept to a 
minimum and proceedings will be expeditious.
<P>
	Bill C-55 will achieve some very specific goals, but it is 
important for the House to consider the broader implications of 
this proposed legislation. Most fundamentally we must 
understand that without Bill C-55 the settlement of land claims 
in Yukon cannot be concluded.
<P>
	Once again our efforts to address the rightful claims of Yukon 
First Nations will be stalled. Another generation of Yukon 
Indians will face the prospect of starting anew to negotiate an 
agreement that all parties have already accepted. Vital economic 
development opportunities will be lost. We cannot and must not 
allow that to happen. The Government of Canada made certain 
commitments in the umbrella final agreement in 1993, including 
the commitment to create a surface rights board and we must 
live up to those obligations.
<P>
	I would like to remind my hon. colleagues of the debate that 
took place in the House some four months ago. That debate 
determined conclusively that the umbrella final agreement is a 
solid agreement that will benefit all residents of Yukon. By 
providing a secure land base, settlement agreements will 
empower Yukon First Nations to build a better future. The 
territorial government and all Yukoners will benefit from 
increased economic activity and from the strengthened political 
development of the territory.
<P>
	In addition to confirming ownership of vast areas of land, 
Yukon First Nations will be entitled to significant financial 
compensation. This compensation package is essential to the 
future prosperity of Yukon First Nations. It will give them the 
financial resources to create jobs within their communities, to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7046"> 7046 </A></B>
<P>
deliver social services and to generally establish a better 
standard of living for Yukon Indians. These achievements will 
benefit all Yukoners and all Canadians.
<P>
	All of us can appreciate that much more is at stake here than a 
new surface rights regime. At stake here is the economic growth 
of Yukon as well as its political and administrative 
development. Also at stake is the spirit of partnership, trust and 
mutual accomplishment that government is working hard to 
establish with First Nations in Yukon and elsewhere. The very 
future of Yukon First Nations is at stake. They have already 
waited far too long to have their voices heard and their concerns 
addressed.
<P>
	With that in mind, I urge hon. members to look beyond the 
legal and technical complexities of the bill, as important as they 
are. I urge them to embrace a broader viewpoint to acknowledge 
that the Yukon surface rights board is vital to the land claims 
settlement process. I remind them that land claims settlements 
are something all Yukon residents and Canadians want and 
expect us to achieve.
<P>
	This is the time to move forward to lay the foundation for a 
better future for all people in Yukon. Toward that end I urge my 
hon. colleagues to join me in supporting Bill C-55 so that it can 
proceed as quickly as possible to the other place. This is the only 
responsible course of action to ensure that implementation of 
the Yukon First Nations final and self-government agreements 
can proceed without further delay.
<P>
<B>(1245 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the opening comments by the member who just 
spoke there were some statements regarding the Reform's 
concerns about the ability of the Council of Yukon Indians to 
designate its representatives to this board.
<P>
	On the contrary, we have no concerns about its ability to 
designate representatives. Our concern, as expressed in my 
speech, related to and focused on the minister's ability to make 
this into a hot bed of patronage and to set up a divisiveness and 
other turf wars that are of major concern to us.
<P>
	I wanted to set the record straight on that and ensure there was 
nothing on the record that would indicate we agreed in any way 
with those statements.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anawak:</B> Mr. Speaker, I heard quite clearly the hon. 
member saying that because of the 50 per cent participation of 
the Council for Yukon Indians on the surface rights bill there 
might be a place for some leaning in a racial way. That is why I 
made those comments. To me that was undermining the 
council's ability to look at problems it might encounter through 
the surface rights bill in looking after the interests of all 
Yukoners.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to the member's speech and the answer to my 
colleague's question.
<P>
	We are after the 10 best people from Yukon to address these 
matters. It is in no way to be implied that it is a racial question 
that we are bringing up here. I would like the hon. member on 
the other side to understand that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anawak:</B> Mr. Speaker, I suspect if we look at the blues 
there will be comments in there that clearly state the word racial. 
That is why I made the comment that this was uncalled for.
<P>
	Yes, we are looking for the 10 best people or the best people 
the Council of Yukon Indians can offer to settle its disputes. I 
would be honoured if all members of the surface rights board 
were Indians from the Yukon area. They probably could do a 
better job than anybody else in the country in settling disputes 
that will arise.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it gives me no pleasure to rise in the House today to 
oppose Bill C-55.
<P>
	The bill is the handmaiden of Bills C-33 and C-34, two pieces 
of legislation debated before the summer recess and passed 
despite the serious objections of many well-informed 
Canadians, including the opposition of the Reform caucus.
<P>
	I am told that Bills C-33 and C-34 cannot take effect until we 
pass Bill C-55. I would like to be able to support all three pieces 
of legislation because I support the progress of native Canadians 
toward taking full responsibility for themselves and for their 
future. Unfortunately a number of concerns with this bill 
prevent my supporting it.
<P>
	However, I wish to mention some positive aspects. First, 
given transportation problems in the north for so much of the 
year, I applaud the bill's provision that board members can 
attend their meetings by telephone.
<P>
	Second, I was also pleased to see that this board can only 
intervene on matters brought to it by others and cannot just 
insert itself willy-nilly into negotiations which the parties are 
settling on their own.
<P>
	Third, because delay of rulings can cause real hardship, 
especially due to the very short work seasons for mineral 
exploration and development north of 60, I was especially 
pleased to read section 27 which states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>An application before the board shall be dealt with as informally and 
expeditiously as the circumstances and considerations of fairness permit.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1250 ) </B>
<P>
	Fourth, faced with the probable administration nightmare 
generated by Bills C-33 and C-34, at least the Department of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development consulted widely and 
publicly among the many affected groups and general public of 
Yukon as to how the expected conflicts of interest ought best to 
be resolved through new legislation in Bill C-55.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7047"> 7047 </A></B>
<P>
	It is my understanding that 16 months ago some 11 interest 
groups were sent draft copies of the proposed legislation 
including the Yukon Chamber of Mines, the Klondike Placer 
Miners Association, the Canadian Association of Petroleum 
Producers and two groups representing Yukon trappers and 
outfitters. Coupled with advertising in area newspapers, the 
government apparently has made a sincere effort to bring all 
parties immediately concerned into the discussions, a 
praiseworthy method of proceeding.
<P>
	However, I also believe it is my responsibility in opposition to 
point out the shortcomings of these pieces of legislation and my 
firm belief that no native group should be granted 
self-government rights greater than those of municipal type 
governments. The very amount of land to be covered by Bill 
C-55 together with certain riches of natural resources involved 
makes the subject far too large for municipal type 
administration
<P>
	It is my hope that the Department of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development will listen and improve the process of 
dealing with what will be among the most long lasting and 
consequential actions of Canadian federal government for all 
time. I say for all time because these land claim settlements and 
dispute settling mechanisms will no doubt set precedent for the 
entire process of settling native land claims still outstanding, 
especially in the province of British Columbia.
<P>
	In addition, they obligate Canadian taxpayers far into the 
future. This latest piece of legislation, Bill C-55, if we include 
all the lists and guides needed to find particular topics, requires 
some 64 pages to sort out the mess created when the government 
decided to hand over jurisdiction for many thousands of square 
miles of Yukon territory to be administered by the so-called 
First Nations.
<P>
	I have great admiration as well as sympathy for Canada's 
native peoples. Moreover, as our native people demonstrated the 
readiness to take over the running of their own affairs, I strongly 
support dismantling the Department of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development and handing those rights over to the 
natives themselves.
<P>
	Because I believe in full equity among all Canadians with 
special status for none, I also believe we must take great care to 
ensure that Canada does not create by this kind of legislation the 
very sorts of racial homelands and racial biases for different 
treatment of our people, which the government and people of 
South Africa have been struggling for generations to root out of 
their country.
<P>
	Therefore, I also believe that any further federal 
responsibility that in any way differs from the way the federal 
government deals with each and every other Canadian should 
also stop, cease and desist at that point, when by passing 
legislation like Bill C-55 we hand over the running of native 
affairs to natives themselves in a reasonable and efficient 
manner.
<P>
	However, these three pieces of legislation go far beyond 
anything I can call reasonable and efficient. The legislation also 
maintains special federal responsibilities to Yukon First 
Nations, including large cash grants and creating separate living 
areas and entitlements based solely upon race.
<P>
	At the same time, the legislation package gives virtually all 
the rights and responsibilities of a full fledged modern nation to 
these groups whose total population is approximately 7,300 
divided into 14 bands and scattered across some of the least 
populated land remaining on our planet.
<P>
	Even Canada's smallest cities have populations larger than 
the total population of these groups, which are now to be 
considered nations. Nor can it be any secret to any citizen 
concerned about public affairs in their own municipal 
governments that cities like Vernon and Salmon Arm in my own 
riding of Okanagan-Shuswap often are hard pressed to provide 
the personnel and pay for the services their residents require.
<P>
<B>(1255 ) </B>
<P>
	It is more than ridiculous; it borders on the tragic to heap so 
much responsibility upon so few. The only thing making it 
possible is the ongoing financial support of all Canadian 
taxpayers; support for an inefficient administrative rat's nest, 
here boxed and wrapped as Bill C-55.
<P>
	Bill C-55 creates a group to resolve land use conflicts certain 
to arise because of this government's decision to transfer 
responsibility for all ``use, management, administration, 
control and protection'' of some 16,000 square miles of land 
equal to about 75 per cent of the province of Nova Scotia to 
those 7,300 Yukon natives.
<P>
	Included are natural resources, businesses, professional and 
trade licensing, responsibility for all construction, zoning and 
land development, sanitation and planning, operation and use of 
vehicles, prevention of pollution and protection of the 
extremely sensitive Yukon environment.
<P>
	We all know that the Liberal government likes to brag about 
the number of jobs that Canadian citizens and entrepreneurs 
have managed to create in the year since the 1993 election 
despite federal government overregulation, mismanagement 
and overtaxation.
<P>
	There can be no doubt that some of those jobs have been 
directly created by government. It seems apparent that native 
land claim settlements will become a big player in the job 
creation scenario because there will be administrative jobs for 
anybody who is not busy testifying about the many disputes 
likely to arise from changing the status of this parcel of land 
equal as I mentioned above to about three-quarters the size of 
the province of Nova Scotia, land now being divided into 
category A settlement land, category B settlement land or fee 
simple settlement land.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7048"> 7048 </A></B>
<P>
	The major purpose of Bill C-55 is to create some group that 
would have the authority and resources to settle the many 
disputes springing to life when miners, trappers, big game 
guides and many ordinary Canadians suddenly realize that areas 
where they may have thought themselves previously legally 
entitled to earn their living now have been handed over from 
either federal or territorial jurisdiction to control by the First 
Nations.
<P>
	That dispute settling body is to be called the Yukon surface 
rights board consisting of a chairman and from two to ten other 
members, a majority resident in the Yukon Territory, with half 
the members appointed on the nomination by the Council of 
Yukon Indians.
<P>
	I note that neither being a member of the Yukon First Nations 
or having an interest in their land shall be considered as grounds 
for disqualification. I have some concerns that this Yukon 
surface rights board may become a nesting site for that well 
known political species, the patronage appointed bird.
<P>
	I believe it is important in all government groups to avoid 
even the appearance of conflict of interest, and so I hope that all 
concerned will take special care on that point.
<P>
	Beginning on page 33 of the legislation, this act deals with 
mineral rights disputes on non-settlement lands. I must question 
the logic of this legislation doing so many things on the basis of 
race only but then granting authority over non-native lands to a 
board half composed of natives.
<P>
	Additionally, because there are so many different pieces of 
legislation involved, namely the Canadian Oil and Gas 
Operations Act, the Yukon Placer Mining Act and the Yukon 
Quartz Mining Act, it seems that the Yukon surface rights board 
will have to develop some fairly sophisticated methods of 
weighing the various claims because virtually nothing is spelled 
out in Bill C-55.
<P>
	What principles should the board apply to settle disputes? Is 
time of filing important? How long must a person have filed a 
mineral claim for natives to recognize it? What amounts of 
royalties will bands be allowed to request from proposed 
developers of mining property? What environmental protection 
bonds will be required? What percentage of band funds can be 
devoted to develop a mine that may employ natives?
<P>
	I am sure that all of us hope that the Yukon chiefs and band 
councils are going to be fully responsible to their local band 
members in a democratic fashion. Where is the board's 
responsibility to either native or non-native people spelled out? 
Bill C-55 does require the board to make an annual report but it 
does not state in cases of conflicts of the best interests of natives 
with the best interests of non-natives whose interests should 
prevail. Can we today not envision such disputes lasting for 
many years?
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	Finally, I was somewhat surprised to see that this board has 
been given discretion regarding awarding any and all costs of 
hearings they undertake. It is all well and good to direct that the 
hearings shall be conducted on the native lands wherever 
possible and also that the hearings should be dealt with as 
quickly and as informally as possible.
<P>
	Nevertheless, I believe past experience should warn us that 
hearings involving serious conflicts of interest with native land 
claims have been known to drag on for many years to the delight 
of lawyers and other hangers on of the Indian establishment. The 
legislation proposes no limits, for example, on the number of 
legal advisers or other so-called experts which either side to a 
dispute might wish to summon. To that extent I am afraid that we 
are once again committing taxpayers to sign and pay for a blank 
cheque.
<P>
	Some people are saying that the majority of disputes will arise 
and be settled shortly after Bills C-33 and C-34 come into 
effect. However, as population increases and resources become 
scarce during the next century on this planet, I believe that the 
people of Canada and the Yukon First Nations may well see 
themselves tied up in virtually endless administrative wrangling 
over surface rights in Canada's north.
<P>
	I sincerely hope that Bill C-55 provides an adequate 
framework for the settlement of such disputes. However I see no 
clear evidence to make me reasonably certain that peace, order 
and good government for all people of Canada, including other 
provinces and future generations, will be well served by passing 
Bill C-55. Therefore, I ask the House to support me in opposing 
it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Iyerak Anawak (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wonder if I might ask the hon. member a 
question. The term native was mentioned in the debate a lot 
during the speech of the hon. member.
<P>
	I wonder if the hon. member might elaborate a bit on how he 
feels about the way aboriginal people in Yukon have been 
treated over the last number of years and whether he agrees that 
the aboriginal people, the Council of Yukon Indians, and other 
aboriginal groups deserve some recognition because of the fact 
that they were here for quite some time before the arrival of the 
rest of the Yukon population.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
comments. First I am sorry that the member is upset about the 
word native being used so many times. I use that term about 
myself and about my colleagues, that we are all native 
Canadians. I use that word a number of times in conversation 
with anybody in the country. We are native Canadians. I can 
under-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7049"> 7049 </A></B>
<P>
stand the member's concern because of the misconception of 
that.
<P>
	I agree that over the last years the native population in Yukon 
has not been treated that well by white people. This has been an 
injustice. We have to be careful that we do not try to cure this by 
another injustice. We have to do it properly at this time. Now is 
the time when we have a chance to do things that will be set in 
motion for centuries to come hopefully.
<P>
	Our concern and my concern is that we must do it properly the 
first time around so that we can go forward and not have to keep 
going to court or run into the similar problems we have today 
100 years or 200 years down the road.
<P>
	Our obligation in the House is to the Canadian people and the 
future of Canada as a whole. Let us try to do it properly this time, 
not like we have done it for years. I hope that answers the 
member's question.
<P>
<B>(1305 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elijah Harper (Churchill, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
address the House on Bill C-55, the Yukon Surface Rights Board 
Act.
<P>
	I would like first to make some general comments regarding 
how this legislation came about. We had two previous bills 
dealing with the Yukon land settlement, the land claims and the 
self-government issue. I was somewhat perturbed as to the lack 
of understanding by the member who just spoke in terms of the 
relationship that the First Nations have in the country. I think 
oftentimes such ignorance misleads the general public. I do not 
blame the member. I think it is just a lack of knowledge and lack 
of awareness of that information.
<P>
	I have always said that the first order of business in this 
country should be with the first peoples, the First Nations, in 
Canada. After all it is the First Nations that were here to 
welcome many of the newcomers who are here in this country, 
including members who are sitting in this House.
<P>
	It is through the generosity of the First Nations people that 
many Canadians have benefited from the lands and resources in 
this country. In many parts of Canada there are still outstanding 
claims that have to be settled with First Nations.
<P>
	In my area in Manitoba we have treaties that were signed a 
long time ago and in parts of B.C., the territories and Yukon 
treaties were never entered into. As a matter of fact this land 
claim settlement that we have just made I think is the conclusion 
of the outstanding business that needed to be settled with First 
Nations people in Canada. It is a modern day treaty that provides 
the wherewithal for First Nations to be self-sufficient and 
self-governing.
<P>
	As the member has stated, Canadians need to be aware of what 
commitments the federal government is making to First 
Nations. We need to look at what promises have been made by 
First Nations to this country. They have through treaties shared 
the land and resources with the rest of the people in this country.
<P>
	The question is not asked by First Nations: ``What are we 
committing ourselves to, to other people?'' There is no 
hesitation at all to bind our future generations so that we can 
share our land and resources with the newcomers. As a matter of 
fact this commitment and these promises are forever. The 
treaties state as long as the sun shines and the grass grows and 
the river flows that is our commitment. We expect governments 
to reciprocate that kind of understanding to our people.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	As the member asked, what is the government promising to 
First Nations in the country? We have waited well over 100 
years to address these issues. We have First Nations in Yukon 
who have waited a long time to settle these outstanding claims.
<P>
	All these years governments have reaped the resources from 
Yukon. Canadians have benefited from those resources but 
across the country today the First Nations people still lack basic 
human needs such as housing which many Canadian people take 
for granted.
<P>
	As a First Nations member I have been involved in this 
process for a long time, trying to educate the general public 
about these issues as to how generous we have been as First 
Nations people. That is a kind of understanding that I hope hon. 
members across will understand, that somehow in settling this 
land claim we are depriving ordinary Canadians. That is not so.
<P>
	If the government were to look at the past 100 years in terms 
of the lands and resources that it has had and how much revenue 
it has obtained from these lands and resources that First Nations 
shared in the country, it would see that it runs into billions of 
dollars. If the First Nations people would even obtain a small 
percentage of the revenues generated from the lands and 
resources alone there would not be any government handouts. 
Oftentimes First Nations people come to governments to seek 
help. Oftentimes it is humiliating because it appears we are 
beggars and are seeking handouts.
<P>
	The truth of the matter is that the aboriginal people, the First 
Nations people, have given much already and have had very 
little in return. It is time that governments honoured their 
obligations to First Nations people in this country. We are not 
asking for anything more or anything for less. We are just asking 
governments to live up to their promises.
<P>
<B>(1315 ) </B>
<P>
	Another question I want to address is the hon. member's 
notion of self-government. The hon. member said that 
self-government should not be more than a municipality. That is 
another lack of understanding the hon. member has. In the 
country it was 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7050"> 7050 </A></B>
<P>
the Queen and her officials, the sovereign country of England, 
who entered into treaties with First Nations in the country. 
Therefore, we have a nation entering into an agreement with a 
group of people in the country and it certainly was not a 
municipality. It was the First Nations.
<P>
	The notion of a treaty making process is a right that the 
aboriginal people, the First Nation people, have had for 
thousands of years. A treaty making process only validates and 
recognizes that the First Nations have been self-governing for a 
very long time. That is something that needs to be understood by 
Canadians and by governments in the country.
<P>
	We have a special and unique relationship with Canada. I do 
not mean that we are special in a way that we are better off than 
other people. No other group of people in the country has that 
kind of relationship with governments except the First Nations.
<P>
	By signing treaties we were entering agreements with another 
government and did things we understood. We have been very 
accommodating to other governments and Canadians. It is time 
we begin to reap from the land the resources that we once had 
control over.
<P>
	I am extremely pleased to speak in support of the legislation 
that deserves the backing of hon. members from both sides of 
the House. The people of Yukon are nearly unanimous in 
expressing the view that it is time to move forward with the 
settlement on the Yukon Indians land claim. Bill C-55 is the 
final building block in the legislative foundation.
<P>
	Hon. members are well aware that the Yukon Indians' 
umbrella final agreement was 21 years in the making. People 
who were not even born when the negotiations began now have 
families of their own. With Parliament's endorsement of Bill 
C-55, the benefits of the agreement, including money, can begin 
to flow to these families.
<P>
	The claim agreement will do nothing less than ensure an 
equitable and prosperous future for Yukon Indian children and 
youth. It will also recognize First Nation seniors for their 
perseverance, patience and guidance, as well as compensate 
them for many years of hardship.
<P>
	It will give Yukon Indians of all ages a chance for a new 
beginning, a new partnership with governments in the 
management of Yukon lands and resources.
<P>
	Hon. members are also aware that the umbrella final 
agreement was ratified by all the affected parties: the federal 
and territorial governments, Yukon First Nations, business 
interests and non-aboriginal residents of Yukon.
<P>
	It is supported by the stakeholders because of the certainty of 
land ownership and the rights it will bring to Yukon. This 
certainty is essential if mineral and energy development 
projects are to go forward, creating jobs, income and business 
opportunities for all residents of Yukon.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	We must acknowledge and respond to this support by moving 
Bill C-55 through this House as quickly as possible. To do 
otherwise would be reckless and irresponsible and would 
damage the crown's credibility among First Nations, 
northerners and all Canadians.
<P>
	The legislation before us today will establish a new surface 
rights regime and a surface rights board for  Yukon. The creation 
of the board was a key element of the umbrella final agreement 
and is, therefore, a legitimate commitment by the Government 
of Canada to all residents of Yukon.
<P>
	If there is one thing that stands out about the bill it is the 
extent of the consultative process that has been proceeded with 
since its introduction to the House. Both the general public and 
affected interest groups in Yukon were widely consulted last 
year by federal officials when guidelines for Bill C-55 were 
being developed.
<P>
	They were also consulted on a number of occasions on the 
wording and contents of the bill. Several groups from the mining 
industry participated in the legislative drafting process, 
including the Yukon Chamber of Mines, the Klondike Placer 
Miners Association, the Prospectors and Developers 
Association of Canada and the Mining Association of Canada.
<P>
	The interests of the petroleum industry, which also has an 
important stake in the issue of surface rights, were well 
represented by the Canadian Association of Petroleum 
Producers. The Yukon Territorial Government also provided 
input as did the Council for Yukon Indians, various Yukon First 
Nations and the Gwitch'in Tribal Council.
<P>
	Public input was solicited by sending drafting guidelines to 
major interest groups, including the Yukon Trappers 
Association, the Yukon Outfitters Association. An 
advertisement was also placed in Yukon newspapers announcing 
the availability of guidelines for review by the public.
<P>
	Consultation on a first draft of the legislation began 15 
months ago in June, 1993 when a draft bill was sent to all 
interest groups. Later that month a meeting was held with these 
groups in Whitehorse. Subsequent parts of the bill were 
distributed to groups in October and February. This was 
followed by additional meetings with the Council for Yukon 
Indians and the territorial governments in Vancouver in March 
and with other interest groups in Whitehorse in April.
<P>
	Based on the output received at these meetings and through 
other channels, another part of the bill was produced and 
distributed this past June. Further meetings were held with 
different stakeholders in July, August and September, leading to 
more changes to the bill.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7051"> 7051 </A></B>
<P>
	My intention here is not to provide details of every meeting 
that has been held on Bill C-55, but it is important for the 
House to recognize that the government has made an 
extraordinary effort to hear the concerns of stakeholders who 
will be affected by the creation of a new surface rights regime 
in Yukon.
<P>
	Most concerns were met but some compromises were 
necessary. The bill that has been introduced is consistent with 
the provisions of the land claims agreement and is in the best 
interests of all Yukon residents in the interests of open, 
accessible and responsive public government.
<P>
	Hon. members would be hard pressed to find any stakeholder 
group in Yukon that opposes the basic principles that underlie 
this bill. The different groups may not agree with how every <I>i</I> 
has been dotted and every <I>t</I> crossed, but they do agree on the 
need for a territorially based surface rights board that will 
oversee a stable, fair and responsible regime.
<P>
	It is my belief that we must seize this opportunity to put this 
new regime in place. As I stated earlier, further delay at this time 
is not only unnecessary but will jeopardize the implementation 
of the final agreements of Yukon First Nations.
<P>
	I might remind hon. members that such agreements have been 
already reached with four Yukon First Nations: The Vuntut 
Gwitch'in First Nation, the First Nation of-
<P>
<B>(1325 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon member's time has expired. I 
wonder if there might be unanimous consent to give him a 
moment or two more to finish.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Churchill):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will read my 
prepared statement which is about four more pages. I will try to 
read fast.
<P>
	I would remind hon. members that such agreements have been 
reached with four Yukon First Nations, the Vuntut Gwit'chin 
First Nation, the First Nation of Nacho Nyak Dun, Champagne 
and Aishihik First Nations and Teslin Tlingits Council. Progress 
in the negotiations for final agreements with the remaining 10 
First Nations are awaiting passage and proclamation of the bill 
and the coming into force of the Yukon First Nations land claims 
and self-government acts which members passed last June.
<P>
	One of the primary objectives of land claim agreements is to 
bring about certainty of land and resource ownership. This is 
being achieved in Yukon and it will result in many economic and 
social benefits to both aboriginal and non-aboriginal residents 
of Yukon.
<P>
	Hand in hand with this certainty of ownership comes the need 
for a known regime for obtaining access to private and public 
lands. This regime must be responsible and fair to all residents 
of Yukon and it must put Yukon resource industries on a level 
playing field with other Canadian jurisdictions.
<P>
	I am very confident that Bill C-55 will establish such a 
regime in Yukon. It will establish a common set of rules 
throughout the territory. It will ensure that all stakeholders have 
representation on the surface rights board which will hear 
disputes between surface rights holders and those who want 
access to the subsurface resources.
<P>
	It will keep these disputes out of the courts. As my colleagues 
have already indicated, the proposed Yukon surface rights board 
will be a cost effective dispute resolution mechanism compared 
with litigation.
<P>
	The surface rights board will be an extremely important body 
in Yukon. It will guarantee that mining companies and others 
will be able to exercise their legitimate rights of access to 
holdings of private land as well as crown land. This will ensure 
that resource development projects will go ahead after many 
years of delay and frustration.
<P>
	The board will also ensure that compensation for the use of 
these lands is fair and reasonable. This is particularly important 
for First Nations which will own the surface rights of large tracts 
of land for which subsurface rights have already been granted.
<P>
	In addition, the surface rights board will be mandated to 
uphold all existing rights of access across settlement lands for 
the public and government.
<P>
	This is on the condition that the use of these rights does not 
significantly alter the route. Otherwise the consent of the 
affected First Nations will be required. Consent will also be 
required for new access routes across settlement lands.
<P>
	There are many reasons why the House should support Bill 
C-55 but in weighing all the reasons my colleagues and I have 
outlined today, we should not forget that most fundamentally we 
will be fulfilling a commitment made by the Government of 
Canada to Yukon First Nations and to all Yukon residents.
<P>
	That commitment was to settle the Yukon First Nations land 
claims based on the umbrella final agreement and the creation of 
this board is an integral part of that process.
<P>
	The government's commitment to settle outstanding land 
claims was clearly stated in the red book and it is a pledge we 
intend to act upon at every opportunity.
<P>
	We have made some excellent progress and established strong 
momentum over the past year. Most recently, we endorsed the 
final agreement of the Sahtu, Dene and Metis of the Mackenzie 
Valley. Negotiations are proceeding well on a number of other 
claims.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7052"> 7052 </A></B>
<P>
	By addressing land claims in a fair and responsible manner, 
the government will resolve long standing disputes with First 
Nations and contribute to a healing process between aboriginal 
and non-aboriginal people.
<P>
	I would urge my hon. friends to participate actively in this 
healing process by supporting Bill C-55 at second reading.
<P>
<B>(1330 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for 
Churchill spoke at some length on matters not directly covered 
by Bill C-55. In his remarks he referred to the lack of 
understanding of we on this side of the House. Perhaps the 
problem is that we understand only too well what is going on.
<P>
	The hon. member speaks of the generosity with which 
aboriginal people bestowed their heritage and their resources on 
our ancestors. This is a misleading and I think unfair 
interpretation of history. The native people lost their territory 
and resources because they were confronted with overwhelming 
numbers of people who possessed technological superiority.
<P>
	No right-minded person would suggest the game was fair. The 
invaders were not adverse to double dealing, chicanery and 
theft, but some native tribes were not exactly angels either. The 
past is past.
<P>
	My question for the hon. member is short and simple. He long 
ago joined the Canadian mainstream. Why does he continue to 
promote and propagate the idea that other native people should 
not also join the mainstream?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Churchill):</B> Mr. Speaker, what we have heard in 
the House from the hon. member confirms what I mentioned 
earlier. There is obviously a lack of understanding by the 
member. I said that ignorance sometimes misleads the public.
<P>
	If the member knew the First Nations people, we have been 
very kind and generous. The member should look at exactly 
what the treaties mean. Much of the documentation created at 
those treaty gatherings was done by government officials, 
maybe in some cases by priests who did not understand 
aboriginal people.
<P>
	We have a very rich oral history. The member would find the 
treaties meant that we were to live with each other side by side, 
that we would respect each other and not dominate each other. 
That is the spirit of the treaties. The member would not find 
those things written in history books, but if he talked to our 
elders he would find how generous we have been to share the 
land and resources with the people.
<P>
	We have never been conquered. We chose to enter treaties 
with your government. Today we find that many of the First 
Nations people live in poverty. Meanwhile other Canadian 
people live in better housing. The standard of living in Canada is 
one of the highest in the world. It is envied by many countries. 
But First Nations people do not enjoy that.
<P>
	Like I said, all we ask for is the government to live up to its 
treaty promises. We do not ask for anything more or anything 
less.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Iyerak Anawak (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wonder if the hon. member for Churchill 
might elaborate a little more on the comment that was just made 
suggesting we should go into the mainstream of Canadian 
society. We do enter the Canadian mainstream society when we 
walk in the door to the House and Commons and to our offices 
each morning, but that is a when in Rome do as the Romans do 
practise. When we are back in our homes it is different. People 
do not go up to me and say: ``Mr. Anawak''. They say: ``Hi 
Jack''.
<P>
	It is not our way to make one person any better than another, 
because we respect each other. I wonder if he could elaborate a 
little more. Yes, we do enter into the Canadian mainstream but at 
the same time our culture is very important to us and should be 
kept at all possible costs.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	I realize this is not part of the debate, but considering the 
comments made by the member, I think it is appropriate that 
there be no misconceptions about how we feel as members of 
Parliament about entering the mainstream of Canadian society 
when we need to.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Churchill when 
answering might wish to use up the remaining one and half 
minute of the debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Churchill):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member 
for his question. I chose to become involved in mainstream 
politics because I wanted to raise many issues.
<P>
	As First Nations members we were not even recognized as 
part of the country for a long time. The first time we were 
allowed to vote was in 1960 and in the province of Quebec it was 
1969. Many of the laws and legislation affecting First Nations 
people were passed without the full consent and participation of 
the First Nations people.
<P>
	It is hard to unravel the history and legislative policies over 
the last hundreds of years in that short period of time. As a 
matter of fact I was the first treaty Indian elected in the province 
of Manitoba about 11 or 12 years ago. Most of my activity in the 
political field has been in mainstream politics. Before that I was 
chief of my band.
<P>
	My ambition was to become involved in mainstream politics 
and hopefully through my participation many other people will 
begin to understand First Nations people.

	All of us as parliamentarians and members of the older

importance of the younger generation of Canadians. But actions 
speak louder than words. Often the actions of Parliament and the 
government send a very different message. For example, the 
chronic and systematic overspending by governments of our 
generation have piled up a burden of debt and taxation which we 
are passing on to the younger generation.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	This is a terrible legacy and unless we address it, the principal 
effect of this generation of politicians on the well-being of the 
next generation will be essentially negative rather than positive.
<P>
	Therefore I feel it is important for Parliament and the 
leadership of the country to offer something of real value to 
young people, something that by its very nature sends a message 
that states: ``Yes, we realize your importance; yes, we recognize 
your value to the future of the country; and, yes, we are prepared 
to invest in you and not just pass on our debts''.
<P>
	During the last federal election campaign I made two 
proposals on the subject of higher education which seemed to 
provoke a very positive response from younger people. One was 
the proposal to give students more control over the spending of 
education dollars by distributing federal cash transfers in 
support of education in the form of non-repayable vouchers.
<P>
	The other proposal that evoked a good response was the 
proposal embodied in this private member's bill. It is also a 
proposal mentioned in the government's human resources 
development discussion paper and that is the proposal for an 
income contingent loan repayment program.
<P>
	I should mention that in the national leaders' debate that was 
held in Ottawa during the election campaign where the 
questioning from the audience was very controlled, the one and 
only question from a younger person in that audience had to do 
with how students facing higher tuition and education costs are 
going to finance their education in the future. I suggest that this 
income contingent loan repayment program provides the best 
answer we can think of to that question.
<P>
	I would like to review the current situation briefly. Everyone 
knows students require money to finance their education. I know 
something about this personally. Sandra and I have five 
children, three of whom are of university age. The principal 
sources of funding for students are these: income earned by 
students themselves, and many students today are carrying two 
jobs in addition to their education to try to make their way 
through; family funds, if those are available, but those are often 
very restricted in many families; scholarship funds which are 
usually tied to academic performance and other criteria; and, 
borrowed funds.
<P>
	At present the principal federal act for securing borrowed 
funds for students is the Canada Student Financial Assistance 
Act, the old Canada student loans act. Under the provisions of 
that program the government guarantees loans by private 
lenders, namely the banks, to students with the cost of the loan 
being subsidized by the government as long as the student is 
enrolled in full time studies. The student usually begins paying 
the loan back about eight months after leaving school. In the 
event of default the lenders are reimbursed  and the loan is 
usually sent to a collection agency under contract with the 
government.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7054"> 7054 </A></B>
<P>
	The principal defects of the current system are that it provides 
insufficient funding for students facing rising tuition and 
education costs and the fact that one in five students ends up 
defaulting on their loans.
<P>
	Reform has asked: Is there not some superior alternative? We 
believe it exists in this income contingent loan repayment 
program. Since that is a mouthful I will refer to it from here on 
as the ICLR program.
<P>
	Simply put, this is a program designed to allow students to 
pay back their student loans over a period of time after 
graduation based on their annual income, with collection being 
organized through the income tax system. After graduation a 
student would begin to repay their student loan based on their 
ability to pay as determined by their earnings. Precisely how 
much a former student pays back each year would vary from 
year to year depending on income. The specific amount set as a 
percentage of income would be paid through the income tax 
system. If the student's income does not reach a specified 
minimum amount, the payment would be deferred until earnings 
increased.
<P>
	This payment system depends on an accurate flow of income 
statements after the individual has left the institution of higher 
education. Revenue Canada, producing the full details of a 
former student's income and whereabouts through the income 
tax form, would be the collector of the loans. We like the idea of 
income contingent loan repayments for three reasons.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	It would help to maintain the high quality of educational 
services in this country. As the finance minister pointed out in 
the last couple of days demands on public resources are 
enormous. The availability of those resources is increasingly 
limited. Both federal and provincial jurisdictions are wrestling 
with how to refinance post-secondary education.
<P>
	As governments contribute less and less funding and costs 
increase, the quality of education will decline unless new 
sources of revenue are found. Lack of laboratory equipment, 
growing class sizes and enrolment caps are a direct result of the 
decreasing government contributions in the face of escalating 
educational costs.
<P>
	Any workable resolution to the underfunding of higher 
education must depend on more financing from 
non-government sources, including increased student fees. 
However one cannot increase tuition and other fees to students 
without making the cost of a university education even more 
prohibitive than it is under the current system.
<P>
	If however students were permitted to repay loans on an 
income contingent basis over a longer period of time, the burden 
of higher tuition fees would be more manageable. Private 
lenders and the federal government would also be able to 
provide more and larger loans at  lower risk because the loans 
would be secured by the enhanced future earnings of the 
graduate and backed up by the collection powers of Revenue 
Canada.
<P>
	Another reason for supporting this scheme is that it provides 
greater fairness and flexibility for students. The current student 
loan system has many defects, most of which result in high 
default rates.
<P>
	Prospective borrowers are subjected to traditional means tests 
that take into account their parents' and their partners' income. 
Students whose parents are relatively well off are often 
ineligible for student loans even if they receive no assistance 
from their parents. Students are obliged to repay their loans at 
the same rate and at the same level after graduation, regardless 
of their employment and income position.
<P>
	The high default rate which results from this system has two 
particular negative effects. It invites abuse of the system by 
irresponsible borrowers to the detriment of those who really 
need the loans. It also makes it harder to maintain public support 
for the student loans program because taxpayers are often left 
holding the bag. The income contingent plan by contrast links 
the payment to the ability to pay and makes repayment more 
certain to the benefit of both students and taxpayers.
<P>
	Under the current act taxpayers pay the difference between 
the simple interest paid by borrowers and the accumulated 
interest that private lenders demand. The taxpayers subsidize 
interest costs while the borrower is in school. The taxpayers end 
up footing the bill for loans where borrowers default and pay the 
collection fees charged on the defaulted loan. The cost of default 
has become a substantial burden on the entire system. Earlier 
this week Peter Moon of the <I>Globe and Mail</I> sketched out the 
dimensions of this burden.
<P>
	Currently about one in five borrowers default on their student 
loans. About two-thirds of these eventually repay but only after 
the federal government assumes the debt from the bank and has 
launched some form of collection activity. The other third, 
about 7 per cent of all student loans, are carried as bad debt. 
There is currently about $1 billion in bad loans outstanding 
owed by 180,000 former students. Eventually about 2 per cent of 
all student borrowers use bankruptcy to evade payment of their 
loans.
<P>
	Under an income contingent system these costs would all be 
substantially reduced. The savings associated with minimizing 
collection costs in particular would be major. The government 
spent about $23.3 million in collection costs last year to recover 
about $100 million worth of debt. With a total value of defaults 
approaching $1 billion the potential earnings of the collection 
agencies is now estimated to range up to $300 million.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7055"> 7055 </A></B>
<P>
	To sum up, Reformers advocate the adoption of an income 
contingent repayment system for loans for three reasons. First, 
it is a cost-effective, fair and flexible system for students. It 
enables them to invest more in education, thus helping to fund 
and maintain Canada's high quality system. Second, it provides 
fairness and flexibility for students by dispensing with 
traditional means tests and by allowing former students to repay 
their loans over a longer period of time based on their income. 
The third reason is that it reduces the cost to taxpayers by 
minimizing defaults, dispensing with interest subsidies and 
minimizing collection costs.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	I would like to spend a moment or two comparing the Reform 
and Liberal government commitments to financing higher 
education. I often note that some of the government's best ideas 
are ones that have been appropriated from the Reform Party. 
Canadian governments have gone out of their way to ignore this 
type of proposal for about 40 years, as well as the experiences 
with it in Australia and New Zealand. However only weeks after 
my motion was placed on the Order Paper experimentation with 
ICLR appeared in Bill C-28.
<P>
	During the debate on that bill, Reformers suggested that the 
whole system of student loans should be overhauled with a 
system of income contingent loan repayment. A few months 
later, lo and behold, the social policy discussion paper proposed 
just that. We do not mind when the government borrows good 
ideas from Reform. Our only concern is that it takes it so long to 
do it. We hope it does not bungle the implementation.
<P>
	There is however one significant difference between ICLRs as 
the government is proposing and ICLRs Reformers propose. 
Unlike the Liberal government's proposal, Reformers do not see 
student loan reform as a means of offloading government debt 
onto students or abdicating the federal government's role in the 
funding of higher education.
<P>
	We see income contingent loan repayment as a replacement 
for the current system of student loans and as a supplement to 
federal educational transfers. We believe the cash portion 
should be transferred directly to students in the form of 
non-repayable vouchers.
<P>
	On the other hand, the government's social policy discussion 
paper recommends eliminating the cash portion of federal 
education transfers. This would reduce the EPF portion of 
federal education funding by over 40 per cent and students 
would have to meet this shortfall.
<P>
	This is why students are so concerned about the government's 
proposals. Students are not stupid; they know the difference 
between a repayable loan and a non-repayable voucher. While 
ICLR is a valuable proposal in and of itself, students and 
prospective students legitimately fear that the sudden 
elimination of federal cash transfers will damage the quality of  
education, restrict access and saddle them with massive 
personal debt.
<P>
	In conclusion, I want to say just one word about the support of 
the ICLR system and where it should come on the list of 
Parliament's spending priorities. Everyone in the Chamber 
knows the Reform Party has made its reputation by calling for 
spending reductions that would balance the federal budget 
within the term of this Parliament. However as indicated in our 
zero in three plan for eliminating the deficit which we tabled last 
winter, one of the few areas where Reformers do not advocate 
spending reduction is in the area of financial support for 
post-secondary education.
<P>
	Make no mistake: Reform's fiscal goal is to eliminate the 
deficit. However post-secondary education as an investment in 
Canada's future is so important to us that we are prepared to 
make massive spending reductions in other areas in order to 
maintain current funding levels for education.
<P>
	I suggest to the House that of all the things the government 
does, of all the money it spends, its one true investment in the 
future is its investment in the education and training of the 
younger generation of Canadians.
<P>
	In this light, the inadequacy of the proposals put forward by 
the Minister of Human Resources Development in his 
discussion paper with respect to financing education frankly 
leads us to question the government's competence to set 
spending priorities in the exercise of social reform or deficit 
reduction.
<P>
	I ask the House and I ask members opposite: Is $1.1 billion in 
federal subsidies to the CBC more important than the funding of 
the education of young people? I do not think so. Is $40 million 
in federal funding for multiculturalism more important than 
funding the education of young people? I do not think so. Is $50 
million spent on bilingual bonuses for civil servants more 
important than the funding of the education of young people? I 
do not think so. Is $1.4 million spent on a film glorifying the 
murderers of Pierre Laporte more important than the funding of 
the education of young people? I do not think so. Is over $3 
billion in federal funding for subsidies to private business more 
important than the funding of the education of young people? I 
do not think so.
<P>
<B>(1355 ) </B>
<P>
	In conclusion, I hope the House will support this motion to 
reform student loans, especially in light of the proposals in the 
government's social policy discussion paper. Let us send a clear 
signal to the young people of the country that our highest 
priority is their education, their knowledge and skills, and their 
future.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7056"> 7056 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Geoff Regan (Halifax West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased the hon. member did eventually conclude. After saying 
in conclusion about three times, it was nice to see that he finally 
came to his conclusion.
<P>
	The government believes our competitiveness and therefore 
our prosperity depends on the skills and talents of individual 
Canadians. The policy choices we make today will have 
important consequences for the future. Based on that belief the 
federal government is ensuring access to student loans and 
increasing the amount of money students receive under the 
program.
<P>
	We have approached the provinces to undertake pilot projects 
in areas like school to work transition and learning technologies 
because we know Canadians will be placing more and not fewer 
demands on the educational system in the future. The resources 
we use must be carefully placed for the greatest impact. 
Research partnership with provincial governments will develop 
new ways of bringing appropriate instruction and training 
within the reach of all Canadians.
<P>
	Members already know we have to make the most of every tax 
dollar. They should also bear in mind there are few better 
investments to make with those tax dollars than helping our 
people to learn, whether they are children, teenagers, people in 
the workforce or people who want to rejoin the working world.
<P>
	It bears repeating that the government and most Canadians 
place a high value on post-secondary education. Canada and 
Canadians spend a great deal of money on higher education. 
Every college and university student in Canada owes the 
taxpayers a great deal, but the taxpayers benefit from a well 
educated workforce.
<P>
	Our college and university graduates repay the investment in 
many different ways. University graduates have an 
unemployment rate of 5.7 per cent; the rate of those who did not 
finish high school is more than 16 per cent. Post-secondary 
graduates earn about 40 per cent more than non-graduates over 
their lifetimes. Last year more than three million Canadians 
were on some kind of income security at one point.
<P>
	In a time of constraint, allocating resources becomes very 
difficult. There is greater need and there are more contending 
voices. Under these circumstances a government is obliged to 
listen carefully before choosing a policy.
<P>
	To justify support for higher education we can point to the fact 
that in the last three years there were 17 per cent more jobs for 
university graduates and 19 per cent fewer jobs for those who 
had not completed high school. By the year 2000, 45 per cent of 
jobs will require 16 or more years of education.
<P>
	With that in mind we have improved the Canada student loans 
program. These measures reflect the concerns raised over the 
years by the public, the provinces and student groups. There are 
many reasons for extending the benefits of student loans.
<P>
	There is no question that an investment in education now will 
reduce social assistance costs in the future. A sound education 
and access to training now will help following generations of 
Canadians to grow up in a more secure world. We must invest in 
a skilled workforce now to ensure that Canada and Canadians 
have real choices in the future.
<P>
	The work has already started. New financing arrangements 
under the Canada Student Financial Assistance Act will ensure 
income sensitive terms for borrowers as they repay their loans. 
Lenders will assume greater responsibility in servicing and 
recovering loans.
<P>
	Under the reform, students in similar situations will receive 
similar treatment in each participating province. Some students 
are worried that income contingent repayment will load them 
with a huge burden of debt. We made our intentions plain in the 
new Canada Student Financial Assistance Act.
<P>
	Take a look at what we did. We created four new grant 
categories under the student loans act. We responded to the 
needs of part time students, students with disabilities, single 
mothers and women in certain graduate programs.
<P>
	We want people to get a good education. Canada gets a high 
return from its investment in competent and well trained 
graduates. At the same time the government believes that those 
who benefit from post-secondary education must assume their 
responsibilities. When we make student loans for example, we 
believe those students are obliged to complete their studies and 
then repay the loans if they are able.
<P>
	In his motion the member calls for the government to consider 
the advisability of income contingent repayment. With all 
respect, the short answer is the government is already looking at 
income contingent repayment.
<P>
<B>(1400) </B>
<P>
	In May and June the government moved the Canada Student 
Financial Assistance Act, Bill C-28, through Parliament to 
royal assent. This act provides flexibility for ICR schemes. We 
are consulting with the provinces on possible pilot projects. The 
province of Ontario and the Department of Human Resources 
Development among others promoted and took part in a two-day 
symposium on income contingent repayment in later September. 
Work is underway with Statistics Canada to develop an 
economic model of ICR which will allow the testing out of 
various scenarios.
<P>
	The question we must ask about ICR or any other proposal 
about higher education is simply will this measure benefit 
Canadians by bringing college and university studies within the 
reach of everyone who wants to attend?
<P>
	The discussion of ICR is not taking place in a vacuum. As we 
all know, Canada's economic future will increasingly depend on 
our college and university graduates. The choices those students 
make will  determine the country's ability to compete and our 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7057"> 7057 </A></B>
<P>
potential to remain one of the best countries in the world, in my 
view the best.
<P>
	These brief remarks can hardly do justice to the concept of 
income contingent repayment. What I can say to the hon. 
member is the government is always willing to explore new 
ways to do more with fewer resources. We are already taking 
steps to investigate income contingent repayment.
<P>
	The reforms to the student loans program which are now being 
implemented do not represent the government's final word on 
ways to help Canadians finance their post-secondary studies. If 
there is convincing evidence that Canada would benefit from an 
income contingent repayment system the findings will speak for 
themselves.
<P>
	We do welcome good ideas. As a nation we spend 2.6 per cent 
of the value of our entire economy on post-secondary education 
every year. That is a lot of money. It is also the highest 
percentage of any country in the world. From high school 60 per 
cent of Canadian students now move on to college or university. 
We should bear in mind in a given year two-thirds of students do 
not take out student loans. The majority graduated with under 
$5,000 in student loans.
<P>
	When it comes to ICRs we have done our homework. At the 
same time some student associations believe that any benefits 
they receive from ICR loans would quickly be taken away by 
their provincial governments in the form of fee increases.
<P>
	We all know that we cannot impose educational fee schedules 
on provincial governments. They have gone up in recent years. 
Let me make this point. Education and training are shared 
responsibilities. Governments can offer students a wide choice 
of opportunities but Canadians have an obligation to invest in 
themselves.
<P>
	As a country we are willing to commit resources to education, 
but many Canadians still feel we are not getting the kind of 
graduates we need. We all face a new reality. When people stop 
learning they stop earning. We do not want to burden new 
graduates with huge debts. The new act makes that clear. We are 
working for a system that supports people who go to school, not 
one that penalizes their ambition.
<P>
	Throughout their working lives many if not most Canadians 
will need to learn new skills. Before that can happen all of us 
must learn new attitudes as Canadians, as governments, as 
businesses and associations. The challenge is accessibility. 
Potential students may have all the ability and all the desire in 
the world but we cannot expect them to undertake their studies 
without the means to finance their education and a realistic way 
to repay their loans.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too appreciate 
this opportunity, as the Official Opposition  critic for training 
and youth, to state the position of our party with regard to 
Motion M-291 put forward by the Leader of the Reform Party
<P>
	This motion, as you may recall, reads as follows: ``That, in the 
opinion of this House, the government should consider the 
advisability of amending the Canada Student Loans Act to 
include an income contingent loan repayment system [-]''
<P>
	On the face of it, the concept of repayment based on income 
seems to be to the students' advantage. If that were the intent, 
there would, of course, be very wide support for this motion on 
this side.
<P>
<B>(1405) </B>
<P>
	But since no clear definition of this concept exists as of yet, it 
can easily be used for other purposes.
<P>
	As it stands, the motion tabled by the leader of the Reform 
Party justifies, in our view, the approach advocated by this 
government, that is to say to have the students defray the costs of 
higher education.
<P>
	There is no need for me to emphasize the fact that, at more 
than $500 billion, our national debt is huge, but the point can 
easily be made that students are not to blame for this situation. It 
is not the doing of students pursuing higher education. I will not 
get into a debate on who is to blame. Let us just say that the 
blame does not rest only with this government. As we know, this 
debt has been spiralling, particularly since 1979. It started under 
the Liberals and continued with the Conservatives and is still 
growing today.
<P>
	Just now, I heard the member of the governing party say 
something that is very wrong. He said that responsibility for 
higher education is shared by the federal and provincial 
governments. The member has misread the Constitution, which 
clearly states that education and higher education are a 
provincial responsibility. My purpose today is not to debate the 
Constitution, but it is still worth recalling because even 
members of this House seem not to know that fact.
<P>
	Despite that, we know that so far the federal government has 
used the spending power, which is also in the Constitution, to 
invade this field. Since some of Quebec's taxes have been used 
until now to finance higher education under the federal 
government's authority, it was normal that we tried to obtain our 
share, but again, keep in mind that it is in provincial 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	Until now, we in Quebec have used our right to opt out with 
financial compensation, but this is not the discussion that I want 
to get into today.
<P>
	We believe that we must debate ICLR more thoroughly before 
setting up such a plan. Nevertheless, we oppose any use of ICLR 
if the ultimate goal is to make students pay the full cost of higher 
education, because tuition fees are already rising outrageously. 
Students' indebteness is also growing at an alarming rate,  and
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7058"> 7058 </A></B>
<P>
not just the national debt. Students' personal debt is already 
rising fast.
<P>
	Indeed, students have great difficulty repaying their loans 
once they graduate. According to an article that appeared in the 
October 18 edition of the <I>Globe and Mail</I>, the federal 
government is now owed close to $1 billion by former students 
unable to repay their loans. The new financial assistance law 
passed on June 23 will allow us to compensate by turning to 
banks, whose customary generosity is well known. These banks 
will not hesitate to recover students' debts.
<P>
	Here is another statistic: former students unable to pay for 
their studies make up 10 per cent of personal bankruptcy cases. 
What do they want to do now? They want to increase these 
students' debt load. Where are we heading, Mr. Speaker?
<P>
	Although figures are often contradictory, according to the 
Committee on Human Resources, the average Canadian student 
owes $11,000. At first sight, this does not seem very high, but it 
is the average and we know that the average includes those 
students who do not complete their college or university studies. 
This means that, at least in Quebec, the $11,000 average debt 
would be closer to $16,000 or $17,000 for those about to receive 
their B.A., and some even talk about a higher figure.
<P>
<B>(1410) </B>
<P>
	They mention an average of $21,000 for students with a 
master's degree and $37,000 for those with a Ph.D. The 
Federation of Students thinks that these figures will double. We 
can see what kind of debt load this could lead to.
<P>
	I do not think that the purpose of this motion is to help 
students. If we read paragraph (<I>a</I>) of the motion tabled by the 
leader of the Reform Party, we can see clearly that such is not the 
case. Its first objective is to ``reduce the cost to taxpayers of 
financing post-secondary education''. The goal is not to help 
students but to reduce the deficit. So we, of course, disagree 
with the motion as it now stands.
<P>
	A closer look at the text of the motion gives us a better 
understanding of the real motives of this party which, above all, 
wants to cut costs. I said that in paragraph <I>(a)</I>, the reason was to 
reduce the cost to taxpayers of financing post-secondary 
education. Like the Liberal government, the Reform Party 
recommends reducing the government's financial commitments 
to post-secondary education. Its purpose in presenting this 
motion is, first of all, to reduce government spending.
<P>
	Students will have to pay higher tuition fees as a result of 
government cutbacks. The Reform Party and the Liberal 
government describe income contingent loan repayment as a 
blessing for students, but they omit the fact that this measure 
comes at a time of major cuts in financing for post-secondary 
institutions. The blessing is rather dubious.
<P>
	We are against cuts in post-secondary education. If the 
government wants to withdraw from an area that is an 
exclusively provincial jurisdiction, it should do so across the 
board, not just financially. The government seems to want to 
control more while spending less. There is a contradiction here. 
We agree the system for repayment of student loans should be 
changed, but not in the way suggested by the Leader of the 
Reform Party or by the Liberal government under its current 
social security reform.
<P>
	Occasionally, references are made to countries like Sweden, 
Australia and New Zealand, which have introduced income 
contingent loan repayment systems. We know that New Zealand 
was forced to do so by the IMF. However, people tend to forget 
that the position of students and post-secondary education 
financing differs from one country to the next. It is therefore 
very difficult to apply in this country what is being done 
elsewhere, especially since the ICLR systems used in these 
countries are relatively recent and according to initial results 
have shown that they are not successful.
<P>
	Closer to home, a pilot project in Ontario had 1,000 openings 
and only 75 people took advantage of this opportunity, 75 out of 
a potential 1,000. Why? Because, students, the Canadian 
Federation of Students and the Quebec Federation, all the major 
student federations are against the system. Why? Because it 
only covers loans, and there are no provisions for bursaries.
<P>
	In Quebec, we have a bursary program that is very popular. 
Since I only have one minute left, I see the Chairman of the 
Human Resources Committee, and I happen to be a member of 
this committee which will organize wide-ranging consultations 
across the country. I think this is a concept that could be 
discussed, but I think we would need some in-depth 
consultation before getting it on the road.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it gives me great pleasure today to speak on the motion 
of my esteemed colleague, Motion No. 291, to amend the 
Canada Student Loans Act to include an income contingent loan 
repayment system in order to reduce the cost to the taxpayers of 
financing post-secondary education.
<P>
	Before I begin I would like to address my colleague's concern. 
This is not a turf war between provinces. We are bringing this 
motion forward for students across this country and we do not 
care what province they come from. I suggest that he look to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7059"> 7059 </A></B>
<P>
New Zealand and Australia to see two places where the motion 
has been brought into play and where it works.
<P>
D (1415) 
<P>
	If health is the most important thing that Canadians value then 
surely education is its greatest investment. A solid investment in 
education for the people of this country, particularly its youth, is 
the greatest guarantee that we can have to ensure the social and 
economic integrity of our society.
<P>
	Canadian universities are now in a state of serious financial 
crisis. Administrators, faculty and students alike agree that the 
fiscal crisis we are now in compromises their ability to provide 
for the best educational opportunities for the youth of this 
country.
<P>
	Underfunding on every campus is pervasive and the effects 
are extremely negative. Fat has already been removed from the 
system. We are now down to the bone and the bone is being 
chipped away.
<P>
	It was not so long ago that I graduated from the University of 
Toronto after spending seven years there. It has not become any 
easier since I graduated. Underfunding for the students is still a 
huge problem as an example. The percentage of students 
borrowing from 1982 to 1990 has risen from 44 to 47 per cent 
but the amount they owe when they get out has also increased 
dramatically, from $5,400 to $8,600 for merely a bachelors 
degree. This is especially prevalent among those of lower 
socioeconomic groups.
<P>
	The fact that costs are increasing is compounded by the fact 
that students cannot find summer jobs or part time jobs to offset 
their tuition fee. In effect they are caught between a rock and a 
hard place. On one hand they recognize that their best hope for a 
career and a future to become financially independent is to 
acquire post-secondary education. On the other hand they 
recognize that it is becoming increasingly more difficult to fund 
it but to drop out of school will commit them generally speaking 
to a life of low paying jobs with little potential for advancement.
<P>
	Recent studies have shown that the most important factor of 
gaining employment is in fact some form of post-secondary 
education. This fiscal crisis that students have can be amplified 
on a macro scale to our country by the fact that we have 
increasing deficits that add to the debt which produces 
increasing interest payments that extracted from the 
government and enables less money to be paid for programs 
such as education. I know we keep on harping on this fact but we 
will repeat it a thousand times until the government gets into its 
head what needs to be done.
<P>
	It is a vicious cycle that has to end. I am encouraging the 
Minister of Finance who has at long last admitted to the problem 
and has an understanding of what to do. However he does not 
have a plan. We do in this party. It is called the zero in three plan. 
Again I encourage the Minister of Finance to solicit our help in 
aiding him to make fair, equitable and constructive cuts to 
minimize the hardships for people while enabling this country to  
get the economic kickstart it is so desperately in need of. We 
have a plan. All he needs to do is ask us for it.
<P>
	We in this party have also looked for ways to ensure that every 
qualified student gets equal access to post-secondary education 
and not just the rich. In response to this my colleague has again 
brought up what I will refer to, and he has explained, as the 
ICLR, a concept that our party has been advocating for years. It 
has widespread support among students, administrators, and 
educators alike across the country. It has been applauded by 
these groups as being fair, more effective, and more fiscally 
responsible than any other way of dealing with the student loan 
system.
<P>
	Currently our system has the same loan limits and criteria and 
has not changed since 1984. It is behind the times; behind the 
times with the costs of education rising, the cost of living rising, 
and job availability decreasing. The loan system has become 
archaic and much less helpful for the student population and 
requires immediate revamping.
<P>
	When students graduate they often find it very difficult to find 
employment in the job market and this is becoming increasingly 
more difficult with time. Real incomes are down, job prospects 
are down, and they cannot pay back their loans. As a result of 
this, 70 per cent default in the first 12 to 18 months. This does 
not lead to a system that is self-sustaining and self-perpetuating 
for future generations. It costs the taxpayers money. It is a drain 
and an unnecessary one at that. It detracts money from higher 
education.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	How bad is this situation? Let us take a look. In 1992 loan 
defaulting became epidemic. The value of loans defaulted since 
1964 is in the order of a billion dollars. That represents 180,000 
students. The cost of extraction will be between $135 million 
and $270 million, money again removed from the educational 
system that could best be spent to provide for students in the 
trenches.
<P>
	The finance minister has also proposed to convert the cash 
contribution of education from $2.6 billion to zero by the year 
2006. This will produce a sharp rise in tuition fees and some say 
will double in the year 1997. The problem is becoming more 
critical in the very near future.
<P>
	This is the most interesting fact. Most people after they 
receive their post-secondary education ultimately do find a job. 
The problem occurs in the first few years after they graduate 
when they are not making much money at all. Because of the 
inflexibility of the current loan repayment system they are 
forced to default. This is a tragic loss to the taxpayer and our 
educational system and one that is unnecessary.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7060"> 7060 </A></B>
<P>
	That is why this ICLR system that we propose is a powerful 
tool to ensure greater certainty of return by tying the repayment 
scheme to the income of the student. It would not cost more 
to operate because it would operate through the existing income 
tax structure and would be easily managed.
<P>
	With the ICLR, this would produce a system that would be 
self-sustaining with a much higher rate of return and much more 
money being kept in the educational system. It is fair and 
non-discriminating.
<P>
	Education is indeed the hope of the future. In this world of 
globalization and specialization, with the rapid movement of 
capital across borders, economies are forced to change and 
change rapidly. That is why our educational system must be 
nimble in its ability to accommodate the needs of a rapidly 
changing economy.
<P>
	It is estimated that a student now graduating will change his or 
her profession four, five or more times in the course of their 
lifetime. With this in mind, we will need an expanded 
educational system and the ICLR will produce the funding for 
this system by stanching the losses incurred through defaulting.
<P>
	I implore the government to look ahead to the future, not five 
years but forty years down the line to anticipate the needs of our 
economy and provide for these educational opportunities now. 
This will require courage and foresight with this knowledge.
<P>
	Our country demands a strong workforce. A workforce can 
only be strong if it is given the proper educational opportunities 
that it deserves which will cost money, money that will be harder 
to find. That is why Motion No. 291 is a must to support. We in 
this party support it. I hope people across the House and across 
party borders will take it in their hearts to support this motion 
for students all across the country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (St. Paul's, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, to 
debate the motion thoroughly, we should take a moment to 
reflect upon what we expect from higher education.
<P>
	Canadians understand that we face tougher competition here 
at home and around the world. Knowledge based industries are 
becoming more important. We hear more about concepts like 
distance education and lifelong learning.
<P>
	The pace of change is accelerating. Knowledge intensive 
industries like telecommunications, environmental services, 
computer technology and biotechnology will provide economic 
growth now and into the future.
<P>
	The working world has changed dramatically. Canadians can 
now expect to change jobs several times in a working career, as 
the hon. member just said. No one can count on lifetime secure 
positions with a single employer.
<P>
	We know that a majority of jobs now being created will 
require at least 16 years of schooling. Higher education and 
continuous retraining will be necessary to remain competitive in 
the marketplace of the future.
<P>
	While Canadians are being told to acquire more education, 
tuition fees have been rising and changes to the family structure 
and the economic environment have been making it difficult for 
some people to return to school to complete their studies.
<P>
	Therefore, we take the hon. member's motion to consider the 
advisability of income contingent repayment quite seriously. 
Under ICR loan repayments would be adjusted to incomes. 
Graduates could begin their working lives knowing their student 
loan debts would not overwhelm their incomes. Such systems 
could reach potential students who are now deterred by the 
prospect of large, fixed loan repayments after they leave school.
<P>
<B>(1425 ) </B>
<P>
	As the member may know, the federal and provincial 
governments have discussed these concepts in the past. We will 
continue to examine them. An ICR student loan system deserves 
careful consideration. The potential cost implications will be a 
factor in our assessment because the federal government must 
reduce spending in all areas in order to address the deficit. The 
matter is as clear to the hon. leader of the Reform Party as it is to 
me. Cost will not be the only factor.
<P>
	The member's motion is an opportunity to elaborate on the 
discussion of income contingent repayment in the social 
security reform discussion paper. Every year the provinces 
receive a higher proportion of their post-secondary education 
funding as a result of the transfer of tax points. The overall 
transfer of funds from the federal government is not increasing. 
This means that while the tax point transfer increases provincial 
revenues, revenues that are supposed to be used to support 
educational institutions, the direct cash component of the 
transfer is declining.
<P>
	The provinces in the coming years will retain the tax points 
and they will steadily increase in value as the economy grows. 
The federal government is asking the provinces to consider 
shifting the current cash transfers into expanded loans and 
grants to students. The result would be a permanent $2 billion 
loan fund for sustainable student aid.
<P>
	The resource would continue to grow in the future and extend 
its benefits to succeeding generations of Canadians. This is not 
the blind and brutal cost cutting that some opponents of social 
security review fear. Designed properly and carefully 
administered, we could put in place a resource that would help 
educate generations of students.
<P>
	As a proposal for change the hon. member's motion is one 
more voice calling for creative ways to help every Canadian 
with ability and the desire to attend college or university. We 
have already taken measures to increase  and enhance student 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7061"> 7061 </A></B>
<P>
assistance and to help students make the school to work 
transition.
<P>
	We have high expectations of our graduates. We want them to 
maintain a prominent place for Canada among the advanced 
countries of the world. Considering our expectations, providing 
student aid to those in need is more than a commitment to 
fairness and equality; it is an investment in people. The amount 
and the conditions of that investment in student loans reflect the 
confidence we have in their abilities.
<P>
	We need a climate that encourages both entrepreneurs and 
investors. We need a highly skilled and adaptable workforce to 
keep pace with the competition in high tech industries around 
the world. Now Canadians want clear direction to guide their 
individual decisions on education and training.
<P>
	This generation of decision makers must give all Canadians 
realistic choices because now more than ever we need 
everyone's skills and capabilities mobilized to build our 
common future. In creating opportunities the government put its 
commitment to education and training on the record. We are 
keeping our promises.
<P>
	For 30 years the Canada student loans program has reduced 
financial obstacles to post-secondary education for over two 
million students. The new measures we introduced this past 
spring will make education more accessible to students with 
disabilities. Those students will help build larger, better 
educated and a more representative workforce.
<P>
	Other reforms reach out to a growing constituency of part 
time students by increasing their loan limit from $2,500 to 
$4,000. Under the new financing arrangement part time students 
will pay only the interest on their loans while they are still in 
school. Single parents will face fewer obstacles to their 
education. The new needs assessment acknowledges the reality 
of child care and transportation expenses as well as tuition and 
books.
<P>
	To address their present under-representation, women in 
engineering, mathematics and science programs at the doctoral 
level will be eligible for special opportunity grants of up to 
$3,000 per year.
<P>
	The Canada Student Financial Assistance Act reforms are 
designed to help those who need better access to post-secondary 
education. Today more than 900,000 full time and more than 
half a million part time students are pursuing a higher education. 
They do not just represent an investment in our future, they are 
the future.
<P>
	The new Canada Student Financial Assistance Act also 
enables the federal government to join provinces in pilot studies 
of income contingent replacement systems. The hon. member 
opposite might recall that we wrote this specific provision into 
the Canada Student Loans Act so we could investigate its 
usefulness.
<P>
	Income contingent replacement has some very attractive 
features. It can be designed to meet different categories of need 
while students are still in school. After  finishing school, the 
graduate who finds employment can pay off the loan at a rate 
that by definition is affordable.
<P>
	The student's risk is reduced because the loan would adjust to 
an unexpectedly low income. We have heard the term offloading 
from some students who oppose the ICR assistance, because 
they believe people will graduate with huge debtloads. ICR 
assistance can be deigned to protect the very small number of 
students who necessarily take on a high level of debt.
<P>
	Just as we have made provision for large debts in the Canada 
Students Financial Assistance Act, we could design a system 
that eased the burden for these situations. For the average 
student, the extra burden is estimated at about $2,000 a year. To 
put that in perspective, two years after graduation, the person 
with a post-secondary education is making 25 per cent more 
than someone with only a high school diploma.
<P>
<B>(1430 ) </B>
<P>
	If students take out a loan to finance their education, they are 
the best judges of how much debt they can assume. If they are 
wrong about their future earnings, they are only required to 
repay what they can afford.
<P>
	In effect, borrowers are protected from the risk of being 
unable to pay and their borrowing relates to their ability to pay 
rather than that of their parents. We do not intend to bury our 
students under a mountain of debt, far from it. We will support 
their efforts to get the education they want. We want them to go 
on and hold jobs and create jobs. When that happens, the student 
loans system benefits all of us.
<P>
	The hon. member's motion and the new Canada Student 
Financial Assistance Act both address the aim of meeting the 
challenge of allocating education costs fairly between 
governments and students.
<P>
	Some groups oppose an ICR while others believe there will be 
benefits. The Association of Universities and Colleges has 
proposed an ICR type system. The Association of Community 
Colleges is generally in favour. Some student associations are 
interested in the concept. I note that some institutions have 
concern with the proposals in the social security review with 
respect to EPF transfers.
<P>
	We are in dialogue with these institutions and welcome their 
active participation in the social security review. Their ideas and 
support are extremely important for all Canadians.
<P>
	There are no exact models elsewhere in the world that tell us 
how ICR would work in Canada, in the Canadian environment. 
We must evaluate the idea in the Canadian context. We want to 
know if we can build a comprehensive system to help
<P>

<B><A NAME="7062"> 7062 </A></B>
<P>
students in need without putting a greater burden on the 
taxpayer.
<P>
	Social programs save money by putting resources where they 
belong, training and employment skills for those who need them 
and protection for those people who need help.
<P>
	The current system is not doing a good job. It keeps some 
Canadians in poverty and dependence. Any new system must 
help people learn the skills, develop the skills they need to get 
back on their feet.
<P>
	We hope that the social security review will bring to light 
more interesting and creative concepts. It is safe to assume we 
will need flexible and responsive systems to meet the training 
requirements of the Canadian workforce.
<P>
	In the final analysis, Canadians want a system that works. We 
know that success in advanced technologies is the key to a 
prosperous and caring society. The key to future success is 
advanced education. Canadians must share in the benefits and 
costs of academic success.
<P>
	We expect many more Canadians will enroll in our colleges 
and universities. Young and old alike will want the skills that 
keep them employed in well paying and challenging jobs. The 
social security review will examine anything that could 
contribute to this success. Together as partners, we can manage 
our educational resources to meet the needs of every student. 
When our students succeed their achievements benefit all of us.
<P>
	The hon. member's motion has illuminated one possible 
response to the need for fair and effective student loans. 
Through this debate within the context of the social security 
review and elsewhere we will continue to seek out, listen to and 
investigate every possible means by which Canadians can build 
prosperous and productive futures through training and 
education.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There are approximately seven 
minutes left. The hon. member for Capilano-Howe Sound has 
approximately seven minutes. He will have three minutes in the 
next two-hour session.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Finance this week like never before cut 
through the traditional Liberal ideology and wishful thinking 
when he warned that spending cuts are needed or the country 
will go bankrupt.
<P>
	The search for such cuts is now on. I predict confidently that 
the post-secondary education sector will not be spared such cuts 
any more than any other of the many worthy spending programs 
in our society except those serving the truly needy, handicapped 
and aged.
<P>
	If this education sector joins all the other recipients of 
government funds in the traditional refusal to accept cuts and 
the government accedes to their wishes, the coming financial 
crisis very soon will make the recently proposed cuts seem 
trivial.
<P>
	Under either scenario, I believe that it is in the self-interest of 
the higher education sector to consider methods for dealing with 
the coming financial difficulties.
<P>
	I recommend this course of action because I am totally 
convinced of the economic and social merit of higher education. 
How could it be any other way after 30 years of university 
teaching, the experience of having seen first hand many 
generations of young people gaining knowledge and maturity 
that prepared them for successful careers in their lives. I do so 
because I am a realist and I wish to see a continued, strong 
higher education industry in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1435) </B>
<P>
	The financial innovation that will help this sector overcome 
the upcoming financial problems is found in the private 
member's bill for the establishment of income contingent 
student loans which we are here to discuss today. What are these 
innovative types of loans? The idea is simple. Students receive 
government loans that they can use to pay tuition at institutions 
of higher learning. The loans plus accrued interest are repaid in 
instalments once the borrowers have reached a specified level of 
income. Revenue Canada would serve as a collection agency at 
low cost.
<P>
	Detailed legislation has to address a number of important 
characteristics of this system such as the maximum amount a 
person can borrow, the interest to be charged, the income 
threshold when repayment starts, the period of required 
amortization which determines the maximum annual income tax 
surcharge.
<P>
	While one should never underestimate the devil that lurks in 
these details, enough research and practical experience with the 
principle of income contingent loans exist to make me confident 
that it is workable, efficient and equitable. The program would 
give students the ability to pay more of the true cost of their 
education. Institutions of higher learning could use this ability 
to recover more of their operating costs, replacing the funds lost 
as a result of the government's present financial problems.
<P>
	Students certainly will not like having to absorb more of the 
cost of their own education. I would be very disappointed if they 
did not launch massive protests and repeat all the old chestnuts 
about the unfairness of it all, how it prevents those with low 
income parents from obtaining higher education and so on. I 
sympathize with these students. They have had a good deal for a 
long time and very few people will want to give it up when they 
have had such a good deal.
<P>
	I enjoyed having these benefits when I was a student. The time 
of free lunches and good deals is over. I wish it were not so, that 
we could go back to the past when the taxpayer paid the full fare. 
No wishing will bring it back. The country is heading for 
bankruptcy and students will have to share in the burden of 
preventing this untold disaster. Do not shoot the messenger.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="7063"> 7063 </A></B>
<P>
	A few facts should be considered by those concerned about 
the fairness and efficiency of the proposed system. Canada 
devotes a large amount of resources to higher education. The 
direct and indirect annual costs are about $15,000 per student 
per year which in total are exceeded only by the costs of health 
care.
<P>
	There are over 100 universities and other institutions of 
higher learning for 29 million Canadians. Nova Scotia has 32 
university places per 1,000 population. Analogous figures are 
21 for Ontario and 13 for British Columbia.
<P>
	As a result of past investment in higher education 17 per cent 
of Canada's population hold university degrees. This compares 
very favourably with 7 per cent in France and 8 per cent in the 
United Kingdom.
<P>
	Students should also consider the following fact about their 
ability to pay a larger share of the true cost of higher education. I 
am sorry, I have to wind down. I will have to continue next time, 
but the point is that the private rate of return to higher education 
is-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Thanks to the graciousness of the 
parliamentary secretary, it is proposed that we not see the clock. 
Is that agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I really appreciate the generosity 
of the members opposite.
<P>
	Census data show that Canadians with bachelor degrees on 
average earn higher incomes than Canadians with lower levels 
of educational attainment. The present value of these lifetime 
income premiums is much greater than the costs involved in 
obtaining the degrees. These costs consist of tuition fees at 
recent levels, costs of books and supplies and, quantitatively 
dwarfing all the other costs, the earnings forgone while in 
university.
<P>
	The rates of return on these investments in recent decades 
have been about 7 to 10 per cent. This is a very good rate of 
return. It is capable of absorbing very substantial increases in 
tuition costs without becoming less than the real long run rates 
of return available in financial market instruments.
<P>
	Students concerned about the fairness of our society's 
spending and taxation system should be aware that the vast bulk 
of university graduates come from families in the middle and 
higher end of the income distribution. Yet a substantial 
proportion of the tax revenue used to pay for their education is 
collected from Canadians with lower incomes. In effect, the 
present system forces low income earners to subsidize those 
with higher incomes to get their university education.
<P>
	The proposed system will correct this inequity. Middle and 
higher income families will pay a larger share of the higher 
education benefits they receive. If bad luck prevents them from 
enjoying the benefits of higher education, these students will not 
have to repay.
<P>
	Students concerned about the access of the poor to higher 
education are reminded that under the present system the poor 
are often excluded because they do not  qualify for fixed 
repayment loans. Under this system, no questions are asked and 
they will have access without any difficulty. They have to repay 
only if they are able to do so.
<P>
	Finally, I would like to raise a point that is not often 
discussed. Under the present arrangement, students choices are 
severely limited. Programs offered by state monopolies of 
higher education have been slow to react to the demands of 
students in a changing world. It is well known that the solution 
to these problems lies in the use of vouchers, that is, 
non-repayable certificates given to students and cashable at 
institutions of their choice. The Reform Party supports the use 
of such vouchers and the resultant empowerment of students.
<P>
	The income contingent loans program moves the system 
closer to the ultimate goal of vouchers. It similarly empowers 
students to obtain study programs that they like rather than those 
that professors and bureaucrats think they should like. By 
spending their loan money in institutions of their choice, they 
encourage them to grow and force others to shrink. Since they 
spend their own repayable money, they have the proper 
incentives to make wise choices.
<P>
	The time for income contingent loans for students in higher 
education has come. This proposed system offers an efficient 
and equitable way out of the problems created by the country's 
financial crisis.
<P>
	I hope the government will take note of this private member's 
bill introduced by the Reform Party and debated today and that it 
will offer promptly legislation to put it into effect.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The Chair would thank the members 
for their co-operation and assistance to the member who just 
spoke.
<P>
	The hour provided for the consideration of Private Members' 
Business has expired. Pursuant to Standing Order 93 the motion 
is dropped to the bottom of the order of precedence on the Order 
Paper.
<P>
	The House stands adjourned until Monday at 11 a.m. pursuant 
to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 2.44 p.m.)
