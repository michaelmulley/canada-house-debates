	<B>Ms. Colleen Beaumier (Brampton, Lib.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should introduce legislation to 
protect public servants who report wasteful spending, illegal activities or any other 
incidents which threaten the integrity of the government of Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak on Motion No. 263. 
Given the importance of this issue and the need to hear from as 
many members as possible, I ask for unanimous consent of the 
House to share my 20 minutes with the member for Ottawa West.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Is that agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Beaumier:</B> Mr. Speaker, we are fortunate to have in Canada 
a public service which is the envy of the world. It is not overstating 
the fact to say that our public service is of the highest calibre.
<P>
	Despite the severe cutbacks and historic change that the public 
service is currently enduring, Canadians continue to enjoy service 
from among the best and the brightest. However, the public service 
cannot maintain its tradition of excellence if the professionals who 
make up this body are not empowered toward excellence.
<P>
	This means not only providing the best training and support, it 
means providing protection against those who do not aspire to the 
high standards met daily by the majority of public servants. It is the 
first step in the creation of a regime which empowers those 
committed to excellence to have a method of dealing with those 
who are not.
<P>
<B>(1105 )</B>
<P>
	This motion is designed to address the absence of any legislated 
protection for public servants who report any fraudulent activities, 
suspected or otherwise. As members well know, public servants in 
Canada do not enjoy any  special protection from reprisals should 
they report any fraudulent activity on the part of their superiors. We 
lack the mechanisms necessary to ensure safe reporting of an 
investigation of such activities.
<P>
	All too often, the only course that public servants feel they have 
open to them is to report their concerns to the media. Yet the media 
is often unable to act until after an abuse of power has occurred 
because it really is not news until it happens.
<P>
	This is a problem that we need to address in a twofold manner. 
First, we need to construct an investigative regime which will 
protect the identity of the reporter. Second, we need to create a 
climate where individuals who contemplate such activities know 
they simply cannot get away with this kind of behaviour. The way 
to achieve this second objective is to be very effective in our 
treatment of the first.
<P>
	I have worded this motion in very broad terms because 
parliamentarians from all parties, academics, interested 
organizations and, of course, public servants should have a say in 
the creation of this legislation. It is particularly important to hear 
from public servants to determine the shape this whistle blower 
legislation should take. It is the public servants who must feel that 
any such regime affords them the kind of protection to be effective.
<P>
	The auditor general, in his 1995 annual report, stated that about 
one-third of public servants believe that their job security would be 
threatened if they were to report a conflict of interest involving a 
superior or senior manager.
<P>
	I have been approached on several occasions by constituents 
who are public servants with reports of suspected abuse in their 
departments. My action in these instances was to report the 
suspected abuse while preserving the identity of my constituents. I 
have done this and their concerns were investigated. However, I 
was not happy with the process or lack of process to adequately 
deal with these complaints. It appears that the fox minds the hen 
house.
<P>
	I am quite confident that my experience is not unique among 
members of Parliament. The experiences of my constituents are 
certainly not unique. We need whistle blower legislation.
<P>
	There is a lack of balance in the current accountability regime. 
Under the terms of the Financial Administration Act, public 
servants are required to report any suspected  fraud or face a fine of 
up to $5,000 or five years in prison. However, there is no protection 
for those who act in compliance with the Financial Administration 
Act. We need to balance the requirement to report abuse with 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7862"> 7862 </A></B>
<P>
protection for whistle blowers who act in accordance with the law 
and in the best interests of Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	The legislation which this motion proposes the government 
introduce would serve two functions. First, it would provide 
protection for public servants who feel reprisal if they report abuse 
and it would function as an incentive for public servants to follow 
the letter of the Financial Administration Act and report any 
suspected fraud. It would also have an additional, very important 
effect: to create a chilly climate for fraudulent behaviour.
<P>
	Although it would be up to the government to create the 
legislation, I would hope that process would include extensive 
public hearings to ensure that we are able to create effective whistle 
blower legislation.
<P>
	The testimony that would come from these hearings would 
greatly assist the government in creating an effective whistle 
blower regime.
<P>
	There has been some excellent work done in Canada on this 
issue. Two initiatives in particular deserve mention. In 1986, the 
Ontario Law Reform Commission released a position paper calling 
for the creation of an office of special counsel whose purpose 
would be to receive allegations of wrongdoing from public 
servants. The OSC would launch an investigation, if warranted, 
while ensuring the confidentiality of the complainant.
<P>
	In 1994, the Professional Institute of the Public Service of 
Canada released a series of recommendations as part of its 
document entitled ``Lifting the Silence''. The institute 
recommended the establishment of the office of the ombudsman 
assigned to a function similar to that of the proposed OSC. The 
office of the ombudsman would also have the authority to ensure 
that corrective action is taken. We should draw on this work and 
other initiatives in this area in creating the whistle blower regime.
<P>
<B>(1110 )</B>
<P>
	My colleague, the member for Portneuf, has introduced Bill 
C-318 on this issue. I appreciate his concern with this issue and I 
know that he is sincere in his efforts to address the very serious lack 
of whistle blower legislation. Unfortunately, I am not convinced 
that his bill would create an adequate whistle blower regime. The 
problem lies in the fact that he has prescribed a pivotal role to the 
office of the auditor general.
<P>
	Under his proposed legislation the auditor general would 
investigate all complaints and the public servant in question would 
be protected from reprisal by the auditor general. I raise this bill 
because some would argue that this is a very natural role for the 
auditor general. I think that we have to be very cautious in this 
regard. If we were  to review the literature on the auditor general 
among academics and practitioners we would find a real concern 
with the direction that office is currently taking.
<P>
	We often forget that the office of the auditor general was initially 
created for a very specific purpose, to conduct probity audits: that 
is to ensure that government money is being spent the way the 
government has said it is spending money. This has evolved into 
what is known as a comprehensive audit where the auditor general 
is making many value judgments on the manner in which the 
government funding is spent. The function of the office has become 
far more politicized and has gone far beyond its intended scope.
<P>
	To assign a role to this office which includes investigating 
allegations of fraudulent activity of all kinds and protecting whistle 
blowers would represent a fundamental new responsibility. I am 
not ruling out such a possibility in the future but I think that we 
should consult with and examine the office of the auditor general 
before assigning such a role.
<P>
	Finally, as a member of the Liberal Party of Canada, I am 
introducing this motion to ensure that the government fulfils a 
1993 election commitment to introduce whistle blower legislation. 
At an Ottawa press conference held on September 9, 1993, a one 
page document was released which contained a commitment to 
create an effective whistle blower regime. That document reads in 
part: ``Public servants who blow the whistle on illegal or unethical 
behaviour should be protected. A Liberal government will 
introduce whistle blowing legislation''. It is important that this 
commitment be kept. The legislation is long overdue.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dalphond-Guiral:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
If you were to seek it, I believe you would find unanimous consent 
to have the recorded divisions scheduled for this evening on the 
amendment of the hon. member for Saanich-Gulf Islands, and on 
the motion of the official opposition tabled by the hon. member for 
Shefford to be deferred until tomorrow, after Government Orders.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Does the official opposition whip have 
the unanimous consent of the House?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Could the hon. member succinctly 
explain to the member for Brampton what this is about, or does the 
member for Brampton now understand? It was explained to her? 
Very well.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Is there unanimous consent to move the motion?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jackson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I did not hear what happened.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7863"> 7863 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have just been made aware of 
this motion. I would like an opportunity to confirm that 
consultations have taken place. Would the member mind 
withdrawing it for the moment and perhaps we could come back 
to it after the debate proceeds, since I am the next speaker?
<P>
<B>(1115 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There are actually two parts to it. One, 
there has to be unanimous consent to hear the motion and, second, 
to pass it. We have basically gone through the first step but not the 
second. We will get back to this question in 10 minutes.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in the debate on the motion tabled in the House 
by the hon. member for Brampton.
<P>
	The motion proposes that legislation be introduced to protect 
public servants who report wasteful spending, illegal activities or 
any other incidents which threaten the integrity of the government 
of Canada.
<P>
	This means that such legislation could include appropriate 
sanctions against public service managers taking disciplinary 
measures as a form of reprisal against employees who disclose 
serious wrongdoing by their employer.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This proposal, like most legislation that comes before us, 
particularly in the area of wrongdoing, is not intended for the 99 
per cent of people affected by it who act properly, who look always 
to do that which is right, fair and just and a responsible use of 
taxpayer money. However, like all laws that come before us, they 
are designed for those few who would choose to abuse a privilege, 
to act with disrespect or harmfully or viciously toward other 
members of society or toward their responsibilities.
<P>
	A few years ago the previous auditor general suggested that we 
should set up a snitch line so that public service employees could 
call up and report abuses in their departments by other employees 
or managers. I was not terribly in favour of that because it sounded 
too much like repressive regimes around the world that have turned 
their citizenry into a nation of spies against their friends, relatives 
and co-workers.
<P>
	However, I do think we want to encourage and, as my colleague 
from Brampton has said, the Financial Administration Act 
requires, members of the public to report any incident of abuse of 
public resources and to suffer consequences if they do not. On the 
other hand, employees are reluctant to do that because of fear of 
suffering the consequences through loss of a job, through the lack 
of opportunities for promotion and training. In  other words, they 
fear suffering real and significant consequences in their own 
careers and advancement.
<P>
	What the member for Brampton is trying to do is ask that we 
look at legislation that would ensure that kind of punitive activity 
cannot take place because a public service employee has exercised 
his or her legal responsibility and duty to the country by reporting 
wrongdoing.
<P>
	It recognizes that whistleblowing can be in the public interest 
and particularly if wasteful spending or illegal activities or even the 
integrity of the government itself is at issue. We are all interested in 
any proposal that would lead to improvements in the way 
government programs are delivered. It would lead to greater 
efficiencies and effectiveness and to the elimination of waste, 
mismanagement or misconduct. That is why I had some regrets that 
the motion before us is not votable. We want to try to foster that 
attitude in the public service where employees feel free to suggest 
better ways and feel free to come forward with knowledge about 
how public money is being wasted or used illegally.
<P>
	Right now there is no mechanism to protect them. There are a 
number of measures in place that certainly provide opportunities. 
The grievance process in the public service, as part of legislation, is 
certainly one such mechanism whereby people who feel that they 
have been wrongly denied opportunities, perhaps for doing 
something that was their public duty to do, can certainly complain. 
But that is a long, onerous and often damaging process. It is a very 
confrontational process.
<P>
<B>(1120 )</B>
<P>
	The harassment policy prevents an employer or manager from 
treating employees in an abusive way. This would certainly be the 
case if retaliation for the exposure of wrongdoing were involved.
<P>
	The hon. member for Brampton is not alone in having dealt with 
constituents who know of wrongdoing or who suspect wrongdoing 
in the public service who are afraid to come forward to make a 
complaint to correct the waste and abuse of public resources.
<P>
	I do not believe that legislation such as this would be a blanket 
answer. Legislation cannot protect against the bad will and 
malicious nature of some people. I say that emphasizing that laws 
such as this are written for a very small percentage of people who 
do not behave in a proper manner, either in their personal lives or in 
their work as public service employees. Legislation such as this 
would be irrelevant to 99 per cent of public servants, perhaps more.
<P>
	We have to look at how legislation such as this might affect other 
obligations of employees. For instance, confidentiality is an 
obligation of all federal public servants by virtue of the Official 
Secrets Act and the oath or affirmation of secrecy taken by public 
servants upon entering the service.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7864"> 7864 </A></B>
<P>
	It is not a simple matter. I do not pretend that legislation could 
necessarily guarantee protection. However, it is an issue which 
Parliament should look into. Can we ensure that our employees 
feel perfectly comfortable when they identify serious faults and 
perhaps illegalities in coming forward in the public interest and 
making that information known? Unless the information is known, 
nothing can be done to correct the situation.
<P>
	A number of other jurisdictions have taken such measures. We 
have a number of models which we could consider. This is 
something which employees of the public service have been asking 
of government for some time. I compliment the hon. member for 
Brampton for bringing forward this motion today.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The opposition whip, I understand, 
wishes to defer the two supply votes from today after Government 
Orders to tomorrow after Government Orders.
<P>
	Did I hear a no?
<P>
	If I understand her correctly, the hon. member simply wishes to 
defer the vote on the two supply motions scheduled for today to 
tomorrow after Government Orders.
<P>
	I realize that the hon. deputy whip has not had time to speak with 
her colleagues. Does she wish a further deferral of the putting of 
this question to the House?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> We are prepared to deal with it now, if you wish, 
Mr. Speaker.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent in the House 
for the hon. opposition whip's proposal?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as its name 
indicates, Motion M-263, presented by the member for Brampton, 
would protect public servants against reprisals for having, 
confidentially and in good faith, reported certain abuses by federal 
public servants.
<P>
	This motion does not set a historic precedent as such. Our 
neighbour to the south, the United States, is increasingly favouring 
legal protection for employees who blow the whistle on unlawful 
practices. Whistle blowers in the American civil service are 
afforded some protection under the Civil Service Reform Act.
<P>
	From state to state, in the U.S., protection varies considerably, 
with some states having legislation that covers both private and 
public sector employers, some having legislation that covers just 
one of these sectors, and yet others having legislation aimed only at 
certain specific problems or industries.
<P>
	In many countries, particularly in the Commonwealth, there is 
more specific legislation concerning such areas as employment, 
health or the environment, that protect employees against reprisals 
to which they might be subject for availing themselves of the rights 
conferred on them under such legislation.
<P>
	Ontario is the only province in Canada that has brought in 
legislation to provide general protection for whistle blowers in the 
public sector. The 1993 public service and staff relations amending 
legislation contains a part IV dealing with protection for whistle 
blowers. Although the bill received royal sanction on December 
14, 1993, this part IV is not yet in effect, and since the 
Conservatives came into power in that province, no one knows 
when it will be.
<P>
	All bills comparable to Motion M-263 presented to date in the 
House of Commons have shared the objective of protecting federal 
public servants who make allegations of wrongdoing by their 
employers.
<P>
	Since 1987, there have been four such legislative measures 
debated in the House. I would like to list these: Bill C-229 by the 
former Conservative member Bill Vankoughnet; Motion M-57, by 
the former Solicitor General of Canada, the Hon. Bob Kaplan; the 
motion by the former Conservative minister, the Hon. Alan 
Redway, and finally Bill C-293 by former NDP member Joy 
Langan.
<P>
	In addition to these legislative measures in the House of 
Commons, several organizations have made submissions, or 
indicated their agreement in principle with a bill such as the one 
proposed by today's motion. Those publicly stating the necessity of 
such a measure include the Public Service Alliance of Canada, the 
Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada, and the 
Auditor General of Canada.
<P>
	On the other hand, certain political parties have taken a stand in 
this debate on ethics in the public service. The Liberal Party of 
Canada, the New Democratic Party and, of course, the Bloc 
Quebecois, have stated their intention to propose or support such a 
measure. As for the Reform Party, they have been endlessly stating 
since their election that they will support any measure aimed at 
eliminating waste by government institutions.
<P>
	The doggedness of the Public Service Alliance of Canada in 
promoting such a legislative measure is certainly undisputable. On 
a number of occasions, it has criticized the situation and 
recommended passing a bill proposing the same objectives as 
Motion M-263.
<P>
	In November 1994, in its document ``In the public interest'', one 
of the recommendations the Alliance made was:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the Government of Canada pass legislation aimed at protecting members of 
the Public Service who disclose government wrongdoing, reprehensible practices 
and waste.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7865"> 7865 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	In a press release dated May 12, 1995, the Alliance stated that 
speedy passage of the bill on whistle-blowers promised by the 
Liberal government during the election campaign would go far 
towards resolving the ethical dilemmas facing federal public 
service employees.
<P>
	On May 11, 1994, the Bloc member for Portneuf tabled Bill 
C-248 in this House for first reading.
<P>
	On June 19, 1996, the hon. member for Portneuf tabled Bill 
C-318 for first reading.
<P>
	We feel there are a number of reasons why the auditor general 
should be allowed to receive and investigate complaints referred to 
as whistle-blowing.
<P>
	The auditor general is by law responsible for the internal audit of 
the federal administrative apparatus. The auditor general is also 
known for his professionalism and the relevance of his reports.
<P>
	Finally, the auditor general's office operates at arm's length from 
the government and politicians, which gives it a certain status and 
impartiality.
<P>
	Considering the number of bills tabled previously by members 
of all parties; considering the election promises made by the Prime 
Minister and his Liberal colleagues regarding the introduction of 
such a measure; considering that all other political parties support 
such a proposal; considering that the unions are unanimous in their 
support for a tool including provisions that would allow 
whistle-blowing; also considering the number of government 
agencies that recommend this type of legislation and, finally, the 
urgent need for increased transparency and integrity in federal 
institutions, we should support Motion M-263.
<P>
	For all the reasons just mentioned, the Bloc Quebecois will 
support the motion tabled in the House by the hon. member for 
Brampton.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to address Motion No. M-263 brought forward by the 
member from Brampton. Motion No. M-263 asks:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should introduce legislation to 
protect public servants who report wasteful spending, illegal activities or any other 
incidents which threaten the integrity of the government of Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Clearly Canadians want and expect their government to conduct 
their business openly and honestly and that is what this motion is 
about.
<P>
	The principles of this motion are similar to the principles of the 
Reform Party. The Reform Party has always advocated 
transparency in the federal government and the elimination of 
waste in public funds. As a result, Reform members have asked this 
government to introduce whistle blowing legislation in the past. 
For  example, the Reform member for St. Albert asked the 
President of the Treasury Board to introduce legislation to protect 
whistle blowers. We have yet to see this legislation introduced in 
the House.
<P>
	Public servants must not only be allowed but also encouraged to 
report practices that would cause a specific and substantial danger 
or prejudice to the public health, safety or welfare, or entail 
wasteful or unjustified public spending. Employers should not be 
allowed to discourage, suspend or impose financial penalties on 
any employee who makes a disclosure. Public servants must be 
protected against employer reprisals in retaliation for disclosures 
that are made in good faith.
<P>
	These measures were forward in the House before, as mentioned 
by my colleagues both on the Liberal side and the Bloc side, by the 
Bloc member for Portneuf as Bill C-248. The fact that this issue has 
not been deemed votable both times it has been brought forward 
before the House makes it rather clear that the government does not 
want to see whistle blowing legislation before this House.
<P>
	Before the last election the Liberals promised to introduce 
whistle blowing legislation. In their approach to the public service 
the Liberals promised: ``Public servants who blow the whistle on 
illegal or unethical behaviour should be protected''. That is pretty 
clear. ``A Liberal government will introduce whistle blowing 
legislation in the first session of the new Parliament''. Well guess 
what. The first session has past, we are into the second session and 
there is still no whistle blowing legislation.
<P>
<B>(1135 )</B>
<P>
	Many other countries are far ahead of Canada in this area. For 
example in the United States they have the false claims act. Under 
it whistle blowers receive 25 per cent of the savings of any whistle 
blowing event that they unearth. Over the first six years of 
operation of that act 407 lawsuits were filed and 37 were settled for 
a total of about $147 million in savings. The average whistle 
blower received $400,000. England has similar legislation. I 
believe this is the crux of what we are talking about here, protection 
at the same time as incentive.
<P>
	The Americans saved $147 million by people within their 
departments saying there was waste and showing that there was 
waste. The incentive was there. Twenty-five per cent of the savings 
that they identified went into their own pockets. It works very well. 
The government saves on the one hand, the employee picks up on 
the other hand and the protection is there. It would be worthwhile 
to look at some of the practices followed in other countries to draft 
a plan of our own.
<P>
	We also have on the books existing legislation that makes it 
necessary for this government to introduce whistle blowing 
legislation. Such an act is necessary  because at the same time that 
our Financial Administration Act states that a public servant who 
fails to report suspected fraud can be fined up to $5,000 or sent to 
prison for up to five years, there is no corresponding protection for 
whistle 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7866"> 7866 </A></B>
<P>
blowers who act in accordance with the law. Clearly we require a 
balance.
<P>
	The government knows full well that there is waste and abuse in 
the public service and the introduction of such an act will bring 
many of these wasteful practices under control. This type of bill 
would help restore the credibility of the government and the 
politicians who are, to a certain extent, responsible for public 
service waste and abuse.
<P>
	As my colleagues have mentioned before, the auditor general has 
covered this. He emphasized the need for action on this issue in his 
1995 report. The auditor general wrote: ``Canadians are concerned 
about integrity in government and they have the right to expect the 
highest ethical standards in their governments. Leadership by 
members of Parliament, ministers and deputy ministers is critical 
to maintaining ethical standards and performance in government''.
<P>
	The auditor general went on to say: ``If Canadians do not trust 
their governments to act ethically, governments will find that their 
actions have less and less legitimacy and effectiveness. Thus we 
believe that it is important to discuss the ethics in government and 
to take action to maintain and promote ethics within government''.
<P>
	The Liberals promised in their red book to restore honesty and 
integrity to government yet their actions speak otherwise. If we had 
honesty and integrity, we would not need Motion No. M-263. We 
would not need to waste this House's time asking the government 
to follow through on its election promise. However as it is, there is 
a need to protect public servants whose efforts to ensure honesty 
and integrity in our institutions are threatened by their government. 
Thus we need this legislation.
<P>
	It is ironic that on the one hand we have a Liberal backbencher 
pushing to fulfil a Liberal promise yet on the other hand cabinet is 
acting to undermine the Liberal member's efforts. This is not a 
partisan issue. It is simply common sense. It is in the best interests 
of Canadians and the federal government to introduce this 
legislation.
<P>
	In conclusion, I support Motion No. M-263. I believe that there 
is broad support for this motion within the House. We have heard it 
from the Liberal side, we have heard it from the Bloc and Reform. 
As such I would ask for unanimous consent in this House that this 
motion be deemed votable.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member is seeking unanimous 
consent that the matter be made votable. Is there unanimous 
consent colleagues to have this matter made votable?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Colleagues, I hear a no and therefore it 
cannot be made votable.
<P>
<B>(1140 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Parliamentary Secretary to President 
of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
participate in the debate today on the motion tabled by my 
colleague, the hon. member for Brampton, advocating legislation 
to protect public servants who report wasteful spending, illegal 
activities or any other incidents that threaten the integrity of the 
Government of Canada. The term whistle blowing has been used to 
describe such activities.
<P>
	While the matter of legislating whistle blowing protection has 
been given a thorough airing in this House in the past, it is useful to 
bring it forward on occasion to see if the issues are real, if there are 
current mechanisms in place to assist public service employees 
who are fulfilling the legitimate requirements of their jobs, and if 
these mechanisms continue to provide the required degree of 
comfort for employees. It is useful as well to look at the experience 
of others in the area of whistle blower protection.
<P>
	In Canada within the public service context, whistle blowing is 
rather loosely defined as making public disclosure of practices or 
actions related to fraud, mismanagement or waste. It is interesting 
to note that the current motion also includes a reference to items 
which threaten the integrity of the Government of Canada. It is 
very important for employees within the public service and in the 
private sector to have pride in their jobs and in their organization. 
Also I feel strongly that employees want to identify in a positive 
way with their employment and with their employer.
<P>
	The issue which arises is what to do when an employee sees 
situations involving potential waste or mismanagement, or from a 
more positive perspective, when that employee sees a way for 
improving job efficiency or effectiveness. The concern is with 
those mechanisms that are available should the recommendations 
or suggestions not be welcomed or addressed.
<P>
	I looked at some of the United States experience in the area of 
whistle blower protection legislation. As a bit of background, 
whistle blowing protection was legislated in the United States with 
the 1978 Civil Service Reform Act and in 1989 with the 
Whistleblowing Protection Act. It was designed to provide 
protection against adverse employment actions for employees who 
blow the whistle.
<P>
	The 1989 legislation allowed employees to appeal to the Merit 
Systems Protection Board to seek redress for alleged acts of 
retaliation such as reassignments and ratings. As a follow-up to 
determine the effectiveness of the legislation, the United States 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7867"> 7867 </A></B>
<P>
government conducted  employee surveys in 1983 and in 1992 with 
a number of interesting findings.
<P>
	Survey data showed that from 1983 to 1992 fewer employees 
said they had personally observed or obtained direct evidence of 
one or more illegal or wasteful activities involving their agencies. 
However of these employees, an increased percentage said that 
they had reported the illegal or wasteful activities. There was also 
an increase in the percentage of employees who said they had 
experienced reprisal or threat of reprisal for having reported an 
illegal or wasteful activity, but there was a decline in the more 
serious forms of reprisal.
<P>
	From the perspective of increasing efficiency and effectiveness 
it was noted that while a smaller percentage of employees reported 
seeing examples of illegal or wasteful activities, of those who saw 
them a much larger percentage were willing to report them. Some 
employees chose not to report for a number of reasons, primarily 
because they believed nothing would be done to correct the 
activity, or they feared retaliation. Of course, when employees do 
share information about problems they see, the receivers of this 
information must be receptive to the information and must be 
willing to work with the employees toward problem resolution.
<P>
	The United States report reached the conclusion that agencies 
need to focus their efforts on creating an atmosphere in which 
employees and managers alike see the value both in identifying 
problems and in working together to resolve them and that threats 
associated with disclosing illegal or wasteful activities must be 
diminished. The report concluded that this can be done only by 
empowering employees with the control and the right to help make 
changes in the workplace.
<P>
<B>(1145 )</B>
<P>
	Suggestions for improvement included the following. Agencies 
should emphasize organizational change and improvement. 
Agencies should examine their processes for selecting supervisors 
and managers to ensure that they are choosing management teams 
with whom employees will feel comfortable sharing information 
concerning illegal or wasteful activities. Agencies should ensure 
that employees understand the kinds of problems about which they 
should share information, how the information will be handled and 
what safeguards there are against reprisals. Agencies should 
actively solicit employees' views and give employees feedback 
concerning those views.
<P>
	This leads to an interesting comparison with the approach within 
the Canadian public service. In terms of the Canadian approach, we 
think it is important that the government of the day works with the 
public service in a co-operative manner, and I feel a spirit of trust 
must be felt as we look to ways of eliminating waste and achieving 
effectiveness.
<P>
	At this time there are mechanisms within the public service to 
allow employees to bring to the attention of senior management 
any concerns they may have regarding illegal activities which they 
consider beyond the bounds of propriety. As well, there are a 
variety of mechanisms to protect employees from arbitrary 
disciplinary measures including the well established grievance and 
adjudication process.
<P>
	The Public Service Staff Relations Act allows employees to 
grieve any perceived injustice or wrongdoing where there is no 
recourse provided in law. The Canadian Human Rights Act protects 
employees from discrimination and the Privacy Act provides a 
measure of protection as well.
<P>
	In addition to the legislation provisions, the harassment in the 
workplace policy adopted by the Treasury Board for all public 
service employees specifically forbids harassment for any reason 
whatsoever, including specifically abuse of authority. It provides a 
simple mechanism that allows employees to bring their concerns to 
the attention of a neutral third party. In addition, the powers of the 
press and the public service employee unions have been influenced. 
The press and the unions have demonstrated a continuing interest 
in keeping government employees and public organizations on the 
straight and narrow, as we are all aware.
<P>
	A fundamental principle of management in most successful 
organizations is that the employees are accountable for their 
performance to their senior managers. Fair play on the part of 
employees and superiors is an equally important element. There are 
in place remedial measures and available avenues of appeal that 
work efficiently to deal with abuses of authority. There are also 
sanctions in place to prevent, avert or penalize proven 
dishonourable conduct, criminal actions, waste, extravagance, 
discrimination or abuse of trust.
<P>
	Employees are expected to inform their supervisors of any 
seeming impropriety and to suggest ways of improving public 
service actions. Recourse to internal channels where available and 
likely to be effective is required so that problems may be resolved 
internally.
<P>
	The employee must consider whether that alternative is 
appropriate, not because the truth should be hidden but because 
internal remedy may be the most effective. There is an important 
message for internal managers here. Employees, according to a 
United States survey, are more likely to disclose issues in the 
context of where the issue is likely to be addressed.
<P>
	For all the complexity of the government, the incidents that put 
employees in particular difficulties are remarkably few and far 
between. Existing mechanisms have been shown to be capable of 
dealing with them. New legislation in the area might well open a 
gulf between the employees and management, one which does not 
exist now.

<P>
<B>(1150 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Beaumier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have listened to the debate and I 
think that all members are in general agreement that the legislation 
is necessary. I am just hoping that the government will take this as 
a lead to enact some sort of hearings for this legislation.
<P>
	I have had a number of personal experiences with people 
reporting abuses. I do not find that even for a member of 
Parliament there is a satisfactory way to address these issues. 
Public servants are intimidated by talking to members. Often in a 
department one public servant will not even meet with a member 
alone. They want someone else there with them as a witness to 
protect themselves in case the member makes a complaint. They 
want their own jobs protected.
<P>
	I have been a public servant. We have some of the most 
dedicated, hard working people in the public service of Canada. 
Unfortunately, the only things ever reported in the news media are 
the abuses long after they have occurred. I do not think it is fair to 
the public service to be tarred with the same brush by the 
perception being created out there by these odd stories.
<P>
	I would like to encourage the government to proceed with 
fulfilling its commitment.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member is perhaps not aware of 
the fact that the proposer can sum up only if nobody else wishes to 
speak. Perhaps the hon. member could call it a point of order. He is 
not entitled to speak once the proposer has made a final summary.

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I declare the motion carried.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CONSIDERATIONRESUMEDOFREPORTSTAGE">CONSIDERATION RESUMED OF REPORT STAGE</A></H4>
	The House resumed from February 6, 1997 consideration of Bill 
C-70, an act to amend the Excise Tax Act, the Federal-Provincial 
Fiscal Arrangements Act, the Income Tax Act, the Debt Servicing 
and Reduction Account Act and related Acts, and of the motions in 
Group No. 3.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise to speak to the motions in Group No. 3 put forward 
by the Bloc Quebecois concerning this part of Bill C-70. Because 
this bill is very substantial, the amendments have had to be 
grouped.
<P>
	I am pleased to rise today to express my opposition to Bill C-70, 
as my colleagues have done before me. As has already been said 
repeatedly, this bill is a hodgepodge of amendments to the GST, a 
rather thin and tasteless soup.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	One of the aims of this bill is to harmonize the GST and the 
provincial sales tax of three maritime provinces in exchange for a 
paltry compensation of $1 billion based on some particularly 
obscure calculations.
<P>
	First off, I would like to point out that there would have been no 
debate on Bill C-70 had the Liberal government kept its election 
promises. In the last election, the Prime Minister promised to 
totally eliminate this federal sales tax. However, far from 
eliminating it, the government now wants to harmonize it, as it puts 
it, to better hide it. In addition to not fulfilling his election promise, 
the Prime Minister told Canadians and Quebecers he had never 
promised to eliminate the GST.
<P>
	Canadians were probably not watching the right television 
channel when the Prime Minister said: ``We want to scrap the GST; 
we want to abolish it; we want to eliminate it''. Canadians were 
probably not reading the right newspapers when they read, written 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7870"> 7870 </A></B>
<P>
in black and  white, during the election campaign, statements made 
by the Prime Minister and his Liberal colleagues saying: ``Yes, we 
will scrap the GST''. Canadians were probably not tuning to the 
right radio stations when the Prime Minister, his ministers and 
other members opposite said: ``We will abolish the GST; we will 
scrap it''.
<P>
	Today, we are told: ``You misunderstood''. And we 
misunderstood them in both official languages. This is all about 
respect.
<P>
	Now, we all know what to make of the Liberals' promises, 
including future ones, because they will promise us the world 
again. We have proof that the Liberals are unable to fulfil their 
commitments. To make things worse, the Prime Minister was 
disrespectful to a citizen on the national television network when 
he told her: ``No, we did not lie; this is what we meant, but we did 
not state it correctly''.
<P>
	Not only did the Prime Minister and his government renege on 
their word, they are now proposing a bill hastily thrown together, a 
bill that will cost us one billion dollars in compensation to just 
three maritime provinces. What a nice pre-election gift. They 
probably need it badly in that part of the country.
<P>
	I will not discuss in detail the technical aspects of Bill C-70, but 
I have to point out the government's incompetence in this matter, 
and its lack of respect for the opposition and for Maritimers, who 
were not given an opportunity to be effectively consulted and 
heard.
<P>
	Before Christmas, the Minister of Finance tabled a bill that has 
close to 300 pages. He tabled it just before the Christmas recess, 
giving the opposition 24 hours to review this technical piece of 
legislation and to prepare for debate at second reading. The purpose 
was obviously to prevent the official opposition from finding flaws 
in the bill. Unfortunately for the Liberals, there were flaws and 
there are still many. In fact, the government botched its work to the 
point that the Liberals themselves tabled over 100 amendments to 
their own bill. Their excuse is that they worked so quickly and did 
such a poor job that they did not have the time to read it over and so 
they have come up with 100 amendments to remedy matters.
<P>
	The government has been moving full steam ahead with Bill 
C-70 so that the public will forget the GST fiasco before the next 
federal election. It shows, because this is a bad bill and the 
government is proving it by introducing so many amendments. Not 
only is Bill C-70 bad, but it is unfair, because it makes no provision 
for compensation to provinces that have already harmonized their 
provincial sales tax with the federal tax.
<P>
	Oddly enough, the only province that has already harmonized its 
sales tax with the federal tax is Quebec. That is right, once again 
the Liberal government is thumbing its nose at Quebecers, by 
refusing to give them the money to which they are entitled. The 
Government  of Quebec calculates the amount at $2 billion. If you 
work out fairly what Quebec should receive in light of what was 
handed over to the maritimes, this is the amount owing. We are not 
asking for a handout or anything extra, we are asking for what is 
owed us.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	When the provincial premiers got together in Jasper last August, 
they reached an agreement that all provinces should be treated 
equitably by the federal government. All provinces including 
Quebec, since it is still part of Canada for a few years to come, are 
to benefit equally from the agreements regarding the 
harmonization of sales taxes, which naturally includes 
compensation.
<P>
	On December 13, 1996, Quebec ministers Bernard Landry and 
Jacques Brassard officially requested $2 billion in compensation 
for having harmonized Quebec's sales tax with the federal sales 
tax. Since that time, the Liberal government has refused to 
compensate the Quebec government for this harmonization.
<P>
	It is worth pointing out that Quebec harmonized its sales tax in 
1991, on its own and without financial assistance. The costs of this 
harmonization were considerable, and part of those costs were 
borne by Quebec businesses. Moreover, Quebec businesses are still 
paying the price, and are not even reaping the benefits the 
harmonized tax will offer, as proposed in Bill C-70. The bill 
neglects to even mention Quebec.
<P>
	As for the three Maritime provinces, they will benefit fully and 
considerably from the harmonization of their sales tax with the 
federal tax. Unlike the Quebec businesses, those in the Maritimes 
will be fully reimbursed for input taxes, without the increase in 
taxes Quebec businesses had to absorb. One of the best proofs of 
the Maritimes' new advantage is the poaching by New Brunswick's 
Premier McKenna during Team Canada's latest trip to Asia. During 
this trade mission, Premier McKenna approached Quebec and 
Ontario businesses to get them to move to New Brunswick by 
pointing out the advantages of harmonizing their sales tax with the 
GST.
<P>
	The federal government is therefore using some of the Quebec 
taxpayers' money to finance unfair and unethical competition by 
the Atlantic provinces. We are also paying for the tax cuts promised 
by the Government of New Brunswick, while such a luxury is out 
of reach for us in Quebec. Unfortunately, the harmonization of 
sales taxes by the Maritime provinces will cost us more than just 
the $1 billion over the next four years. The reduction in sales tax 
from 19 per cent to 15 per cent will mean that Quebecers and all 
Canadians will be contributing more in equalization payments to 
the maritime provinces.
<P>
	Furthermore, the federal government is guilty of a total lack of 
transparency and fairness in this matter. There is no way at the 
moment to justify the $1 billion the maritime provinces are going 
to get. The reason is  simple, unlike the practice, the standards and 
method of calculation used to establish the amount of compensa-
<P>
<HR>

<P>
tion remain hidden and under wraps. This is unacceptable. The 
government is being neither professional nor honest in this matter.
<P>
	Now, a quick word in closing on Bill C-70's supposed 
elimination of tax on books. Another snow job by the Liberal 
government in an effort to hide its mistakes. Bill C-70 provides for 
the elimination of taxation on books purchased by literacy and 
teaching institutions only. This is a start, it is true. We recognize 
that. However, it is thanks to the unrelenting demand of Quebec, 
which, by the way, has eliminated sales tax on all books.
<P>
	In conclusion, the Bloc Quebecois opposes Bill C-70 and its plan 
to harmonize the GST with the sales tax of the maritime provinces. 
This bill is jerry-built and based on nothing more than political and 
partisan considerations. The Liberal government is attempting to 
mislead the public with this bill and make them forget the empty 
promise of eliminating the GST, but people will not be fooled and 
will still remember in a few months' time.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to Bill C-70 and the third group of 
amendments on harmonizing the sales tax in the maritimes.
<P>
	We have hard much about how the harmonized sales tax is unfair 
and complex. I am going to get into some solutions to the GST that 
the government could employ in order to give all businesses a leg 
up against competitors in other parts of the world.
<P>
	The government had an enormous opportunity when it came into 
office three and a half years ago to finally help Canadian businesses 
to become competitive with their counterparts in the world. Instead 
the government has taken an entirely different approach other than 
business as usual. It has done the exact opposite and complicated 
our tax structures.
<P>
<B>(1305 )</B>
<P>
	The most recent example is the HST. This sales tax does not 
make the taxation system simpler. It does not provide an impetus 
for the private sector. It does not create more jobs. It will do the 
exact opposite. It will cost jobs. There are some very sad examples 
of this, particularly since this affects the maritimes. It is supposed 
to help the maritimes but will actually have a devastating effect on 
many businesses.
<P>
	Who is this going to affect? It will cost more for children's 
clothing, books, auto repairs, gasoline, home fuel. It is not the rich 
who pay for this but the poor on fixed incomes who really pay. Let 
us look at some real life examples of businesses on the east coast 
that are going to be affected by this.
<P>
	The Canadian Real Estate Association claims that the increasing 
cost of a new house in Nova Scotia or Newfoundland will be over 
three and a half thousand dollars. The GST harmonization in New 
Brunswick will cost almost 80 jobs in Moncton and Buctouche. 
There are other examples in New Brunswick. There is a 50:50 
chance of other store closures in the Greenberg chain and a loss of 
over 70 jobs in places such as Atholville, Shediac and Moncton. 
This tax will not alleviate the strain and duress that Canadians from 
coast to coast feel. It will make things worse.
<P>
	The Canadian Federation of Independent Businesses made it 
very clear that harmonizing the sales tax is good but that it has to 
conform to certain criteria. It stated that a properly harmonized tax 
is good, but it has to be one sales tax across the country at a lower 
rate than the present rate. It must have one set of rules, one set of 
audit procedures, a single remittance requirement and one tax 
collector.
<P>
	The HST proposal that harmonizes the sales taxes will not do 
that. It violates the principles put forward to the government by the 
business community through the Canadian Federation of 
Independent Businesses. It said to the government: ``Here are some 
good solutions. Take them and use them''. What did the 
government do? It ignored them and went in the opposite direction.
<P>
	I am sure many members will empathize with me. Before I got 
into this business, as a member of the public I often wondered why 
in the world did governments continue to propose solutions that 
have little or no relevance to what is actually going on in the 
trenches? I am no closer to answering that question today after 
three years in this House than I was before I got into this business, 
and that is sad.
<P>
	It is a disgrace and a shame that we have repeatedly failed the 
Canadian public by not putting forward good, effective solutions to 
the problems that affect us. In no other realm have we violated the 
trust of the Canadian public more than in the field of economics. 
This opportunity to harmonize the sales tax was a great chance but 
a failed opportunity on the part of the government.
<P>
	Some very good solutions could be put forward, but first I will 
talk a bit about the GST. I will not discuss the fact that the 
government violated the public's trust on this issue because that 
has been spoken about before. Once again I plead with the 
ministers of revenue and finance to please simplify this tax or 
eliminate it. It is a complicated tax. I do not know if they really 
understand the incredible stress and burden it places on the small 
independent businesses that are trying their hardest to eke out an 
existence. These businesses are getting it in the teeth and the 
simplification or the elimination of the GST would be a welcome 
respite for people who are the underpinning of our economy and 
the true creators of jobs in Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7872"> 7872 </A></B>
<P>
	This tax is not applied fairly. In the medical field, the GST is 
not applied fairly at all. Physicians are actually singled out and 
treated unfairly by this tax. I will show members how.
<P>
<B>(1310 )</B>
<P>
	Medical services are designated as tax exempt under the Excise 
Tax Act. Physicians, on the other hand, are denied the ability to 
claim a GST refund for purchases such as medical equipment and 
medical supplies that are necessary to deliver quality care.
<P>
	Why did the government not support motions put forward by my 
colleague from Medicine Hat to make that issue fair for all medical 
personnel? Why are physicians being singled out? Only the 
government knows that. It is unfair and discriminatory to this 
group of individuals.
<P>
	I would like to discuss some things we can do to try to improve 
the economy in our country. The first thing is to look seriously at 
introducing a simple, flat tax. The flat tax tells people that the 
harder they work, the more they are going to keep. Our present 
taxation system tells the Canadian public the more they make, the 
more the government is going to take from them.
<P>
	That is a very serious problem because it takes away the 
incentive to go out and strive harder. A flat tax with a greater 
margin of exemption at the bottom takes out the lowest 
socioeconomic groups from paying taxes and puts more money in 
their hands.
<P>
	My colleagues in the Reform Party have proposed that and we 
have the flat tax in our fresh start platform. It shows ways that the 
government can actually put more money into the hands of all 
Canadians, but in particular those who are poorest in our society. I 
encourage the government, once again, to take a look at that. 
Frankly, I am not very confident that it will take the initiative.
<P>
	The complexity of the tax structure absolutely restrains, restricts 
and compromises the ability of the private sector to go out and be 
as aggressive as it can be.
<P>
	Government regulation, in fact government over regulation, 
must be diminished greatly. If I was a private business person 
considering opening up a business, I would think very carefully 
about not doing it because of the level of government over 
regulation. Three levels of government are the hoops that many 
business people have to jump through, and that acts as a huge 
restraint on maximizing the great ideas that they have 
economically.
<P>
	We must also deal with education. We need a much stronger 
education system and it needs to be brought into line with what is 
taking place in the global economy and what the needs of our 
country will be in the 21st century. Currently students, faced with 
an over 20 per cent unemployment rate, are having great difficulty 
earning the funds to get themselves through school. Almost two 
years ago Reformers suggested an income contingent  loan 
replacement plan which would provide more funds to students 
going to school.
<P>
	Our educational system must reflect the needs of the 21st 
century. Therefore, closer co-operation between the private sector 
and the education system is essential if we are going to maximize 
the needs of our country and the needs of our students. The ICLR 
program would enable more money to be available for students to 
get the training required. We also need a far greater input into job 
training in the work force.
<P>
	Much to my dismay, I have learned that our country is one of the 
lowest in all developed countries in investing in their workers in 
developing the trades and the educational systems they will require 
along with the skills to be aggressive in the 21st century.
<P>
	In closing, if the government was to have a flat tax, decrease the 
complexity in our taxation system, have a strong educational 
system, decrease the tax burden on Canadians and simplify the tax 
structure, we could provide enormous input, incentive and impetus 
to our private sector. As a result, we would create more jobs and 
have a more secure future for all Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1315 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to voice my opposition to Bill C-70. It is a 
thinly veiled attempt by the government to fulfil a red book 
promise to eliminate or redefine the GST.
<P>
	I never fail to be amazed at the attitude of the government which 
has changed from such a short time ago when it was in opposition. I 
clearly remember the debate which went on in this place and in the 
other place when the former Conservative government brought in 
the GST. I remember the debate which went on in the other place 
for hours and hours, day and night, and the Liberal outrage over the 
proposed GST. The debate caused emotions which at times almost 
led to physical violence. All sorts of strange manoeuvres were 
employed to filibuster the bill, yet a couple of years later the 
Liberals who now form the government have completely flip 
flopped and seem to be defending this very unpopular and unfair 
tax in the interests of all Canadians.
<P>
	When we read some of the debates from the last Parliament we 
see the Liberal comments which were voiced every time the 
Conservatives invoked closure on a bill. The Liberals howled and 
shouted their outrage. Now they are on the other side and they 
invoke closure on a regular basis. It is almost a daily order of 
business. There is a lot of hypocrisy in that kind of action.
<P>
	The imposition of the GST had a lot to do with what happened to 
the Conservative Party in the last election. It will probably have 
somewhat the same effect on the Liberal members from Atlantic 
Canada in the next election if they do not start speaking up and 
representing the views of their constituents on the harmonized  
version of the GST. It has all the same problems and faults which 
the original GST had when it was imposed on Canadians, except 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7873"> 7873 </A></B>
<P>
those problems and faults are now magnified. Instead of a 7 per 
cent tax we are looking at a 15 per cent tax.
<P>
	The whole concept was sold to Atlantic Canadians on a bill of 
goods which said they would be better off, that the provincial tax 
would be lower and that it was the best thing since sliced bread. 
Atlantic Canadians are quickly coming to realize that the picture is 
not quite as rosy as the one they were sold.
<P>
	The provincial sales tax was a tax on goods. Now it has become a 
tax on goods and services. On top of the billion dollar incentive 
which was given to the Atlantic provinces by the rest of the 
Canadian taxpayers to induce them to enter this agreement, the 
base of the tax will be hugely expanded compared to what was 
covered by the provincial tax. It has become quite evident to 
Atlantic Canadians that their cost of taxation will be substantially 
higher than it was with the two tax system.
<P>
	On top of that, there is the fundamental dishonesty about trying 
to bury the GST in the price of the goods so that every time an 
Atlantic Canadian buys a good or a service they will not be 
reminded of the hated GST. That it is hidden in the price does not 
seem to be a very upfront and honest way of trying to make this 
whole controversy go away and make Canadians forget the most 
hated tax in Canadian history.
<P>
<B>(1320 )</B>
<P>
	On top of that, a number of well known organizations have 
exposed the cost of this harmonized tax to Atlantic Canadians. It is 
certainly going to kill jobs in a major way. It is going to put 
expansion plans of a number of fairly major retail chains on hold. It 
will not only cost in investments but it will also cost jobs for 
Atlantic Canadians.
<P>
	Of course we can go back to the whole issue that has been 
plaguing this House for the last three and a half years, which is the 
difference in what the Prime Minister and other Liberals promised 
during the campaign and what they have delivered since the 
election. The recent town hall meeting brought to light very clearly 
the difference between the two. The expulsion of the member for 
York South-Weston has certainly exposed the fraud in this whole 
issue.
<P>
	There is no doubt that the promise to eliminate the GST after the 
election, because it has been such a very unpopular tax with 
Canadians since its implementation, had a very major impact on 
the number of seats the Liberal Party gained in the last election. 
Doing a flip-flop and turning its back on that promise will have a 
major impact on the next election. I do not even think this attempt 
to harmonize the tax will cover the failure to fulfil that promise by 
this government.
<P>
	We in the west and even those in Ontario, the largest province in 
Canada, have shown little interest in joining in this effort to 
harmonize the tax for the same reasons that now, after the faults 
have been exposed, Atlantic Canadians are rejecting it. In Alberta 
where we have no provincial sales tax, the implication of a blended 
tax is of little interest to Albertans and would do nothing but cost a 
substantial amount of money.
<P>
	Alberta, Ontario and British Columbia are the three provinces 
that are not even willing to talk about the proposal. It appears that 
even the provinces of Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Prince Edward 
Island are quickly backing away from having any input into the 
whole proposal. It is simply no better than the GST which 
Canadians have been rejecting for so long.
<P>
	It is understandable why the provincial governments of some of 
the Atlantic provinces did fall into the trap set by the federal 
government to get them into this scheme. It was simply because of 
the billion dollars which was put up by all Canadians through their 
tax dollars to bribe them into becoming part of the scheme. There is 
also the very complicated issue of tax credits where one tax is 
applied on top of another tax and the province receives a rebate in 
those instances. One can see how it could be appealing to a 
provincial government if in fact it is looking after its interests 
instead of the interests of the people it represents, the people of the 
Atlantic provinces.
<P>
	While it might have more appeal to the governments in the 
Atlantic provinces, certainly for the same reasons as for all other 
Canadians it has little appeal to Atlantic Canadians. That is 
probably one of the reasons the Liberal government refused to hold 
public hearings on this issue in Atlantic Canada.
<P>
<B>(1325 )</B>
<P>
	Certainly, considering the implications of this bill and the tax the 
government is proposing, it would only be natural that the 
committee would have travelled to Atlantic Canada to hold public 
hearings and hear the opinions of all Atlantic Canadians but that 
just was not to be. I find it quite curious that this government would 
not have been willing to go there to hear the opinion of those most 
affected.
<P>
	We oppose the GST in its entirety and we oppose this bill to 
harmonize the GST, but to somehow neutralize at least some of the 
problems with it we introduced a number of amendments. It will be 
realized that with the imposition of closure on the bill the Liberal 
government is not interested in hearing any amendments to 
improve the bill any more than it is interested in hearing any more 
debate on the bill.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry to tell the hon. member that his 
time has expired. The hon. member for Cumberland-Colchester.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a privilege to stand before this House  today as a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7874"> 7874 </A></B>
<P>
member from the Atlantic region to talk about the Atlantic region. I 
wish to clarify the point that some of the members from the third 
party have referred to it as the maritime region when in fact we are 
talking about the Atlantic region of Canada. The harmonized sales 
tax is indeed an issue for intelligent discussion in this House.
<P>
	The member indicated that members of the finance committee 
did not go to the Atlantic region because we were afraid to hear 
what the people might have had to say. That is not the case. We 
were in the Atlantic region in November. We held hearings across 
the country on the GST and we had open discussions. We even had 
political leaders from other parties attend our hearings here in 
Ottawa. It was the generous availability and the invitation of 
members of the finance committee that brought them to Ottawa.
<P>
	Some key points in the harmonized sales tax that are being 
missed are really valuable. A point of fact is that on average, a 
Canadian consumer and in fact a consumer in the Atlantic region 
visits the grocery store approximately two times each week. In the 
items the average consumer will buy, approximately 40 per cent of 
them are taxable. What this means in the Atlantic region is a 
reduction of that tax through a harmonized process. In Nova Scotia 
alone that reduction is almost four percentage points. In the other 
Atlantic provinces, such as Newfoundland, it goes down even 
much further. In fact consumers at the grocery store will see a 
benefit in a reduced tax of up to four percentage points at the 
minimum in buying approximately 40 per cent of their goods on 
average twice a week in the average consumer pattern.
<P>
	There is another important point. I talked to farmers in Atlantic 
Canada this very morning. The Nova Scotia Federation of 
Agriculture and the Canadian Federation of Agriculture are very 
pleased with what this tax will do in the farm sector. Barns and new 
silos are being built across my constituency already. This is in the 
event that when the tax comes into place on April 1 these farmers 
will get a rebate of 15 per cent on all capital expenditures.
<P>
	Let me tell this House that Ontario farmers are now saying: 
``Why can't we have this in Ontario?''. That is the message which 
is coming from the farm sector in this country. They want what 
Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and New Brunswick are getting in the 
farm sector. This 15 per cent tax credit looks a heck of a lot better 
to the average farmer than does a 7 per cent GST rebate.
<P>
	When we talk about the input tax credit, the 15 per cent input tax 
credit that is available to all manufacturing sectors in the 
harmonized zone is a benefit to the Atlantic region. Why is it a 
benefit? Because it will sustain those who are manufacturing and 
creating long term jobs in our area.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	This is the real benefit to our harmonized tax and the single tax 
system. Why is it a benefit? People have been asking us what to do 
in terms of simplifying tax. We have heard the hon. member speak 
about a flat tax here today. This is not about a flat tax and this is not 
part of this reform. It is about a harmonized tax.
<P>
	In the Standing Committee on Finance we had companies in 
Ontario that manufacture goods for this nation say to our 
committee: ``We will be looking at the harmonized zone. There is 
an incentive in that for us to even look at relocating to a 
harmonized zone because a simplification of a single tax, no tax on 
tax, is beneficial to the manufacturing sector and to the long term 
sustainable sector of our society that will keep our economy 
employing young people and generating an economy that will 
sustain us as we move into the 21st century''.
<P>
	A controversial point in this whole debate is a tax in pricing. 
Those who are making the most noise regarding tax in pricing are 
the multinationals and the internationals. When they come to 
Atlantic Canada they have told us that they do not benefit from the 
15 per cent input tax credit because they do very little 
infrastructure in the harmonized zone. They have cashiers and 
people who work at the front line who stock shelves but the money 
for the most part is simply in employment wages and it leaves the 
region in the benefits from the sales. My invitation to the 
multinationals, if they really wanted to get the maximum benefits 
from the harmonized sales tax, was to come to the Atlantic region, 
to the harmonized tax zone and set up basic infrastructure, develop 
the long term sustainable businesses that will generate our 
economy.
<P>
	For several decades now, maybe even a century, we have lost a 
large part of our economy. We have been an underprivileged region 
accepting large transfer payments. That is not because we want to, 
that is not because we are hard workers and that we do not have 
large numbers of entrepreneurs. I can give the history of my own 
businesses. We had put money where our mouth was and started a 
scientific company that has since went on to the stock exchange to 
become a very successful international company. We wanted to 
manufacture in the Atlantic region. We wanted to hire young 
scientists to create jobs and to be sustainable so that we would not 
have to be that have not province and have to take those transfer 
payments that we have depended for so long.
<P>
	Some of the hon. members are advocating that this is not good 
news for the Atlantic region because they would like to continue 
for us to be that transfer receiving province and dependent on the 
provinces that are more sustainable economically. This is a chance 
for us to change that pattern.
<P>
	There are comments from APEC, the Atlantic Provinces 
Economic Council, that this harmonized tax is  good news for the 
Atlantic region. There are comments from the CIBC this morning 
saying the Nova Scotia resale sector was strong in 1996 and the 
introduction of the harmonized sales tax is expected to further 
increase sales.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7875"> 7875 </A></B>
<P>
	The harmonized tax does many things for our region but above 
all it allows us as Atlantic Canadians to have a stronger resource 
sector, a stronger manufacturing sector and to develop those jobs 
that can be sustained through a modern global competitive 
economy, and that is what we want. There will be some costs 
associated with the transfer of new cash registers or change over 
but these are minimal to the benefits of the overall 15 per cent 
harmonized tax and that 15 per cent input tax credit.
<P>
	I could go through sector by sector, whether it is fishing, farming 
or manufacturing, but all those sectors in our economy, the 
building supply sector, the grocery store sector, have invited us to 
push forward with this harmonized tax and to make it forceful and 
make it strong. As I indicated moments ago, talking to our farmers 
this morning from the Nova Scotia Federation of Agriculture, they 
are pleased with this. They are being told from the Ontario farmers 
they would like to have the same thing. I expect that farmers in 
Ontario, a strong, vibrant part of our economy, will put the push on 
the government there that it join in and get a harmonized tax as 
well.
<P>
<B>(1335 )</B>
<P>
	To display some of the myths about this whole tax is that it is a 
two package deal. It is a harmonized tax at the manufacturing and 
business level and it is a tax in pricing at the consumer level. The 
reason it is a package deal is want the consumers of the Atlantic 
Canada and of our nation to eventually receive this through put in 
the reduction of prices of a tax in pricing. When we see a 
commodity on a shelf, whether cat food, dog food, lumbering 
supplies or whatever, we will know that the price which is marked 
on the shelf is the price we will pay when we go through the cash 
and exit the store. That is the benefit-

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to address Bill C-70.
<P>
	However, I would like to make a correction on the facts that were 
just presented by the member from Cumberland-Colchester. She 
indicated that the HST-BST committee had gone to Atlantic 
Canada, when in fact it is not true. That was a prebudget 
consultation hearing that went to Atlantic Canada. For her sake and 
the sake of my colleague I would like to clarify that the Reform 
Party member was correct when he said that the committee did not 
go to Atlantic Canada, nor did it receive people from there at the 
hearings.
<P>
	I would like to refer to a document I got permission to quote 
quite liberally, from Mr. Mitchel Gray who writes for the Canada 
Taxpayers Federation, Alberta division. He calls this weekly 
commentary paper ``Let's Talk Taxes''.
<P>
	It is ironic that my little newsletter that I put out through the 
House of Commons two or three times a year is called ``Let's 
Talk''. I like the title. I will stray from time to time but I will give 
him credit for the gist of the commentary on this issue.
<P>
	The same people who told us they would scrap, kill and abolish 
the GST are bringing in legislation now to harmonize the GST, to 
include the GST in our lives forever with this harmonization in 
three provinces of Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	Harmonize is a nice word. Aside from its soothing musical 
connotation it implies a sense of unity, togetherness and 
co-operation. When applied to the GST, however, harmonization 
means coercion, confusion, cost and cover-up. Here is how Mitchel 
Gray describes these four words, and I concur with his views.
<P>
	Coercion. Part of the harmonization plan would force businesses 
to hide the new harmonized sales tax, HST, which our party prefers 
to call the blended sales tax, the BST, in a price of the product or 
services being sold.
<P>
	Shopkeepers who make a mistake and sell a product without 
including the tax in the price would face fines, jail sentences or a 
permanent criminal record. That is right. It is off to the gulag. With 
all these <I>g</I> words these days, between gonads and gulag, we are 
getting an education in this House.
<P>
	It is off to the gulag for those brave souls who would reveal how 
much tax Canadian consumers are paying. When I say gulag I am 
not kidding. While rapists and robbers can be granted conditional 
or absolute discharge by a judge under sections 763 and 737 of the 
Criminal Code, pops down at the corner store will be excluded 
under these sections and will rot in jail for not including the 
HST/BST in the price of a chocolate bar. We will need a 
magnifying glass in case the tax inclusive price is not the right size 
it is supposed to be. This gets very confusing.
<P>
	Confusion. It is probably confusing enough to have a combined 
provincial-federal sales tax in three of Canada's provinces, two 
separate sales taxes in six provinces and one sales tax in one 
province.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	If members need more confusion, how about this. The HST/BST 
legislation will exempt some items from the hidden tax rule and 
allow businesses to show both the tax inclusive and tax exclusive 
prices as long as the former is displayed. I think people are 
confused already. I will go real slow in the next part.

	Shoppers could conceivably be faced with four different prices 
for the same marked down item. I will go real slow for the Liberal 
members because I know this is intended to simplify, clarify and 
make it a lot easier for people to understand-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Consumers are more intelligent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> -the original price with the tax, the original price 
without the tax, the sales price with the tax and the sales price 
without. The next point is cost.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Just to complicate it for the Reform.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> At least this party does not go along like a herd of 
sheep and follow the democratic dictatorship that we have elected. 
When the backbenchers of this Liberal government go back and 
face their constituents they will have to answer why they are 
bringing in more taxes, new taxes in a region that is subsidized by 
the rest of Canada after the finance minister calls it pan-Canadian. 
We will see how pan-Canadian it is after this is fleshed is out in 
about 10 or 12 months after this tax has been in place.
<P>
	Companies will have to develop dual inventory. They will have 
to have two pricing systems, computer and advertising systems in 
order to accommodate this change. It will be confusing and it will 
be costly. It is a shame that a government cannot look at a plan and 
implement it all across Canada rather than just doing it piecemeal 
in one part of the country only.
<P>
	In addition to the direct costs there is the cost of lost jobs. A card 
company and Woolworth, as my colleague has previously 
mentioned, will be forced to lay off hundreds of people with this 
increase in costs or pass it on to consumers. That is what we have 
been arguing all along.
<P>
	It makes no matter if someone can deduct this as input costs. It is 
a 15 per cent deduction. Come and create the jobs. What matters is 
whether this benefits the Canadian taxpayer, the Canadian 
consumer. The answer is unequivocally no. Take a look at what is 
being done here.
<P>
	A tax is being increased on a lot of goods and services in these 
provinces. Yes, the overall combined tax is lower in those 
provinces, but Canadians have to pay $974 million to do that. It is a 
prepayment to get a tax reduction in one part of the country at the 
expense of the other part of the country. Then what happens to the 
people in that part of the country?
<P>
	Are they going to be better off at the end of the day? I submit no, 
because when they buy their goods and services they will be paying 
15 per cent on a lot of goods and services they were not paying on 
before. Their out of pocket costs will go up and when those 
consumers find out, the premiers, the politicians in those provinces 
are going to be in deep goo-goo, sticking to the <I>g</I> alliteration.
<P>
	The final word I have to say is cover-up. Hiding the HST and 
BST will allow Ottawa to cover-up future rate hikes. That is the 
danger in this legislation. Other  countries have combined a value 
added tax with a local sales tax to have just one tax. Governments 
then go on and raise it from 5 per cent to 10, from 10 to 15, from 15 
to 18. It just gets easier and easier to raise the tax.
<P>
	This Liberal government, should it be so lucky to enforce a 
harmonized sales tax all across Canada, will then be in a position to 
raise this tax forever.
<P>
	This cover-up is nothing more than trying to keep a promise that 
it never intended to keep in the first place. Those members said 
they would scrap the GST, abolish the GST, and now they have 
done the very thing that they argued against in this House of 
Commons when they were in opposition.
<P>
	This is not about money. This is not about creating jobs. This is 
about integrity and honesty in politics. I am embarrassed to have to 
say the politicians on that side, now in government, especially the 
cabinet ministers, are now saying things opposite to what they did 
over here.
<P>
	When the minister of defence was on this side he said the GST 
should not be tax included, that tax should always be obvious and 
clear. Now he is favouring a hidden tax.
<P>
	When the finance minister was on this side he said if you 
combine a provincial sales tax with a goods and services tax, you 
will entrench the GST forever. For a party and two people who ran 
on the platform to scrap, abolish and get rid of the GST, to entrench 
it in our lives forever, to guarantee that it stays with us forever, is 
hypocritical, duplicitous and is not serving the general public.
<P>
	They should be ashamed of changing their minds and doing 
exactly the opposite once they get over on the other side. This 
piecemeal, ad hoc legislation is not good for Canada. It is not the 
solution. If we are going to do something and we want to have one 
tax, then let us just have one tax but have it as low as possible, have 
it all across Canada and not force companies, businesses and 
consumers to listen to this confusion all the time.
<P>
<B>(1345 )</B>
<P>
	We oppose this legislation because it is being done for the wrong 
reasons. It is being done just to keep a promise that has been long 
broken and should be buried. The minister of heritage quit over 
this. She admitted that the promise was broken. The finance 
minister admitted the Liberals broke their GST promise. It is only 
the Prime Minister who will not admit he broke his promise to 
abolish the GST.
<P>
	For political and not economic reasons the Liberal Party should 
reconsider this bill. It should look at it and say: ``We should not go 
ahead. Tax inclusive pricing is divisive, there is a lot confusion. 
Let's back off on this. Let's wait and see if we can convince all the 
other provinces to come on board''.

<P>
	I will leave the government and the Liberal backbenchers with 
this thought. Answer this question: If the HST is so good, why 
have the other provinces not jumped on board and proclaimed the 
wonderful advantages and benefits of this ridiculous Bill C-70?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brushett:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order to clarify a 
point. The hon. member for Calgary Centre indicated that we did 
not go to the Atlantic region in January. That is a fact and true. The 
finance committee was there in November. We invited anyone in 
the region to come to Ottawa for the hearings and paid their-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member is engaging in debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to speak again on Bill C-70 because I believe it is 
good policy and good legislation. In the world of politics and 
government we have to deal with the art of the possible. We often 
are not fortunate enough to have perfect solutions to everything but 
I believe the HST comes very close to that.
<P>
	I would like to correct the member for Calgary Centre on one 
point. The premier of Ontario is quoted as saying-I do not have it 
in front of me now-that the harmonized sales tax would be the 
best thing Ontario could ever do. It is on the record. However, in 
the interim he has been involved in the politics of this issue and he 
does not want to move on it. We are finding that with so many 
issues.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Augustine:</B> His Reform friends.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cullen:</B> Exactly. His Reform friends are influencing that 
deliberation.
<P>
	I am pleased the member for Calgary Centre acknowledged that 
he got some material from someone who has to be respected. 
Unfortunately we often hear a lot of rhetoric from the other 
opposition party. We wonder if it would be attributed to the Fraser 
Institute or to Newt Gingrich or if they would make the same kind 
of attribution that the hon. member so rightly did.
<P>
	I want to discuss tax included pricing. The opposition parties are 
creating a lot of confusion and debate around this point about 
which I will provide some clarification. At the time the GST was 
first promulgated under the Conservative government, I thought if 
they were going to bring it in they should have it out front and 
centre so that people could see it. That was a reasonably 
honourable thing to do.
<P>
	However, if people opposite were frank with themselves they 
would acknowledge what we are now hearing from Canadians, 
myself included on this point. When Canadians go to the cash 
register they are continually surprised when tax is added on to their 
items. A $100 item becomes $115 dollars. Canadians are fed up 
with that.
<P>
	Contrary to what the member opposite says, the HST will not be 
hidden. It will be on the receipt. If you travel to Europe or other 
places you will see the taxes are included on the bill and also on the 
sticker price. We are moving to what many other countries have 
moved to, and the tax will be there and visible for all eyes to see.
<P>
	In Atlantic Canada we are reducing the GST component of the 
HST so why would we want to hide it? Why would we want to hide 
a tax we are reducing? It makes no sense. It argues the point quite 
well that we are not really trying to hide a tax; we are trying to 
respond to what Canadians are asking for from sea to sea.
<P>
<B>(1350 )</B>
<P>
	I would like to comment briefly on the origins of the HST. When 
the GST was brought in, the manufacturers' sales tax was 
eliminated. Many Canadians, myself included, did not factor that 
in very heavily at the time. Independent surveys showed that the 
manufacturers' sales tax on white goods and big appliances in most 
cases was passed on to the consumer. We have lost the benefits of 
the manufacturers' sales tax.
<P>
	When we campaigned in 1993 we said that we would do 
everything we could to replace the GST because it was not a 
popular tax. We looked at a whole range of options. The red book 
said that we would harmonize the GST and make it simpler and 
more equitable. The HST will do that.
<P>
	An aspect which is sometimes forgotten is the notion of the 
embedded PST. That is a term which deserves an explanation. 
When Atlantic Canada moves to the HST, the whole tax collection 
and remittance system will become a value added type tax.
<P>
	Those Canadians who have small businesses, medium sized 
businesses or who work in the accounting offices of big companies 
know how the GST works. They take all the GST they have paid on 
the goods they have purchased, deduct that from the GST they have 
charged to customers and remit the net. Essentially it is a value 
added tax.
<P>
	When the tax is harmonized in Atlantic Canada, the provincial 
sales tax which is currently in the cost of goods that businesses buy 
will be relieved. Therefore, the cost of the goods which are 
produced by those companies will be reduced. The result will be 
that the companies in those provinces will be more competitive.
<P>
	Some of the Atlantic premiers, such as Frank McKenna of New 
Brunswick, are very aggressive when it comes to developing and 
attracting business. They know that the harmonized sales tax will 
position their provinces very well. In fact, Quebec has moved along 
a similar avenue.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="7878"> 7878 </A></B>
<P>
	In Ontario the Harris government is doing nothing because it 
likes to play politics. We have run into that on a whole range of 
issues, such as CPP reform, but that is an issue for another day.
<P>
	If we faced reality in Ontario, the taxes could be harmonized. 
Instead of a 15 per cent tax there would be a 14 per cent tax. 
Perhaps in the future it could be reduced even more. In doing so, 
businesses would be more competitive. Things would be simpler 
for businesses. Right now they fill in the GST forms and then they 
fill in the PST forms. It is very complicated. People spend their 
time filling in forms when they should be focusing on expanding 
markets or developing new opportunities. When the tax is 
harmonized there will be one form to complete and one cheque to 
remit. With the new tax commission things will be simplified even 
further.
<P>
	Some Canadians might say: ``What does that do for me?'' If 
businesses in Ontario and the other provinces are more 
competitive, it is good for all of us. Their businesses will grow and 
they will be able to hire more people. They will be able to expand 
their markets. Some of those benefits will flow to consumers. We 
have independent research which shows that happened after the 
GST was implemented a number of years ago.
<P>
	If we had the perfect solution we would eliminate all taxes. This 
debate has gone on and on and we are left with looking at what are 
the practical alternatives. The HST is a practical alternative. In 
addition, it will create some real benefits for people in Atlantic 
Canada. If other provinces would follow suit they would realize the 
same benefits.
<P>
<B>(1355 )</B>
<P>
	We all know that if the tax is harmonized in Ontario there will be 
some difficulty because consumers will now have to pay this 
harmonized tax on services at a higher rate than they paid before. 
That is the reality.
<P>
	What do we do? Do we go dig a hole and lose ourselves in some 
of those facts? Or do we say that it will to be better for industry. 
Businesses will be more competitive. They will be able to compete 
better with Atlantic Canada and Quebec in world markets.
<P>
	Exports are what it is all about. Growth in the economy has come 
through exports. If businesses are not competitive, even within our 
own provinces, then we are going to have some difficulties. I think 
Ontario should take the lead of Atlantic Canada and Quebec and 
harmonize the tax.
<P>
	The member for Calgary Centre talked about the fact that people 
who do not comply with this law would be sent to jail, debtor's 
prison and all this sort of rhetoric. I do not think the hon. member 
was around for the debate subsequent to that announcement. There 
was some legitimate confusion among Canadians about people 
being thrown in jail and the way in which people would be charged 
under summary convictions or under various  areas of the Criminal 
Code. The fact is that people will not be thrown in jail.
<P>
	I find it ironic that Reform Party members, who stand up and talk 
about law and order and crime and punishment and who go on and 
on about the underground economy, the minute the government 
stands up and says: ``Look, if you are start fiddling around with 
your HST, we are not going to throw you in jail but, yes, we are 
going to take it very seriously. We are going to treat that as a pretty 
serious-

	<B>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to inform the House of a program called ``Encounters

Buchanan, or Jimmy as his friends like to call him, attends Sir 
Winston Churchill Collegiate in my riding of Scarborough Centre.

	There are also a litany of concerns specific to my constituents. 
Coast guard cutbacks, de-staffed light stations and DFO

with the government's cramming gun control, native land claims 
and increasingly punitive taxes down their throats.

	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, today, 
the Quebec theatre industry mourns the loss of Georges Groulx, 
who died at the age of 74.
<P>
	Georges Groulx can be described as a great creator, an 
extraordinary actor and stage director, as well as an outstanding 
educator. During his career, this theatre personality deeply touched 
those who worked with him: Gilles Pelletier, for one, spoke about 
the humility and joviality of the man he considers the pillar of the 
Nouvelle Compagnie théâtrale; as for Françoise Faucher, she 
remembers him as an exceptional artist who was able to make fun 
of his own fears.
<P>
	Georges Groulx worked with a number of seasoned actors in the 
Compagnons de Saint-Laurent company and helped train several 
Quebec actors at the Théâtre du Nouveau-Monde and the 
Conservatoire d'art dramatique. He was also a stage director at the 
Rideau Vert and a Radio-Canada producer.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois joins the artistic community in mourning 
this great theatre personality, whose generosity was only matched 
by his talent.

	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley,

Week and it is a very special anniversary.
<P>
<B>(1410 )</B>
<P>
	Prior to 1947 anyone who was born in Canada was not a 
Canadian citizen but rather a British subject resident in Canada. It 
is ironic that Canada has existed as a nation for almost 130 years, 
yet Canadians as a people have existed for only 50 of those 130 
years.
<P>
	While Canadian citizenship is something to be proud of, it is 
often difficult to celebrate. Just last year while filling out my 
census form I had the option of marking my ethnic background as 
Chinese, Japanese, Korean or Filipino. I could not say I was 
Canadian unless I marked ``other''.
<P>
	Canadian citizenship should be something we can be proud of 
regardless of race, creed, colour, ethnicity or when our ancestors 
came to this land. Maybe we will even be able to indicate this pride 
during the census.

	<B>Ms. Maria Minna (Beaches-Woodbine, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to offer my congratulations to the National Forum on 
Health, which presented its report this week.
<P>
	Our health care system is the pride of our country. The forum 
reaffirmed the belief of Canadians that the single tier, publicly 
funded health care system is the best model to deliver the best care 
for the best results for the best price.
<P>
	The forum produced some excellent recommendations. Among 
some of the most interesting recommendations is that the 
government examine publicly funded home care and medication. 
The report also underlines the link between poverty and health, 
especially in children.
<P>
	I support these recommendations, as they clearly indicate that 
health care as a prevention method is the best way to go.

<P>
	Our objective is to create more jobs during the 1997 construction 
season. We believe that extending the national infrastructure 
program should help create between 15,000 and 20,000 new jobs.
<P>
	The program is a major success. To this day, it has helped create 
over 100,000 new jobs. Our government sees this as further proof 
that our federalist system is flexible and helps create jobs when the 
various levels of government work together.

Speaker, as part of the national action plan to combat smuggling, 
the government in 1994 committed $315 million over three years to 
help the RCMP, Revenue Canada and the Department of Justice to 
increase border protection, close down smuggling operations, 
dismantle organized crime networks and reaffirm the uniform 
application of Canada's laws.
<P>
	The plan has been very successful. That is why the government 
recently announced it would renew the full range of enforcement 
measures at a cost of $100 million.
<P>
	As well, last Monday my colleague, the solicitor general, 
announced in Washington after meeting with American Attorney 
General Janet Reno that he will be creating a new, high level 
anti-smuggling co-ordinating group to work with the counterpart 
American group. The aim is to have an additional mechanism to 
work on border enforcement issues of mutual interest, thereby 
maximizing our activities against smuggling.

of how we work daily to safeguard the safety and security of 
Canadians.

10 provinces to meet right thinkers like Michael Coren, David 
From and Ted Byfield. The young Reformers interacted with 
Reform MPs, election strategists and, most important, with each 
other.
<P>
	Reformers call for balanced budgets and lower taxes that will 
create jobs and put more money into the real economy. They 
demand tax fairness for low income families and government 
policies that will strengthen the family unit.
<P>
	The young Reformers are going to work tirelessly for Canadian 
unity, putting money back into the health care and education 
system and a massive overhaul of Canada's criminal system.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="NATIONALUNITY">NATIONAL UNITY</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in an interview with the <I>Toronto Star</I>, the Prime Minister 
said he thought he had done everything possible on the national 
unity front. He said, and I quote: ``I don't have to campaign on that, 
it's not a big issue, we've done it''.
<P>
	Since the Prime Minister claims he has delivered the goods, are 
we to understand that, with the phoney resolution on distinct 
society, a regional right of veto and still unresolved negotiations on 
job training, the Prime Minister feels that the promises he made in 
Verdun to Quebecers have been kept?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as promised, we passed a resolution in the House of 
Commons in December of 1995 in favour of distinct society status 
for Quebec, and everyone noted that the Bloc Quebecois does not 
want Quebec recognized as a distinct society in Canada.
<P>
	We passed a bill in the Parliament of Canada establishing 
regional veto rights that gives the Province of Quebec a right of 
veto. Once again, Bloc members do not want Parliament to give 
Quebec a right of veto. All this could be entrenched in the Canadian 
Constitution, as I have said, when the provinces give their 
agreement.
<P>
	We voted here in Parliament, but once again the leader of the 
Quebec government, when he was leader of the Bloc Quebecois, 
voted against both these measures. Still, we pursued it. In the 
speech from the throne last year, we said that we were withdrawing 
from a number of areas of activity in Canada.
<P>
	We are no longer involved in mining or forestry. We have found 
common ground with the provinces on tourism. We have 
negotiated very useful clarifications on environmental matters and, 
at this time, we have offered  the provinces new arrangements with 
respect to manpower training, a very important issue for Quebec. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7883"> 7883 </A></B>
<P>
We have signed an agreement with the Government of Alberta, 
another one with the Government of New Brunswick, and the 
minister is now working on an agreement with the Government of 
Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is not a question of what the present, past or future 
leader of the Bloc Quebecois would like. We are talking about 
promises made by the Prime Minister. We are talking about 
promises made by the Prime Minister himself, on his own 
initiative, before the referendum, in front of all Quebecers. Let us 
not shift the blame.
<P>
	I am going to put the following question to him: If his distinct 
society resolution is so important, when has the government taken 
it into account? What has it meant for Quebec since it was passed, 
this resolution that is not worth the paper it is written on, this 
meaningless resolution that has produced nothing, and that does 
not absolve the Prime Minister from his promises?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Liberal party and the government undertook to pass a 
distinct society resolution and we have done so. We have taken it 
into consideration, for, in the speech from the throne, we vowed to 
work on improving the federation, one problem at a time, and I 
have just given a fairly long list of what we have done.
<P>
	What is fascinating in all this is that, while we are working daily 
to improve the situation, the people across the way do not want 
Quebec to be recognized as a distinct society. They do not want 
Quebec to have a veto, because if they truly did, all they would 
have to do is pass similar resolutions in the Quebec National 
Assembly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B>Mr. 
Speaker, it is too bad. We told Quebecers not to trust what the 
Prime Minister said. We told all Quebecers. Unfortunately, there 
are still some who trust the Prime Minister.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	When all is said and done, when the Prime Minister tells us 
today there is nothing more he can do for Quebec, is he not just 
confirming what we have always told Quebecers concerning him 
and his promises: that there is nothing he can do for Quebec and 
that Quebecers should certainly not expect anything from him?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will have to repeat myself. We in this House, over which 
this government does have some authority, passed a resolution 
recognizing Quebec as a distinct society and another one giving 
that province a right of veto.
<P>
	We have withdrawn from the mining and forestry sectors. We 
have concluded agreements on tourism and the environment. We 
are now in the process of working out the most important issue, 
manpower training. We said we were going to find a solution to this 
problem and we have done so with two provinces thus far. The 
minister is working very hard to reach an agreement with Quebec. 
We were hoping that they would sign an agreement in January, but 
apparently the Government of Quebec is in no hurry to settle this 
matter, as it was for-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> Agreements were reached very 
quickly with Alberta and New Brunswick. I do not see why the 
same conditions could not be met in Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	In an interview with the <I>Toronto Star</I>, the Prime Minister states 
that he has ``kept all his promises to Quebec''. Let us not forget that 
this is the same Prime Minister who claims he has kept his promise 
on the GST.
<P>
	Is the Prime Minister getting ready for his next election 
campaign by telling Canadians and Quebecers that everything he 
says during his campaign will be worth no more than what he said 
during his 1993 election campaign and in his Verdun speech in 
1995?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have discussed this. We would have liked to have done 
more on the GST, but we have succeeded in doing as promised in 
the red book, harmonizing it with three provinces, and the process 
is almost complete in Quebec as well.
<P>
	As for the resolutions on the distinct society, we voted in this 
House, and the Bloc members, including the hon. member who has 
just spoken, voted against Quebec being a distinct society. Her 
constituents will remember that.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in that 
same interview, the Prime Minister stated that, if he did not want to 
speak of national unity during the next election campaign, this was 
because the premiers of the other provinces were not prepared to 
recognize Quebec's demands.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister admit that the promises he made in 
Verdun were nothing but smoke and mirrors, and that we are still at 
the point of no return from Charlottetown: that what is not enough 
for Quebec is already too much for the rest of Canada?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs has said on a 
number of occasions, several provinces would be prepared to vote 
for distinct society, but it is very difficult to force recognition on 
the Government of Quebec, when it does not want such 
recognition.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7884"> 7884 </A></B>
<P>
	If the hon. member wants the federal government to impose 
distinct society against the will of the Government of Quebec, let 
her say so. She should have done this when she had the chance 
to vote in favour of distinct society. It is not very edifying to see 
her rising to speak today, when she has voted against distinct 
society. She should think about that.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, according to the Prime Minister, the next federal election 
will be about jobs and he is willing to run on his record. Here is the 
record: the worst string of jobless numbers since the great 
depression; 76 months with the unemployment rate over 9 per cent; 
1.5 million Canadians unemployed; two million to three million 
underemployed; 700,000 Canadians moonlighting just to make 
ends meet; 17 per cent of our young people out of work; one out of 
four Canadians worried about losing their jobs. This is the jobs 
record that the Liberal government will be running away from at 
the next federal election.
<P>
	Why should Canadians trust a Prime Minister who says he is 
proud of the worst string of unemployment numbers since the great 
depression?
<P>
<B>(1425 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I said and I will repeat that I will never be satisfied with 
the level of unemployment that we have in Canada. We are working 
very hard to make sure it goes down.
<P>
	The leader of the third party should recognize that 771,000 new 
jobs have been created in the last three years in Canada. He should 
be able to recognize that more jobs have been created in Canada 
than have been created in Germany, France, Great Britain and Italy 
combined. He should be able to recognize that in January 1994 we 
were at 11.5 per cent and that at this moment we are at 9.7 per cent. 
I will never be satisfied with the level as long as people want to 
work.
<P>
	He should be obliged to recognize that we have put the finances 
of the nation in order. We have the lowest interest rate in 40 years 
in Canada. That is why in the last few months all the indicators 
have shown a new confidence among Canadians. They are buying 
more cars and building and buying new houses because they know 
this government is on the right track.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister repeats the numbers that his spin 
doctors give to him and he conveniently ignores the other statistics.
<P>
	He ignores the fact that our unemployment rate is higher than the 
average of the G-7 countries; it is higher than all three of our major 
trading partners: Japan, Great Britain and the United States. Our 
unemployment rate is higher than that of New Zealand, higher than 
that of Switzerland, higher than Sweden's, higher than Australia's, 
higher than Austria's; it is even higher than the unemployment rate 
in Mongolia.
<P>
	Instead of trying to make an atrocious 9.7 per cent 
unemployment rate sound good, why does the Prime Minister not 
do something different? Why does he not unleash the job creating 
power of consumers and businesses by balancing the federal 
budget, making the government smaller and giving Canadians 
much needed tax relief?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, everybody recognizes this government has done better 
than expected on the balancing of the budget.
<P>
	Journalists came to Canada from Japan to interview me and 
some ministers. They were wondering how we have managed to 
reduce the deficit from 6.2 per cent of GDP to less than 3 per cent 
in three years. They do not know how to do that and they are 
coming to Canada to find the recipe.
<P>
	We have to stay the course. The leader of the third party does not 
want to reduce the deficit because he is trying to buy votes by 
promising tax cuts before the books are balanced.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if the Prime Minister would read our fresh start platform, 
he would find that it balances the budget first and delivers tax relief 
second.
<P>
	Canada's unemployment situation is a human tragedy. Yet the 
Prime Minister always responds to these questions in this House 
with questionable statistics or political rhetoric. We never get a 
response from the heart. It is the same attitude that was shown at 
the town hall meeting on TV when he told that jobless woman 
``some are lucky, some are unlucky, that is life''.
<P>
	How can Canadians believe that the Prime Minister even cares 
about the tragedy of unemployment when he has the nerve to tell a 
jobless person that is life under a Liberal government?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, since we formed the government three years and a few 
months ago, our main preoccupation has been jobs. We knew when 
we formed the government that we had a deficit of $42 billion. We 
knew that the entire international financial community had lost 
faith in Canada. Some were comparing Canada to a third world 
situation. Today everybody says that we will do better than any 
other G-7 nation in 1997-98.

	We were also the government that was not afraid to tackle the 
problem of the deficit and really do something about it. When a 
government does that, it has to stay the course. We are not about to 
try and buy the votes of the Canadian people the way the leader of 
the Reform Party is trying to do with tax cuts before we have 
reduced the deficit to zero. This is the only responsible way.

had protected the French fact against all odds.

it is a pleasure to rise in the House today on behalf of the Minister 
of Canadian Heritage and inform the hon. member opposite who 
just asked this question that yes, during the sixties and seventies 
and historically, the federal government invested and has always 
invested in the cultural sphere and in promoting the French fact and 
Quebec culture through instruments such as the CBC, the National 
Film Board, the Canada Council, the Science Council, and so forth, 
at a time when there were no similar instruments at the provincial 
level.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, if 
the answer is so straightforward, perhaps the minister would bother 
to rise and answer this question: how can the minister honestly give 
his own government credit for saving the French language in 
Quebec, when its policy has speeded up the assimilation of 
francophone and Acadian communities in Canada?
<P>
	What explanation does he have for the fact that the same policy 
by the same government can have the exact opposite effect?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Don Boudria (Minister for International Cooperation

the hon. member opposite who is a Franco-Ontarian like me would 
certainly not say today in  this House that he and I are assimilated. 
We survived as a society in Canada thanks to the instruments of the 
federal government.
<P>
	And I would also like to say to the hon. member opposite who, 
today, is criticizing cuts by the federal government that the Quebec 
government itself did some downsizing at Radio-Quebec by getting

when it comes to buying votes, the people at Bombardier and the 
people who are benefiting from the infrastructure program know 
that the Liberals are experts at it.
<P>
	Canadians are really starting to wonder just how in touch the

<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr.

campaign in Alberta because in the last budget we gave big 
incentives to ensure a huge tarsands development in the north of 
the province. We were applauded by all the people in Calgary for 
our energy policy. It has been a long time since we have had a

votes. We remind the Prime Minister what happened to the last 
energy minister from Alberta.

	The Prime Minister really does not get it. This fall he said to the

right thing to do in a society like Canada''.

<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I know of one former minister of energy who travelled a 
lot in Alberta and is now the Prime Minister of Canada. That means 
some former Liberal ministers of energy have done pretty well.
<P>
	We are very proud of what we have done in the hon. member's 
province for the oil industry and the development of the tarsands. 
There is not only one province in Canada. There are other 
provinces in Canada that need some help. We are doing that across 
Canada because we believe the federal government is there to 
create opportunities everywhere in the country. That is why we are 
happy to do things for Alberta, B.C., Quebec and Ontario. They are

	I also showed that, in terms of political association, Quebecers 
were proud of Canada's foreign policy and  could identify therefore 
with it. What I said was, that in cultural and linguistic terms, the 
Liberal Party of Canada had set up institutions that have made an 
exceptional contribution to the growth of the French language in 
Canada and of culture in Quebec, and I gave as examples 
Radio-Canada, the National Film Board and the Canada Council.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this government is suffering from the same malady as its Prime 
Minister. On television, it is one thing and, in the House, it is 
another.
<P>
	In connection with the three institutions mentioned, I remember 
the government's commitment to provide stable funding, whereas 
they cut $414 million and 4,000 jobs from the CBC and $20 million 
from the National Film Board and they moved the board of 
directors of Telefilm Canada from Montreal to Toronto. That is 
what this government is all about.
<P>
<B>(1440)</B>
<P>
	Culture and the French language are the product of the efforts of 
generations of artists and craftspeople. They were funded, 
regardless of what the minister may think, by the taxpayers of 
Canada.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> We can feel the tension in 
this government on the eve of an election.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Kindly put your question now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> By giving Ottawa full credit 
for culture in Quebec, is the minister not insulting the artists and 
craftspeople who have produced it and have created the cultural 
institutions that ensure its dissemination?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I must congratulate Quebecers 
on the extraordinary effort they have put into promoting culture. I 
never said that they had not contributed to it.
<P>
	What I did say is that the Government of Canada provided 
Quebec creators, artists and actors with means they had never had 
at their disposal. I was looking back to the years when the 
nationalists, the forebears of the members opposite, saw culture as 
useless piano players. That is what I was talking about.
<P>
	No one is more exquisitely aware of the huge contribution 
Quebecers have made to their own culture than I am. The means 
given them was first and foremost Radio-Canada and the National 
Film Board, and now Telefilm, and I am extremely proud of them. 
Long live Quebecers and long live what Canada has done for them.

	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Canadians are embarrassed by the Liberal's 
pathetic record in dealing with Nazi war criminals. Now they 
appear to be taking the same attitude toward a new group of war 
criminals.
<P>
	At least 250 suspected war criminals from Afghanistan, Bosnia, 
Iraq, Somalia and various Latin American countries have been 
allowed to remain in Canada despite being denied refugee status 
and having their appeals rejected.
<P>
	Can the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration please explain 
why the Liberal government is protecting war criminals?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Maria Minna (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Canada does 
not protect war criminals. In fact, Canada is not a safe haven for 
war criminals or persons who have committed heinous crimes.
<P>
	As a matter of fact the CIC set up a specialized unit in April 1996 
which is in the process of finalizing a report that contains the 
inventory of modern war criminals now in Canada to assist 
officials who are taking enforcement actions against them. Action 
is being taken. These people will be removed. They will not be 
allowed to stay in this country.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have heard this promise before from the 
government and it has not done the job.
<P>
	It has been reported that the backlog for refugee claims has 
increased 75 per cent since the government took power, that 
thousands of genuine refugees have to wait years to have their 
cases heard because of bogus refugee claims made by war 
criminals, convicted criminals and terrorists.
<P>
	When is the government going to develop the fortitude to rid the 
country of all undesirables starting with the 250 war criminals?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Maria Minna (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, it is 
not true that the war criminals have not been identified. They have. 
That is why they are being removed from the country. As soon as 
they are identified and under which class they fall, they will be 
deported.
<P>
	Second, with the backlog in refugees some measures have 
already been taken by the IRB which has total responsibility for 
administering the refugee system and addressing the issues.
<P>
	Furthermore, Bill C-49 which is in front of the House and with 
which Parliament is dealing, contains provisions that will reduce 
the refugee division panels from two to  one member. This 
legislation change will improve the efficiency of the IRB while 
realizing efficiencies in that kind of a system.
<P>
<B>(1445 )</B>
<P>
	If the hon. member would assist us in passing this bill, it would 
go a long way in dealing with the issue.

	<B>Mr. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Vancouver South, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Revenue.
<P>
	The new foreign reporting requirements have generated 
considerable concern in British Columbia. In response to these 
concerns, the Minister of Finance recently announced that these 
rules would not take effect until 1998.
<P>
	Can the minister tell the House why the T-1 income tax form sent 
to Canadians for the upcoming tax season contains three questions 
relating to foreign property reporting?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am glad to have the opportunity to clarify this important 
point for the House and to say that for the 1996 tax filing year, 
Canadians will not have to complete the section of the income tax 
form dealing with the reporting of foreign assets.
<P>
	As the House knows, Revenue Canada prints its forms in 
advance, often in anticipation of legislation. In this case, 
legislation was changed late in the year and Canadians will not 
have to report on their foreign assets until April 30, 1998.

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Employment is the number one concern of Quebecers and 
Canadians. Despite the Prime Minister's fine promises, his 
government's record on job creation is pitiful. We still have 1.5 
million people out of work, almost as many as in 1993. The 
unemployment rate has remained above 9 per cent for more than 76 
consecutive months, the longest stretch since the Great Depression.
<P>
	By telling us that he wants to run once again on a platform of job 
creation, is the Prime Minister not in fact recognizing, admitting 
that he failed to fulfil his 1993 promise of jobs, jobs, jobs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what the Prime Minister said 
and what we, on the government side, are saying is that we are 
extremely concerned about  the prolonged employment crisis. The 
situation is the same almost everywhere in the western world, and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7888"> 7888 </A></B>
<P>
it is extremely difficult to fight unemployment successfully right 
now, with the new economy and technological changes.
<P>
	We made a commitment to create jobs. We are not afraid to 
admit that not enough jobs were created. But we are also saying 
that we have done much better than most other western economies 
and that, everywhere we go, we are praised for managing to create 
more than 700,000 jobs in the Canadian economy while putting our 
fiscal house in order. That is not enough, but we are saying it is a 
very good start.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, instead of 
playing with statistics and comparing Canada with those nations 
with the worst record in terms of job creation, the minister should 
recognize that 15 of the 26 leading industrialized nations have a 
lower unemployment rate than Canada.
<P>
	Why does he claim that Canada is the best country in the world 
by comparing it with countries that have achieved less?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, that is precisely why our 
government is putting so much energy into doing even more for job 
creation. I will be discussing this matter with several of my 
colleagues in the near future, because we are indeed very 
concerned about the unemployment situation, particularly among 
young people. In the next few days, I hope to be able to outline our 
government's concrete strategy for helping young people who are 
unemployed.
<P>
	My own department, Human Resources Development Canada, 
has set up and spent millions of dollars on programs designed to 
help the unemployed return to the labour force. These programs are 
extremely effective and will hopefully produce even greater results 
in the years to come.

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The defence minister has reversed previous Liberal 
commitments not to interfere with the Somalia inquiry, yet Justice 
Letourneau has called the defence minister's interference in the 
inquiry: ``a serious challenge to democratic institutions and to 
democracy itself''.
<P>
	The minister claims that he wants to see justice done. By 
shutting down the inquiry he is making the junior ranks pay a price 
while senior bureaucrats and Liberal insiders seem to go 
untouched.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister agree with the analysis of Justice 
Letourneau? Is this interference really a travesty of justice and an 
interference with democratic institutions?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as was requested by the leader of the third party, we are 
making sure the inquiry is completed in time so it will not be going 
on at the time of an election. I think the Minister of National 
Defence explained his position extremely well and we are 
supporting him.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Prime Minister knows that he has another year and a half before he 
has to call an election. There is plenty of time for a full 
investigation.
<P>
	The defence minister has been attacking the inquiry by 
suggesting that Justice Letourneau can call any witness he wants. 
Yet Justice Letourneau said last week: ``It is not true the inquiry has 
plenty of time to call all the witnesses such as Mr. Fowler and Mr. 
Anderson. Evidence on important matters presented without the 
possibility of real or substantial testing risks producing a 
whitewash of the alleged cover-up, rather than investigation of it''.
<P>
	Why would the Prime Minister allow a whitewash of this 
inquiry? Why would he allow that to happen when it is only the low 
ranking officials now who have been under charge?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am happy to realize that the hon. member is not keen to 
go to the polls and would rather have an election in 18 months. 
However, that is not a subject for discussion at this time.
<P>
	When the Minister of National Defence announced that the 
inquiry was to be terminated in June, it gave the commission three 
more months because its mandate was that the inquiry be 
completed in March. After he made the announcement the 
commission had two and half months to call the witnesses it 
wanted. Of course, it is up to the commission to choose which 
witnesses it wants to hear. We have nothing to do with that.
<P>
	We will see by the end of the inquiry to which witnesses the 
commission decided to listen and to which it decided not to listen. 
But there were two and a half months after the minister's decision 
for the commission to call any witness to testify.

House, to discuss France's decision to ban asbestos with President 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7889"> 7889 </A></B>
<P>
Jacques Chirac. As you know,  that industry accounts for thousands 
of jobs in the asbestos region.
<P>
	Following his official two day visit to Paris, on January 22 and 
23, can the Prime Minister tell us the outcome of his efforts to 
defend Quebec's asbestos industry?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member is aware that the issue was raised with 
France's President and Prime Minister. In fact, during our joint 
press conference, Prime Minister Juppé clearly indicated that 
France had no intention of reconsidering its decision in that regard.
<P>
	Moreover, during a reception with Prime Minister Juppé, I 
introduced to him two residents of the asbestos region, Raymond 
Setlakwe and his wife. Mr. Setlakwe had asbestos in his jacket to 
prove that it is not a very dangerous product. The Prime Minister 
found the whole episode quite funny.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
considering the Prime Minister's reply, I am inclined to think that 
he did not get any concrete assurances for the asbestos region, 
which includes the towns of Thetford and Asbestos.
<P>
<B>(1455)</B>
<P>
	Given France's refusal to reconsider its decision to ban asbestos, 
will the Prime Minister tell us why his government stubbornly 
refuses to lodge a complaint to the World Trade Organization, so as 
to stop the domino effect of France's decision in Europe?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, during my visit to France, we had an opportunity to 
discuss the issue with the French Prime Minister. We informed him 
that the Royal Society of Canada had produced a very detailed 
report showing that it is possible to use asbestos safely. I asked the 
Prime Minister to have that document examined by his experts, and 
he agreed to do that.
<P>
	As for going before the international courts, the Minister for 
International Trade is currently looking into the possibility and 
when he has a public announcement to make he will do so, 
hopefully in the near future.

	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister for International Trade said that our cultural restrictions 
may be costing us greater exports and foreign markets, yet the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage wants to increase those restrictions. 
That is her answer to cultural protection. The heritage minister has 
said that Canadian culture should not be treated like pork bellies, it 
is not a commodity. On the other hand, she boasts that Canadian 
culture has created lots of jobs through exports.
<P>
	When is she going to wake up and smell the Colombian coffee? 
We live in a global economy. The heritage minister has said that 
Canadian culture is a valuable export. Who speaks for the 
government, the heritage minister or the Minister for International 
Trade?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the member is trying to show some division 
between myself and the Minister of Canadian Heritage he is 
barking up the wrong tree.
<P>
	Both the Minister of Canadian Heritage and myself are strong 
supporters of the Canadian cultural sector. We want to see it grow. 
We want to see it prosper. That is what the government is solidly 
behind.
<P>
	We all recognize that these are changing times. There are 
changing technologies and we need to keep our policies and our 
programs on the leading edge. We have faced those kinds of 
challenges before. The government is solidly behind the Canadian 
cultural sector.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was very 
pleased to see the international trade minister answer that question. 
At least he is not an embarrassment to the government, as the 
heritage minister was this morning when she said: ``Celine Dion 
would not be where she is today if government policy did not 
require that we play a certain number of Canadian songs on the 
radio''. That is not only shameful, it is frightening. As far as she is 
concerned the only way that our Canadian artists can get ahead is if 
they are protected by the government.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Is it not about time that he 
turn over the culture portfolio from the heritage minister to the 
trade minister because at least he is not an embarrassment?
<P>

and Minister responsible for Francophonie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Government of Canada has done much to assist the cultural 
sector in this country and we are very proud of our 
accomplishments in that regard.
<P>

	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Child poverty is a major problem in this country because parents 
of poor children remain chronically unemployed. The NDP 
governments of British Columbia and Saskatchewan are addressing 
child poverty by investing in programs to help these children and 
their families. Meanwhile, the only investment the Liberal  
government 
<P>

<B><A NAME="7890"> 7890 </A></B>
<P>
made was to pass Bill S-9 which gave millions of tax dollars to 
wealthy Canadians through generous tax breaks.
<P>
	When is the government going to make a committed investment 
in the future of children living in poverty with a national child 
benefit instead of giving huge tax breaks to the very wealthy of this 
country?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the government is very 
concerned with child poverty in the country. We have already done 
a great deal. Over $5 billion has been invested in the child tax 
credit and we have invested a lot of money in the working income 
supplement to help low income families.
<P>
	The member certainly knows that over the last four months, with 
the provinces, we have negotiated and brought about a consensus 
and both the provinces and the Government of Canada have agreed 
to move toward an integrated national child benefit.
<P>
<B>(1500)</B>
<P>

announce the way it will proceed. However, it will be designed

<P>
	The credit card interest rate situation has not improved despite 
three parliamentary inquiries.
<P>
	Mr. Minister, what has Industry Canada done to protect 
consumers against high credit card interest rates?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Before I let my colleague answer the question, I 
remind hon. members to please address the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would be happy if that question went to the Chair.
<P>
	I am sure my colleague shares the concern that I have expressed 
about the fact that the rate of interest charged on consumer credit 
cards has tended to drift higher in relation to the Bank of Canada 
prime rate than it was historically. The concern the government has 
is that those rates should be tracking one another.
<P>
	On the positive side of the ledger, may I point out to him that 
what we have undertaken to do in Industry Canada is ensure that 
consumers are well informed about the variety of choices available 
to them in credit cards  and of the interest rates available. I point 
out to him that the availability of a low interest card has become 
much better known by Canadians in recent months. According to 
an Angus Reid survey, as recently as last April only 30 per cent of 
Canadians were aware of these cards. More recently that number is 
up to 57 per cent.
<P>
	I am sure the member will agree with me that an informed 
consumer who is interested in ensuring that they get the best value 
for their money is the best way to make sure that a market system 
works.

given the health, environmental, economic and safety concerns 
relating to nuclear power.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="EXCISETAXACT">EXCISE TAX ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of Bill C-70, an act to amend 
the Excise Tax Act, the Federal Province Fiscal Arrangements Act, 
the Income Tax Act, the Debt Servicing and Reduction Account act 
and related acts, as reported (with amendment) from the 
committee; and of the motions in Group No. 3.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, usually we say it 
is a pleasure to rise and enter into the debate. Frankly, I wish I did 
not have to give this speech today because it is one of such distress 
to Canadians. It is the one that turned the previous government on 
its ear and turfed it out. Primarily it was the imposition of the GST 
on the Canadian people that turned the people against the 
government of the day.
<P>
	I would like focus on what this means to business. In order to do 
that, I have chosen to back into <I>Hansard</I>. It will be four years in 
March that the GST was being debated in the House. There was a 
bill brought forward which amended the GST rather substantially. 
That generated a lot of debate.
<P>
	At that time the Liberals were in opposition. I went to <I>Hansard</I> 
to see what the Liberals said in the last Parliament about the GST, 
particularly about how it affects business.
<P>
	There were several members who spoke about this. There are 
three people I would like to draw attention to. One is the Deputy 
Minister, another is the member for Broadview-Greenwood and 
the third is the member for York South-Weston.
<P>
	I cannot help but have a great deal of sympathy for the voters of 
this country when they feel cynical about government. These three 
people very distinctly and explicitly gave the Liberal position on 
the GST. In fact, every one of these people took action on the side 
of the government when the GST had not been rescinded the way 
they promised during the election campaign.
<P>
	I do not know whether the logic escapes Canadian people but, for 
example, the Deputy Prime Minister told the voters in her riding 
that she would resign if the GST were not abolished. There are 
really only two possibilities here. The first is that she, like millions 
of other Canadians, did not read the red book and the fine print in it. 
Therefore she actually fell into the group that really did not fully 
understand the Liberal policy. In that case, I recommend that she be 
considered quite incompetent because on such a major issue during 
the election campaign she should have known her party's policy. 
The second is she tried to deliberately deceive the voters in order to 
gain their vote without telling them the actual truth. We do not want 
to believe that but it is a possibility which should not escape our 
consideration.
<P>
	I would like to talk about the member for 
Broadview-Greenwood who, previously in this Parliament, 
actually left the Liberal fold for a short time to sit as a Liberal 
independent, or whatever the name was that he chose, and then 
later on returned. I challenge him personally and all Liberal 
members to live up to what they committed themselves to in the 
campaign on behalf of the Canadian people in order to restore the 
trust and confidence that Canadians ought to have in this 
institution.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	I will quote from <I>Hansard</I> of March 12, 1993, pages 16902 and 
following. This what the hon. member for Broadview-Greenwood 
said: ``This whole GST operation by the government has been the 
worst initiative that any government has ever perpetrated on a 
people''. He said that the GST is ``a tax that has done a great deal to 
dampen and suppress entrepreneurial spirit and consumer 
confidence in this country. I know in my own riding it has 
practically cut the restaurant business in half, not to mention what 
it does to students who tend to work their way through either high 
school or college by working in restaurants part time. They count 
on not only this type of work in the restaurant-tourism business but 
on the tips. It has just gutted the hopes for half-decent, part time 
income for tens of thousands of university students right across 
Canada''.
<P>
	Earlier today in question period we were talking about jobs and 
the jobless rate in Canada. The fact is that 17 per cent of our youth 
are actively looking for jobs. I know what that means. I have a son 
who for over a year has been looking for a job. He cannot find one. 
The economy does not say to him to come and work because  it is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7896"> 7896 </A></B>
<P>
so depressed. Partially it is because of the pervasive effect the GST 
has had on it.
<P>
	The hon. member for Broadview-Greenwood said: ``It has 
throttled people with this bureaucratic nightmare of a GST''. Those 
are the words spoken by that member almost four years ago. The 
hon. member for Broadview-Greenwood quoted the leader of the 
Liberal Party of the day, the current Prime Minister, by saying: 
``My leader three weeks ago said that this GST will be scrapped. 
Make no mistake about it, the GST will be scrapped if we are given 
the trust to run the Government of Canada''. That is a direct quote 
from <I>Hansard</I>. Here is another one: ``This GST has done much 
damage to the retail business in this country. It has done much 
damage and caused much unemployment and welfare''.
<P>
	When the hon. member for Broadview-Greenwood was on this 
side of the House, he identified the true implications of the GST. 
He made a great point of expressing those sentiments. He went on 
to say: ``If you developed a fair tax system in this country and if 
you put 400,000 or 500,000 people back to work, you could find 
$15 billion within four or five months, not to mention the fact that 
we would start giving people back their dignity. We have to 
understand that there are close to two million people in this country 
who are out of work''.
<P>
	Listen to these beautiful words from that member. I am happy to 
quote him because he is right. It is unfortunate he has changed his 
mind. He said: ``I cannot imagine a single member of Parliament in 
any party in this House of Commons wanting to defend the status 
quo in terms of tax law in this country. In fact I have not met a 
member of Parliament who believes that the tax act of this country 
is fair, simple or efficient. We all agree that this 2,400-page 
document with its rules and regulations and its exceptions and its 
exceptions to exceptions is no longer intelligible. This tax act 
combined with the GST has caused an underground economy of 
cash deals in this country. Experts estimate that right now there are 
over $100 billion of cash transactions in this country''.
<P>
	He continued: ``All kinds of schemes are going on in this country 
right now. The underground cash economy is just out of control''. 
He then went on to discuss this.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	It is very clear to me from this sample of three that there must 
have been many other members of the Liberal Party, but 
particularly these three, who said explicitly that they were going to 
scrap the GST. The fact that they have not done so and have 
changed their views, their words and their actions since they were 
elected to government is unconscionable.
<P>
	The member for Broadview-Greenwood said that the tax act is 
so complex. He went on to say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The GST has exacerbated that. No matter how many amendments or refinements 
the government brings in on this bill it cannot make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. 
The GST is a sow's ear and the Canadian public is never going to accept it.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I agree with that. I still continually hear complaints about the 
GST, about its draining of much money from our economy, of its 
preventing people from getting jobs and of the great complexity 
and annoyance of having to file the rebate statements and all of the 
administrative costs that are associated with it.
<P>
	I will quote again from <I>Hansard</I>. At page 16906 the same 
member said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We have a situation today where the government wants us to support a bill to 
refine the GST. I am totally opposed to the GST. It is an inefficient, unfair tax. Small 
businessmen despise the GST. They want it replaced. They definitely want to make 
sure we do it in a responsible way. We cannot just snap our fingers and pull 
something out of the hat. There has to be a serious debate on tax reform, but they do 
not want us to defend the status quo which the Conservative government wants to 
defend. We are not going to defend the status quo. There is no way. There is 
absolutely nothing that could ever make me change my attitude toward the GST.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Well it appears that being elected to the government side actually 
did change his attitude to the GST. He of all the members made one 
of the braver attempts to change it.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> According to what I have hear the member's time 
is up.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> I am surprised.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am surprised too because I was enjoying it so 
much. I think we will pass on to the hon. member for Saint John.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would first 
like to say that I am pleased to be able to speak to the report stage 
of Bill C-70.
<P>
	I would also like to inform my colleagues from the Reform 
Party, notably the member for Prince George-Bulkley Valley and 
the member for Medicine Hat, that the member for Saint John has 
spoken out against the HST on a number of occasions. I also 
brought the Retail Council of Canada to my riding of Saint John, 
New Brunswick for a luncheon with the board of trade and the 
business community. I have spoken in this House several times and 
have written several articles for the paper as well. I just wanted to 
clarify a couple of statements that were made in this House.
<P>
	The concept of harmonization is worthwhile, however not this 
government's version. I cannot support a bill which will hide taxes, 
shut down stores in Atlantic Canada and kill jobs for our people. 
This bill is nothing more than a political solution to cover up the 
Liberal failure to scrap the GST. Who is going to pay the price for a 
promise made during the heat of an election? The people of 
Atlantic Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7897"> 7897 </A></B>
<P>
	The amendments made in committee and the amendments we 
are debating today do not address the problems because the bill 
is fundamentally flawed. This comes as no surprise when we have 
a government rushing to live up to a poorly thought out campaign 
promise before the election rolls around.
<P>
	But it is more than just that. There were hearings up here on the 
Hill and no one informed our people back home in New Brunswick, 
Nova Scotia and Newfoundland that if they wanted to come and 
make a presentation, the government would pay their way. No one 
mentioned it to them. They did not know this because no one told 
them. Is that because the government did not want to hear from 
them?
<P>
<B>(1540 )</B>
<P>
	It is ironic that the majority of those affected by the HST have 
not had their say about this legislation. I am sure many Atlantic 
Canadians would have been delighted to come here to make it clear 
how much they oppose the legislation on this harmonized tax with 
tax in pricing. One also has to question why hearings were not held, 
as I have stated, in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and 
Newfoundland.
<P>
	One of the biggest problems with this legislation is the tax 
included pricing component. Retailers, businesses and restaurant 
owners to name just a few have explained what it will cost in 
dollars to switch to a tax in pricing system. More important, they 
have also explained the cost in real terms, in terms of jobs, jobs, 
jobs. Twelve stores have already stated that they will be closing 
down because of the harmonized tax and the tax in pricing.
<P>
	It is also ironic that while the government is trying to make 
Canadians believe it has lived up to one campaign promise, it is 
reneging on the other promise of jobs. A representative from K 
Mart Canada said that the company will face an inevitable loss of 
jobs as marginally profitable locations become unprofitable due to 
increased costs.
<P>
	One only has to look at the population of the area of Nova Scotia, 
New Brunswick and Newfoundland. Take a look. As the Retail 
Council of Canada stated, it is a much smaller population than 
central Canada, Quebec, or out west. It said that the profit there is 
very marginal and asked: ``What would you do if you were us? 
Would you stay there or would you just stop? Would you pull out?''
<P>
	This is a very serious situation. Those who have come to see me 
up on the Hill are: the Hudson's Bay Company, Canadian Tire, 
Sears, Eaton's, Shoppers Drug Mart. The list is long and they are 
all saying that they may pull out of Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	When the Liberal MPs from our area vote for this, they will be 
going against the wishes of their people. How can they possibly do 
that? How can any of the MPs from these provinces possibly vote 
for this when, as the hon. member from the Reform Party just 
quoted, they stated  when in opposition that it was no good? They 
said that this was wrong and that if they formed the government, 
they would never do it.
<P>
	The hon. member for Acadie-Bathurst, who is now Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, said: ``The sign 
of the times is that so long as we have a tax that is hidden from the 
consumer, we are going to have problems that are a lot more 
serious than we understand''. He also stated: ``The whole idea of 
visibility was seen by many Canadians as being a deterrent to 
free-spending governments which would just raise the tax, get the 
money it needs at election time for promises and spend it 
foolishly''. These were statements in <I>Hansard</I> in 1990.
<P>
	How are Canadians to hold this government accountable when 
they do not know which position to believe because it changes from 
year to year? Perhaps the government members opposite could 
clarify their position and explain why it has changed so drastically 
now that they are the government.
<P>
	It has just been brought to our attention that Assumption Life in 
New Brunswick must now charge HST on its management fees for 
segregated funds. However companies headquartered outside the 
harmonized zone do not have to charge the HST. If you were 
someone in New Brunswick, would you go to Assumption Life 
now knowing this? Any company selling mutual funds will choose 
not to locate in our area of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and 
Newfoundland. Companies already in the harmonized zone would 
be better off relocating to a non-harmonized province which is 
what they are telling us every day.
<P>
	This legislation will drive business away from the Atlantic 
region. We do not want to be have not provinces. We want to 
contribute to our country, but we cannot do this if this government 
continues to cut off our legs from underneath us when it brings in a 
tax such as this.
<P>
	Representatives from One Voice, The Canadian Seniors Network 
came to see me. They explained that seniors will be paying more. 
One little senior called me and said: ``I have very little money but 
when this new tax comes in, I must pay it on my heating bill, I must 
pay it on my hydro bill''. She said further: ``I do not believe that I 
will be able to go to the hair stylist any more to get my haircut. I 
cannot afford any more, Elsie. I can barely meet the needs that I 
have today with the money and income that I have. In addition, 
some groceries and children's clothing will cost more''. This 
legislation is not good for the people of Saint John, my riding. It is 
not good for the people in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and 
Newfoundland.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	One must ask oneself why only New Brunswick, Nova Scotia 
and Newfoundland agreed to the HST. Would it be  because these 
three provinces are the only provinces left in Canada with Liberal 
premiers? Would it be because all three provincial governments 
received a substantial monetary gift from the federal government 
on agreeing to implement the HST? Did they have any choice, 
because of politics? Why would all other premiers across the nation 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7898"> 7898 </A></B>
<P>
say no and only the three Liberal premiers say yes? The answer is 
quite obvious to all Canadians.
<P>
	I will conclude by urging the government to rethink the 
legislation. Please do not make Atlantic Canadians pay the price 
for ill-conceived campaign promises and hasty attempts to live up 
to them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am delighted to have the opportunity to join in the debate 
on this most important topic.
<P>
	For the benefit of the House we should take the opportunity to 
review the famous GST and where it came from. As most members 
are well aware it is derived from the former manufacturers' sales 
tax. The previous administration decided that it would have a GST 
at 7 per cent across the country. Of course the proposal was that the 
government would use it to reduce the deficit.
<P>
	We know the legacy that the Tories left us in paying the deficit, 
that each and every goal and projection that was set went in the 
opposition direction. For some reason instead of the deficit going 
down, it continued to go up until this government assumed office 
and assumed a $42 billion deficit at that time.
<P>
	What happened to that $14 billion to $15 billion that was 
projected as new revenue from the GST? It went into the general 
revenue fund. The manufacturers' sales tax had disappeared. The 
new GST was here. Contrary to what others have said, and I admit I 
can only speak for myself, I know what the policy was of my party 
when I was campaigning. People did ask me what I thought would 
happen to the GST. Of course they loved it so much they wanted it 
left completely alone.
<P>
	I said it would be changed to a fairer and more equitable tax 
system both for the small business people in our communities as 
well as for the consumers. I pointed out very clearly and in many 
cases said it twice: ``Hear me, it has to be replaced in order to 
provide approximately the same amount of revenue''.
<P>
	Originally we were told that the GST would provide enormous 
additional dollars in revenue that would expedite paying down the 
deficit and we would reach a balanced budget much faster in the 
early 1990s.
<P>
<B>(1550 )</B>
<P>
	It was projected that the $14 billion or $15 billion that came 
from the manufacturers' tax which was replaced by the GST 
actually came to approximately $28 billion. When the rebates and 
the additional administration costs were taken off so we were back 
to  the the $14 billion or $15 billion figure which was the level of 
income from the previous manufacturers' tax.
<P>
	When the government looked at possible ways of replacing that 
revenue, the finance committee travelled across the country from 
one end to the other, including my home province of New 
Brunswick of which I am very proud.
<P>
	In New Brunswick I listened to presenter after presenter. Some 
were from the business sector, some from the industry sector, some 
from agriculture, some from the education sector and some from 
the consumer sector. They said we had to have a simpler system. 
We had to come up with a harmonized system that would reflect the 
total of the taxes they are paying. I agree it has to be very up front 
and very forward.
<P>
	Following all of the presentations and hearings across the 
country after some two and half years, the finance committee came 
forward with its recommendation to harmonize the two taxes, the 
provincial sales tax and the GST into a new harmonized sales tax.
<P>
	The first three provinces that came on board, in addition to the 
province of Quebec that had the harmonized sales tax, were the 
provinces of Newfoundland, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. 
Some have criticized and complained about the formula that was 
arrived at, not for those three provinces, but for every province in 
Canada to use. It is a formula that would be fair and equitable to all 
provinces and treat each and every one in the same fashion.
<P>
	What does harmonization do for the business sector and the 
retail sector? I have talked to many business people. First of all it 
means that they have to keep one set of books instead of the 
previous two. It means that they have to issue one cheque instead of 
the previous two. It means that one tax auditor will come in and 
review their books instead of two. It is a much simpler system for 
every business person throughout the communities that are 
involved in the retail sector.
<P>
	What does it do for the consumer? Report after report and survey 
after survey have indicated that the consumer does not want any 
more surprises when he or she arrives at the cash register and wants 
to know exactly what amount must be paid.
<P>
	There is no intent to hide the total amount of taxation that would 
be paid on any product that is taxable at the cash register. As a 
matter of fact the proposal stated very clearly that consumers want 
it shown on the cash register tape the price of the product, the tax 
that is included and the total. On the shelf the consumer will see the 
price that is being paid which includes the taxes.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	It is not a hidden tax. It is a tax that is very up front. Right on the 
cash register tape is everything that is purchased. Let me look at 
some of the key elements.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7899"> 7899 </A></B>
<P>
	It says: ``Consumer in participating provinces will benefit from 
the removal of the provincial retail sales tax from business inputs. 
This advantage, combined with the benefit of a lower rate and 
lower compliance costs for businesses, will lead to lower 
consumer prices on many goods. Tax inclusive pricing rules will 
ensure that consumers know the full price of the good or service 
before paying for it while keeping the amount of the rate of sales 
tax payable visible on the receipts''.
<P>
	As I mentioned, it is simpler for the business community, 
simpler for the consumer and it provides the revenue toward 
decreasing the deficit that we know the government assumed at $42 
billion plus. We know that Canadians want the government to put 
its financial house in order. That is exactly what is being done.
<P>
	We are not the first government ever to set goals. There have 
been others. However, I suspect we are the first government in 
recent time to have been able to achieve those goals, to meet or 
exceed them in each and every instance and we will continue to do 
so.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to join the debate on the report stage of Bill C-70.
<P>
	Some members opposite would have us believe that the debate is 
about harmonization of the GST with the provincial sales tax in the 
Atlantic provinces. They would have us believe that the debate is 
about doing taxation better. That is not what it is about.
<P>
	I take my cue from a headline on the Saint John <I>Telegraph 
Journal</I> editorial in January which said: ``Most people can hold 
their breath longer than the Liberals can hold their principles''. 
That is basically what the debate is about.
<P>
	The debate we are having today is about integrity, about 
responsibility and accountability; the lack of accountability of the 
government to the Canadian people. The debate is about the 
government's failure to keep its election promise to scrap, kill and 
abolish the GST. It is about why Canadians cannot trust the 
government.
<P>
	Integrity is important to Canadians. When I travel around my 
riding in British Columbia, people stop and tell me that they do not 
expect miracles from their politicians, but they do have some 
expectations. They expect politicians to show compassion, expect 
them to care and to set an example and to keep their word. The 
Government of Canada has fallen short of these expectations. It has 
not kept its word. It has broken faith with those who trusted it. 
Canadians cannot trust the government for three major reasons.
<P>
	The first reason they cannot trust the government is because 
during a CBC town hall on October 18, 1993 the Deputy Prime 
Minister promised Canadians: ``I have already said personally and 
very directly that if the GST is not abolished, I will resign''. The 
Liberals refused to abolish the GST and it took months of denial, 
cover-up  and flip-flops before the Deputy Prime Minister finally 
did resign to run again in a byelection. She resigned only after a 
poll told her that she would win. This is not resigning. This is not 
responsible action. This is not integrity.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	It is like saying ``you caught me this time, I will go through the 
motions but I still don't have to be accountable''. Canadians do not 
trust this government.
<P>
	Let me share with members again the second reason why this is 
the case. The finance minister said on April 4, 1990: ``I would 
abolish the GST''. That is what he said. Instead of abolishing the 
tax and keeping his word after being elected, the finance minister 
tried to cover up his broken GST promise. He hid behind the 
coat-tails of the new tax he created, the harmonized sales tax.
<P>
	Yes, the finance minister, instead of keeping his word, bribed 
three Atlantic provinces with about $1 billion cost to the rest of the 
country to harmonize their provincial sales tax with the GST. This 
is his way of saying that the GST has been abolished.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I understand 
that debate does get a little hot, but the member has just imputed 
motive to the Prime Minister, talking about bribing the electorate 
with regard to the arrangements in the maritimes.
<P>
	Would the Chair raise this matter with the member with the view 
to withdrawing that comment?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Perhaps the hon. member for 
Cariboo-Chilcotin would indicate what it was he said in the 
context of what has been raised by the member for Mississauga 
South.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mayfield:</B> Mr. Speaker, what I said was that the finance 
minister, instead of keeping his word, bribed the three Atlantic 
provinces with $1 billion to the cost of the rest of the country to 
harmonize the provincial sales tax with the GST and that this is his 
way of saying that the GST has been abolished.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The dictionary is on the table and if we 
look in it we will see that ``bribe'' means to give money to or 
induce somebody to do an illegal act.
<P>
	I realize that we cannot get into a definitional fight over every 
word that is used, but I would ask the hon. member, if he accepts 
that definition, if he might consider rephrasing that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mayfield:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would be happy to do that. The 
Deputy Prime Minister used the money of the rest of Canadians to 
enforce the GST, to entice the Atlantic provinces to accept this 
GST.
<P>
	Canadians cannot trust this government. That member is one of 
the reasons why. Think for a moment about what $1 billion could 
do for the hospitals that are closing down in this country and for the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7900"> 7900 </A></B>
<P>
students who cannot go  to school because their tuition is too high. 
Such is the price of a broken promise.
<P>
	I know the finance minister apologized about breaking his 
GST-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Culbert:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I apologize 
to stand on a point of order again, interrupting the speaker across 
the way. That is not my intent.
<P>
	However, he referred to an individual member. I am not certain 
whether he is referring to my colleague who just spoke on a point 
of order with regard to comments that were made or if he is 
speaking about some other colleague. I would like to have 
clarification.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Incidentally, this time will not come out 
of the speaker's time. He will recapture the time that has been lost 
with points of order.
<P>
	I was listening carefully this time to the hon. member and I do 
not think he was accusing the member for Mississauga South or 
any other member of doing something that was beyond the pale. I 
appreciate that the member for Carleton-Charlotte thinks he was 
but I am sorry, your Speaker cannot find anything that was said that 
is not within what happens here every day-the member may say 
unfortunately-all day in debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mayfield:</B> Mr. Speaker, with perseverance we shall endure. 
I know the finance minister apologized about breaking his GST 
promise, but saying ``I am sorry'' does not pay the bills. It does not 
help the sick. It does not help the most vulnerable in society.
<P>
	The federal legislation for the harmonized sales tax is before this 
House today, Bill C-70. It should not be called a harmonized sales 
tax but perhaps a coat-tail tax or a tax that entices provinces with 
other people's money.
<P>
	Bill C-70 is a reminder to all Canadians that the Liberals cannot 
be trusted to keep their word. Bill C-70 is a symbol of broken trust.
<P>
<B>(1605 )</B>
<P>
	Why cannot Canadians trust this government? The Prime 
Minister leaves us with a third and final reason. In October 1990, 
during an interview with the Toronto <I>Star</I>, the Prime Minister said: 
``The Liberals will scrap the goods and services tax if they win the 
next election. I am opposed to the GST, I have always been 
opposed to it and I will always be opposed to it''.
<P>
	In October 1993, just before the election, the Prime Minister 
spoke again about the GST: ``Yes, I will abolish it''. In May 1994, 
after winning the election, he said about the GST: ``We hate it and 
we will kill it''.
<P>
	However, just yesterday in the Toronto <I>Star</I>, the Prime Minister 
said: ``I have always said we want to replace the GST with a 
harmonized tax''. Come on, let us speak the same language.
<P>
	The Prime Minister not only told the Canadian public that he 
would scrap, kill and abolish the GST, he told the  Liberal caucus 
the same thing. The member for York South-Weston told the 
House on December 12, 1996, from page 7467 of <I>Hansard</I>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Speaker, I think what is compounding the problem is that the Prime Minister 
refuses to recognize what his promise was. He has now had the opportunity to review 
both the audio and video tapes. Not only did he promise Canadians that he would 
scrap the GST, he also promised caucus on a number of occasions that he would 
scrap the GST.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	After being elected the Prime Minister changed his tune. He 
started to say that he had always promised to replace and not 
abolish the GST. This got him into big trouble at a CBC town hall 
in December. When asked at the CBC town hall why he did not 
scrap the GST, the Prime Minister said: ``That is not what we said 
on that. We never said in the red book or directly that it was to be 
scrapped''. It was clear to everyone that the Prime Minister broke 
his word to Canadians.
<P>
	Compounding the problem over the next couple of days, the 
Prime Minister denied ever saying he would scrap, kill and abolish 
the GST. He said: ``We have not lied. We have always said there 
would be a replacement tax. I recognize that it is not always been 
clear and has remained a problem in public opinion''. It seems the 
Prime Minister at this point was trying to pass the blame for his 
broken promise on to the Canadian public but it would not fall for 
it. It knew he had broken his word.
<P>
	Therefore the Prime Minister tried to set the record straight a 
couple of days later by saying the following: ``If I and others left 
the impression with anyone that we would be able to do away with 
the tax without replacement, I want to tell them I am sorry''. Only 
after experiencing incredible public pressure was the Prime 
Minister willing to admit he was wrong. Canadians can no longer 
trust this Prime Minister or believe his words.
<P>
	This truth is reflected in public opinion today. Let me quote from 
a letter sent to me earlier this year: ``The CBC town hall meeting 
with the Prime Minister is the best of what CBC is all about. The 
Prime Minister again was not honest with Canadians. I don't trust 
the Prime Minister. I don't believe a word the man says''. This is 
what average Canadians are saying about the Prime Minister. 
Canadians cannot trust this government.
<P>
	In closing, I want to say what a Reform government will give 
Canadians. It will give four tools to keep its elected officials 
accountable to their promises. These four tools are the following. 
First, free votes in Parliament so that MPs ultimately take their 
voting instructions from their electors, not the party whip. Second, 
the right to binding referendums so that Canadians have a direct 
say in issues affecting their interests. Third, the right to citizen 
initiatives so that Canadians can force an issue on to the 
referendum ballot if the government chooses to ignore it. Fourth 
and most important of all, the right to recall, to fire MPs who fail to 
keep their commitments to the people and lose their trust.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7901"> 7901 </A></B>
<P>
	The GST fiasco has taught Canadians that they cannot trust this 
Liberal government. In fact, Canadians have learned that they can 
only trust themselves. If we give Canadians the tools that I just 
mentioned they will continue to build this great country. They will 
build a strong country, built not only on the foundation of peace, 
order and good government but on the foundation of integrity, 
responsibility and accountability.
<P>
<B>(1610 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak at report stage of Bill C-70. Despite 
the diatribe that has been heard before me, this debate is really 
about harmonization. This debate is about the new single 
harmonized tax system. This debate is about a simpler, fairer and 
more economically efficient harmonized tax system. This debate is 
about benefits that would be realized by individuals, communities 
and groups.
<P>
	I will speak about five different areas in which the new single 
harmonized tax system will benefit consumers and businesses. I 
want to talk about the economic benefits it will have for all 
Canadians. I want to talk about the lower administrative costs. I 
want to talk about organizations such as colleges, schools, 
hospitals, universities and the registered charities which will 
benefit from this system.
<P>
	My colleague spoke about consumers. He spoke about the 
benefits which will be realized as a result of the tax inclusive 
pricing rules inherent in Bill C-70. Those rules will ensure that 
consumers know the full price of a good or a service before paying 
for it, while keeping the rate of sales tax visible on receipts.
<P>
	Another of my colleagues spoke about businesses which will 
have to deal with only one set of sales tax forms. There will be one 
set of operating rules. There will be one tax administration.
<P>
	There is a business in my area run by Mr. Cinelli, a hairdressing 
salon. He has spoken about the time and the effort which he has to 
expend because of the GST. It is complicated and it affects his 
business.
<P>
	There are benefits for Atlantic Canada. Members of Parliament 
from Atlantic Canada have spoken about the benefits the new 
system will have for business.
<P>
	Would we in Ontario have such benefits? All Ontario members 
of Parliament are awaiting Premier Mike Harris' pledge to 
harmonize the system. We appeal to him at this point in time to get 
onboard and to consider the harmonized system which he knows 
will benefit the province of Ontario. It will benefit the businesses 
of Ontario, especially the businesses that currently have to deal 
with so much administration.
<P>
	We have also heard from members across the way a whole series 
of difficulties they see with the system. They do not seem to 
understand the intent of harmonization. Or maybe they refuse to 
understand the benefits which a  single, harmonized tax will 
provide for businesses. Economic benefits will flow from the 
removal of tax on business inputs. There will be lower 
administration costs.
<P>
	A lot of time has been spent talking about the Prime Minister and 
individuals who spoke while in opposition without fully 
considering the low administrative costs which businesses will 
realize. The intent must surely be to ensure that Canadian 
businesses survive and grow and that administrative and economic 
benefits are provided to those businesses so they can provide jobs.
<P>
	We have in Canada 73,000 to 75,000 registered charities. Four 
thousand of them are comprised of hospitals, universities, public 
colleges and schools. They are not for profit organizations engaged 
in charitable activities.
<P>
	In my riding there are several hundred registered charities. They 
vary from small relief organizations, anti-poverty groups, 
benevolent groups, the cancer society to others like the children's 
aid society, the YMCA and YWCA. Those charities are small. 
They have unsophisticated accounting systems and rely heavily on 
volunteers. Those organizations will benefit from the harmonized 
sales tax system. The administration of those organizations and the 
workload of their volunteers will be simplified as a result of the 
harmonized sales tax.
<P>
<B>(1615 )</B>
<P>
	Bill C-70 is designed to significantly simplify that burden for 
charities. What I consider to be the four or five important measures 
that will assist those organizations-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Swift 
Current-Maple Creek-Assiniboia, on a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's eloquence is 
being wasted here. There are only nine people in the Chamber. I 
call for a quorum.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Yes, the hon. member is correct. Call in 
the members.
<P>
	<I>And the bells having rung:</I>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Since there are 20 members in the House, 
we can proceed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Augustine:</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill C-70, the new single 
harmonized tax system is designed to significantly simplify the 
sales tax rules for charities. The legislation includes measures to 
streamline the definition of charity to make the application of sales 
tax rules simpler. In speaking with several of the volunteer 
organizations and charities in the riding of Etobicoke-Lakeshore, 
those measures in Bill C-70 please them greatly.
<P>
	The bill raises the existing small supplier thresholds applicable 
to taxable supplies and gross revenue, reducing  the number of 
charities required to register for sales tax purposes. The measures 
the small charities in my riding see of benefit consolidate and 
simplify the rules governing the charities' taxable activities. These 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7902"> 7902 </A></B>
<P>
measures within Bill C-70 are designed to assist charities. They are 
designed to ensure that volunteers can work productively within 
those charities without spending administrative time. These are 
benefits within Bill C-70. Another measure simplifies the 
requirements for filing returns and claiming rebates. Again we 
know the volunteer hours that are spent doing those two important 
tasks.
<P>
	The overall effect of the changes are really what we should be 
focusing on; that is, simplifying the rules, reducing the workload 
that volunteers give of their time and effort. All of this would seem 
to be outside pure accounting and economic lines. Those are 
reasons that Bill C-70 needs to be supported.
<P>
	It is also important to note in this debate that Bill C-70 speaks 
about efficiency, fairness and simplicity in the tax system. It calls 
on every one of us in this House on behalf of our constituents to 
ensure that we are providing them with the ways in which they are 
able to respond to bureaucracy, government measures, revenue 
issues and taxation. We are providing them with those measures.
<P>
<B>(1620 )</B>
<P>
	It is important that this is supported. All members on all sides of 
the House must realize the discussion is one that speaks to a 
harmonized system that would benefit our entire country. They too 
have spoken about a difficulty with the old GST, the difficulty in 
the system, the labour intensity in the system and the fact that it is a 
tax that stands in the way of businesses doing what they should do 
and could do for all Canadians.
<P>
	I call on all members on all sides of the House to recognize that 
this debate is about harmonization. This debate is about a single 
harmonized tax system. This debate is about simplicity, fairness 
and an economically efficient tax system. I call on all members to 
focus on the debate and support the bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 
38, to inform the House that the questions to be raised tonight at the 
time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. member for 
Leeds-Grenville-national gun amnesty; the hon. member for 
The Battlefords-Meadow Lake-agriculture.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to take part in this debate on the Group 
No. 3 amendments to Bill C-70.
<P>
	The issue here is not the GST or the HST in debating the 
harmonization of the GST. The real issue here today in this House 
is accountability, integrity and  responsibility. The issue here is 
damage control, damage to this Liberal government for a failed 
broken promise.
<P>
	Earlier today, and I think it is the 27th time, this Liberal 
government brought in closure to cut off debate. Time allocation is 
the nice term that is used but it is a violation of the democratic 
process which would allow a full debate on an issue that is so 
important as this one.
<P>
	This is one of two major broken promises made by this 
government. There may have been 170 or 180 promises in the red 
book but there are only two promises in that red book that counted 
heavily with about 90 per cent of Canadians who put their trust in 
this government. One of course was jobs, jobs, jobs and the other 
was the fact that the Liberals were going to scrap, abolish and get 
rid of the GST. We do not have the jobs and we do have the GST. 
We have the old campaign of say whatever to get elected and then 
once elected do whatever.
<P>
	Let us talk about jobs before I get back to the GST. This 
government cannot run and hide from its failure in jobs. The UI 
stats prove monthly its ongoing failure to create the jobs that our 
children and grandchildren are looking for. The government cannot 
avoid that.
<P>
	Three years have been spent trying to deal with that problem and 
with no success and still no understanding of what has to be done. 
This Liberal government has still failed to connect the fact that 
high taxes are what contribute to high levels of unemployment. The 
Liberals ran on a $6 billion infrastructure program that was 
supposed to kick start the economy and create the jobs that they had 
promised in the red book and they failed.
<P>
	As a matter of fact the auditor general has criticized the $6 
billion infrastructure program as a waste of tax dollars and a failure 
in creating the jobs. Unbelievably, the Liberals are looking at 
another one, only this time instead of being $6 billion which failed, 
apparently they believe that something less than that will be 
successful. Is there no one in the government asking the question: 
What we are doing is not working, why should we be looking for a 
better way?
<P>
<B>(1625 )</B>
<P>
	The Prime Minister got up in the House today and talked about 
jobs. The only jobs that we can take credit for in this country right 
now really have come about because of free trade and NAFTA, two 
programs the Liberal government strongly opposed when in 
opposition. As a matter of fact, another red book promise was that 
the Liberals were going to rewrite NAFTA. Thank God they did not 
because it is creating a few jobs in this country.
<P>
	Let me come back to the GST, the other major broken promise. I 
would like to quote the member for Mississauga South who in 
debate in the House on February 6 said that the Liberals had 
wrestled with this GST problem, debated it at great length, held 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7903"> 7903 </A></B>
<P>
hearings and lo and behold, what did they discover? They  
discovered that the best replacement for the GST is the GST. Yes, 
the best replacement for the GST is the GST, as far as the member 
for Mississauga South is concerned.
<P>
	The member for Mississauga South is a new member, like 
myself, new to this place and new to the debate. However, I would 
point out that there are 19 members in the cabinet of this 
government who were here in opposition when the GST was 
introduced. They knew what the chances were of harmonization. 
As a matter of fact the current finance minister opposed 
harmonization. He said it would be a terrible mistake.
<P>
	We should look at some of the quotes from the Liberals when 
they were in opposition. Here are some of the things they said. I do 
not think we need to talk about the Deputy Prime Minister again. 
Canadians from coast to coast know very well what she said and 
then failed to keep her promise, or at least she failed to keep it until 
a poll was taken to show that she would be re-elected if she did 
keep her promise.
<P>
	Back in 1990 the then finance critic, now the defence minister, 
said the Liberal Party would scrap the GST. The Liberals pledged 
that in a nationally televised debate with the then finance minister, 
Michael Wilson. He went on to say: ``The goods and services tax is 
a regressive tax that has to be scrapped and we will scrap it''. There 
was nothing about harmonization. There were no weasel words in 
there. It was very clear.
<P>
	Here is a quote from the current Liberal House leader. Again 
back in 1990 when in opposition he said: ``Not only do the Liberals 
oppose the GST now, that opposition will continue even if the bill 
is passed. We are not interested in tinkering with the GST. We do 
not want it at all''. What is harmonization? Those are very strong 
words. No weasel words there. It is very clear. Of course the 
current finance minister said: ``I will abolish the GST''.
<P>
	The leadership of that party when in opposition knew very well 
the problems they were facing in dealing with the GST. Now that 
we have heard quotes from the Liberals, let us look at what the 
provinces are saying about harmonizing the GST. The member for 
Etobicoke-Lakeshore talked about support in Ontario, which I 
have yet to identify.
<P>
	Certainly the premier of Ontario has consistently claimed that 
the federal harmonization plan will cost Ontario consumers 
between $2 billion and $3 billion a year. With figures like that I do 
not know how it is going help charities in Ontario with a $2 billion 
to $3 billion tax increase because of harmonization. The premier of 
Ontario also went to say that the subsidization package given to the 
three Atlantic provinces represents a bribe and warned that more 
and more provinces are going to be disenchanted by this kind of 
bribery and this kind of government.
<P>
	The finance minister of Ontario, Ernie Eves, said: ``It really 
offloads about $3 billion annually from businesses to consumers. 
This is not acceptable. I would say the issue is dead''.
<P>
<B>(1630 )</B>
<P>
	Let us talk about the almost a billion dollars that was going to 
flow to the provinces to encourage them to harmonize. The federal 
government receives 41 per cent of its revenue from Ontario. One 
could make the argument that 41 per cent of any amount of money 
the federal government spends is Ontario taxpayers' money. It 
could be argued that Ontario will be subsidizing the $961 million 
bribe to the tune of $400 million. I do not think that is appropriate 
and I do not think that is fair to the taxpayers of Ontario.
<P>
	The cost of harmonization to the typical Ontario family that 
earns $30,000 to $40,000 a year represents an additional $185 in 
taxes. I do not know how the members from Ontario who sit in this 
government can defend this very unfair tax grab.
<P>
	This government was elected on restoring integrity. It knew the 
problem. I am sure its members heard of it at the same doors I 
knocked on. They even devoted a chapter in their red book to that 
subject. I will quote from one paragraph on page 95 where they 
recognized the problem and said they would deal with it by 
appointing an ethics commissioner: ``In particular, a Liberal 
government will appoint an independent ethics counsellor to advise 
both public officials and lobbyists in the day to day application of 
the code of conduct for public officials''. The ethics commissioners 
was to report to Parliament.
<P>
	That is what it says in the red book. In fact, the ethics 
commissioner reports to the Prime Minister. What was to be a 
watch dog has become a lap dog. From that point on the promises 
in this red book went right down the drain.
<P>
	This coming election will be about integrity. Canadians are 
looking for a party with a vision for the future. They know the 
government has no credibility, whatever it promises.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to have the opportunity to participate in the report stage debate on 
Bill C-70. We are focusing on the harmonization of the provincial 
sales taxes and the GST in most of the Atlantic provinces.
<P>
	It is important at this time, in view of some of the comments we 
are hearing from the other side, to review the big picture again. If 
we step back we can understand why harmonization of the GST and 
the provincial sales taxes where they exist is a laudable and 
extremely important objective.
<P>
	It was a very interesting experience for me as a member of the 
Standing Committee on Finance to take  part in the many weeks of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7904"> 7904 </A></B>
<P>
study and hearings on options and alternatives to replace the GST. 
This was in the spring of 1994.
<P>
	The finance committee is an all-party committee. It listened to 
Canadians from coast to coast, here in Ottawa and in each of the 
provinces. They were asked some tough questions and in all cases 
they gave very honest and frank responses to the challenge of what 
was the best alternative to the GST.
<P>
	Members of the other parties know that over 20 alternatives to 
the GST were studied. The vast weight of the evidence provided by 
the witnesses indicated that there was no other alternative that 
could be better than harmonizing the provincial sales taxes with the 
federal GST. The weight of that evidence was so great that even in 
the provincial campaign of 1995, the then leader of the Ontario PC 
party, now premier, Premier Harris, indicated his strong support for 
harmonizing in Ontario the PST and GST. The story we hear from 
Ontario now is a little different.
<P>
<B>(1635 )</B>
<P>
	I do not want to impute motives, but the fact is I agree with its 
campaign promise that harmonizing the PST and GST in Ontario 
would have many benefits for small, medium and big businesses, 
for consumers and for provincial and federal governments that I do 
not know why we are hearing such a fuss from the opposition.
<P>
	Among the many things we heard in the testimony, much had to 
do with red tape. We all hear from taxpayers and businesses that 
there is too much government red tape at all levels. Therefore, the 
fact that the government has taken the initiative to tackle a 
challenging problem, the harmonization of these two levels of sales 
taxes, is something for which all Canadians will be grateful. 
Certainly the witnesses we heard from at the finance committee 
told us in no uncertain terms that it was the goal to aim for.
<P>
	There was no question that there were going to be some 
challenges along the way. As my colleague from 
Carleton-Charlotte reminds me, when that finance committee, 
ably led by the MP for Willowdale, reported, the Reform Party was 
on record as supporting the notion of harmonizing the provincial 
sales taxes and GST.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That was piecemeal, ad hoc bullshit and you 
know it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. St. Denis:</B> I am very sorry that he is leaving. I am very sorry 
that he will not be with us after the next election by his own choice. 
I have a great respect for him. However, his memory is as good as 
mine. He knows what the minority report of the Reform Party 
stated. It stated that Reformers supported the concept of 
harmonization. However, one cannot believe in a concept if one 
does not always believe that one has to go through tough steps to 
get to that final resolution.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> No subsidization in three provinces.
<P>
	<B>Mr. St. Denis:</B> We cannot get from A to B all the time by 
drawing a straight line. That is the simple way to look at problems. 
Sometimes one has to go over hurdles and around obstacles. That is 
what we are doing as a government. We are tackling the issues that 
face us each step of the way as we move toward the goal of 
harmonizing these two levels of taxes.
<P>
	What are the benefits to Canadians? Let us start with the 
business sector, particularly small and medium size business. Now 
each of these businesses faces reporting both federal and provincial 
sales taxes, two sets of records and the possibility of having to be 
audited by two separate levels of government. Many businesses are 
operated by one or two people. They are very small operations 
where every hour spent on government red tape is an hour taken 
away from productivity, an hour taken away from selling more 
goods or providing service to their customers. To the extent that we 
can reduce the time commitment that any business person, 
especially the small business owner, has to government paperwork 
is something that we are adding toward the productivity of this 
country.
<P>
	Therefore, I do not understand how the opposition can argue on 
one side, as it said in its minority report, that we should get to a 
harmonized situation, but on the other side it says that we should 
not tackle each step along the way with bigger creativity and 
determination. That is what leadership is all about and that is why I 
believe Canadians give us their support in October 1993. I trust 
when they look at the government closely again in the next election 
campaign they will feel that our leadership is what this country 
needs.
<P>
	No government is perfect, there is no question about that. If we 
were perfect it would be the first time, I am sure, that any 
government in the world was perfect.
<P>
	Besides the elimination of red tape, consumers will not only 
benefit from the fact that the costs of running a business will be 
reduced, but over time it will be reflected in the prices because the 
small business operator will be able to cut down his or her costs.
<P>
<B>(1640 )</B>
<P>
	I happen to be one who believes in tax included pricing at the 
retail level, but tax included pricing with full disclosure on the 
receipt at the cash register. We heard, over and over again, that the 
concept of sticker shock or counter shock was hurting 
consumption. Canadians will like the idea that they can see 
something on the shelf that is priced at $10, go to the cash register, 
put down $10 and know that they have paid the full amount due for 
that commodity.
<P>
	On the receipt will be disclosure of the amount of harmonized 
GST and PST that is in the product. That is fair. It will have the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7905"> 7905 </A></B>
<P>
positive impact on consumers that  we need to have in this country 
to ensure the fullest level of employment possible.
<P>
	We have been accused of saying that we would totally abolish, 
scrap the GST. I refer colleagues across the way to page 22 in what 
I call the well read book. Page 22 says that we will move toward 
harmonization of the provincial and federal sales taxes. That is 
what I said in my campaign. That is what I said door to door. I 
never varied from that commitment. As a member of the finance 
committee, along with my colleagues on this side of the House, we 
are taking steps in that direction.
<P>
	It is the job of the opposition to try to divert attention but the fact 
remains that a responsible government knows that people cannot 
take $15, $16 or $17 billion of revenue and throw it out the 
window. A responsible government also does not promise to have a 
broad base tax cut that it knows cannot be afforded at this time-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member's time has expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am always amazed as I watch the government when it 
gets itself into a sticky political situation. To find its way out, it 
creates a scenario and then all members can unabashedly go out 
with a straight face and sell that story line.
<P>
	What we have with this legislation is reflective of a very 
worrisome trend that we are seeing in legislation coming forward 
from this administration. Some words that come to mind are: 
responding to political events, balkanization, dividing the country, 
willy-nilly, knee-jerk, no vision, no principles, ad hoc.
<P>
	The reason I say that is because this is not the only bill where the 
government is responding to a political situation, responding to a 
half-baked promise, responding to special interests that are 
promoting a particular point of view with the government.
<P>
	I have been looking at two pieces of legislation that are going to 
be coming before the House. They have both been tabled. We have 
what has been called by some, Indian Act II. This is parallel 
legislation, if members have ever heard of such a thing, where 
people can opt in but they cannot opt out.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fewchuk:</B> What are you making fun of the aboriginals for?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I am not sure what that comment was, but I am not 
making fun of anybody. I am stating a fact about two pieces of 
aboriginal legislation before the House.
<P>
	The other bill before the House that has the same balkanization 
trend is the First Nations Land Act. Once again, it is national 
legislation from a national government that will deal with 14 bands 
only.
<P>
<B>(1645 )</B>
<P>
	What do we do the next time there are 12 or 14 bands that want 
something different? We have over 600 bands in the country. Are 
we going to have 35 pieces of legislation to deal with all of them? 
This is a very worrisome trend.
<P>
	We have had a whole set of negotiations in this country dealing 
with an attempt to get rid of interprovincial trade barriers. In my 
view this BST bill is actually contributing to interprovincial trade 
barriers. It is adding to the cost of businesses in Nova Scotia, New 
Brunswick and Newfoundland in doing business with other 
provinces. Why we would want to go in this direction is absolutely 
beyond me. There is only one overriding reason, and we know what 
it is. The government got in trouble, it got hung on its own 
statements and in order to extricate itself it entered into this special 
agreement. Why else did the government have to come up with $1 
billion to encourage people in those three provinces to participate?
<P>
	The three provinces which are the net contributors to 
equalization in the country are B.C., Alberta and Ontario. Those 
three provinces do not want to have anything to do with this 
proposal. That is interesting.
<P>
	The minister of finance for the province of Ontario has said that 
this way of arranging things would cost the province $3 billion in 
extra taxes. It is comforting to see that there is someone who 
cannot be bought.
<P>
	There is a circumstance in the bill which would force federally 
regulated industries like the airlines and the banks to bury GST in 
their pricing across the country. I find that most interesting with the 
current transparency of taxation.
<P>
	I have relatives who live in the United States. They have looked 
at ticketing from the United States through Canadian airspace to 
Canadian destinations. Travel agents in the U.S. are absolutely 
horrified at the level of taxation in Canadian air travel as compared 
to U.S. air travel. At least they know it is taxation which is creating 
the pricing. With this kind of provision no one will know. Is that 
not wonderful for the government's agenda of out of sight, out of 
mind?
<P>
	There is another parallel. If they cannot blend it, then maybe 
they can obfuscate it. We can always see in the actions of this 
government where it is trying to maintain federal leverage but it 
wants to obfuscate how it achieves the leverage because it wants to 
do it at minimum cost. We have seen that in the blending of the 
transfers to the provinces for health, education and welfare during 
the term of this government. They were rolled into one transfer. It 
is much harder to delineate what is going where. Then the $18 
billion transfer was reduced by $7 billion, but it cannot be tracked 
because it has a new name and it is blended. That is quite a parallel.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7906"> 7906 </A></B>
<P>
	We have the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, the 
Minister of Finance and scores of Liberal cabinet and caucus 
members who all made election pledges to eliminate and not blend 
the GST. We have a Deputy Prime Minister who said on this issue: 
``A promise made by a politician seeking election is not really a 
promise''. Is that not wonderful?
<P>
<B>(1650 )</B>
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> What is it then?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I would like to know what it is also.
<P>
	The Retail Council of Canada estimates that by forcing stores to 
bury the tax the harmonization tax regime will cost retailers $100 
million a year. What on earth is the government trying to do? I 
heard Liberals in this House say it will make business more 
competitive.
<P>
	I will tell the House what will make businesses more 
competitive. A $95 billion federal government, not a Liberal $110 
billion government. The Reform Party proposes $95 billion 
spending, excluding interest on the debt.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> What are you going to spend it on?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Read our fresh start program and you will know 
what we are going to spend it on.
<P>
	The western world is moving in new directions. The public is 
demanding balanced budgets and the provinces are getting there 
much faster than the feds. There will be a reduced incentive for 
provincial sales tax relief with the BST. There will be more 
leverage from the federal government on the provinces.
<P>
	We have seen 36 tax increases from this government, taking $24 
billion more from the taxpayers. If the feds really want to come to 
grips with a rational, focused, central government, they could 
indeed contemplate the end of GST. At least let us not put 
roadblocks in the way of eliminating the GST, and that is what the 
BST does.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Halifax, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to take part in this debate today. I want to speak a little 
about some of the benefits that harmonizing the sales tax will 
bring, in particular to consumers in Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	It is very interesting to know that in polling and in otherwise 
questioning consumers in the Atlantic provinces that have agreed 
to harmonize the sales tax with the federal government, over 79 per 
cent of persons polled-and I am happy to say that the major poll 
was taken in the city of Halifax in my riding-were in favour of tax 
inclusive pricing.
<P>
	It is very important for people to realize, even some of the 
people on the other side, and really understand what is happening 
and what tax inclusive pricing means for consumers. It is 
something all of us as legislators have heard of since the first time 
the GST was brought in. The  bottom line is that consumers want to 
know how much they have to pay before they get to the cash 
register.
<P>
	Every single one of us has had the experience while shopping of 
seeing something that we want to buy for ourselves, a family 
member or whatever and thinking the price is reasonable and 
within the realm of what we have decided we want to pay. We go to 
the cash register only to discover that the tax bite has put it over the 
top of where we want to be. That of course is something that 
distresses consumers every day.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Are you saying that 
your constituents cannot figure out what 7 per cent is?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Actually it is 19 per cent, to the hon. member from 
Kicking Horse Pass over there. I understand that he has always had 
a little difficulty with arithmetic, which does not surprise me.
<P>
<B>(1655 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Your constituents 
cannot figure out 19 per cent either?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> The hon. gentleman appears to be making an 
untoward amount of noise. I must say that I am a little leery of 
making any comments that might in any way stir the beans on the 
other side for fear someone might start to undress in the House of 
Commons, which of course I would consider to be most 
distressing, not to mention unsightly. But of course unsightly 
premises are municipal law, not federal law.
<P>
	At any rate, with regard to tax inclusive pricing, the participating 
governments developed guidelines based on extensive 
consultations with businesses and business associations.
<P>
	In Halifax there have been long consultations with ever more 
increasing consumers, retailers, the Chamber of Commerce in 
Halifax. My colleague, the member for Halifax West, and I had a 
long and most productive meeting with the Chamber of Commerce 
in Halifax recently. As a result the word we heard most has become 
a hallmark of this legislation. That is guidelines that provide 
flexibility to ensure that businesses can comply without undue cost. 
That, of course, is of paramount importance.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> It is going to cost $90 million.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> I am really concerned about the outgoing member 
for Calgary whatever over there. I am afraid that there may be a 
problem and I wonder if we could ask the page to bring him a glass 
of water. What he proceeds to do with the glass of water, of course, 
will be his own decision. Pouring it over his head would have to be 
a decision he took for himself.
<P>
	His incredible response to the debate earlier today when I was in 
the Chamber, all he could talk about was how glad he was that he 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7907"> 7907 </A></B>
<P>
would be out of here in a couple of months. I can only say that, 
collegiality  notwithstanding, we too on this side will be glad to 
hasten his departure.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Not as glad as they 
will be about yours.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> I am glad the hon. member for B.C. brought that 
up.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> You are just trying to kill time. Why not speak to 
the bill?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> I have to respond to my colleague. I am still 
waiting to hear if a Reformer is going to run in my riding. 
Apparently not.
<P>
	Tax inclusive pricing will be confusing for consumers. That is a 
myth. There is nothing confusing about tax inclusive pricing. Tax 
inclusive price is what is paid at the cash register. Indeed, the 
research that many of us have dealt with, those of us who 
understand it, shows that consumers will not be confused. They 
support tax in pricing and they support the options available to 
retailers.
<P>
	Some of those options are to post the tax inclusive price only, to 
post the tax in and the tax out prices alongside each other, to use 
shelf or bin pricing so they do not have to resticker prepriced goods 
from the manufacturer, or use conversion charts so consumers can 
look at the tax included price for prepriced magazines, greeting 
cards, et cetera.
<P>
	Many retailers already use these methods, particularly bin or 
shelf pricing. All they have to do is apply this common practice to 
tax inclusive pricing.
<P>
	For goods priced individually by retailers business supply 
companies are producing stickers with the words tax inclusive 
price or tax exclusive price embossed right on the sticker. This will 
make it clear which price includes tax and which does not.
<P>
	The thing I think most consumer realize is that prices change all 
the time in our retail establishments in this country. In fact, the idea 
that confusion will result is not true. Indeed, it will make life less 
confusing for those shoppers and consumers.
<P>
	The second myth is that it will be difficult for consumer to 
comparison shop given that retailers may follow different pricing 
practices. I think with the greatest respect again there is a theory 
here that the Canadian consumer is somehow less willing and able 
to know what this is about. Most of these things are fairly easy to 
handle. My personal belief, in spite of what our friends on the other 
side will have us believe, is that the Canadian consumer is capable 
of handling this. It may well be that our friends on the other side are 
not capable of handling it. That I certainly believe. Again, I trust 
none of them will start taking off their coats.
<P>
<B>(1700 )</B>
<P>
	The reality on this supposed myth of difficulty is that what 
matters to consumers is what they pay at the cash and not how 
retailers display tax in prices. Consumers will know the difference 
between a price that includes the tax and one that does not. They 
will compare total prices and make their purchases accordingly. 
That is effectively what I was talking about when I said that 
consumers do not want surprises when they go to the cash register.
<P>
	Harmonization is something that will benefit both retailers and 
consumers. Another myth is that tax inclusive pricing will be costly 
for businesses that will pass on the increased costs to consumers in 
the form of higher prices. In reality governments have developed a 
flexible and simple set of options to ensure that businesses can 
implement tax inclusive pricing at a minimum expense.
<P>
	For example, the need to reticket inventory will be limited and 
the need to reprogram cash registers will be minimal. Many of the 
costs associated with implementing tax in pricing are one time 
costs. Other expenses will be absorbed into the ongoing cost of 
doing business.
<P>
	Harmonization will also benefit retailers in several important 
ways. It will permanently reduce their costs because they will no 
longer have to pay sales tax on their business inputs. This will save 
retailers in the participating provinces $30 million.
<P>
	Harmonization will mean a substantial reduction in sales tax 
rates, about 5 percentage points lower in Newfoundland and 
Labrador and 4 points lower in the provinces of Nova Scotia and 
New Brunswick. Both these factors will mean lower prices for 
consumers, between 3.5 per cent and 5 per cent lower which will 
translate in higher sales for retailers.
<P>
	Another myth is tax inclusive pricing will result in a hidden tax. 
With the tax clearly shown on the receipts the sales tax cannot be 
hidden. Consumers believe that showing the tax on the sales receipt 
is sufficient to ensure that they know how much tax they are 
paying. Indeed, in polling done, 71 per cent agreed in a survey in 
the participating provinces that this was both comprehensible and 
an acceptable way to do it.
<P>
	The harmonized sales tax is something that-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> A blended sales tax.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Here they go again attempting to correct my usage 
in the House and suggesting that I use a term that is both 
agricultural and faintly scatological.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I want to inform the hon. member that her 
time has expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I understand that the 
Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister have been busily 
writing a new dictionary. I do not know whether it is going to have 
a red cover or not but I  suppose it will. It is going to be called ``The 
Liberal Lexicon of Misinformation and Mendacity''. They have 
come up 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7908"> 7908 </A></B>
<P>
with some new synonyms for scrap, kill and abolish. These are hide 
deviously, infuriate citizens, kill jobs-not a tax but jobs.
<P>
	This is supposed to be, or at least I thought it was when I came 
down here, a place where we sit down and reason together. Boy, did 
I get an education.
<P>
	It is sad. The member for Calgary Centre is one of the few people 
in this House who has the competence to understand the 
ramifications of this bill and who actually looks at taxation from 
the point of view of the victim. When he tried to make his points he 
was subjected to the usual yahoo comments from the people in the 
Liberal nosebleed section. However, when it comes to real debate 
only three members from Atlantic Canada have been willing to 
face the wrath of their constituents by speaking on behalf of hiding 
the hated GST.
<P>
	The members for Cumberland-Colchester, 
Carleton-Charlotte and Halifax should be commended for 
volunteering to commit political suicide. Their Atlantic colleagues 
are wisely keeping their heads down.
<P>
<B>(1705 )</B>
<P>
	Some place in the rubble I have an editorial which I would like to 
share with the House. Believe it or not it is from the Saint John 
<I>Telegraph Journal</I>. The last time I looked Saint John was in the 
maritimes. It says: ``To keep the GST hidden from Canadians is 
despicable,' said Robert Nault, a Liberal opposition MP to the 
Conservative government in 1989. The government is telling 
Canadians, `trust us'. There is no trust in this government and there 
is no integrity in this government''. My, my, how things stay the 
same.
<P>
	``Seven years after Mr. Nault's righteous tirade against hidden 
taxes, a principle championed by the Liberal opposition in those 
days, the government of the Prime Minister is demanding that its 
own sales tax be hidden in retail prices''. Imagine.
<P>
	Consider this. The harmonized sales tax legislation would make 
not hiding the tax a criminal offence. In spite of what one of the 
members opposite said a while ago, it will still-even with the 
amendments brought in at committee-make hiding the tax a 
criminal act. The only difference is that now it will be possible to 
get an absolute discharge if you do not remember to show the tax 
when you sell a chocolate bar.
<P>
	I quote again from the editorial: ``Any law that hides the tax 
from those who are paying it is draconian and any government that 
opposes such a law is practising deception. In the moments when 
we all stop giggling at the government's silly contention that it only 
wants to hide the HST in prices to make it easier for shoppers to 
know how much things cost, it's clear that the only people who will 
benefit from a hidden GST are the politicians who are doing the 
hiding''.
<P>
	I am really gratified that there are people in Atlantic Canada who 
can speak so eloquently to this subject. They bring the views of 
ordinary Atlantic Canadians to this House even though they have to 
do it through a member from Saskatchewan. Of course their own 
members do not have the fortitude-if I may use that 
semi-parliamentary word-to stand up for their constituents. They 
are too busy polishing the apple of the Prime Minister.
<P>
	I return to this wonderful editorial: ``The government, which has 
no proof that consumers are crying for a law to impose tax 
inclusive pricing, cannot deny that Canadian business is uniformly 
against a hidden HST''. The government should be listening to 
people who think about these things, like the Canadian Federation 
of Independent Business, the Canadian Labour Congress, the 
Canadian Chamber of Commerce, all of whom say that the hidden 
tax should be withdrawn.
<P>
	Is it not interesting that way back in 1990 the now minister of 
defence rose in this House as a Liberal finance critic, attacked the 
government's GST bill and said that this tax should be withdrawn. 
How times do change. Apparently there is a big difference between 
being here or over there. It is a sea change in attitudes; it is a sea 
change in integrity.
<P>
	Integrity is what we are talking about here. We are not talking 
about taxation. We are talking about a government which cannot be 
trusted, which does not stick to its principles and which does not 
keep its word.
<P>
<B>(1710 )</B>
<P>
	Getting back to the nitty-gritties, the Retail Council of Canada 
has studied this BST-HST at great length. It states that forcing 
stores to bury the new tax in prices will cost retailers at least $100 
million a year. The Retail Council of Canada has no vested interest 
in telling a government how it should collect its taxes. It has a very 
large vested interest when the government's proposals are going to 
crucify its members in Atlantic Canada by forcing all this new and 
unnecessary bookwork on them. It is going to cost jobs. I do not 
know how many people have brought this up today.
<P>
	The Halifax Chamber of Commerce, which I believe is also from 
Atlantic Canada, predicts that the harmonized sales tax will push 
up the prices on new housing by 5.5 per cent. It will also force 
municipalities to raise property taxes. The Canadian Real Estate 
Association says that harmonization will increase the cost of a new 
house by $4,000 in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and $3,374 in 
New Brunswick.
<P>
	To get all these wonderful benefits, we are going to send almost a 
billion dollars of federal tax funds, taken out of the hides of the rest 
of us, preferably western Canada I presume since we are the usual 
whipping boy, to bribe, if you will, the premiers of those Atlantic 
provinces to accept the fiat from Ottawa.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7909"> 7909 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, it is 
not God that is here. It is just the secretary of state.
<P>
	I am delighted to speak on this subject. Having listened to my 
colleagues, especially my colleague from Halifax who just recently 
spoke, about the effect of this tax on consumers, I would like to see 
if the opposition parties might think about the business aspect of 
this.
<P>
	I know the Reform Party would not be interested in the fact that 
businesses are going to improve their efficiency with this thing, 
that there will be one set of rules instead of two. No, the Reform 
Party wants two set of rules.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Tell us about Carleton Cards.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters:</B> I hear the Reform Party member telling me that he 
does not want two sets of rules. He wants a provincial set of sales 
tax rules and a federal set of sales tax rules. Instead of that, under a 
harmonized sales tax rule we will have a single set of rules. A 
single set of rules will be applied to all business.
<P>
	I was in London, England where I walked into a store and bought 
an article. I went to pay for it and it cost five pounds. I down my 
five pounds and asked how much more I needed but that was all it 
cost.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> I'll bet you liked that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters:</B> I think a pack of yahoos have infiltrated the Reform 
Party benches.
<P>
	I asked the clerk: ``What do you know about the taxes?'' He said: 
``I don't know anything. I don't have to know anything''. However, 
if we go into any Canadian store and ask the clerk if they know 
about the sales taxes, they will answer: ``Yes, there is 8 per cent and 
7 per cent in Ontario. There is a different one in Newfoundland, a 
different one in P.E.I. and a different one in Nova Scotia''.
<P>
	This harmonized sales tax will be of serious benefit not just to 
consumers, who will know when they see the price, but it will be of 
real benefit to business. Businesses will not have to register for the 
harmonized sales tax. It will be already registered. Everyone who 
has registered for the GST will be registered again.
<P>
<B>(1715 )</B>
<P>
	How will a new business be treated? Instead of having to register 
for a provincial sales tax and a federal sales tax, it will have to 
register for one sales tax.
<P>
	Reform Party members have quoted a number of people. Here is 
a GST quote. This is from The Atlantic Provinces Economic 
Council: ``The potential benefits of harmonization can be easily 
laid out. By broadening the base of taxation, harmonization will 
make the system more equitable and reduce the incentive for tax 
based consumption or investment decisions. Harmonization  
should also simplify tax collection procedures, reducing the red 
tape required to administer the sales tax for both business and 
government. A common system among the three provinces with a 
full system of input tax credits will also result in the removal of a 
barrier to interprovincial trade and may reduce the amount of 
activity in the underground economy''.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Give us a date.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters:</B> Mr. Speaker, it seems that our friends over there are 
not interested in reducing the underground economy. They are not 
interested in efficiency. They are also not interested in being quiet.
<P>
	The Atlantic Provinces Economic Council has given a clear 
indication of how favourable this harmonized sales tax would be. 
Another quote comes from the Deveau family which owns Acadian 
Seaplants in Dartmouth. It landed an order from Thailand recently 
during the Team Canada sales mission. It told the law amendments 
committee hearing on the BST that its competitors already have a 
full refundable tax system for business: ``What the harmonized 
sales tax does for us is to level the playing field when we compete 
with the Europeans, who already have the advantages of a value 
added tax system. The harmonized sales tax means we have lower 
costs and that means we can have lower prices, win more contracts 
and hire more people''. That is a quote from the material provided 
by the Nova Scotia department of finance. It is obvious that the 
harmonized sales tax will be a strong plus for business in the 
Atlantic provinces. The Reform Party does not have any members 
in the Atlantic provinces so it cannot be very interested in business 
in the Atlantic provinces.
<P>
	This government is to be commended for putting the harmonized 
sales tax forward. It will have many advantages for business in 
Atlantic Canada. It will return the structure of the sales tax system 
to a proper order so that business in the Atlantic provinces will 
have a serious advantage in selling their products, not just locally 
and nationally, but internationally as well. The consumers will also 
have a serious advantage. They will know the price of the goods 
they are buying. It will be on the item. That will be what they will 
pay at the cash register.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is February 1997 and we are still talking about the 
GST. I remember when I first started taking interest in the federal 
political system. It was during the beginning of the GST debate. I 
got involved in Canada's political life about the time the GST was 
beginning to be debated.
<P>
	I remember attending anti-GST rallies. They were held across 
Canada. I remember people from the various political parties 
speaking about the GST. There were members from the Liberal 
Party who spoke against the GST. I remember in particular a rally 
in Saskatchewan. I believe it was in Weyburn, Saskatchewan. The 
current Minister of Foreign Affairs was there. He was  representing 
the Liberal Party. At that time he was an opposition member. He 
said ``I see they have named this rally after me''. It was the axe the 
tax rally. He came in with a bluster and a flurry and said how 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7910"> 7910 </A></B>
<P>
terrible the tax was and how the government should not be 
spending so much money. Of course, as Canadians know, the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs is one of the biggest spenders we have 
ever seen.
<P>
	The public sentiment against the GST began to increase. 
Canadians began to realize that this was not just a replacement tax 
for the manufacturers' sales tax but that it was a plan of the 
Conservative government to tax Canadians more intensely.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	It was an easier dial to turn to tax the hides off Canadians. They 
also recognized and realized that the Conservative line that this was 
a tax that would be applied against the deficit to reduce the deficit 
was a bunch of baloney. They began to oppose the tax even more 
strongly.
<P>
	The Conservatives got into a lot of trouble over the GST. They 
were having trouble in their riding associations. Their members 
were coming back to find that they had rebellion in their riding 
associations. There was talk of nominating new candidates to run in 
the next election. There were defections even in the Conservative 
caucus, members leaving to become independents or to join other 
parties.
<P>
	It was not a very happy time for the Conservatives but power at 
any cost was the motto of the Progressive Conservative Party. It 
decided it was going to get this thing through. It rammed it through 
the Parliament of Canada. It rammed it through this House.
<P>
	The Conservatives had a majority government, just like we have 
a majority Liberal government today. It gets its way. It just forces 
the MPs to vote in line with the Prime Minister's wishes, the 
PMO's wishes.
<P>
	The Conservatives got that GST through the House of 
Commons. There was the filibustering. There was the indignation 
and all the routine we see in the House of Commons. The 
Conservatives had a pretty strong and pretty long whip. They 
whipped their members into shape and got that bill, eventually, 
through the House of Commons.
<P>
	Then they sent it off to the Senate but the Conservatives had a bit 
of a problem in the Senate, sort of like the Liberals have had in the 
past two or three years where they were not always sure of getting 
their legislation passed through the Senate.
<P>
	The bill got stalled in the Senate. Mr. Mulroney had to have 
power at any cost. He had to get this GST through. He had to have 
the source of revenue. His pride was on the line. What did the 
prime minister of the day do? He took a very arrogant step of 
expanding the Senate by  eight members. This was unprecedented 
in Canadian history. He added eight extra seats. We call them the 
stacking stools. The Senate went from 104 to 112 senators.
<P>
	Just the other day one of those senators from Saskatchewan was 
charged. I am sure members are aware of the charges that have 
been laid against one of those stacked senators, Senator Berntson. 
We do not know whether he is guilty or not. It just reminds 
Canadians of that old Conservative air where power had to be had 
and power had to be maintained at any cost. Tamper with 
democracy. Tamper with the parliamentary system, but we have to 
get this GST through. We cannot be stymied by Canadians. We 
cannot listen to Canadians. We have to have our way.
<P>
	We know what happened to the Mulroney Conservative 
government. Those few Tories who are left today are still admiring 
his government. I do not understand why even the current leader 
today seems to think Mulroney was a great prime minister. I guess 
he liked his heavy handed ways.
<P>
	Nevertheless, the Tories were defeated in 1993 because another 
party had come along. The official opposition said ``we're going to 
scrap the GST, we'll kill it, we'll get rid of it for you''. We have 
seen the video tapes. We know that is a fact. That is what happened.
<P>
	Then the Liberals inherited the problem. They were not prepared 
to reduce the size of government. They like to spend over $100 
billion on government programs. They wanted to increase 
revenues, not reduce revenues. They like big government. If there 
is big government, there is control, power and maybe Canadians 
can be manipulated.
<P>
	The Liberals suddenly found themselves in a very awkward 
position, having made a promise that they were not particularly 
keen on keeping.
<P>
	What did they do? They tried to avoid the problem. They 
pretended that it was not a problem. They pretended they had not 
said what they said. They tried to camouflage it with some wording 
from the red book even though Canadians knew they had 
campaigned and promised to scrap, abolish and kill the GST.
<P>
	It finally got so bad they thought they would sacrifice one of 
their own to try to appease Canadians and make them forget they 
made this promise. The Deputy Prime Minister did some polling. 
She figured she could get re-elected. After they had carefully 
calculated everything, she tearfully resigned to keep her promise to 
scrap and kill the GST.
<P>
	Then she went stomping back in the by-election and was 
re-elected and reinstated as the Deputy Prime Minister by the 
current government.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7911"> 7911 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1725 )</B>
<P>
	The problem did not go away. The government by this time is 
bringing in Bill C-70 that we are debating today, this blended sales 
tax. It does not eliminate or scrap or do anything with the GST 
other than try to heap its many implications on the provinces in a 
blended form with a provincial sales tax.
<P>
	In Saskatchewan we have a provincial sales tax. It is far too high. 
It is the old NDP motto you have to tax them hard and often. We 
certainly pay in Saskatchewan with our provincial sales tax, but 
this sales tax is not on everything. If we blend this sale tax with our 
GST, suddenly our tax bill is going to go up substantially in 
Saskatchewan and it is not going to sell very well.
<P>
	It was not going to sell very well anywhere in the country. This is 
becoming very embarrassing to the Liberal government, so it 
decided: ``We have three friends in Atlantic Canada, three premiers 
and perhaps we can strike a deal; how much is it going to cost us?'' 
That is the old Mulroney approach. ``Let's sit down and make a 
deal. Is it going to be $200 million or $300 million or maybe $100 
million a province to sign up for this blended sales tax''. They are 
Atlantic premiers and they know how to wheel and deal. By the 
time the dealing was done it turned about to be $1 billion for three 
provinces to agree to a harmonized sales tax.
<P>
	Where does this $1 billion come from? It happens to come from 
taxpayers, some of whom are from Atlantic Canada. I understand 
Atlantic Canadians are not very happy about this blended sales tax. 
They realize now when they go to the cash register it is costing 
them a lot of money. They also realize that federal taxes and federal 
revenues have increased and government is still large. The 
government is not only operating a blended sales tax but it is still 
operating the non-blended sales tax where provinces are not 
co-operating. The government has a mighty mess on its hands.
<P>
	So what does the government do? Today here we are in the 
House of Commons and it has moved closure. I do not know how 
many times this federal government has moved closure but it is just 
the same way the Mulroney government operated. Power at any 
cost, control at any cost, to heck with Canadians, they do not 
matter. All they are good for is writing the cheques. As long as we 
can keep this big monster going, $115 billion government going 
every year, borrow money if we have to, but we do not care what 
we promise Canadians, we have to have this GST. We have to keep 
it because we have an insatiable appetite for money.
<P>
	The Mulroney government fell flat on its face because it failed to 
listen to Canadians regarding the GST. I predict that the Liberal 
government will be even damaged more than it already has been. 
We know that its popularity is starting to sink like a stone in water 
simply because Canadians recognize it has broken its promise  
regarding the GST. Bill C-70 is as poor excuse for trying to keep a 
promise that has been broken.

must become a model, imagine, a model for Canada as a whole.
<P>
	They have no idea what they are talking about and they are living 
on another planet. Right now, contrary to what they would have us 
believe, the situation in the maritimes is chaotic. For three days 
now, here in Ottawa, the finance committee has been hearing 
witnesses from the maritimes. The chairman of the finance 
committee and all the Liberal members were expecting praise for 
the wonderful $1 billion paid as a reward for agreeing to a new 
scheme to harmonize the GST with provincial sales taxes, but that 
was not what they got.
<P>
	They took it from all sides, and they richly deserved it 
furthermore. Do you know why? This plan to harmonize the GST 
with provincial sales taxes in the maritimes is half baked. It is half 
baked on all counts: because of the harmonization process as such, 
and because the government had credibility problems when 
discussions first began with the governments of the maritime 
provinces. Everyone was reminding it of its election campaign 
promise to scrap the GST, and was asking why it was doing nothing 
about it.
<P>
	Rather than talk about scrapping it, rather than get the public and 
the opposition riled all over again, they preferred this ruse, and 
decided to offer up an agreement that was billed as the event of the 
century as a replacement for the GST.
<P>
	It is also half baked because, in order to come up with a 
harmonization plan that is so appealing for business and Canada as 
a whole, they had to dig into our pockets, dip into our money, for 
the $1 billion they paid the governments of the three maritime 
provinces who signed this agreement.
<P>
	If this harmonization process was so wonderful, if it was going 
to contribute to greater economic growth and boost job creation, 
why was it necessary to pay the maritimes $1 billion? Why was it 
necessary to take money from people in Quebec, Ontario, 
Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia in order to 
hand out compensation to the governments of three provinces, 
including New Brunswick-more about that in a few minutes-so 
that they would sign. Half baked, I tell you.
<P>
	The picture is no better when it comes to the mechanisms for 
introducing the new tax and having business implement it. The 
political reality of the Minister of Finance, the Prime Minister and 
the Deputy Prime Minister, who had promised to scrap the GST, 
and the economic reality which businesses have to face are two 
completely different worlds.
<P>
	This is the reason why I have just stated that, during the three 
days of finance committee hearings,  representatives of large and 
respectable businesses, which have in the past made a consistent 
contribution to economic growth and job creation, and continue to 
do so-I am thinking of Sears Canada, Canadian Tire, all those big 
businesses with nation-wide operations-came and told us that 
application of this new system in the maritimes had to be 
suspended. And why? For a number of reasons, but I shall go into 
only some of them, since I have just a few minutes left to give an 
overview of such a major issue.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you indicate that I have five minutes left, and I just 
happen to have five reasons.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	The first reason has to do with the implementation of this new 
harmonization system which, let us not forget, is not a 
Canada-wide operation as it only affects three small maritime 
provinces. This new system will cost businesses in those three 
maritime provinces $100 million to implement, a considerable 
amount.
<P>
	Second, not only will it cost $100 million to establish this new 
taxation system, but in addition businesses like the ones I just 
referred to, as well as the medium sized businesses which deal with 
consumers across Canada, will have to pay some $90 million 
yearly in recurring annual adjustment costs.
<P>
	This means that, for as long as these companies continue to do 
business, they will have to bear additional costs of $90 million 
annually, costs they would not have had to bear if there had not 
been that political agreement designed to help a Minister of 
Finance with a taste for the limelight and a Prime Minister in 
trouble because of his unkept promise to abolish the GST and make 
them look good. Ninety million dollars a year.
<P>
	One of these costs is fairly obvious. Take Sears Canada or 
Canadian Tire, major companies which tend to have huge 
centralized warehouses in some regions of Canada, where they put 
price labels on merchandise before they send it out to retail stores. 
In other words, these huge warehouses contain the tires, household 
appliances and all the other products sold by Canadian Tire, Sears 
or other stores, and this where the pricing is done.
<P>
	The problem with the agreement with the maritimes is that the 
products will have to be divided into two groups: one for all of 
Canada, showing only the selling price to be used in the branch 
stores of these major retailers and, on the other side of the 
warehouse, the same products but with a label that will also show 
the retail price of the product, but with the new sales tax, the 
so-called harmonized tax, for the maritimes.
<P>
	This is the sort of cost that the government did not assess. And I 
will tell you that, when the representatives of these businesses 
came to express their dissatisfaction to the Standing Committee on 
Finance at a special meeting in January, the committee chair was 
busy expecting accolades for the excellent work of his excellent  
government in the matter of the GST, which is excellent for us, but 
not for them. When people came to say the opposite, when they 
said the bill made no sense, that it was hastily thrown together and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7913"> 7913 </A></B>
<P>
costly and would generate annual adjustment costs, the Liberal 
members of the committee were stunned. They then realized that 
the Minister of Finance had done a job that looked good politically, 
but appearances are what the Minister of Finance is about, always 
looking good. However, in practical terms, he won nobody over 
with this new agreement.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you are giving me the peace and love sign? Oh, you 
are indicating to me that I have two minutes left. So he won nobody 
over with this new agreement. The fact that the Retail Council of 
Canada, which represents 65 per cent of retail business in Canada, 
appeared before the finance committee to say, and I am quoting 
from their brief, that to include the tax in the sales tax in the 
maritimes would increase costs and confusion. Instead of making 
things more harmonious and easier for business, this so-called 
harmonization policy increases confusion, uncertainty and costs.
<P>
	I ask the government to reverse its decision and to put off 
implementation of this senseless agreement, which is costing 
Canadians and Quebecers $1 billion and which, in addition, will 
cause disorder and discord in the maritimes, rather than improve 
things. Perhaps it is time to take a better approach, to think and for 
once set aside partisan politics so we can implement things that 
make sense.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have been debating these motions 
for many hours.
<P>
<B>(1740 )</B>
<P>
	A number of themes have been repeated over and over again 
because they strike members of the opposition as good sound bites, 
ways to attack the government. Who can fault them for that? That 
is what they are here to do. The trouble is that it distracts this House 
and people who may be viewing this debate from considering the 
real issues at hand.
<P>
	What we are doing in this harmonization agreement with the 
provinces that are coming onboard now is we are moving to a 
system of sales taxation that is coherent, is in the interests of 
consumers, and is more efficient and easier for businesses. It is a 
win all around.
<P>
	It is interesting, particularly as I rise after a member of the 
opposition, the Bloc Quebecois, to hear the unrelenting criticism of 
harmonization from that side of the House. One has to ask why that 
might be. Consider that in the province of Quebec we already have 
harmonization. So how can it be that members of the official 
opposition have been in this House day after day attacking 
harmonization?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As I just said in English, Bloc members are against 
harmonization, which is very odd because they have harmonization 
in Quebec. Everyone knows that. Is it because they want to keep the 
benefits of harmonization for themselves, for their own companies 
and consumers?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Could it be that they want to preserve for their businesses and 
their consumers the benefits of a more efficient harmonized sales 
tax system? I looked at a map of Canada the other day, which one 
should do from time to time, to remember that Quebec borders 
New Brunswick. If New Brunswick goes to harmonization and has 
the benefits of that, then Quebec loses some of the comparative 
advantage it has had through harmonization. Those advantages will 
now be available in Atlantic Canada and eventually throughout the 
country. It is the right way to go for business and it is the right thing 
for consumers.
<P>
	I travelled across the country with the finance committee. 
Members of all parties, even the third party, supported 
harmonization, but we would hardly know it from listening to the 
debate of the last few days. We travelled across this country and 
Canadians said: ``While you are fixing the GST please do 
something about this anomaly. We are the only country in the world 
that has 10 sales taxes: nine provincial sales taxes and one federal 
tax''. Travel anywhere in this world and try to find that. You will 
not.
<P>
	I will speak to one other misconception that has been advanced 
in this Chamber, which is the issue of hiding tax. Consumers said to 
us overwhelmingly-and I will have more to say about this in later 
stages of the debate-that they wanted tax inclusive pricing. As for 
those who said they did not want the tax to be buried, I asked them 
if they had ever travelled outside North America and had looked at 
a cash register receipt in almost any country of Europe or if they 
had looked at a receipt from the gas pump, whether it was in 
Alberta or Quebec City and had seen the amount of tax indicated on 
the receipt. I did not hear a great hue and cry about hidden taxes in 
gasoline prices in this country. And I have yet to run into anybody 
in Europe who says: ``The Government of France is hiding the tax 
from me''. It is right there on the receipt, as it will be in Atlantic 
Canada.
<P>
	I have taken these few minutes to come back to basics. I look 
forward to hearing what the members opposite have to say, 
particularly if it is something new and not something that has been 
said over and over again without looking at the substance of what is 
being done here, about the wishes of consumers and retailers in 
Atlantic Canada about what makes sense for economic efficiency 
in this country. It makes sense in Quebec where they have been 
doing it for years. It must make sense for the rest of the country as 
well, and indeed it does.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7914"> 7914 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on 
this set of motions to add a few more arguments to this debate.
<P>
<B>(1745 )</B>
<P>
	I understand the member who just spoke is the vice-chairman of 
the finance committee and does a good job chairing the committee 
meetings. However, I do sometimes question the ideas and 
philosophy he supports because I do disagree with him.
<P>
	First he says that if it is good enough for Quebec, it should be 
good enough for the rest of the country. Let us put the Quebec issue 
in perspective. With everything the federal government seems to do 
and wants to run as a federal government, the provincial 
governments of Quebec have always said: ``No, no, no. We will do 
it. We will handle it. We can do it better than the federal 
government. We will look after our own pensions. We will look 
after our own sales tax and harmonization. We will do it 
ourselves''. Quebec implemented a harmonized system right from 
day one. Whether or not that tax is popular in that province I will 
leave for Quebecers to decide.
<P>
	One thing the members of the Bloc Quebecois are doing right 
now in objecting to this bill is they are saying loud and clear that 
the Bloc Quebecois representing Quebecers objects to the fact that 
the Atlantic provinces received a lump sum payment of $964 
million or $971 million, somewhere in there. Let us round it up to 
$1 billion because by the time they exchange all these cheques that 
is what it is going to cost. These three Atlantic provinces received a 
$1 billion lump sum payment. Why? The government says it is in 
order to make up for the shortfall in revenues the provincial 
governments will have. Who pays for it? All taxpayers. And the 
majority of taxes are paid outside those three Atlantic provinces.
<P>
	Some people call it a bribe. I myself call it a bribe, an 
inducement or an enticement to participate in something that looks 
good on paper: ``We can lower your taxes from 18 or 19 per cent 
down to 15 per cent and for the loss in revenue we will supply you 
with $971 million to do that. You are in, you look great. How can 
you argue against lower taxes? It is going to help your economy. 
Harmonization, what a wonderful word. Everybody will be 
co-operating. We will harmonize and have one tax. It will be easy 
to administer. It will be a lower cost. It will just be wonderful. You 
guys will be elected for years. You will be heroes. And you are 
helping us as the federal government to keep our election promise 
to abolish the GST. You will be helping us to keep our election 
promise in the red book because we went door to door and said we 
would harmonize the sales tax''.
<P>
	The Liberals said they would get rid of the GST. They said they 
would not take money out of the back pockets of Canadians with 
the GST but out of their pockets with a harmonized sales tax. At the 
door, the Liberals said that  if in any province the combined tax was 
higher than the 15 per cent, or whatever the combined tax rate is, 
they would give them a lump sum to make up for that lost revenue.
<P>
	Every Liberal in Ontario said they would do that. I know because 
I have friends who live in Ontario. They know that the Liberals 
promised to replace the GST with a harmonized sales tax and to 
give lump sum payments to provinces to induce them to 
participate. I know they said that. That is exactly what they said 
and what they promised.
<P>
	The Quebec representatives in the federal House here, the Bloc 
Quebecois, are angry and upset. They are demanding their chunk of 
the money that was given to the Atlantic provinces. Therefore, do 
not stand here and tell us, as the member on the Standing 
Committee of Finance just did, that if it is good enough for Quebec 
it is good enough for everybody.
<P>
	We have heard a number of times where the Reform Party 
supported harmonization. Let us put this into context. This party 
likes to have quotes in context. It does not like to have things 
piecemeal, ad hoc and out of sync. When the Liberals said that we 
supported harmonization, we were on a big committee reviewing 
how to help this government get rid of the GST. We were actually 
trying to help it keep a promise. We listened to all the people and a 
lot of suggestions were made.
<P>
	The first thing this government wanted to do was to bring in a 
shoe box business transfer tax. That is what it was supporting. It 
then came around to this other form of tax. It talked about a 
national sales tax. In this context of a national sales tax, it does not 
mean three provinces out of ten; that is not national but regional. A 
national sales tax is where we could have just one tax at the lowest 
possible rate. Yes, we do support that and every one of the 
Reformers who are here today would support that.
<P>
<B>(1750 )</B>
<P>
	Anytime we can eliminate taxes, get rid of one set of taxes and 
replace it with another, especially if we replace it with one that is 
lower, you bet we would support that. That is what is in our 
minority report. If we had one blended sales tax, if it was a national 
sales tax and not a regional piecemeal, ad hoc tax like this one, we 
would support it. If it had the lowest single possible rate-single 
possible rate, we were hinting at 9 per cent or 10 per cent-we 
would support it, but not 15 per cent.
<P>
	I was taunting the Liberals earlier today about why the Ontario 
government is not supporting it. It is so obvious. For Ontario a 15 
per cent combined sales tax, the GST and PST, would be revenue 
neutral. Why would Ontario not support it? One tax, harmonized 
and blended. Call it the HST or the BST, it does not matter. It has to 
be good for Ontario business people. It has to be good for Ontario 
because it will simplify the tax system.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7915"> 7915 </A></B>
<P>
	Why are all those arguments not being bought? It is quite 
obvious. First of all, just to get the Atlantic provinces to play the 
game it is going to cost Ontario taxpayers $400 million, their share 
of the $1 billion bribe.
<P>
	Second, yes you are making it easier for retailers. Yes, you are 
making it a little bit easier for consumers not to get that shock price 
at the wicket. But what you are doing is transferring the costs that 
will now be on the goods and services that were not there before 
with the provincial sales tax, on to the GST along with it. Now the 
price of some goods and services will be raised that were only 
taxed at 8 per cent. Now they will be taxed at 15 per cent. 
Transferring that cost to the consumers of Ontario according to 
their finance minister will cost $2 billion to $3 billion. That is what 
is not in the cards for Ontario and that is what members of this 
Liberal government cannot get through their thick heads as to why 
Ontario will not take it.
<P>
	Talk about something new and talk about something that is 
despicable as far as I am concerned what frustrates me is they 
introduce it at the last minute through their regulations. They have 
this white paper and they introduce changes. It is always an excise 
book, an excise act. It looks something like this one which relates 
to alcohol and tobacco products. They have it for the GST. In the 
fine print they put in that tax inclusive pricing is mandatory. Then 
they say how and where it has to be done.
<P>
	I am sure the committee went through hell. We read about it in 
the newspaper all through January. There were complaints from the 
Atlantic region and all these people who supported them. The 
Canadian Federation of Independent Business and the retailers 
association, they all turned on them and turned against them 
because they did not want this tax included pricing the way the 
Liberals wanted it. It hurts the most now.
<P>
	I do not know if Canadians know this but every related agency 
that gives a service from the federal government all across Canada 
is going to have tax included pricing. This is going to confuse 
airline tickets. It is going to confuse a lot of financial services 
although they do not have much, just safety deposit boxes.
<P>
	It is ridiculous to make all these businesses go through the high 
cost of changing computers in order to have two prices all across 
Canada, one in Atlantic Canada, especially national retailers such 
as Eaton's or companies like Carleton Cards. They came before the 
committee and said: ``We are going to lose money. It is going to 
cost millions of dollars. We are not sure if we can pass along these 
costs for this product because all we sell are cards''.
<P>
	The government is not listening. For some strange reason the 
Liberals insist on proceeding. They believe that if they get Atlantic 
Canada to use the harmonized blended sales tax for a couple of 
years-and this is where  they are going to find it wrong-they 
think that by forcing all government related agencies to also 
include this tax included pricing across Canada, they will 
embarrass, force, coerce or browbeat everybody into participating 
with our own money, with our own tax dollars and then they will 
have kept their promise to eliminate the GST.
<P>
	What they have done is entrenched the GST according to the 
finance minister, the master of myth, the minister who said one 
thing on this side. He lost some integrity when he walked across to 
the other side and now is saying another thing.
<P>
	It is like the infrastructure spending. There is only one taxpayer 
and darn it and damn it we are paying for everything all across this 
country. For programs they say that this is federal and this is 
provincial and it is not. Infrastructure comes out of our pockets. It 
is ridiculous.
<P>
	Even if the premiers of Alberta and Ontario, these people who 
are in control of their budgets, support infrastructure-Alberta just 
signed on-it is absolutely ridiculous. Alberta is making a mistake 
because if Alberta with a surplus wants to improve its 
infrastructure it has the money to do it. Taxpayers across this 
country could be saved some money but no. It is all a fight over 
budgets: ``This comes out of the federal budget, so we will take 
some. This comes out of our budget and this comes out of the 
municipal budget. Let us go one-third, one-third, one-third''.
<P>
<B>(1755 )</B>
<P>
	We have to stop this kind of extravagance which is at the expense 
of taxpayers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Ontario, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to speak today in the context that my hon. colleague for Calgary 
Centre has just alluded to.
<P>
	I do not know if he is an expert on the GST or matters of 
taxation. I certainly did not believe that the hon. member was one 
who felt it was important to recognize that there is one taxpayer 
and at the same time not move toward something that is both 
symbolically and realistically an attempt at addressing the fact that 
the one taxpayer deserves a one tax system in this country.
<P>
	It compels me to wonder and worry aloud about the hon. member 
and the other member from the third party, the hon. member for 
Simcoe Centre who spoke very passionately, although not 
necessarily always accurately on this very important debate of 
C-70 with respect to the harmonization of the GST. If the hon. 
member and his colleague who spoke earlier believe in this issue so 
strongly, it is unfortunate that they may not be able to join us here 
in the next Parliament. I know there are problems in that party and 
they are not just the problems evidenced by some of their policy 
issues they have had in the past. I think it is abundantly evident 
with this issue of the GST.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7916"> 7916 </A></B>
<P>
	The name of my riding, Ontario, is fitting certainly in the 
context of the debate. I believe the hon. colleague who spoke 
before me was completely wrong when he said that this is about 
politics.
<P>
	The record will show that the current premier of Ontario, Mike 
Harris, was very emphatic the day before he was elected in June 
1995, that he would work with the federal government to 
harmonize and to make a better sales tax regime in this country. I 
know that may be hard for my friends in the third party to 
recognize. I see them shaking their heads, probably because they 
are not sure whether the Harris government is a Conservative 
government or a Reform government. Either way, we know it is a 
hopeless government.
<P>
	When discussing the issue of taxation there are very few 
opportunities to discuss it in the context of virtue. Everybody has 
their own idea on taxation. All of us in this country would not want 
to pay taxes or would want to minimize them.
<P>
	The experience in Ontario is a telling one that I want to relate to 
my friends in the third party. Budget cuts based on the presumption 
of reducing taxes are being made to the direct detriment of the 
poor, the people who are the most defenceless in our society and 
people who do not have an agenda to hurt other people.
<P>
	There are politics and policies and there are dangerous politics 
and dangerous policies. I suggest any party that wants to undertake 
an ideological view of their politics with respect to taxation must 
first take into account that one of the most symbolic, rallying 
points of our nationhood is our ability to look out for the weak, the 
defenceless and those in our society who through no fault of their 
own find themselves at the low end of the scale. This consumption 
tax, the tax to be blended in the maritime provinces, is a positive 
step forward. It takes into account the recognition that there is 
indeed one taxpayer.
<P>
	A very important point is that it takes into account from an 
international perspective examples of consumption taxes in those 
countries with one single sales tax regime, one retail sales tax 
regime. We have spoken to the chambers of commerce and the 
boards of trade in my riding and across the country. We must make 
sure that we do not have 13 or 14 different sales tax regimes such as 
we currently have.
<P>
<B>(1800 )</B>
<P>
	If members are truly interested in representing the interests of 
their constituents they would be working beyond and above to 
transcend the politics on which this debate seems to founder to one 
of trying to find a co-operative, harmonious approach. I believe the 
best way for us to do that is to follow through on taxation, but 
taxation that permits individuals at the end of the day to have a 
system that is far more efficient and that makes more sense for 
business and consumer alike.
<P>
	I have had over 46 public forums in my riding since I was 
elected. That is virtually one for every month that I was elected. It 
seems to me that while there are those who would like to make the 
GST a big issue and certainly there is plenty of cannon fodder on 
both sides for that, I do not think there is anyone in this House who 
has not given that subject some consideration or who has not been 
outspoken on that issue.
<P>
	The far greater and more important problem is the one of getting 
our financial house in order and at the same time making sure that 
we can provide an environment that helps people get back to work. 
Anything else in my view, and I think in the view of those in my 
riding, is simply nonsense.
<P>
	While it is important for a government to proceed with the 
question of harmonizing these taxes, I think credit must be given 
where credit is due. The Minister of Finance, in concert with the 
people who worked on the committee on both sides, have tried to 
hammer out the best of all worlds in a situation where we 
understand that the current sales tax regime is not one that is 
acceptable to people.
<P>
	The hon. member just yelled something. I am not exactly sure 
what it is he said but that is very consonant with the views of his 
party.
<P>
	The arguments in favour of a sales tax are one, we certainly 
appreciate-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We could perhaps for the first time discuss getting rid of taxes in 
this country. In a perfect world, people can always make that kind 
of promise. In my opinion, however, a responsible government, a 
government that wants to show leadership, has to manage its affairs 
so that, at the end of the day, it can honour its commitments and be 
accountable to the consumers we represent. It must do everything 
in its power to build a tax system that protects the interests of both 
consumers and entrepreneurs.
<P>
	In the case of the Atlantic provinces, we are looking at both sides 
of the question: will harmonization mean that a range of goods will 
be taxed that would not be taxed without harmonization? I think we 
have the ability to make arrangements to ensure that these people 
will be protected.
<P>
	We also have the ability to find a balance. This balance exists in 
paying a tax which is not 7 per cent plus 8 per cent, that is 15 per 
cent, but is somewhere around 12 or 13 per cent, as in the 
maritimes.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This Parliament has undertaken many contentious issues. There 
will be many more in the days to come. The GST, the 
harmonization of the tax with provincial taxes is an excellent first 
step, but I hope that the House and those who are seeking to make 
political points and  profiting from the rhetoric understand fully 
that they are profiting at the direct expense of individuals, of 
people in our constituencies across the country who expect 
leadership and expect 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7917"> 7917 </A></B>
<P>
us at the end of the day to do what is right. Doing what is right is 
trying to do what people expect you to do.
<P>
	Harmonization is an excellent first step but it requires the 
provinces to get on line. Let us not break down on the question and 
the subject of partisanship. Mr. Harris, I am calling on you this 
evening, as they have done in the province of Ontario to do the 
same.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I ask the hon. member to please not call 
on people other than the Speaker in this House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McTeague:</B> I am sorry, Mr. Speaker. I was referring the 
premier of the province of Ontario.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as this debate winds its way to a close, the member for St. 
Paul's earlier said that this is an occasion for marvellous sound 
bites and it is. It is an occasion for the Liberals opposite to rest 
uncomfortably in their chairs as the odour of this particular piece of 
legislation wafts through the country.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	The hon. member for Ontario, who just concluded his comments, 
suggested that this is legislation that is really very good for the 
country, that it has no detrimental effects and that the rest of the 
provinces should get on with it and harmonize the GST.
<P>
	As Canadians know, this bill will put the legislation through the 
House to finalize the deal with the three Atlantic provinces. The 
three Atlantic provinces are the barber shop trio. They are singing 
in harmony with the federal government. They are singing in 
harmony with the Liberal government because they have been 
bribed, as earlier speakers have indicated, with our money.
<P>
	The problem is this. The reason this issue raises the ire of 
Canadians and has raised the ire of the opposition is that the Liberal 
government has a majority. The majority is in good measure 
because of the government's promise during the election campaign 
to scrap and abolish the GST. The number of seats that the Liberals 
were able to achieve during the last election and the number of 
votes they were able to achieve, which may well have swayed some 
of the other votes, which would have affected the official 
opposition in the country, is the direct result of the Liberal promise 
to scrap the GST.
<P>
	The Liberals were very vocal about it in the 34th Parliament. 
They knew full well when they made the promise to scrap the GST 
that they could not. The country had to have that revenue. If they 
went on the hustings and were elected on a promise to scrap the 
GST, to abolish the GST, the hated tax, which they failed to do 
while in opposition, then it logically follows that the  government 
was elected on a fraud. It should not be sitting here in the first 
place.
<P>
	Our responsibility is to ensure that Canadians understand full 
well that the Liberal government did not tell the unvarnished truth 
during the election campaign and it should not get away with it.
<P>
	In politics in our country we should expect our politicians, when 
they knock on the door, and our Prime Minister, when he looks us 
in the eye on television, to tell the truth. Is it too much to ask that 
our politicians, the highest elected officers in our land, tell us the 
truth?
<P>
	A few months ago I read an article in a newspaper which said 
that Canadians do not really expect the people who they elect to tell 
the truth. Therefore, why should we be surprised when they do not? 
That article was written by a respected pundit of this country. It 
went on to say that people should not expect politicians to keep 
their promises because circumstances and situations change. The 
situation and the circumstance of the GST did not change after the 
election. The circumstances were exactly the same. That promise 
should have been kept.
<P>
	What kind of a country do we have when the end justifies the 
means? Should we not go into an election prepared to tell the voters 
exactly where we stand, exactly how we feel about an issue and 
then be held accountable for it? That is what the real issue is. The 
real issue is not the harmonization of the GST. It is the fact that the 
Liberals were elected on a promise to scrap the GST. They did not, 
and now they are trying to crawl out from under it.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	It will cost us roughly a billion dollars in a bribe to the Atlantic 
provinces. It will cause untold grief, untold extra work all across 
the country, but that does not matter. What matters to the Liberal 
government is its ability to say that it kept a promise, to whitewash 
this whole issue.
<P>
	I would hope that when the Liberals come knocking on the door 
asking for the support of Canadians in the next election, every 
single Canadian will look them in the eye and say: ``Did you keep 
your word? Did you do as you promised to do prior to the last 
election?'' They will say: ``Oh yes, we harmonized the GST''. 
Then, Mr. and Mrs. Canadian, look them in the eye and say: 
``Where in your election platform did you say anything about 
harmonize? You said scrap. You said abolish. You said get rid of. 
You did not say harmonize''.
<P>
	Every single Liberal should be taken to task, even the member 
for Broadview-Greenwood who is certainly no friend of the GST, 
whether harmonized or not. Even the member for Ontario who 
spoke so recently is no friend of the GST and neither is the Deputy 
Speaker who changed political parties because of the hated, 
despised GST. Members can imagine how uncomfortable that hon. 
gentleman feels as he stomachs that hated GST.
<P>

<P>
	There are two aspects to a consumption tax. Most people, in 
fairness, will say that a consumption tax is not a bad way to tax. 
It is incremental. It is broadly based. It means that everybody pays 
on everything. People cannot get out from underneath paying the 
tax. However, there are two aspects to it. There is the rate, that 
is, whether 8 per cent or 7 per cent.
<P>
	That was the problem with the old manufacturers' sales tax. 
People were afraid to go to sleep at night because they knew the 
federal government would raise the tax because it was hidden. That 
is why it has to be visible.
<P>
	There is the rate and there is the base. The base means to what is 
the tax applied. This is never brought up. The problem is that the 
base, the products to which the taxes are applied in the provincial 
sales tax is quite a bit narrower. Not nearly as many products are 
taxable under a provincial sales tax.
<P>
	When the tax is harmonized, it becomes a question of applying it 
on as broad a base as can possibly be done so that the rate is as low 
as it can possibly be. It is a combination of low rates and wide base 
that makes sense. To apply it on a narrow base but at a very high 
rate is counter productive.
<P>
	As this debate winds down-I recognize that I may be the last 
person to speak on this-I want once again to make sure that all 
Canadians are reminded of the hypocrisy, the duplicity, the outright 
lie on which the Liberal government was elected. It should be 
ashamed and ashamed for a long time to come.

was a lot of up and down here and confusion on the yeas and nays. 
We are voting nay at this time.

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The problem was created by the hon. 
member for Beauce. We were trying to fit him in. That is the 
problem that was created and it is the fault of the Chair. I should not 
have interrupted the vote. The hon. member is voting no.

	<B>Mr. Jim Jordan (Leeds-Grenville, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
been asking for the government to give some consideration for 
some time now to a gun amnesty bill for the nation. I am back again 
now to encourage the government to move on. I was led to believe 
there was some provision in the new gun control bill for an 
amnesty.
<P>
	It would be rather simple to do. I would not require any new 
legislation. There is already a provision there for a gun amnesty. It 
would not require a lot of funding. Indeed, it might save some 
money. It would save considerable money for people who have 
guns they do not need and who would like to see them disposed of 
in a systematic way.
<P>
	A couple of experiences we have had in this country would 
support the wisdom of a gun amnesty law at this time. Back in the 
period of November 1 to December 15 in 1992 the minister of 
justice announced a gun amnesty and 30,000 firearms, both 
handguns and long guns, were surrendered in Canada.
<P>
	A little later there was another gun amnesty. This quotation from 
the <I>Globe and Mail</I>, which is always very accurate and precise. On 
April 18, 1994 that paper reported the success of a gun amnesty in 
metro Toronto. According to the <I>Globe and Mail</I> police said at that 
time that most of the people turning in weapons were just average 
Joes. They were people who just wanted to get rid of their guns, the 
guns that were in their basements, behind kitchen doors and in the 
attacks of their homes. They had some fear at that time, and the 
situation would be prevalent today, that these guns might at some 
point be stolen or misplaced or might fall into the wrong hands.
<P>
	Gun amnesty has been very successful in this country and I 
would like to see this government proceed with a national gun 
amnesty. It is no good to announce that amnesties are permitted. 
We need the government to put some national focus on gun 
amnesty instead of depending on municipalities to do it 
independently of one another. That would give the project some 
thrust. They could suggest through various forms of media that 
there was a national gun amnesty. If we got a few thousand more 
guns out of our society we would have a safer society. It would be a 
mark of progress to us as a society and as a culture to make this 
effort.
<P>
<B>(1900)</B>
<P>
	I am looking forward to the government response on this matter. 
I know that municipalities could go ahead and do it, but that is not 
what I am asking for. I am asking for a national focus and a national 
thrust to this because of the successes we had when gun amnesties 
were declared on a smaller scale.
<P>
	That was my question to the minister several weeks ago. I am 
back again at the late show tonight to  emphasize it. I am 
committed to this. Indeed, I will be the first one to turn in guns. I 
have guns which I no longer have a use for and I would be glad to 
be the first one to contribute a couple of rifles to a national gun 
amnesty.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
amnesties could be declared as part of the implementation of the 
firearms act and the new part of the Criminal Code. In 1992, for 
instance, an amnesty was successful in removing over 28,000 
firearms and 700,000 rounds of ammunition. The declaration of 
amnesty, however, must be made with the support of provincial 
authorities and local police. An amnesty would be costly, as it 
would involve the manipulation of firearms and the issuance of 
receipts.
<P>
	In the past, the purpose of amnesties under the Criminal Code 
was to encourage people to surrender unwanted firearms or 
ammunition without liability, whether they were lawfully or 
unlawfully held. The power to declare amnesties under the 
Criminal Code may be used in the future in the implementation of 
the new part of the code or the firearms act.
<P>
	There are advantages and disadvantages to amnesties. The 
advantages are that amnesties have resulted in the turnover of 
numerous unwanted firearms. They allow people to turn over 
unwanted and potentially dangerous firearms. They reduce the 
number of unused firearms which could ultimately end up being 
stolen and in criminal hands. The disadvantages are that they can 
be expensive to administer and the guns must be carried manually. 
They require the participation and co-operation of police services 
and provincial authorities. The disposal of the firearms can be 
costly and problematic.
<P>
	The firearms initiative is planned on a cost recovery basis and 
the impact of several factors, such as compensation, must be 
carefully considered before an amnesty is declared.
<P>
	The new legislation already provides for transitional periods for 
individuals who will be able to apply for a licence and register their 
firearms.
<P>
	There is no immediate need for an amnesty and officials from 
the department will monitor the implementation of the act and 
advise the minister accordingly should the need arise for an 
amnesty in the future.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am here tonight to raise again the question which I asked 
on February 6. It is a question in which the Minister of Agriculture 
and Agri-Food is very interested because he has said that he is 
interested in keeping grain moving. I do not think we have gone far 
enough in getting the grain moving.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="7924"> 7924 </A></B>
<P>
	The news last week had a number of people from the grain 
industry, including representatives of the Canadian Wheat Board, 
arguing that poor performance by the railroads is costing prairie 
farmers tens of millions of dollars in lost revenues and upsetting 
export customers. The Canadian Wheat Board has estimated that 
about $65 million will be lost in demurrage costs while grain sits 
on the prairies and ships sit in the ports because the grain is not 
moving to the coast.
<P>
	I asked my question last week, but since then I have had a chance 
to look at CN Rail's numbers for 1996. I thought it important to put 
them on the record tonight in the light of this question.
<P>
	Grain traffic was down 5 per cent in 1996 over 1995. Despite that 
drop in traffic, CN Rail reported a $1.2 billion improvement in net 
income in 1996. In a press release the CN president and chief 
executive officer, Paul Tellier, said at the end of the year that 1996 
was the best year ever in the history of CN Rail. Revenues were up 
1.5 per cent while operating expenses declined.
<P>
<B>(1905)</B>
<P>
	In terms of movement of product, industrial products brought 
$866 million to CN; forest products, $790 million; intermodal 
traffic, $710 million; coal, sulphur and fertilizer, $622 million. 
These are all more than grain and grain product traffic which 
brought in $570 million.
<P>
	It is very obvious that CN in particular did a very good job in 
1996 of moving all the product except grain. Now we are 
continuing to have difficulty in moving grain to port.
<P>
	I first discovered the problem with grain movement around 
December 1 after elevator agents throughout my constituency had 
been phoning since mid-November to get cars spotted so that the 
grain could be moved to port. That was before the major snowfalls, 
before the major cold occurred. We were experiencing difficulty 
getting cars spotted at the elevator points throughout my riding, 
and I have since found out, throughout Saskatchewan.
<P>
	Throughout November and December the railways were telling 
the elevator agents that cars would be spotted the next day. They 
would be told, tomorrow. The cars would never come. The agents 
would phone. ``Tomorrow'' they were told. They would phone me. 
I would be told the grain cars would be there tomorrow. They never 
arrived. As a result, the Canadian Wheat Board is now estimating 
$65 million in losses to farmers as a result of all of this.
<P>
	Government policies over the last couple of years have 
contributed greatly to the ability of the railways to run their own 
show. Governments have lost the ability to put pressure on the 
railways. Everything from the privatizing of CN, the deregulating 
of the rail line industry, changing the car allocation policy, 
allowing the abandonment of rail lines and condoning the  
inappropriate downsizing within the railroads have all contributed 
to the problem that keeps grain moving to port.
<P>
	We heard over the weekend the announcement from Manitoba 
that the CP double tracking from Winnipeg to Thunder Bay is being 
torn up. This is, to my mind, an absolute abuse of the privileges 
that we have given to the rail lines to move our product to port.
<P>
	The minister and the government have the responsibility, indeed 
the obligation, to ensure that grain moves from the farm to the port. 
I would like to ask the minister to ensure that he exercises to the 
full extent of his authority everything that he can to get that grain 
moving again.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the problem 
being faced by the prairie grain industry in getting grain to port 
position this winter is a very serious one.
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board now estimates that it will have to 
roll 1.5 million tonnes from its January shipping program into the 
February program. The Canadian Wheat Board estimates this 
rollover may result in a deferred cash flow for prairie farmers of 
$285 million and that selling the 1.5 million tonne shortfall outside 
the premium old crop price months may result in a loss of 
approximately $50 million in revenue to the 1996-97 pool 
accounts.
<P>
	This has been one of the worst winters in the last 100 years with 
respect to snowfall in the Rockies and the extreme cold on the 
prairies. While I agree that this has exacerbated the shipping 
problem, it does not account for the entire delay being experienced.
<P>
	It is my understanding the current problems relate to the 
availability of locomotive power in the railway system.
<P>
	Clearly this is a railroad responsibility and the railways have 
indicated they are taking steps to increase the availability of 
locomotives and to make the shipping of prairie grains a priority 
for them.
<P>
	Rather than finger pointing and laying blame to the industry, we 
should take steps to working out this current problem and making 
certain that we deal with it on an urgent strategic action base to 
make sure that backlogs to not occur as they have in the past.
<P>
	As members know, the legislative rule of the federal government 
is limited. However, the federal government can have a role in 
leading industry toward both a long and short term solution.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="7925"> 7925 </A></B>
<P>
	The Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food has already been in 
touch with many of the key players in the western grains industry. 
He is now pursuing further discussions on an urgent basis to get the 
grain moving faster through the system.
<P>
	Canada's customers and prairie farmers should not be subjected 
to such recurring problems in our grain transportation system.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Dear colleagues, the motion to adjourn 
the House is now deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly, the 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
