<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 1</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-46, in Clause 4, be amended by replacing line 13, on page 2, with 
the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``(h) patents, trade-marks, indus-''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
the debate in which I am taking part today is of the utmost 
interest for the entire Canadian artistic community. If the 
government were to show some open-mindedness, it could give 
a great deal of hope to creators working in the cultural industry.
<P>
	On November 16, 1993, exactly two weeks after the federal 
election, the Coalition of Creators and Copyright Owners 
published an open letter in <I>Le Devoir</I> addressed to the Minister 
of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	It pointed out, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Honourable Sir, the books, recordings, films, radio and television broadcasts, 
paintings, sculpture, photographs, choreography and works of entertainment 
produced by the 30,000 creators, artists and other eligible Quebecers belonging 
to the Coalition of Creators and Copyright Owners are everywhere. Both the 
creators and the public are happy with this situation. However, in the absence of 
adequate legislation, creators' fundamental rights are still not being recognized 
and new reproduction and distribution technologies are depriving them of the 
revenues that the use of their works should generate.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>You undoubtedly realize, Sir, that in order to be able to create new works, 
creators must earn their living from what they produce. Only the Copyright Act 
can ensure the legal basis for fair remuneration for the work of creators.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Minister of Heritage had promised to take prompt action. 
But one year later, creators are still waiting for legislation that 
would recognize their right over their work. Why is this? There 
are those who tell us that the answer to this question lies in the 
fact that two departments share the responsibility for the 
question of copyright. These departments are the Department of 
Industry to be established under Bill C-46 and the Department 
of Canadian Heritage that will eventually be established under 
Bill C-53.
<P>
	We now come to the heart of the debate. According to Clause 5 
of Bill C-46, one of the duties assigned to the Minister of 
Industry will be to defend consumers and large corporations. 
The rights of artists and workers in general are not even 
mentioned in this bill. As a result, this department would have a 
hard time recognizing the rights of creators on their works, as 
these rights are in direct conflict with those of consumers and 
large corporations.
<P>
	The heritage department has a moral right to look into the 
matter. It is, after all, recognized as the primary stakeholder in 
cultural matters. About 10 people work on these issues on its 
behalf. However, these officials have no powers; they can only 
try to influence their colleagues from Industry. That can be a 
very frustrating experience.
<P>
	We now come to the second issue, copyright, which comes 
under two departments defending diametrically opposed 
interests and is stuck in its turn-of-the-century version.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	The review of the act, announced with great pomp on many 
occasions, is getting nowhere, simply because of differences of 
opinion between the departments involved. The Union des 
artistes, for one, wrote in its December 23, 1993 letter to the 
Prime Minister that dividing responsibilities between the 
heritage department and Consumer and Corporate Affairs 
Canada, which had jurisdiction over copyright before 
reorganization, ``stood in the way of harmonious legislative 
reform -This division of responsibilities has led to a dual 
vision, which more often than not results in conflicting 
objectives''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8527"> 8527 </A></B>
<P>
	What the creative artists ask for is a strengthening of their 
first claim on their rights to their work and thus their right to 
negotiate the use made of these works. For example, the 
coalition of creative artists and copyright holders says that their 
rights should be protected as much as those of drug patent 
holders. In a press release from the coalition, Jean-Claude 
Germain said that the least a healthy society which is proud of 
its culture could do would be to protect its creative artists as 
well as it protects its drug manufacturers.
<P>
	Briefly, this is what the creative artists are asking for. They 
want recognition of neighbouring rights, that is, the rights of 
performers to reproduce and present their works. They want 
recognition of consequential rights, namely the visual artist's 
right to a percentage of any profit made on his or her work. They 
want recognition of equal duration of protection, that is, for all 
types of works, copyright would be recognized for at least 50 
years after the artist's death. They also want a law that is 
technologically neutral, that is, one that will apply regardless of 
technological developments.
<P>
	They want fees to be paid on their private copies, that is, 
royalties on media which can be privately copied such as 
diskettes, tapes, videocassettes and cassettes. They want rental 
rights, that is, a royalty on all works protected by law. Finally, 
they want appropriate recourse and adequate penalties for those 
who break the law.
<P>
	For ten years, the cultural communities in Canada and Quebec 
have been demanding these straightforward changes to the 
Copyright Act. They are unanimous on this, but have been 
unsuccessful. It is therefore urgent to act; the survival of 
Canadian and Quebec culture is at stake. It is urgent to give our 
artists the ability to earn a living from what they produce, 
because without culture, a country has no life, no colour and no 
future.
<P>
	The purpose of the amendment moved today by my colleague 
from Richmond-Wolfe is to make Canada and Quebec 
full-fledged players in this new global economy, which is no 
longer based on trade in goods but rather on quality of thinking, 
artistic value, imagination and open-mindedness. Our artists 
are ready and able to meet the challenge. Denying them the 
means to do so is not the way to ensure their survival.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, as I listened to the member 
from Quebec City I must say I share all of her concerns. Coming 
from a riding where the cultural community for people who are 
employed in cultural industries represents the greatest number 
of people employed I am extremely sensitive to this issue. I do 
not want you to think, Madam Speaker, that this is a community 
that I do not care for or am insensitive to. I depend a lot on the 
views and feelings they provide me in the direction I take.
<P>
	The member for Québec said that the fundamental rights of 
the artistic community were being threatened by the positioning 
in the Department of Industry.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	Historically copyright was with the Department of Consumer 
and Corporate Affairs which is now part of Industry Canada. 
From a historical sense we are being fairly consistent but I think 
the member for Quebec mentioned a more important thing, the 
strengthening of the role of the creator. I believe that we are 
doing that. First of all, we have to realize that this is a joint 
relationship between Heritage Canada and Industry Canada.
<P>
	Copyright does not deal exclusively with cultural aspects. On 
the international level, it is a business issue that impacts on 
revenues, investment, job creation, innovation, piracy, theft, 
non-tariff barrier concerns, many of the things that the member 
talked about in her remarks.
<P>
	As a government we believe that the Department of Industry, 
especially with all the new technologies, with the information 
highway, the concerns that we have for protection, is best 
equipped to meet those concerns and those needs of the artists.
<P>
	In light of all of that and the balancing of the concerns, we 
cannot accept this amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the amendment that is being proposed in effect deletes 
the provision of the minister that the Department of Industry 
deal with copyright. It is really intended to bring that over to 
another department.
<P>
	The issue that has just been made by the hon. member 
opposite is a very accurate statement, that we need to recognize 
that the whole area of creator's rights and the business of 
intellectual property ought to be identified. It is not strictly a 
matter of heritage, history or things of that sort but is rapidly 
developing and rapidly changing in our economy in Canada 
today. We need to recognize that in the area of patents and 
trademarks of those sorts of things are no less the property of 
people who use their minds and who use their knowledge to 
develop particular ideas as much as other kinds of property.
<P>
	We are moving today into a knowledge economy which is not 
only a business of making things and of moving people. It is a 
matter of ideas. It is a matter of innovations. It is a matter of 
applying these in the right way.
<P>
	It seems to me that there may be some interest here. In other 
departments, it is with regard to specific content but in terms of 
the ownership of certain sorts of things we need to recognize 
that this is included here in the old traditional way of talking 
about copyright.
<P>
	We are really talking about much more than the initial intent 
of copyright. We are talking about intellectual property. The 
matter should not be taken out of this clause at this time.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I have the pleasure to speak to Bill C-46 on behalf of 
the Official Opposition, as its critic on regional development.
<P>
	There are at least two major elements at stake in this bill to 
establish the Department of Industry. The first one concerns 
jurisdiction over regional development, while the second one 
has to do with whether or not duplication will be perpetuated in 
government management.
<P>
	At report stage of Bill C-46, an Act to establish the 
Department of Industry, the Bloc Quebecois proposes that 
clauses 8, 9 and 10 be amended by inserting, at line 21 in clause 
8, line 21 in clause 9, and line 36 in clause 10, the following: 
``With the approval of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council of 
Quebec when it is a field related to regional development in 
Quebec -''
<P>
	What does that mean? It means that the federal government 
does not have jurisdiction over regional development in Quebec 
and that the province is the only one with the authority to define 
policies and set up structures in that field.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	The constitutional coup against Quebec represented by the 
Constitutional Act dated November 5, 1981, to which Quebec 
never subscribed in spite of the fact that it represents one quarter 
of the Canadian population, allowed the federal government, by 
claiming it had jurisdiction regarding regional disparity, to give 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8529"> 8529 </A></B>
<P>
itself unlimited spending power and therefore also give itself 
every power concerning regional development.
<P>
	The 1982 unilateral patriation of the Constitution is federal 
interference in Quebec's regional development since, as you all 
know, regional economic development is not a jurisdiction 
included in the 1867 Constitution.
<P>
	Bill C-46 is a logical follow-up to the Constitutional deal 
which was struck in November 1981. It is part of the plan of the 
Liberal Party of Canada to isolate Quebec, to direct the 
economic development of Quebecers and to deny their distinct 
identity by making Quebec's development contingent on federal 
regional development policies.
<P>
	In Bill C-46, the government has irresponsibly chosen to 
ignore Quebec's regional development policies and structures. 
Unconcerned about duplication, although the party in power, the 
Liberal Party, admits duplication exists because it wants to 
eliminate duplication and overlap, in this case they have made it 
abundantly clear that they want to preserve this duplication by 
refusing to recognize Quebec's sole responsibility for regional 
development. They prefer to ignore existing duplication and 
overlap just as they prefer to ignore the wasteful spending of 
public funds. The Minister of Industry and his Liberal 
colleagues want to increase their interventions in Quebec 
through this bill.
<P>
	In section 9(1)<I>(a)</I> and <I>(b)</I> it says that the Minister of Industry, 
and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-with respect to regional economic development in Quebec,</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>(a)</I>in co-operation with other concerned ministers and boards and agencies of the 
Government of Canada, formulate and implement policies, plans and integrated 
federal approaches;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>(b)</I>co-ordinate the policies and programs of the Government of Canada;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I think we can clearly interpret this as a full scale invasion of 
regional development in Quebec and a federal takeover of 
development and policies in this area.
<P>
	However, the government party must realize that for decades, 
Quebec has had regional development programs that were far 
more effective than federal intervention has ever been in this 
area.
<P>
	The federal Liberal government, with its two-fold obsession 
with developing the industrial centres of Quebec's metropolitan 
areas while ignoring the rest of the province, and with spreading 
the federal, centralist gospel right and left, without any policies 
for co-ordinating the interests of those concerned, has often 
acted in ways that have proved disastrous for Quebec's 
peripheral regions.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, in this House I had an opportunity to refer to 
an impact study of federal regional intervention policies in 
Quebec, policies that, because of this intervention focussed on 
large urban centres, have had a devastating effect in the regions, 
since we now see that peripheral regions throughout Quebec 
have lost their young people and experienced a decline in 
population.
<P>
	In its second report, the Conseil des affaires sociales du 
Québec pointed out that the situation was disastrous in all 
Quebec's peripheral regions. The number of municipalities and 
peripheral regions where the population has declined increased 
to an alarming extent between 1971 and 1988, when federal 
intervention in regional development was at its peak-in other 
words, the better part of the period when the Liberals were in 
power in Ottawa-so that today, they outnumber communities 
experiencing population increases. Young people are the first to 
leave their regions for the big urban centres.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	That is the result of the federal regional development policy. 
In the Gaspé, the Magdalen Islands and other rural areas of 
Quebec, solidarity movements have sprung up to restore hope to 
local communities and begin work on comprehensive, 
integrated development. They include, among others, Coalition 
urgence rurale, Ralliement des Gaspésiens et des Madelinots 
and Rural Solidarity. The numbers and types of development 
partnerships are increasing.
<P>
	Businesses, unions, local authorities, and the co-operative 
movement no longer hesitate to take charge of their own 
development. These players have sought, when appearing 
before forums such as the Bélanger-Campeau Commission, to 
promote the idea that, for instance, control of economic 
development levers must rest with Quebec and that 
decision-making powers must be decentralized, and to obtain a 
consensus in this regard. The major consensus that has emerged 
fits in with regional development in Quebec, and there is 
growing consensus that the federal government should be told 
clearly to withdraw from regional development, an area in 
which it does not belong.
<P>
	As I have already mentioned, regional development is not a 
separate area of responsibility in the Canadian Constitution, 
thus forcing Quebec to take part in unending and fruitless 
negotiations such as those involving the regional economic 
development agreements. Bill C-46 confirms the federal 
government's determination to take over regional development 
in Quebec.
<P>
	It also points up the stupidity and waste of such an insistence 
on interfering, which leads to still more duplication and overlap. 
Let me give an example. Under section 9(1)(b), the Minister of 
Industry, through the responsible minister in the Federal Office 
of Regional Development-Quebec, shall collect, compile, 
analyse, coordinate and disseminate information with respect to 
regional economic development in Quebec, thus enabling the 
federal agency to undertake a series of studies and analyses with 
the purpose of defining socio-economic profiles for each region 
of Quebec.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8530"> 8530 </A></B>
<P>
	Studies released by the FORDQ in November, a few weeks 
ago, studies that were a total waste of time and which were 
conducted on a region-by-region basis in Quebec, are examples 
of a monumental waste of money and energy, because it so 
happens that Quebec has produced its own studies and analyses 
on each region of the province this past year, in preparation for 
regional strategic development plans. I have perused the studies 
released by the office and noticed that the Federal Office of 
Regional Development-Quebec had wasted money, using the 
same statistics and reaching the same conclusions, region by 
region.
<P>
	Since such studies cost money, this confirms that this 
government is ignoring what Quebec does in that area and 
spends money needlessly on duplicating studies that have 
already been done. To conclude, the federal government must 
withdraw from regional development and recognize that Quebec 
only has jurisdiction over economic development on its 
territory. That is what our amendment, the Official Opposition 
amendment, is about.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am very pleased to enter the debate at this time. If I 
understand correctly procedurally we are debating Motions Nos. 
2 to 8. Is that correct?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> That is right. We are 
debating on the group of motions. Since you are one of the 
proposers you can have the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Schmidt:</B> Madam Speaker, I will address very briefly the 
particular motion that was just presented. I will put my 
interventions primarily in terms of our reasons for presenting 
the motions we wish the bill be amended to meet. I would like to 
focus and couch my remarks in terms of three principles.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	First, there ought to be within legislation checks and balances 
to ensure openness, honesty and integrity on the part of 
government and on the part of the ministers who bring about the 
implementation of government policies.
<P>
	Second, it is the marketplace that should determine winners 
and losers in business, not government.
<P>
	Third, the government's role is to provide a level playing field 
so that competition can be equal, that there be fair 
administration and that the refereeing be done in such a way that 
the conduct of manufacturing, trade and commerce is in fact fair 
and equitable.
<P>
	The result of these kinds of principles would be to develop 
confidence in business and government and of course in oneself. 
It would enhance international competitiveness for the nation 
and for individual businesses. Another consequence is the 
ability to meet the challenge of a new economy which is so 
necessary.
<P>
	The Department of Industry is a major and very important 
department in this government. It has a wide ranging impact on 
the economy of this country and indeed on the jobs and on the 
welfare of many Canadians at all age levels. It is important that 
we recognize the significance of this department.
<P>
	This legislation enshrines and should enshrine in this 
department as much scrutiny as possible so that we can 
determine precisely what is or is not meant in the particular 
clauses. This is why I wish to address these particular motions 
whereby we want to bring about certain amendments.
<P>
	I wish to start with the amendment to clause 8(a). Our 
amendment proposes that clause 8(a) be deleted. Now clause 
8(a) reads that the minister shall: ``promote economic 
development in areas of Ontario and Quebec where low incomes 
and slow economic growth are prevalent or where opportunities 
for productive employment are inadequate''.
<P>
	The reason we would like to see that stricken from the clause 
is that in principle we object to the idea of regional development 
for a minister who has responsibility for all of Canada. There is a 
conflict of interest here in principle to begin with. One should 
not prefer one region of the country over another. Certainly that 
is implicit in this kind of provision.
<P>
	Regional programs have proven to be preferential and the way 
in which certain pork barrelling projects have been created, 
many of them questionable and sometimes with disastrous 
results. The government being engaged in these types of things 
separates regions in one area of the country from another. That 
in itself is disunifying. It divides the country rather than brings 
it together, which is what we want to do. I personally and the 
Reform Party want to bring about equality rather than 
divisiveness. In order to accomplish that the provision in the act 
found in clause 8(a) needs to be taken away.
<P>
	With respect to clause 9, our proposal is to delete the clause 
completely. That of course is the administrative, or if you like, 
the empowerment section which gives the minister the way in 
which he or she would implement the provisions found in clause 
8(a). By eliminating that clause the minister would not have the 
authority to go into regional development specifically in 
Ontario and Quebec.
<P>
	Our amendment with respect to clause 10 is simply an 
administrative one. If we eliminate clause 8(a) and we eliminate 
clause 9, then of course we have to make the consequential 
change in clause 10.
<P>
	There is a confusion in the provisions of clauses 8(b) and 8(c). 
Upon initial reading it would appear that they would apply to 
clause 8(a) in terms of Ontario and Quebec. But upon a more 
detailed reading and in an in depth situation they could be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8531"> 8531 </A></B>
<P>
interpreted as applying to all of Canada. In that case the 
situation is such that the minister may now have full 
responsibility for the economic development in areas where 
there is low  income or where jobs are not plentiful. He can then 
intervene in the particular business promotion in any area of 
Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	Because of its lack of clarity it is suggested that this be 
rewritten in such a way that misinterpretation cannot take place. 
If clause 8(a) is deleted then the clarification becomes 
unnecessary because it is then obvious.
<P>
	To conclude my remarks on these motions, this section on 
regional development does not uphold the three principles 
which I mentioned earlier. It does not inspire Canadians to feel 
that their government is open, honest and possessed of great 
amounts of integrity. It does not provide for a level playing field 
in the marketplace and it does not provide for a clearly refereed 
game.
<P>
	It does not allow the marketplace to determine the outcome. 
In other words, it gives to the government and to the minister, in 
particular, the power to intervene and to determine who wins and 
who loses. Because these principles are not observed we must 
recognize that we should go ahead with these. I hope that all 
colleagues will recognize that certain changes to the act must be 
made.
<P>
	I would like to add a brief word about the Bloc's amendment. 
If clauses 8(b) and 8(c) are interpreted to give to the minister the 
wide-ranging powers for all of Canada, to accept an amendment 
such as was proposed by the Bloc a moment ago would give to 
the lieutenant-governor in council in Quebec the right to 
approve or disapprove economic development in the rest of 
Canada which, as far as I am concerned, warrants only one word 
to describe it, and that is ridiculous.
<P>
	We have to be very careful that we not divide the country. We 
have enough stress already and to do something like this adds to 
that stress. If there is one thing we want to do it is to build a 
strong Canada that is competitive in the world, a Canada that 
provides for the innovation of people, that provides for a level 
playing field, that allows the creativity of entrepreneurs and 
creators at all levels to succeed, and to do so in fair competition 
with other individuals across Canada. No one province, no one 
individual should have the authority to decide who wins, who 
loses, other than on a fair playing field where the referee is 
honest, has integrity, is open and where the things that matter 
come to the fore.
<P>
	Therefore, I urge that the Bloc's amendments be defeated and 
that the Reform Party's amendments be supported.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to begin by 
addressing the remarks that were presented earlier by my 
colleague from Richmond-Wolfe.
<P>
	His remark that the federal government has no jurisdiction in 
Quebec represents a difference that I have with him, one that 
probably represents the single biggest reason why I decided to 
run for public office.
<P>
	I had the privilege and pleasure of working for the man who I 
think was the greatest Prime Minister this country every had, 
Pierre Elliot Trudeau. I believe that Pierre Trudeau and his 
vision of this country, his feeling about making sure we had a 
strong national government that would make sure we had 
national programs that would allow us to develop a national 
spirit, a national will that would pull us together. He also wanted 
a government that was designed to make sure that when regional 
disadvantages occurred, the national government had the 
capacity and the instruments to help those people in regionally 
disadvantaged areas.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	My colleague from Richmond-Wolfe says that the federal 
government has no jurisdiction in Quebec. Let us imagine that 
every provincial premier or every provincial political party took 
that position. That was the essence of the Meech Lake accord 
which is why I opposed it.
<P>
	For the Bloc Quebecois to expect the government to support 
an amendment which essentially states that the federal 
government has no jurisdiction in Quebec is just not on. I 
believe that a majority of Quebecers would not support it either.
<P>
	I accept the constructive remarks of the hon. member for 
Richmond-Wolfe about the fact that we have to be more 
efficient. We have to reduce some of the overlapping that goes 
on between the federal-provincial programs so we can better 
provide services for the people of his community, his province, 
as we want to do for the people in northern Ontario or Atlantic 
Canada or western Canada. I agree with him on that. The 
purpose of this bill is to redesign this department so it can 
become more efficient and address those concerns.
<P>
	However, to go to a position where the federal government has 
no jurisdiction in Quebec, no jurisdiction when it comes to 
looking out for small and medium sized businessmen and 
women, no jurisdiction on retraining, no jurisdiction in special 
projects is not my position. From time to time we may need to 
use extraordinary powers to assist and promote special projects 
in Quebec and that is what this bill allows the government to do.
<P>
	I am in this Chamber because I believe more than ever we 
need a strong national government. We do not need a 
government that is gutted. We do not need a government that is 
decentralized to the point where we no longer have the capacity 
to handle a difficult economic environment. Therefore I say 
respectfully there is no way we can accept this amendment from 
the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8532"> 8532 </A></B>
<P>
	I turn now to my colleagues in the Reform Party, who I should 
add are in accordance with our view of making sure that we 
have a strong national government. They have recognized that. 
This is not in any way, shape or form isolating Quebec. I get 
very concerned when the Bloc all of a sudden thinks that we 
are trying to isolate them. We are trying to do the exact 
opposite. We are trying to make sure that all Quebecers, all 
Canadians, interact and exchange with each other on the total 
resources of this country, not just part of it.
<P>
<B>(1055 ) </B>
<P>
	Reform members have a very difficult time with some of our 
regional instruments like the Atlantic Canada Opportunities 
Agency and the western diversification instrument of 
government. In every high risk situation it is normal and 
historical, whether in business or in government, that from time 
to time mistakes are made and there are failures. It happens in 
business-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Especially when government is involved.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
trying to make my point. I think-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Who pays? The taxpayer pays.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> I am going to tell you 
who pays.
<P>
	The essence of this country is those communities that are 
stronger, that are richer-I come from a city which is strong and 
rich but right now it is in economic difficulty. It is the city of 
Toronto. I know that my community, my city is having a very 
difficult time-believe that we must make sure that 
communities that are more disadvantaged are looked after 
properly and effectively by the national government.
<P>
	I believe that ACOA and the western diversification fund are 
doing a very good job. For those reasons we will not support the 
Reform Party's amendments.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to 
thank the hon. member who spoke before me for recognizing his 
government's clear identification of the need for a strong central 
government with an unshakeable desire to impose its will. Such 
a federal government, as proposed in the Meech and 
Charlottetown accords, was rejected not by a minority but by the 
majority of Quebecers, including federalists unhappy with the 
status quo.
<P>
	I rise today in this debate on Bill C-46 so that some key 
amendments will be made to Clauses 8, 9 and 10 to make them 
acceptable. As I explained at length on October 17 during debate 
at second reading, I am against this bill as it stands because it 
does not recognize Quebec's jurisdiction over its regional 
development.
<P>
	Granted, regional development is a complex issue. 
Identifying the regions to be developed is a major challenge in 
itself, all the more so if we try to do it from afar, without 
knowing each region's particularities.
<P>
	This federal tactic of trying to develop regions by centralizing 
policy-making is not new and was not always successful. As 
early as September 1982, the Senate Committee on National 
Finance said this in a report: ``Designating the least developed 
regions for special status to ensure that regional disparities are 
not forgotten is not an easy task. As DREE discovered, a 
political system generates enormous pressures to extend the 
boundaries of programs that generate cash flow. As a result, 
DREE ended up including more than half the geographic area of 
the country in the designated areas, and the purpose became 
hopelessly diluted''.
<P>
	Why these lamentable effects? Quite simply because the 
federal government is unable to understand that, with general 
policies, it cannot meet the specific needs of each province, 
much less the specific needs of each region.
<P>
	It is utopian to pass a bill at the national level to meet 
particular local objectives. Instead, we need legislation that is 
appropriate to the development of the province concerned, with 
the flexibility to respond to regional requirements.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	Quebecers see their needs for regional development very 
differently depending on which region they live in. I suppose 
that is why previous legislation created different development 
agencies for western Canada and for the Maritimes. That is why 
we believe that Bill C-46 must be related to Quebec's regional 
particularities and to Ontario's as well.
<P>
	The need to develop a region is often related to its 
unemployment level. Unemployment is higher or lower in some 
regions for various reasons. For example, high unemployment 
may be due to lack of education in a region and the solution will 
be to train the workers there.
<P>
	A second possible reason for the lack of jobs is a shortage of 
capital to modernize industry. This can be corrected by 
investing in industrial or tourism infrastructure.
<P>
	A third possibility is lack of natural resources, for example, 
over-exploitation of forests in the past. This is what happened in 
my region and it must be corrected by diversification to stabilize 
regional development.
<P>
	However, the solutions are sometimes hard to find. For 
example, take the price of metals on the international market. 
For example, if the price of copper drops, this reduces 
employment in the affected mining region, but the solution is 
not to keep mines open at all cost.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8533"> 8533 </A></B>
<P>
	How can we protect or develop a region where companies 
have a harder time to survive in the context of international free 
trade? For example, in the case of Montreal's textile industry, 
the solution could be found by that industry and its workers, 
with the help of regional development consultants.
<P>
	These examples show that, for optimum results, solutions to 
regional development issues must be found in the region itself. 
This is why we insist that federal bills reflect a will to 
co-operate with the provinces.
<P>
	Quebec developed its development tools and these tools are 
close to the stakeholders. Consequently, we feel that the federal 
government should also adopt this cost-effective approach, by 
increasing development tools instead of reducing them.
<P>
	Lines 21, 22 and 23 of Clause 8, on page 4 could provide a 
good example of efficient co-operation between the federal 
government and the provinces. That clause currently reads as 
follows: ``The Minister shall exercise the powers and perform 
the duties and functions assigned by subsection 4(2) in a manner 
that will-'', but it should say: ``With the approval of the 
Lieutenant-Governor in Council of Quebec''-we could also 
say Ontario, since this bill concerns both provinces-``when it 
is a field related to regional development in Quebec, the 
Minister shall exercise the powers and perform the duties and 
functions assigned by subsection 4(2) in a manner that will-''.
<P>
	We want to link regional development to the power of Quebec 
to decide and the power of regions to select priorities. The 
amendment to clause 8 is intended to reflect respect for the 
strategic development plans of the regions in Quebec and should 
apply to all regions in Canada. We have had enough of this 
competing by various levels of government at the expense of the 
regions, because we want to eliminate waste and inefficiencies.
<P>
	In my own region, considering the unemployment rate and the 
exodus of our young people, there is a very clear case for making 
proper use of any instruments we are given and for avoiding 
federal products that are not adapted to the needs of the region.
<P>
	In the past few months I talked to senior officials at the 
Federal Office of Regional Development about the need for 
reviewing the agency's 1994-95 priorities for our region.
<P>
	Their new focus is to promote entrepreneurship that will use 
new technologies to create jobs. There is nothing wrong with 
that, but this should not be done in total disregard of the choice 
made by our region, which wants to focus on infrastructures for 
tourism. The Abitibi-Témiscamingue region wants to acquire 
the basic infrastructures that will attract tourists to our region 
for more than a few hours. People have to travel long distances 
to get there, and we could sell our region if points of interest 
were sufficient to make a stay of several days worthwhile.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	Tourists will not drive 600, 700 or 1,000 kilometres just for 
the sake of driving. The FORDQ previously subsidized tourism 
facilities which, it felt, contributed towards developing the 
economy, but now its focus has changed. Other priorities may be 
acceptable, but the region's decision to set a priority on the 
tourism industry should be supported by the federal government 
and the regions should not be saddled with priorities that are not 
often acceptable.
<P>
	People in the community of Radisson near James Bay do not 
see how the new focus of FORDQ would fit their situation. The 
only development they could sustain is tourism. They have 
neither the population base nor the industrial environment for 
these new development priorities and new technologies. Let us 
be practical and use the tools we have.
<P>
	The people of Radisson want to use the far north as a tool to 
attract adventure tours and other types of tourism. The federal 
government should realize that the intent of our motion to 
amend clauses 8, 9 and 10 is to maximize effectiveness by 
focussing on the needs of the community and thus promote 
regional development. The gap between developed and 
undeveloped regions is widening, because in the past, these 
regions did not have the right development tools.
<P>
	Quebec has approved a policy to decentralize regional 
development. Ottawa should also agree to decentralize and 
consider the particular needs of each region. Regional 
development councils in Quebec, which include of the mayors 
of MRCs and regional intervenors, have already designed their 
own development scenarios. They know what their needs are, 
and the federal government should consult them so as to 
harmonize its projects.
<P>
	I think this brief presentation has sufficiently clarified the 
intent of the amendments to clauses 8, 9 and 10. Failure to 
support these amendments will reflect the present government's 
reluctance to co-operate with the provinces and spend the scarce 
amount of funds available more effectively.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Madam Speaker, as I 
was listening to the member for Abitibi I imagined that this 
member could actually be giving this speech from any region of 
the country. He talked about the importance of tourism, 
education, enough capital coming to a region, proper and 
efficient utilization of our natural resources-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The hon. parliamentary 
secretary has already spoken on this group of motions and I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8534"> 8534 </A></B>
<P>
would now like to recognize the hon. member for Fraser Valley 
West. We can intervene only once on each group of motions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the hon. member's speech probably would have been so 
good I would have been happy to let him speak for a little 
longer-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> We could get 
unanimous consent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> You will not get my 
consent to speak in my spot.
<P>
	Yesterday we talked about regional development grants in the 
House. Yesterday we heard a member of the Liberal Party taking 
credit for the great growth in the economy since the Liberals 
have been elected.
<P>
	I reminded the hon. member that this is really the business 
cycle, the natural business cycle in this country that is taking 
place. This government should in no way take credit for what is a 
natural business cycle. Of course the comment-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> We don't take any 
blame either for anything.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> We will give them the 
blame. They are suggesting that they should not get the blame 
but we will give you all sorts of blame in some areas.
<P>
	This is a natural business cycle, my point being that as we 
stand here in the House of Commons taking credit for how well 
things are coming along the average taxpayer out there who is 
getting hit harder and harder and has less and less money looks 
at us on television and these other ways of communicating today 
and wonders what in the heck is going on in the House of 
Commons. These politicians-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> We wonder where you 
got that tie, Randy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> You see how important this 
is, Madam Speaker. The Liberals are at me for my tie. Rome is 
burning and they are at me for my tie.
<P>
<B>(1110 ) </B>
<P>
	My point is that while we talk about taking credit for business 
cycles and so on, Rome is burning to some extent. The average 
taxpayer is wondering what these federal politicians are really 
doing in Ottawa.
<P>
	Yesterday I also heard comments in the House from one of our 
colleagues in the Liberal Party who was very concerned about 
my criticisms of ACOA, the regional development agency in 
Atlantic Canada. The comment was Reformers do not like 
Atlantic Canadians because we have the audacity to complain 
about regional development grants.
<P>
	The relationship between complaining about grants and not 
liking a certain region is ridiculous. Yesterday I heard from one 
of the Bloc members: ``You had better be careful what you say 
about the east; you are talking about FORD-Quebec''. It is not 
about the people and where they live. It is about how much 
money we have in this country.
<P>
	Today we hear about the federal government's central control 
over regional development, about the funds that are going its 
way. We also hear the PQ, the separatists, talking about how this 
is so much of a waste: ``We are doing it in our province anyway 
and the federal government is wasting its''.
<P>
	We hear the Liberals saying they are going to keep it the same 
and big daddy is going to hand out all the regional development 
grants to everybody.
<P>
	What people are hearing from the Reformers is the logical 
approach. Should we be handing out in excess of $1 billion a 
year in regional development grants when we are overspending 
by $40 billion a year and we have a $530 billion debt load? We 
have to get some priorities in place.
<P>
	The people watching and listening must think this is all a 
nightmare. We are talking about giving moneys out to regions 
and the amounts given out are not small dollars. ACOA, the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, is over $375 million a 
year, FORD-Quebec is in excess of $437 million a year and 
western economic diversification is $452 million a year.
<P>
	We have to borrow this money to give out. We are saying let us 
be a little more realistic here, folks. We have to cut back, if not 
over a period of time eliminate this. I have some ideas on where 
to eliminate. I will show today some of the ridiculous grants that 
have been given out by this government-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
rise on a point of order. I do this with respect. The member 
knows of my affection for him. However, I am having a difficult 
time linking the relevance of what he is saying to the actual 
amendment. I would ask for clarification on that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
surely not required to give an explanation to somebody from the 
Liberal government on how I express-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry. The hon. 
member should, however, be relevant.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Madam Speaker, I just 
heard these people here, these separatists, talking about regional 
development. That is what I am talking about. I am not going to 
stand here and justify to a member, Madam Speaker. I can justify 
to you. This is about regional development and that is what I am 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8535"> 8535 </A></B>
<P>
going to talk about whether this government likes it or not. I will 
continue my speech on regional development if the member 
does not mind. I hope this time is added on to my speech.
<P>
	The concept of regional development is what we are talking 
about here. We will try to get a concept through these minds 
here. As I understand it and as the Auditor General has so 
reported the concept, it is to support and promote the 
opportunity for economic development, to foster development 
of entrepreneurship, to increase the rate of new business 
formation and to improve competitiveness of small and medium 
size business.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	I find the concept of entrepreneurship and government 
sponsored dollars incompatible. That is something this 
government has to learn as well.
<P>
	For instance I have been tracking some of the payments made 
by this government. There is an individual who has received the 
entrepreneur of the year award in one of our great provinces. He 
has received something like seven or nine grants from one of the 
regional economic development programs. I find that hard to 
understand. It is an oxymoron. To be the entrepreneur of the year 
and have the government shovel money your way just does not 
fit, but I do not think this government understands this.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> You do not understand 
that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> As far as the value to 
industry, this is an industry bill. I am still relevant, am I Madam 
Speaker? I am just making sure.
<P>
	I have a great deal of difficulty with the concept of regional 
development in industry and shelling out the dollars. We have to 
start eliminating these four regional development programs. 
This government is handing out $1.4 billion a year and a lot of 
that is shelled out not for the concepts I talked about. It is not 
necessarily for fostering entrepreneurship. It is not necessarily 
to increase the rate of new business formation and improve 
competitiveness. In fact, improvement of competitiveness 
philosophy really does not work at all in some cases from 
regional development grants.
<P>
	For example, there are some regional development grants 
given by this government to motels and inns across this country, 
but the trouble is it gives to one and not to another. How do we 
get competitiveness by giving a grant on the backs of the 
taxpayers to one and not to another? I do not understand that 
philosophy at all.
<P>
	Members of the Liberal Party stand in the House and say: 
``Big daddy is going to pass out your money'', and another party 
says: ``You should not be doing that. We have our own. You are 
wasting the money''. Rather than doing that, maybe for a 
moment they should consider phasing them out. If a government 
has to borrow from Japan, Germany or the United States to hand 
this money out it should really consider its management style.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> I cannot believe you 
are saying this.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Well I am saying it and I 
mean it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> And the taxpayers mean it too. They are tired of 
it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> You guys are missing 
the point.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> What about the young 
people coming behind us? What about the debt load we have 
taxed to these people? What about the taxes the small business 
person is paying? What about the interest that Canada itself 
must pay to pay back the debt? It is all borrowed money on the 
backs of the taxpayers and the young people so that this 
government can shell out $1.3 billion a year to regions.
<P>
	Do we need grants? Why do we need grants? Why do we need 
regional development? Regional development is important. But 
to the Liberal Party regional development means shelling out 
dollars to those you know. Next week in this House of Commons 
I will be disclosing some of those they know who get money.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> What would you do? 
You say it is important. But what do you mean by that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Only when it is absolutely 
necessary should the government be in the business of private 
industry.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Give us an example.
<P>
<B>(1120 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Madam Speaker, not to 
expand a tea room for $99,000. They call that regional 
development and it is not. Not to modernize a campground and 
facilities. That is up to the owner with his profits. It is up to the 
individual to expand in regional development.
<P>
	Finally, this government really does not have a clue on 
regional development. We heard the separatist party here talking 
about what is wrong with it and we are saying the government 
cannot afford it. And I think I was relevant.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I would like to remind 
members that Motions Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 will be grouped 
for debate but voted on as follows:
<P>
	A vote on Motion No. 2 applies to Motions Nos. 4, 5 and 7. An 
affirmative vote on Motion No. 2 obviates the necessity of the 
question being put on Motions Nos. 3, 6 and 8. On the other 
hand, a negative vote on Motion No. 2 necessitates the question 
being put on Motion No. 3. A vote on Motion No. 3 applies to 
Motions Nos. 6 and 8.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 9</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-46 be amended by deleting Clause 14.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: As with respect to our amendments to clauses 8, 9 
and 10, we wish to address the amendment to clause 14 with the 
same kind of principles we used to evaluate and analyse the 
others.
<P>
	In particular, we want to suggest to the House again that it is 
the obligation of government and it is and should be the intent of 
legislation to provide checks and balances to ensure openness, 
integrity and honesty in the performance of the duties and 
responsibilities incumbent upon government.
<P>
	Second, the marketplace should determine winners and 
losers, not the government or intervention by government or its 
ministers in that marketplace.
<P>
	Finally, the role of government is to provide a level playing 
field so that competition can be equal, fair and on a level playing 
ground so that the refereeing of the game of business is in fact 
conducted in a manner that provides success for as many as 
possible.
<P>
	The results of the application of these principles is confidence 
for business and government and it certainly enhances the 
international competitiveness and the ability to provide for 
changes in the new economy that is coming.
<P>
	I wish now to address the particular amendment to clause 14 
which really is to eliminate and delete from the bill the total 
clause. There are a number of reasons we would like to propose 
that clause 14 be deleted from the bill.
<P>
	Clause 14 gives to the minister a tremendous range of powers. 
May I just quote briefly from the provisions of the bill. The bill 
suggests that the minister under this act may:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) make loans to any person;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) guarantee the repayment of, or provide loan insurance or credit insurance 
in respect of, any financial obligation undertaken by any person; and</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(c) make grants and contributions to any person.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1125 ) </B>
<P>
	The broad range of power given to the minister under this 
section is such that it makes it possible for that minister to 
intervene directly in the marketplace on behalf of or against any 
business or individual or group of persons, organizations or 
associations.
<P>
	We believe that that provision is most objectionable and must 
not be allowed to stand. It allows the minister or through the 
minister under certain conditions that follow in the other 
sections the cabinet to pick winners and losers in the economy.
<P>
	The authority violates a fundamental principle of openness, 
honesty and integrity. As we know, and history has shown over 
and over again, power tends to corrupt and absolute power tends 
to corrupt absolutely.
<P>
	The provisions of this act are such in this clause that the 
minister can without reference to anyone do the kinds of things 
we talked about: make loans, give grants and things of this sort.
<P>
	The government's role is to regulate the marketplace so that it 
is level but not to intervene and choose winners and losers by 
that intervention. If business is to succeed then it must be 
allowed to do so without having competitors gaining unfair 
advantage as a result of government intervention of one kind or 
another, particularly when it has to do with monetary assistance 
in particular areas.
<P>
	If a business or a business sector is going to fail, it should do 
so because it lacked the competence or for some other reason it 
did not succeed. The government assistance should not be used 
to prop up a business that cannot survive in its own right. If the 
only way a business can survive is by government intervention 
and by shoring it up then indeed that business is of questionable 
integrity and questionable work in the economy.
<P>
	I would like to refer particularly to what can happen when 
government intervention of this kind takes place. I refer here to 
the 1993 Auditor General's report with regard to the then 
Department of Science, Industry and Technology now known as 
the Department of Industry.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8537"> 8537 </A></B>
<P>
	There we have a very interesting situation. In 1985, the 
cabinet authorized the Minister of Finance to provide an equity 
injection into the Federal Business Development Bank to 
enable that bank to purchase a $69 million special issue of 
preferred shares.
<P>
	Subsequently, that was increased to $79 million, only $10 
million more. The investment of the company was made 
pursuant to a directive of the governor in council and executed 
by the Minister of Regional Industrial Expansion, then Industry, 
Science and Technology and currently Industry. It was done 
under this clause and a subsequent clause in section 14.
<P>
	On October 26, 1986, the government signed a share 
subscription agreement with a company for a two stage $260 
million plant modernization project.
<P>
	The information provided to cabinet for its approval on 
October 7, 1986, identified a specific Russian technology for the 
project. This technology was described as the newest and best 
available in the world. The company decided to switch from the 
Russian technology to new German technology which it 
purchased in September 1986.
<P>
	Cabinet was not informed of the major change in this project. 
What was the result of all of these kinds of changes? The 
company's new plant using the German technology attempted 
startup in December 1989 and suspended operation in March 
1990.
<P>
	In December 1992, two years later, the company advised the 
Department of Industry that it could not complete stage one 
before December 31, 1992, for reasons beyond its reasonable 
control thereby suspending its obligation under the agreement.
<P>
	In 1990 the department estimated that the Federal Business 
Development Bank was unlikely to recover its investment or 
earn any dividends. To date, the bank has received no dividends. 
In fact the Federal Business Development Bank wrote that 
particular investment down to zero. The agreement, however, 
remains in force until the year 2006.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	The company's audited statement of total capital 
expenditures for the project at May 31, 1990 indicated that the 
company had incurred costs of $161 million. With $134 million 
that came from the federal government and some from the 
British Columbia government, the company was out of pocket 
$27 million and then only because of cost overruns. Had these 
cost overruns not occurred, the company's share in the project at 
that point would have been zero.
<P>
	That is not the way to use taxpayers' money. The emphasis on 
it being best left to the private entrepreneur is the principle the 
government should observe and not use tax dollars to do these 
kinds of things. This clause of the bill should be deleted.
<P>
	Many of the clauses are unclear. They are intrusionary. They 
are elitist. They allow the government and the  minister in 
particular unlimited opportunities to interfere in the free 
market, and the cabinet as well under another section. In my 
remarks today I have shown that the legislation needs 
clarification. There are things that should be deleted from it. 
There are powers that should be circumscribed; the minister and 
the cabinet should not have these powers. They unbalance the 
very fundamentals of our economy and can strangle our 
treasury, as was already indicated in the Auditor General's 
report.
<P>
	We should get to the point where the government does not take 
winners and losers but in fact develops a level playing field. The 
Department of Industry can be the department to bring about a 
strong engine that will drive the economy and bring about a 
balanced budget. That is what the department should do. 
However the way to do that is not by intervening directly in the 
marketplace through particular regional development programs 
or by providing loans, grants and subsidies to industries. The 
minister has the right to do this for any particular person and is 
not obligated to require that certain conditions be met for those 
loans.
<P>
	At this point the legislation, the way it is being proposed, 
needs to be amended as we have suggested.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, my Reform Party colleague 
from Okanagan made so many assertions in his speech that I do 
not know where to begin. I challenge his statement that this 
clause works against open government.
<P>
	That is just not so. In his discourse the member referred to 
detail about the Federal Business Development Bank. It was 
proof of public accountability for nearly every transaction that 
goes on in government and specifically in Department of 
Industry. The blue book details-and the people of Canada 
should know it-every decision and every taxpayers' dollar 
spent by this department.
<P>
	To suggest that clause 14 allows the Minister of Industry to go 
around with a chequebook in his pocket so that if he happens to 
run into somebody he likes or he thinks has an interesting idea 
he can write a cheque is not what it is all about.
<P>
	This clause is about our space arm. Spar Aerospace was an 
example of the taxpayers of Canada investing approximately 
$140 million in 1979, 1980 and 1981. When that arm opened in 
outer space and the word Canada was on the side of it, I do not 
think there was a Canadian who said anything other than bravo. 
Today that space arm technology has brought the country a 
tenfold return.
<P>
<B>(1135 ) </B>
<P>
	What about the McCains? The Reform Party member said we 
should listen to private entrepreneurs. That is an example of a 
private entrepreneur in Atlantic Canada who got his $4 million 
kickstart from the Government of Canada in a DREE loan. Right 
now he is employing  close to 20,000 Canadians in every region 
of our country, all the way from processors to marketers to 
packagers to truck drivers and so on. He is a private entrepreneur 
and has paid back in tax dollars and employee tax dollars a 
thousand times the investment. What about Bombardier? It is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8538"> 8538 </A></B>
<P>
selling monorails all over the world right now. It is doing all 
kinds of stuff.
<P>
	I will talk about a personal experience I had. I was involved 
with a company called Magna International that received 
taxpayers' money. It not only paid it all back but this year it paid 
the treasury $145 million in tax. It employs 20,000 people and is 
flying. The company needed it. It was the story of an 
entrepreneur getting a bit of a push for his idea, his technology. 
That company makes the best automotive product at the most 
competitive price and is recognized as one of the leaders in the 
world.
<P>
	What about Northern Telecom? What about MacMillan 
Bloedel in western Canada? What about the oil and gas 
industry? These are concrete examples of entrepreneurs, men 
and women, who went through due process and received 
taxpayers' money.
<P>
	There is another thing Reform Party members do not 
understand. They think if someone has an idea he or she knocks 
on the door of Industry Canada and there is a cheque writing 
machine there.
<P>
	I like to think I am an entrepreneur. I find the whole process of 
dealing with bureaucrats to be very frustrating. They want paper 
and more paper. They want to make sure the promised job 
creation objectives are being met with the taxpayers' money. 
They come in and do audits. There is scrutiny beyond 
imagination.
<P>
	I would be the first to admit that the Government of Canada 
has made mistakes from time to time. If they add the last 20 
years of taxpayers' money invested in R and D, in new 
technology and in regional development projects versus the 
return, Reformers would suddenly come across the Chamber and 
join us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> Then why are we so far in debt? Why is the 
country so far in debt?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
want to take a minute to answer the question about why are we so 
far in debt.
<P>
	We should not be punishing or casting aspersions on 
entrepreneurs who have had some financial support from the 
Government of Canada and have more than paid back the 
investment not only in terms of payback on loans but also in 
taxes. It is not relevant but I will deal with the member's 
question. Why the debt? They should not hang the debt on the 
entrepreneurs of the country. If that is what the Reform Party is 
doing now, hanging the debt of the country on the entrepreneurs, 
the small and medium sized business-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> No, it is your policies.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Would the hon. 
parliamentary secretary continue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Madam Speaker, it is 
interesting to hear the Reform Party. We have been in the House 
one year and now the Reform Party is against entrepreneurship.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Schmidt:</B> We are against your pork barrelling. That is 
what we are against.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> I quote directly from 
the member's speech: ``Government assistance should not be 
used if a company cannot make it on its own''.
<P>
	There is not a single entrepreneur in the country, whether it 
was through the tax act, some form of grant, loan assistance or 
whatever, who has not received some sort of recognition and 
support from the Government of Canada or the various 
provinces.
<P>
	All they have to do is look at the tax act of Canada to see $40 
billion worth of tax grants buried there. Most of them are going 
to businesses in the member's riding and now he is against 
entrepreneurship. We will not support this amendment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am a little surprised to hear what the hon. member 
from the Reform Party had to say immediately after the speech 
the hon. member for Fraser Valley West had given, emphasizing 
that the government was to step in only when necessary. He was 
in fact leaving the door open to some government involvement, 
while in the amendment and the remarks made by the hon. 
member for the Reform Party who spoke just before me, the door 
is totally closed.
<P>
	Deleting, in Clause 14, lines 19 to 47, on page 7, and lines 1 to 
8, on page 8, is absolutely unthinkable, as far as we are 
concerned. Let me explain. Again, this Reform Party proposal 
shows that this party is totally out of touch with economic 
reality. It cannot conceive the role of the State as that of an 
economic leader, a developer. It sees it more as a wait-and-see 
role, if not that of a killjoy.
<P>
	By deleting large portions of Clause 14 which enables the 
government, through its Minister of Industry, to influence small 
and medium size businesses to facilitate the implementation of 
programs or projects under the act, the Reform Party shows, 
once again, its commitment to fostering wild liberalism: ``Let us 
go. We will see where it leads us''.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois can only condemn such an attitude, an 
attitude of permissiveness with respect to the market economy. 
You cannot just say: ``Go at it, any which way you want''. I think 
that the State has a role to play as an economic leader, and a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8539"> 8539 </A></B>
<P>
promoter of development. I think that is part of the 
responsibilities of the State.
<P>
	Therefore, we think it is essential that the government be able 
to have a say concerning loans that may be made, guarantees that 
may be given and loan insurance or credit insurance that may be 
provided, as stated in paragraph 14(3)(a).
<P>
	Unlike the Reform Party, we feel it is also essential that the 
government be able to make loans and guarantee the repayment 
of any financial obligation or provide loan insurance ir credit 
insurance and make grants and contributions.
<P>
	The Premier of Quebec made it clear -he sent clear signals- 
when he said that the State must be an active player in the 
economy. It must not assume the role of a banker, but its 
certainly can guarantee repayment for SMEs, which are 
recognized as creating the most new jobs, to promote their 
development and help them face this free trade, global market, 
high-tech, competitive context. In a nutshell, support the 
development of businesses. The primary role of the state is to be 
an economic leader and developer.
<P>
	Quebec, as we know it today, is the product of the emergence 
of a state actively involved in the economic development of its 
territory since the beginning of the 1960s. Take for example the 
great success of Hydro-Québec, the major role played by the 
Quebec deposit and investment fund and, more recently, the 
success of the Solidarity Fund, which go to show that the 
economy of the community has to be made available to small 
and medium size businesses, indeed, the ones that generate the 
most employment.
<P>
	Minister Paillé has just implemented a program for SMEs, to 
guarantee repayment to a maximum of $50,000 for SMEs, 
people who have ideas, who can implement ideas, create jobs 
and develop them.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	That is what we call economic support. Action must be taken 
to support the people who are very active in terms of 
development and job creation. There are many out there who 
have ideas and can set up businesses.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois can only express disagreement with this 
presentation and the Reform Party amendment. Because we 
recognize that any State has a role to play as a developer and 
must support economic development, particularly as regards 
SMEs, we are clearly opposed to the amendment brought forth 
by the Reform Party.

<BLOCKQUOTE>``(2) The Minister shall, at least 60 days before the date on which the Minister fixes 
or increases a fee under sections 18, 19 or 20, cause to be published in the Canada 
Gazette and in no fewer than two leading newspapers in each province a notice 
clearly indicating</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>a</I>) the products, services, rights, privileges, regulatory processes, approvals or use 
of facilities provided under these sections; and</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>b</I>) the fees to be fixed or increased pursuant to these sections.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Madam Speaker, the Official Opposition has a pretty 
straightforward position on clause 21(2). Our amendment is 
aimed at putting things right side up instead of upside down.
<P>
	This clause of Bill C-46 found in the third report of the 
industry committee says in part (2) that, after setting fees under 
sections 18, 19 or 20, the minister has 30 days to publish these 
fees in the <I>Canada Gazette</I> so that Treasury Board can pass 
regulations to authorize them.
<P>
	People are notified 30 days after the fees have been set. This is 
totally unacceptable. This is a devious way to increase taxes 
without notifying taxpayers or notifying them after the fact. 
Something is wrong here.
<P>
	We also detect an attempt to give disproportionate powers to 
senior officials, since this clause enables them to set fees 
without the approval of the House of Commons. They will 
simply bypass those elected by their fellow citizens to manage 
the affairs of state.
<P>
	This provision of the bill is clearly undemocratic, in our 
opinion, since fees can be set without the approval of 
lawmakers. The doors are wide open. That is why the Bloc 
Quebecois tabled this motion:

Not 30 days after but 60 days before, so that we can respond and 
look into the matter.
<P>
	Let us be serious. I am telling the Liberal government to stop

<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, the member raises a very 
good point here. The part of his address I want to deal with is the 
statement he made that this basically overrides the rights of the 
legislators.
<P>
	Members of our statutory instruments and regulations 
committee brought that very point up about three weeks ago, 
that the flaw did exist in the bill. The government recognized 
this was an override. We believe our amendment deals with this 
in a constructive way so legislators are not bypassed. I believe 
my colleague critic from the Reform Party shares that view.
<P>
	I want to say something to the member dealing with this whole 
notion of overriding legislators. The Prime Minister, whom I 
have had the pleasure of working with since 1980, who has come 
up through the ranks as a parliamentary secretary, a young MP, 
is very sensitive to making sure the individual roles of 
legislators in this House of Commons are meaningful.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has stated this on several occasions. It is 
part of the red book. We do not come to this city day in, weekend 
in and weekend out, making sacrifices with our families and 
friends to be subservient to unelected officials or bureaucrats. 
That is why our committee process has reached in my judgment 
a new level of reform.
<P>
	Our committees are almost independent now. I would not 
want to say we are totally independent because the government 
obviously has a majority in terms of the members. There is a 
push by the Prime Minister to encourage MPs to develop their 
ideas, to get control of their own agenda and do what they 
believe in.
<P>
	I believe the amendment we proposed in committee meets the 
concerns the member from the Bloc raised in his address. We 
would be supporting our own motion and we therefore would not 
be supporting his.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I think we would all honour the intention of the 
amendment being proposed by the Bloc. I have addressed the 
idea of having openness. Making sure there is a certain element 
of knowledge that is open and fair to everybody who wishes to 
have that information about  fees and things of that sort is very 
laudable. I certainly commend that.
<P>
	I do agree with the hon. parliamentary secretary to the 
minister that the government saw the error of its original 
proposal in the bill as it was originally written, bringing to the 
committee a whole series of amendments that I think does meet 
the intent of the Bloc member's comments.
<P>
	There is another principle that needs to be observed. There 
has to be a certain freedom to do the things that are right by 
government. There has to be an openness. The accountability of 
government has to be observed.
<P>
	The amendments that were proposed and accepted in 
committee that are now in the report of the bill that will be voted 
on at third reading will meet not only the intent but also the 
detail of the member's suggestion.
<P>
	Therefore I would respectfully suggest that we all support the 
amendments that come out of the committee and that we defeat 
this amendment.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="INTERNATIONALDAYOFDISABLEDPERSONS">INTERNATIONAL DAY OF DISABLED PERSONS</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
bring to the attention of the House that the United Nations has 
declared Saturday, December 3, 1994, as International Day of 
Disabled Persons.
<P>
	In a draft resolution, the United Nations stated that the 
General Assembly was well aware of the need for more vigorous 
and broader action. It stated that measures were required at all 
levels to fulfil the objectives of the decade and world program of 
action concerning disabled persons.
<P>
	As a member of the United Nations, Canada honours this 
international commitment. Our federal strategy is aimed at 
equalization of opportunity for disabled persons and 
optimization of their positive contribution to Canadian society.
<P>
	The government also realizes that more has to be done. 
Through awareness raising and action oriented measures we aim 
for increased comprehension and better access for persons with 
disabilities. As a member of the Standing Committee on Human 
Rights and the Status of Disabled Persons, I too am convinced of 
and committed to these initiatives.
<P>
	A disability or handicap is no deterrent to achievement. In 
politics alone, William Mr. Hughes, the former Prime Minister 
of Australia was hearing impaired. Former President of the 
United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt, was confined to a 
wheelchair. Trevor Morgan, a former member of Parliament, 
was blind. Who can forget the epic journeys of Terry Fox and 
Rick Hansen. The determination of these individuals and 
countless other disabled persons have shown that the barriers 
can be overcome.
<P>
	I encourage all members of this Parliament and Canadians 
to-

	<B>Mr. Réjean Lefebvre (Champlain, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, Robin 
Richardson of the Fraser Institute told the media yesterday that 
if Quebec decides to separate and refuses to pay its share of the 
debt, Canada would be destitute.
<P>
	It is inconceivable that an institution which claims to be 
serious could make such statements. Quebec sovereignists have 
always said openly that they would meet their responsibilities 
and that when Quebec becomes sovereign, it will assume its fair 
share of the federal debt. On the other hand, a sovereign Quebec 
will of course receive its fair share of federal assets.
<P>
	At present, Quebec taxpayers are already bearing their share 
of the federal debt in the present system. But the way the 
Canadian government is managing its finances is cause for 
concern.
<P>
	This is the second time in less than four months that the Fraser 
Institute has engaged in such speculation. In future, we hope that 
the institute will be a little more serious, because as Talleyrand 
said, anything exaggerated is not worth taking seriously.

<HR>

<P>
	This day is to remind us of the special concerns and needs 
of the disabled. The Reform Party joins with all Canadians to 
create a fair, equitable and sustainable system for all. We 
believe that Canadians have a personal and collective 
responsibility to care and provide for those unable to care and 
provide for themselves.
<P>
	Equality of opportunity for the disabled will come about as 
individuals, employers and governments at all levels work 
together to remove the barriers to their full participation in our 
communities and in our workplaces. To assist the disabled in the 
pursuit of their goals is both just and appropriate.
<P>
	Today as we recognize the valuable contribution of the 
disabled, let us reaffirm our support for their desire to be an 
active, integral and productive part of our society.

	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Vancouver Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, today 
our Prime Minister is attending the Paris summit on AIDS.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This summit is a French initiative in co-operation with the 
WHO. Forty-two countries representing 70 per cent of the world 
population will make a joint acclamation of their commitment to 
fight HIV-AIDS. The Paris declaration will reflect the 
principles and values already adopted by the United Nations for 
HIV-AIDS and will add a new component for nations to respond 
to urgent needs with practical and lasting measures. This 
declaration would be operational by January 1996.
<P>
	AIDS is a public health issue and political world leaders have 
made the fight against this disease a priority. Special attention 
will be given to reducing the vulnerability of women to AIDS, to 
the important role of associations of persons living with the 
virus, and to strengthening national and international 
mechanisms for human rights and ethics as they relate to AIDS.

Speaker, on behalf of Nigerians whose voices cannot be heard 
from behind prison bars, I would like to draw the attention of the 
House to activities engaged in by the de facto government in the 
Commonwealth country of Nigeria as they relate to human 
rights.
<P>
	Nigeria's circumstances represent a severe setback to the 
process of democratization in Africa. Mr. Abiola's election 
victory in June 1993 was quashed by General Babangyida, who 
went on to install an interim political body that yielded finally to 
military rule. Already the de facto government has breached the 
UN human rights declaration by its brutal attacks on newspaper 
editors, human rights lawyers and any other type of political or 
economic dissent. As well there is a risk of civil war on the basis 
of ethnic divisions.
<P>
	I am requesting, on behalf of concerned Canadians, that the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs meet with the High Commissioner 
for Nigeria to register Canada's concern for human rights 
conditions in that country. As a signatory to the UN human 
rights declaration, Canada must continue to be vigilant in 
monitoring human rights accordance for men, women and 
children throughout the world.

	<B>Ms. Colleen Beaumier (Brampton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
November 21 the Queen's Square infrastructure project was 
launched in my riding of Brampton. This is a $15 million project 
funded under the Canada-Ontario infrastructure program which 
will result in many medium and long term jobs.
<P>
	The project is being undertaken in conjunction with the 
project negotiated between the city of Brampton and a private 
contractor, John Cutruzzola of the Inzola Group. When 
construction is complete the downtown city core will have 
undergone a $50 million facelift, leaving residents of Brampton 
with a beautiful market style downtown core.
<P>
	The national infrastructure program is putting Canadians 
back to work, and at the same time revitalizing communities. It 
is a model of how all three levels of government can co-operate 
for the public good. The Queen's Square project in my riding of 
Brampton is an example of the benefits of this co-operation 
when it extends to the private sector.
<P>
	On behalf of my constituents, I would like to take this 
opportunity to congratulate the minister responsible for

	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr.

region in Canada. Currently we face a major transportation 
problem with the only arterial highway in and out of Victoria 
choked most of the time.
<P>
	However, there is a solution available in the existing 
Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway. We must put in place 
measures to ensure its viability as an effective and efficient 
mover of goods, services and people. It is currently owned by 
Canadian Pacific and operated in a grossly inefficient fashion by 
VIA Rail.
<P>
	I encourage the Minister of Transport to convene a meeting of 
members of the federal government, the provincial government 
and Canadian Pacific to address this pressing issue. This is not 
an issue of politics but of public necessity. To allow this railway 
to be abandoned will be a gross travesty to the taxpayers as 
ultimately money will need to be spent to provide an alternative

given to the Saint John shipyard in New Brunswick under a 
signed agreement.
<P>
	The board decided on Saint John Shipbuilding because it is an 
ice free port and because the company has the proven expertise 
to do the job.
<P>
	This past Tuesday the Prime Minister stated that he is asking 
the board to review and overturn the signed legal agreement 
with Saint John Shipbuilding in order to put it out to tender. 
Under the agreement the government may be liable for expenses 
and damages as a result of the termination of the agreement, 
should it occur.
<P>
	Is this what the government is all about, cancelling signed 
legal agreements that could cost the taxpayers millions of

incomprehensible that the potential for such atrocities to occur

did not add up about it.
<P>
	Last Friday its members presented to the finance committee 
their plan to reduce government spending by $10 billion. On the 
suggestion of the member for Calgary Centre I undertook to read 
this document. The proposal for reductions is broken down into 
five parts: first, $70 million; second, zero; the third is $3.5 
billion plus $.64 billion; four, $1 billion; and five is $2 billion 
plus $1.7 billion, plus an additional $.125 billion. This adds up 
to only $9.035 billion, a shortfall of $1 billion.
<P>
	To ensure I was correct I had a chartered accountant, an 
economist, two students at Carleton University and one at 
Ottawa University check the figures. The results are the same. 
Members of the Reform Party cannot add and they do not add up 
to Canada either.

	According to the World Health Organization, by the middle of 
1994, more than 16 million adults and one million children had 
contracted the AIDS virus since the beginning of the pandemic. 
Even worse, by the year 2000, the cumulative total of people 
infected by the virus will be between 30 and 40 million, while 
the total number of cases of full-blown AIDS will be close to 10 
million. No responsible government, in the United States or in

the fight against AIDS must include a campaign to promote safe 
sex.

Council for its success in the forestry business, as reported this 
week by their auditors Price Waterhouse.
<P>
	Federal loans worth $1.5 million, used by the tribal council to 
start two businesses, have paid off with a return of $10.7 million 
in corporate taxes.
<P>
	The tribal council, led for many years by Chief Percy 
Derocher and today by Chief Richard Gladue, created jobs, 
contributed to their community and proved that there is an 
important and useful role for the federal government to play in 
support of aboriginal businesses.
<P>
	The success of the Meadow Lake Tribal Council has paid off 
in other ways. Their contribution has helped lead to the naming 
of the town of Meadow Lake as Canada's forestry capital for 
1995. We can all help them celebrate next year by ensuring that 
the federal government acknowledges this success with a 
continuation, indeed an enhancement, of the aboriginal business 
support program.

	<B>Mr. Raymond Lavigne (Verdun-Saint-Paul, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like draw the attention of the House to two 
important events connected with road safety. Today marks the 
beginning of Road Safety Week, sponsored by the Canada Safety 
Council. This year's theme reminds us of the dangers of driving 
while under the influence of alcohol and stresses the fact that the 
lives of thousands of Canadians are affected each year by this 
<P>

<B><A NAME="8545"> 8545 </A></B>
<P>
problem. Concerning another aspect of road safety, five years 
ago, the federal government announced that all new motor  
vehicles sold in Canada were to be equipped with daytime 
running lights.
<P>
<B>(1415) </B>
<P>
	This morning, the Minister of Transport released a study that 
found that daytime running lights had prevented thousands of 
collisions, so that our roads are now much safer.

	<B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, many will recall Marlon Brando as the godfather when 
he muttered: ``A favour is a favour''.
<P>
	Yesterday Liberal members of the Standing Committee on 
Canadian Heritage collectively played the role of godperson to 
the hon. member for Calgary Southeast. Hon. members should 
know the hon. member for Calgary Southeast refused to propose 
or even vote on a motion authorizing funding for witnesses from 
western Canada to appear before the committee, the very 
witnesses the hon. member had previously insisted must appear.
<P>
	Lack of funding would have killed the agreement the member 
had vehemently insisted upon. Certainly, in the vernacular, all 
members have bad hair days but perhaps the hon. member would 
like to manger ses mots.
<P>
	We must restore trust in politicians. Trust only begins when 
we live up to the spirit and intent of agreements made in this our 
parliamentary home. In her own words I would like to say again: 
``Anything less would be absolutely outrageous''.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="MILDAVIESHIPYARD">MIL DAVIE SHIPYARD</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
government persistently refuses to right a wrong done to 
Quebec, by transferring immediately the contract for the 
construction of a Hibernia drilling sub-unit to the Quebec 
shipbuilder MIL Davie, the only loser in this whole business, as 
it was the only other bidder on this contract. Yet Hibernia argued 
that the time constraints and deadlines required that this 
contract be assigned to Saint John Shipbuilding without 
competitive bidding.
<P>
	My question is directed to whichever minister would be so 
kind as to answer on behalf of the government. How is it that the 
government has the time to call for tenders now, when the 
normal practice, as the Quebec Minister of Industry indicated, is 
to go to the next bidder on the list if the first one is unable to 
perform the work?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Hibernia benefits plan provides that all interested 
parties be given a full and fair opportunity to submit a bid for 
part of the work under the Hibernia deal.
<P>
	The independent Canada-Newfoundland Offshore 
Petroleum Board reviewed the decision in this regard by the 
consortium and found that the Hibernia benefits plan had not 
been followed. It is only normal for the government to ask 
members of the consortium to review their decision. I think that 
makes sense because we are asking if the proper process has 
been followed in a way that is fair to all concerned.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
solution seems obvious. A bid has been submitted and the 
bidder's name is MIL Davie.
<P>
	Why does the government not transfer the contract to MIL 
Davie, as would seem appropriate? And where does the 
government find the time now to launch a new bidding process, 
if the work was so urgent, or so we were told, that the contract 
had to be let to Saint John Shipbuilding in the first place?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, what the hon. member is complaining about is with 
respect to a decision made by the consortium that gave the 
contract to Saint John Shipbuilding without following the 
Hibernia benefits plan according to the findings of the 
independent Canada-Newfoundland Offshore Petroleum 
Board.
<P>
	That is why the government is asking the consortium to 
review the decision because of the findings of the board. We are 
asking the consortium to make that decision as quickly as 
possible. We hope the hon. member will agree with this sensible 
step.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, what is 
the government of Canada waiting for to table the full report of 
the Canada-Newfoundland Board, so that everyone can take 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8546"> 8546 </A></B>
<P>
cognizance of the facts and see that MIL Davie was treated 
unfairly and that the Hibernia board of directors has 
contravened every contract award rule in the book in this 
particular case?
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I will inquire as to the possibility of tabling the report 
of the Canada-Newfoundland Offshore Petroleum Board.
<P>
	I think that we should also table in this House the report on the 
nearly $500 million in economic benefits that have accrued to 
Quebec as a result of some 100 contracts. As a result of these 
contracts and conditions, the government just could not leave 
the people of Quebec unaware of such crucial facts.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, at 
a press conference this morning, the minister of defence quickly 
tabled his white paper without any warning and without regard 
for the Official Opposition.
<P>
	The minister of defence announced that, with the holiday 
season approaching, he intends to spend hundreds of millions of 
dollars on used military equipment. The defence minister's 
shopping list includes four used British submarines, helicopters 
and armoured vehicles.
<P>
	Now that the cold war is over and that the government must 
reduce spending, how can the minister dare contemplate at this 
time the acquisition of used military equipment whose 
usefulness is highly questionable?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first on the 
procedural matter, it is customary for government to table 
responses to standing committee reports in the House. That was 
done.
<P>
	I do not think it would have been within the normal practice to 
have given advance warning of that. However I did give a copy 
immediately to a member of the hon. member's party and the 
critic for the Reform Party immediately upon tabling, knowing 
that there were at least four hours before question period within 
which to reflect upon it.
<P>
	On the specific point regarding the major capital purchases 
that have been called for in the white paper, it is very important 
to differentiate between the helicopter purchases required to 
replace the Labradors for search and rescue, the Sea Kings for 
the combat helicopters on ships and the armoured personnel 
carriers for the army from the submarine question.
<P>
	The submarine question is simply a matter of investigating a 
possible arrangement with the United Kingdom that wants to 
sell four used conventionally powered submarines which would 
assist us in discharging our maritime mandate not just on the 
Atlantic coast but on the Pacific coast as well.
<P>
	There is no commitment on the part of the government to 
purchase such submarines. Simply we are looking at the matter 
and we would have been remiss if we had not mentioned it in the 
white paper.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
can assure the minister that I am quite able to differentiate 
between submarine and helicopter purchases!
<P>
	How can the minister explain to Canadian taxpayers that, 
barely a year after cancelling the EH-101 helicopter contract at 
an approximate cost of $800 million, he has now decided to buy 
new helicopters to replace the Sea Kings which last spring were 
declared fit to fly until the year 2002 by the minister himself?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the red 
book we never discounted the need for search and rescue 
helicopters. We said that combat helicopters for ships would be 
studied in the defence review. The hon. member was part of a 
committee that recommended we buy new helicopters.
<P>
	What is important is that the Conservative government 
wanted to spend $5.8 billion to develop a state of the art 
helicopter that we did not need and could not afford. The 
solution that we are proposing is going to save considerably 
more money, well over a billion dollars and perhaps $2 billion. 
That is not bad economics as far as I am concerned.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>During the course of the last several months, I have been in continuous touch 
with senior officials and indeed with provincial counterparts, attorneys general 
and ministers of justice, exchanging views about the proposals that will be 
decided upon and announced this afternoon.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
	However today in a television interview he revealed that he 
had not spoken to some of the provincial justice ministers but 
hoped that he would get their support.
<P>
	Given that the registration of firearms will have a significant 
impact upon the financial resources of the provinces and 
territories, why did the minister not get the support of provincial 
justice ministers before the fact, not after?

<P>
<HR>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the government is 
confident it has the support of the vast majority of Canadians 
in the decisions we announced yesterday with respect to 
firearms.
<P>
	In terms of the provinces and territories, as I made clear 
yesterday I have been in direct contact with some of my 
provincial counterparts. Throughout the process the Department 
of Justice has been in continuous contact with senior officials of 
provincial and territorial ministries of justice. Those 
communications have been continuous and, I can advise the 
House, very productive.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
still seems wise that we would get support from all of them when 
all the provinces will be involved.
<P>
	In one short statement yesterday the Minister of Justice 
eliminated the role of Parliament, of the Standing Committee on 
Justice and of interested parties on both sides of the issue. He 
said: ``Let me make it very clear. The process of consultation 
leading to legislation is now over''. This is unacceptable.
<P>
	What gives the Minister of Justice the power to interfere with 
the parliamentary process which includes the Standing 
Committee on Justice? Is true democracy proving to be 
inconvenient for the justice minister?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I meant yesterday 
exactly what I said. The process of consultation leading to the 
proposals in the legislation the government will put forward is at 
an end. We have reached the government's policy on firearms.
<P>
	Naturally the bill will be put before the House of Commons in 
February when we resume. It will then be referred to committee 
in the ordinary course. It will go through the regular 
parliamentary procedure in which we hope to have the 
involvement of all members of the House.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
seems evident across the country that these proposals are in fact 
full of holes and seriously flawed.
<P>
	We have seen in previous legislation in the House that this 
minister has set a precedent for ramrodding, railroading and 
running roughshod over the democratic process.
<P>
	The minister said that yesterday's proposals are final. Will the 
minister, upon tabling the legislation, be open to further 
consultation? Will he consider changes to these proposals that 
attack responsible law-abiding gun owners?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is obvious the 
support among members of the Canadian public for these 
proposals is very high. We are making proposals that have the 
support of the vast majority of Canadians.
<P>
	In terms of the consultation process, I spent almost five 
months consulting with over 150 national and regional 
organizations of firearms owners and users. I dealt with them at 
close quarters on the details of the proposals. Our consultations 
leading to the formation of government policy are at an end. 
Naturally when I put the bill before the House it will be referred 
to committee, witnesses will be heard, and the usual 
parliamentary process will be followed.

<P>
	Yesterday, the minister refused to respond favorably to the 
invitation from the Mayor of Saint-Jean, saying that he had not 
received an invitation from Quebec's Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs. Now, the Mayor of Saint-Jean 
publicly invited both governments to Saint-Jean to continue 
discussions on the future of the military college on the basis of 
his proposal. Quebec is ready to delegate representatives.
<P>
	Can the minister tell us whether he, like the Quebec minister, 
intends to respond favorably to the invitation from the Mayor of 
Saint-Jean and delegate officials so that discussions can resume 
and thus show his good faith?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs

Mr. Speaker, as I already said in this House a few days ago, I met 
the Mayor of Saint-Jean to listen to his proposal and to discuss 
the future of the college in Saint-Jean.
<P>
	We both clearly agreed that the college in Saint-Jean must 
continue and for this two essential conditions of the July 19 
agreement had to be met: the college has to be demilitarized and 
a transition period is needed.
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
	What has happened is that I sent Ms. Beaudoin a letter several 
weeks ago, asking her to do just that, and she has not yet sent me 
a reply. As soon as she gives me an answer, we are ready to meet 
her.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, can 
the minister tell us whether or not he is prepared to continue

keep 350 officer cadets at the college next September?

	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday 
during the justice minister's press conference when asked 
whether the registration of rifles and shotguns would reduce the 
criminal use of these firearms, the minister could not say that it 
would.
<P>
	Given that the objective of firearms control is to reduce the 
accidental, intentional and criminal use of firearms, can the 
minister today state that the registration of shotguns and rifles 
will meet these objectives and reduce the criminal use of these 
weapons in society?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the only reason this 
government is proposing a registration system for rifles and 
shotguns is our firm belief that it will have exactly that result.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in his 
proposals yesterday the minister failed to provide the statistical 
information to justify the registration of rifles and shotguns and 
to ban other firearms.
<P>
	The Auditor General found the same lack of substantiating 
evidence for Bill C-17, which led him to conclude that C-17 
was initiated for reasons of public policy.
<P>
	I ask the minister, when will he provide statistical 
justification for introducing these measures, or is this being 
done for reasons of public policy as well?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is a reason why 
the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police wants universal 
registration of firearms. There is a reason why the Canada 
Safety Council has been urging the government to introduce 
universal registration of firearms, quite apart from common 
sense.
<P>
	As we announced yesterday, there is a direct link between the 
registration of firearms, the reduction of crime, the reduction in 
the number of lost and stolen firearms in the hands of criminals

RRSPs when, according to a Gallup poll, over 86 per cent of 
Canadians and Quebecers oppose such a measure.
<P>
	Considering that the government did not wait until the end of

UI contributions below the level mentioned in the budget, will 
the Minister of National Revenue now reassure concerned

one fired by Olympic gold medalist, Linda Thom. This is a

eliminated Canadians from this Olympic sport? They will no

<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the category of 
handguns that this government proposes to ban is not broadly 
used in legitimate sporting activities. Instead, these small 
handguns we propose to ban are cheaply made, easily concealed 
and commonly used in crime. That is why we are banning them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr.

not. The categories of handguns which were identified for ban

	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney

yesterday following my speech in the House. It disappointments 
me, as much as her speech did yesterday, that instead of dealing 
with the substance of the matter, instead of expressing her 
position with respect to the substance of the decisions and the

caustically upon that.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
how can the minister claim not to have caved in to the gun lobby, 
considering that his eventual legislation will allow more than 
4,000 Canadians to keep their AK-47s and more than half a

prohibited. Those who have them can keep them but not transfer 
them.

	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	Yesterday, the United Nations suffered a major diplomatic 
reversal when the Bosnian Serb authorities refused to meet with 
UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali. Peace 
negotiations have reached an impasse. The NATO Ministers of 
Foreign Affairs met today in Brussels to develop their position 
on the Bosnian situation, while major tensions between the 
Americans and Europeans continue to grow.
<P>
	What position has the Canadian government taken today at 
the NATO Summit in Brussels in order to break the deadlock 
concerning Bosnia?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National 
Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
first of all, we regret that the Bosnian factions refused to meet 
with the UN Secretary-General. We are very sorry.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has stated our position on the Bosnian 
conflict and this is the position which was stressed again this 
morning and this afternoon by my colleague, the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs. Right now, I do not have a report from these 
NATO meetings, since I am told they are still under way in 
Europe, but when I have an answer I will contact the hon. 
member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
instead of simply criticizing the United States for their attitude, 
as the Prime Minister did in an interview he granted to the daily 
<I>Le Monde</I>, does the government not think it should take a much 
more constructive approach and consult its main partners in 
order to come up with solutions that would get the peace 
negotiations moving again in Bosnia?
<P>
<B>(1445) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime 
Minister spoke to the French Senate today which is indeed an 
honour. I think he is the second foreigner ever to have addressed 
that body.
<P>
	After the speech the Prime Minister was quite forceful in his 
desire for Canada to remain as part of the solution in the former 
Yugoslavia to help bring tensions to an easier point and to bring 
negotiations to fruition. Certainly he believes that Canada has a 
role, and I hope the Prime Minister has a role, to help in any new 
negotiating process.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the contact 
group on Bosnia was established in April, two of the five 
members being countries that had no troops there. Canada is one 
of the largest contributors but we are excluded.
<P>
	Why did the government not do its job in April and demand 
our membership in the contact group? Why did this government 
wait silently for so long before it finally became involved as 
conditions worsened? The Canadian people want to know why.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we made 
representations at the establishment of the contact group and for 
reasons I cannot explain Canada was not invited to be part of that 
group.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8551"> 8551 </A></B>
<P>
	Certainly, even though we regret that state of affairs, that 
does not mean that we renege on our commitments to be an 
active full member of United Nations missions in Bosnia and 
Croatia.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the contact 
group refuses to admit Canada when the Prime Minister asks 
this weekend in Budapest what exactly is the government going 
to do? Are we going to continue to be wimps in answering these 
sorts of things? Canadian lives are at stake and the people of this 
country want to know what the government is going to do.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime 
Minister has been most articulate and most forceful in declaring 
Canada's interest in participating in all manner of fora to deal 
with the very terrible conflict in the former Yugoslavia.

<P>
	Most of the violence women experience is in their homes and 
at the hands of men they know. What measures is the minister

<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are doing a great 
deal but it is not enough.
<P>
	We must renew our commitment and focus our energies to do 
more, but what we have started to date is considerable. I can 
refer to the initiatives of yesterday with respect to firearms. I 
can remind the House that one woman every six days is shot to 
death in this country, that most of the time it occurs in her own 
home at the hands of someone she knows, and that person is 
using a rifle or a shotgun. The steps we took yesterday I believe 
will help in some way to deal with that issue.
<P>
	I should refer as well to the creation of a national crime 
prevention council and the attention it will devote to violence 
against women. I can speak about Bill C-42 and the efforts to 
change the peace bound provisions to make them more effective 
to protect victims of domestic violence, and Bill C-41, the 
matters it deals with in terms of breaches of positions of trust, 
including relationships between physicians and female patients.

	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is directed to the Minister of Industry.
<P>
	The coalition for affordable telephone services has asked the 
government to reverse the CRTC's decision to allow telephone 
companies to raise rates for local calls by $72 annually over a 
three-year period. Furthermore, the association for competitive 
telecommunications is concerned that telephone companies 
would use the additional revenue from local calls to compete 
unfairly on the long-distance market.
<P>
<B>(1450) </B>
<P>
	Does the Minister of Industry intend to look into the 
association's allegations and examine the cost structure of 
telephone companies that offer local services, to ensure that the 
increase in local rates approved by the CRTC does not affect 
competition on the long-distance market?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, we received the request to which the hon. member 
referred just now. I am examining this request, and I think I will 
submit a recommendation to cabinet before the end of the year to 
determine the outcome of this case.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
supplementary is directed to the Minister of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	To allow enough time to check the cost structure of the 
telephone companies, does the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
intend to delay the application of the CRTC's decision to allow 
an increase in local rates as of January 1?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is perhaps difficult for the opposition sometimes to 
understand but responsibility for the telecommunications sector 
does fall within my domain.
<P>

to cabinet which will be dealt with in the course of determining 
the government's position on the appeal and on the 
determination made by the CRTC decision 94-19.

	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	The Reform Party is pleased to see that in general the white 
paper reflects much of what was recommended by the special 
joint committee on defence in its report. However, the white 
paper calls for a reduction in Canadian forces personnel to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8552"> 8552 </A></B>
<P>
60,000, 6,700 below the numbers projected in the February 1994 
budget.
<P>
	The defence review stated that cuts, either financial or 
numerical, beyond those projected would necessitate the 
surrender of Canadian forces capabilities. What capabilities has 
the government identified to be forgone?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do 
appreciate the support of the hon. member and his party. He 
worked very hard on the joint committee and he should be 
commended. I thank him for his consideration.
<P>
	With respect to the reduction in force personnel from a 
projected 66,700 as envisioned in the 1994 budget to an end state 
of around 60,000, we believe that much of the capability can be 
maintained simply by moving a lot of uniform people out of 
administrative positions of downsizing, of rationalizing, of 
privatizing certain services, of doing things efficiently to make 
better use of the personnel we actually have.
<P>
	With respect to the specific point about those aspects of 
combat capability that we are losing, we are sort of trimming at 
the edges. Obviously the big one is that our fighter capability 
will be reduced somewhat from about 72 that are in service now 
to between 48 and 60. We have some flexibility depending on 
the financial requirements that I will be discussing with the 
Minister of Finance. It will be largely in that area.
<P>
	My colleague, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, has made it 
clear that from now on we just do not have the resources to take 
part in every peacekeeping mission. It is very expensive and we 
have to evaluate each request on its merits and look at what we 
can do and what we can afford to do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, all of the reductions the minister mentions in his 
response were included and considered before the 
recommendations were made.
<P>
	The defence review recommended that Canada be able to 
commit to the United Nations and sustain approximately 4,000 
personnel. However, the white paper commits numbers that 
could ``conceivably involve in the order of 10,000 military 
personnel''.
<P>
	As we know from Bosnia and other UN commitments, it is 
easier to become involved than to disengage. Canada cannot 
sustain such numbers. Why are we committing them?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, just because 
we have the capability to commit a certain number does not 
mean to say we actually do it.
<P>
	What we say in the white paper is that at any one time we 
could deploy in missions, not necessarily in peacekeeping but in 
natural disasters or other measures, up to 10,000 people at once.
<P>
	We also commit to increase by 3,000 the number of personnel 
actually involved in the army able to take part in the land forces 
missions.
<P>
<B>(1455) </B>
<P>
	Certainly the point that I raised earlier in terms of evaluating 
each particular mission on its merits answers the hon. member's 
question. We have to be very judicious in future in the way we 
deploy our forces. We believe that there is a consensus in 
Canada that this country really does want to continue to do its 
part for the UN and to help bring peace and stability to the world.

my question is for the Minister of Transport and it concerns the

<P>
	I wonder if the Minister of Transport is aware of arguments to 
the effect that if CP were to be permitted by the government to 
buy CN east of Winnipeg, given the tax treatment of such a 
purchase CP might well get CN from the Canadian taxpayer for 
nothing.
<P>
	I would like to ask the Minister of Transport if he could assure 
us that in the event the government does consider this proposal it 
would make absolutely sure, even if it has to change the tax 
system to do so, CP does not rip off the Canadian taxpayer by 
manipulating the tax system in such a way as to get CN for 
nothing.

have nothing to do with this offer whatsoever even though it has 
been extended?
<P>

east of Winnipeg is under active consideration by both the

by my hon. colleague, there is the question that it would have the 
result of reducing competition and really changing the way rail 
operates east of Winnipeg.

tions revealed certain concerns among Canadians regarding 
Canada's personal and corporate tax systems.

	As members know, Canadians wanted tax incentives to be 
better targeted. They wanted tax loopholes to be closed and 
complexity to be reduced. Overall they wanted a more equitable 
tax system.
<P>
	The government shares these concerns and accordingly in the

the tax system more supportive of economic growth and more 
reflective of fiscal realities, simpler to comply with and more

	First, I would like to review these amendments as a reminder 
to colleagues in the House and to Canadians. The capital gains 
exemption eliminates the $100,000 lifetime capital gains 
exemption and provides an election with respect to the gains 
accrued before the date of the budget.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	The second amendment in the bill relates to employee 
benefits, extending the taxation of employer provided benefits 
to include the first $25,000 of life insurance.
<P>
	The third is the age tax credit, which provides a reduction in 
the amount of the credit based on an individual's income level.
<P>
	The fourth amendment is the homebuyers plan, which 
modifies the provisions of the homebuyers plan, extending it 
indefinitely for first time home buyers.
<P>
	The fifth amendment is the charitable donations tax credit 
which lowers the threshold at which the tax credit is calculated 
at the highest individual marginal tax rate.
<P>
	The sixth amendment is the business meals and entertainment 
expenses, which reduces the percentage of such expenses that 
may be recognized for tax purposes from 80 per cent to 50 per 
cent.
<P>
	The seventh amendment is the tax shelter partnership 
interests. This amendment requires that limited and other 
passive partners report any negative adjusted cost base in their 
partnership interest as a capital gain.
<P>
	The eighth amendment is the divisive corporate 
reorganizations, which curtails the tax avoidance technique that 
allowed capital gains on the disposition of corporate assets to be 
avoided in certain circumstances.
<P>
	The ninth amendment is the investment tax credits. This 
reduces the rate at which the credit is calculated in respect of 
certain regions. It eliminates the regional component of the 
credit in respect of scientific research and experimental 
development and it discontinues the special investment tax 
credit.
<P>
	The tenth amendment is the expenditure limit for scientific 
research and experimental development, which prorates the 
expenditure limit for a Canadian controlled private corporation 
based on the corporation's business limit for the year.
<P>
	The eleventh amendment is the small business deduction 
which progressively reduces the small business deduction 
available to Canadian controlled private corporations having a 
taxable capital over $10 million employed in Canada, so the 
deduction is eliminated at the $15 million level.
<P>
	Finally, the twelfth amendment is the mine reclamation fund, 
which permits a tax deduction for contributions into these funds 
in the year in which the contributions are made.
<P>
	This represents a major list of amendments to the Income Tax 
Act. It will add approximately another 106 pages of rules and 
regulations to the act.
<P>
	I support all of these amendments to Bill C-59, but I have to 
say this is yet another reminder that the the Income Tax Act 
continues to be complex. In spite of our best efforts I really do 
not believe we are heading in the right direction when it comes 
to income tax reform.
<P>
	I hope all members of Parliament will support us as we put 
this series of amendments through the House of Commons 
because the basic principle behind these amendments is to 
increase economic activity.
<P>
	We have targeted enhanced support for our small business 
community, which I know all members of the House support. We 
have made sure that the homebuyers plan is given added 
rejuvenation. We have been extremely sensitive to senior 
citizens at the lower part of the income threshold. These are all 
efforts to make sure there is fairness and equity, but I believe 
passionately it is not enough.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	We are not going far enough in our income tax reform. In 
order to get our Income Tax Act on track we have to go back to 
1948. Last week I asked one of the pages to get me a copy of the 
1948 Income Tax Act of Canada from the Library of Parliament. 
This document worked very well in those days and is 
approximately 100 pages for the whole tax act of Canada. This 
was tax paradise.
<P>
	Over the years the tax act of Canada has been used to run 
every sector of the economy, just as these 10 amendments we are 
talking about today are affecting certain sectors of the economy. 
They are put in to move and stimulate positively those sectors of 
the economy.
<P>
	Over the years there have been so many amendments to the tax 
act, so many exceptions and exceptions to the exceptions that 
the tax act is now almost 1,500 pages. As this act has evolved the 
situation is that even Canada's best tax lawyers and best tax 
accountants are saying the act is no longer comprehensible. The 
exceptions to a particular amendment which lead to another 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8556"> 8556 </A></B>
<P>
exception  create so much confusion that an inefficient system is 
being created.
<P>
	Did you know that right now before the courts of Canada there 
are 37,200-odd cases challenging the tax act of Canada? Just 
think of the cost to the judicial system. Talk about a make work 
program. This is a make work program in tax challenges alone 
for the lawyers, most of whom are subcontracted to the 
Department of Justice. A company which is assessed by the 
Department of National Revenue and wants to challenge it hires 
its own lawyer, but the Department of National Revenue calls up 
the Department of Justice. Justice in turn hires a lawyer to 
defend the crown.
<P>
	Right now the taxpayers of Canada are funding 37,000 cases 
before the courts. Just think of what that does to our judicial 
system, all because of the lack of clarity and the lack of 
efficiency in our tax act.
<P>
	Bill C-59 is a good bill. The specific amendments in it are 
designed to stimulate the economy and create jobs.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to say to my colleagues in 
the House of Commons that perhaps now is the time to look at 
comprehensive reform of our tax system. Perhaps now is the 
time to take up the challenge. We have taken up some great 
challenges in social security reform during the last few months 
and we will be doing so over the next two months. We have taken 
up incredible reform of our UI system and our retraining system. 
Why not take up the challenge of comprehensive tax reform?
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	Quite frankly when I was re-elected last year I hoped that the 
notion of comprehensive tax reform would hit the floor of the 
House of Commons quickly. I was hopeful for a couple of 
reasons.
<P>
	The government in its red book said it would look at tax 
reform. Of course, the finance committee is in the process of 
listening to all kinds of ideas which are being brought forward. 
As we prepare for the budget this is a perfect time to look at 
some alternatives to the tax regime we have right now. That was 
the number one reason I was optimistic for a shot at real 
comprehensive tax reform.
<P>
	The second reason I was optimistic was that I thought I would 
have some company in this whole notion of tax reform. That is 
because lo and behold over 50 members of Parliament were 
elected under the Reform Party flag and I can remember that one 
of its cornerstones of public policy during the campaign was 
comprehensive tax reform.
<P>
	I can remember campaigning in my riding in downtown 
Toronto against the Reform Party candidate, a terrific candidate. 
It is awful when someone forgets a person's name. Where is my 
friend Nick Lamacchia when I need him? He would always help 
me remember someone's name.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> If you do not get elected, you are a nobody; if you 
leave, you are a has been.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Nick, where are you 
when I need you?
<P>
	At any rate when we had public debates and it came to the 
issue of tax reform, the Reform Party candidate would stand up 
and say: ``When it comes to tax reform we support Mr. Mills' 
idea of a single tax system. We call ours the proportional tax but 
generally speaking we think he is heading in the right 
direction''. Actually the Reform Party member helped me get 
elected because some of the things that my constituents perhaps 
did not like about me were offset by the fact that the Reform 
Party candidate helped me push forward on the single tax.
<P>
	Here we are one year later and we have not been able to spark 
an interest in comprehensive tax reform in this House of 
Commons. I want members to know that we are missing a great 
opportunity. You might ask: Why does the government not take 
it up on its own initiative? It does not work like that around here. 
As members know, the essence of a democracy is good solid 
debate. There has to be a to and fro. A good opposition has the 
ability to move an agenda item from the back burner to the front 
burner.
<P>
	On the issue of tax reform the opposition has done a lousy job 
and that is in spite of my giving them a good push every now and 
again. At any rate, I want to say to the people of Canada that I 
passionately believe the single biggest thing we could do to 
spark economic activity in this country is to act on 
comprehensive tax reform.
<P>
	I say that because we as a government are counting on the 
small and medium size businesses to recharge and reignite this 
economy. I hear constantly as I am sure other members do from 
those same small and medium size businesses that the paper 
burden relating to the income tax system, the complexity of it, 
and the unfairness of it on the corporate and personal side make 
it a disincentive to productivity. It is a disincentive to risk 
taking. It is a disincentive to taking that extra shot.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	I believe that. In fact a lot of entrepreneurs who have achieved 
success are not only frustrated by the tax act of Canada but many 
of our superachiever entrepreneurs are currently being taxed at a 
rate of 58 per cent rate when the federal and provincial taxes are 
combined. Many of them are starting to do two things. Some of 
them are parking their resources, their investments and their 
cash offshore. The second thing is some are starting to move 
themselves offshore. They are not just moving their cash but 
some of them are actually taking their talent and walking into 
better tax regimes.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8557"> 8557 </A></B>
<P>
	When we have a bill like C-59 with all of its pluses and 
advantages in moving and improving the tax act it gives us the 
opportunity to look at the big picture over the next eight to ten 
years.
<P>
	If Canada does not have a globally competitive tax system we 
are going to see talent and capital fly out of this country at a rate 
we cannot imagine. When capital flies out interest rates go up. It 
is like any other commodity. A store that has only a few pieces of 
chicken or a few potatoes can demand a higher price. Capital is 
no different.
<P>
	When capital is not in the marketplace or if there is restricted 
amounts of capital, interest rates go up. That causes a 
tremendous strain on our ability to service our deficit and our 
debt. It is a tremendous burden. It is tough for our entrepreneurs. 
When they go to the bankers and try to rent money from them, 
those rates are higher as well.
<P>
	If Canada had a globally competitive tax regime, if we had 
something like the single tax system where-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I know that the 
member for Broadview-Greenwood, the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Industry, is one who can express 
himself very well and certainly is not in any need of props or 
anything else to substantiate his arguments on any piece of 
legislation or debate. I would ask him to keep that in mind.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank 
you for your generous remarks but after five years of trying to 
advance the debate on tax reform in a comprehensive way 
sometimes I wonder what you have to do. It is not just props; I 
think you even have to go beyond props.
<P>
	At any rate the point I wanted to make was about Canada 
having a single tax system. On both the personal and corporate 
sides the rate would be around 20 per cent. On the personal side 
there would be very generous deductions to make sure those 
people at the lower income spectrum were protected. If we had a 
progressive single tax system like that I believe capital would 
flow into this country in a way we could not imagine. Canada 
would be the home for capital from all over the world.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	It is not unlike the grocery store: if there is a sudden glut of 
potatoes or of chicken the price goes down. It is not different 
with capital. If the capital were suddenly parked here in large 
amounts it would put downward pressure on interest rates. This 
would mean it would be much easier for us to service our deficit 
and debt. More important, it would provide capital at an 
inexpensive price for those one million small and medium size 
entrepreneurs, those men and women who need to be fired up to 
get the economy going.
<P>
	I attended a townhall meeting with my colleague from Nepean 
last night at which we had a little session on small business and 
tax reform. One person in the crowd said: ``I don't like this kind 
of a system. I would like a two-tier system. If you make up to 
$60,000 you pay 20 per cent but once you get over $60,000 you 
pay 40 per cent''. I told him that I totally disagreed with that. I 
believe the harder we work the more we achieve, and the more 
we make the more we should have left in our pockets. We should 
and we have always rewarded productivity in Canada.
<P>
	I do not believe for a second in a system where people who 
make millions of dollars get off with paying nothing. I believe in 
an airtight system and the single tax system is an airtight 
system. It does not matter whether one is making $100,000, 
$500,000 or a million, it is 20 per cent; it is airtight. It is airtight 
on the corporate side as well. If we had a system like that in 
Canada we would do much to stimulate economic activity.
<P>
	There is something else we have to be concerned about. In the 
last three weeks our neighbours to the south have been talking 
about the issue nearly every day in Washington. There has been a 
change in the Congress of the United States. Most of the people 
who were elected three weeks ago in the United States are now 
starting to talk on almost a daily basis about a single tax system.
<P>
	That concerns me. If the United States adopts a single tax 
system before we do we would have a problem. It may be 
difficult to move money to the islands, to move money to 
Switzerland or to move a business to another part of South 
America or some part of eastern Europe, but it will be very easy 
for Canadians to cross the 49th parallel.
<P>
	I am standing here today in support of every one of the 
amendments in Bill C-59. They are targeted amendments. They 
are all related to generating economic activity. They are 
simplifying the tax system. I do not disagree with any part of the 
bill because it is taking us in a positive direction in a 
constructive way.
<P>
	My challenge to all members of the House of Commons is that 
it is good but it is tinkering. It is time to go the whole nine yards, 
clean up the whole system and start from scratch. If we did that 
all Canadians would cheer the House. We would have rebuilt 
trust and respect. More important than all those things or 
equally as important, we would ignite the entrepreneurial spirit 
of the country. Our ability to cope and handle our deficit and our 
debt would be much more focused and much easier to address.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	This will probably be one of the last days in this year that we 
have an opportunity to send out a message to all officials in the 
Department of Finance, to my colleague, the Minister of 
Finance, and to all my other colleagues.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> He will not listen to you.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8558"> 8558 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> No, that is not true. 
The Minister of Finance listens to us but he does not listen to 
just a few of us. He listens to all of us. In order to move an 
issue forward as comprehensive as this one it cannot be done 
by one, two, fifty or sixty members. We need one hundred and 
fifty members to move the issue forward.
<P>
	Our team presented the idea of a single tax system to the 
finance committee looking for GST alternatives about two 
months ago. Opposition members started questioning at the end 
of our presentation and the finance critic from the Bloc said: 
``We have no criticism of what you are trying to do but we might 
not agree with some of your credits''. He basically said: ``When 
we become an independent country this is the type of tax system 
we will have. Why would we begrudge it to the rest of Canada?''
<P>
	I felt that was a pretty straight comment from the Bloc. 
Obviously none of us in terms of the Reform and Liberals 
believe in wanting to destroy the country, but he was certainly 
direct about the type of tax system they would have. The Reform 
critic for finance was there and supportive, on side. However 
there is a missing factor in that equation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Excessive spending.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> No. The problem with 
trying to achieve tax reform is not the men and women of the 
Chamber. I believe most men and women who sit in the Chamber 
hear from constituents about problems and complaints in the tax 
act.
<P>
	The problem is Canadians complain day in and day out about 
the unfair, inefficient, complex tax system. I should not say 
never, because I have received about 100,000 letters from a 
community of about 12 million to 15 million taxpayers. I would 
say that 90 per cent of Canadians complain but they do not do 
enough. They do not get up to make phone calls or write letters 
to their MPs on whether they agree or disagree with the status 
quo or whether they have a better idea.
<P>
	I believe part of the reason we have tax inertia is that 
Canadians have not pressed enough of us hard enough. In spite 
of all that, I personally and passionately believe that if we were 
to take up this challenge and have a single tax system we would 
have the most exciting economy on the planet. It would be the 
fastest way to deal with deficit and debt. In the next budget I 
hope we can get a reference for this system.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
before proceeding with my speech, allow me to express my 
scepticism regarding the remarks made by the parliamentary 
secretary who mentioned the openness of the finance minister 
and of his government vis-à-vis the consultation process. 
Supposedly, they are listening not only to MPs, but also to all 
citizens. This process is a farce; next week we are going to listen 
to witnesses, while the report has already been written. What 
kind of  influence are these people going to have? The 
committee must return to Toronto, at the insistence of the 
Liberal members in the area, to hear more witnesses who did 
not, or will not, have any impact on the consultations. This is 
somewhat less than transparent.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	Let us go back to Bill C-59, which could be described as one 
of the pieces of legislation resulting from the Liberal 
government's first budget. This bill includes 12 specific 
measures, which are only some of the legislative measures 
resulting from the last budget. Some are good, others much less 
so. Some will need to be clarified when the clauses of the bill are 
reviewed by the committee.
<P>
	Indeed, this bill was, and still is, the first financial test for the 
Liberal government. Let us say that, in certain respects, it is 
very timid. Since coming to power, the Liberal Party may not 
have had that much time to influence the budget process, a 
reason which is often given to justify the fact that the budget 
does not reflect what the Liberals wanted. This is strange 
because they came to power in October. We were all elected 
then. They claim they did not have enough time, so they tried to 
postpone the pre-budget consultations which are supposed to 
end in mid-December. There is something wrong there.
<P>
	Let us now move on quickly to the measures themselves. We 
will come back in more detail on some of them later. The Bloc 
Quebecois agrees with certain of them. Being more positive than 
negative by nature, I will start with the ones we agree with, 
although we will need clarification on some in committee. The 
first one, of course, is the cancellation of the capital gains 
exemption on the first $100,000. I will come back to this 
measure because it has to be put into context to see what 
happened with capital gains exemptions.
<P>
	There is also the Home Buyers' Plan, which allows first-time 
home buyers to use their RRSPs for financing, which is made 
permanent. This is a good measure. There was much pressure on 
the Conservative Party at the time, and on the Liberal Party 
when it came to power, to make it permanent. This has now been 
done and it is a positive step.
<P>
	Tax credits for charitable donations. The first $250 used to be 
deductible at 17 per cent and any amount in excess, at 29 per 
cent. Now, the limit has been brought down to $200. That is to 
say that amounts in excess of $200 will be deductible at 29 per 
cent. There is now an extra $50 that is becoming deductible at 29 
per cent. In itself, this is a positive measure. It is not the reform 
of the century, but we, from the Bloc, recognize the contribution 
of charitable organizations and other organizations that benefit 
from this funding. That is why we support this measure.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8559"> 8559 </A></B>
<P>
	There are also a number of technical provisions to close 
certain fiscal loopholes. I am thinking about company 
reorganization, tax shelters in the form of partnership interests 
and the small business deduction in particular. Let us just say 
that there are three measures to close technical loopholes. I will 
not get into the detail, as this can be done in committee, but 
this is not the tax reform of the century. It is certainly not the 
reform the parliamentary secretary would like to see and he is 
seeking public support to improve on it. Having participated 
in the consultation process myself, I can tell the hon. 
parliamentary secretary that public support is a subject that was 
brought up very regularly by various people.
<P>
	One of the reasons why we end up with outstanding 
accounts-if you add up the GST, accounts in dispute and 
outstanding accounts per se, as they appear on the books, it is in 
excess of $9 billion-is that somehow individuals do not abide 
by the applicable part of the social contract, in terms of how 
revenue is to be collected. So, the system will have to be 
changed, so that the public can get the right idea. In some cases, 
public perceptions are quite accurate, but in others, perhaps if 
we could clarify and simplify things, people could change their 
minds about certain commonly-held beliefs. But in order to do 
that, we must lay our cards on the table and not be afraid of being 
truly transparent.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	Another measure dealing with mine reclamation funds 
permits a tax deduction for contributions to these funds in the 
year in which the contributions are made. This will benefit these 
businesses, particularly those which had trouble taking 
advantage of these measures when closing or confirming their 
operations.
<P>
	This bill contains a number of positive measures. I will 
review two of them, which can be described as being positive 
but requiring closer scrutiny. One is the capital gains exemption. 
A few years ago, this exemption was set at $500,000. The first 
$500,000 in capital gains was not taxable. To help people 
understand capital gains, I will give an example: Someone could 
buy, not a principal residence which does not qualify, but a 
secondary residence, a cottage, for $20,000. When he sells it 
later for $50,000, he makes a $30,000 capital gain which 
becomes taxable income. However, the first $500,000 in capital 
gains is tax-free. At least, it used to be $500,000.
<P>
	The first reform reduced this exemption to $100,000. Now 
they want to eliminate it, arguing that it only benefits the rich. 
This statement, however, requires careful scrutiny. If this 
measure benefits the rich, it also benefits the future. Some of 
those who used this capital gains exemption are not affected 
because they have already exceeded the limit. Many people 
benefited.
<P>
	When we say that our financial situation is difficult and that 
the country is in debt because of our social programs, we should 
take an occasional look at the cost of tax expenditures. If this 
approach is not valid today,  why was it in the past? Of course, 
we can say at some point that we must provide the tools needed 
to stimulate investment, to encourage people to invest in 
economic development, with appropriate tax incentives. 
Although investments are still needed today, we say: ``No, this 
measure benefits the rich. It took us a while, but we have finally 
realized it''. In reality, this penalizes young people like myself, 
people of my generation. Those who would have benefited in the 
future will be denied this advantage. This is a sacrifice we are 
willing to make in the fight against the deficit. Although we are 
willing to make this sacrifice, I find it very difficult to believe 
that it penalizes today's rich people.
<P>
	We now must work on this in committee and I can say right 
now to Liberal Party members: Older people seem to have a 
problem with this measure this year. The finance minister's 
budget provides an election in respect of gains accrued before 
February 22, which authorizes tax-selling throughout the year. 
To go back to the example I gave earlier, suppose I now have a 
cottage worth $50,000, which I bought for $20,000. I could 
resell it to myself for $50,000. If I sell it for $80,000 in 15 years, 
the only taxable portion will not be $80,000 minus $20,000, or 
$60,000, but $80,000 minus $50,000, or $30,000, which is the 
increase in value between February 22, 1994 and the date of the 
sale. 	So this year everyone can sell their tax benefits to take advantage of the exemption for the last time. They must do so before the end of this fiscal year.
<P>
	Take a senior who collects an old age pension or the income 
supplement. He must declare it on his tax return under capital 
gains so his net income which is used to calculate the amount of 
his pension is artificially increased this year, even though he did 
not collect it as income. As a result, he might lose some pension 
or income supplement. There is a problem, because some 
seniors are being penalized. We would have to know who is 
being penalized. We will need the information. How much 
money is involved and why was a mechanism not provided so 
that people are not discriminated against on the basis of age? 
Someone who is 64 is not affected, but someone who is 65 or 
older and makes a capital gain may find his pension or income 
security affected.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	This needs to be looked at carefully. I say that some 
amendments should certainly be possible. I talked to some 
accounting offices and they told me that it happens in many 
cases. Sometimes people take a while to react and now, thanks to 
the vigilance of some people, we are starting to realize that 
things are not quite right and that something is not working as it 
should. We must ask the government whether it intends to 
penalize seniors or if it is ready to develop some way so that they 
can avoid being penalized.
<P>
	I comment now on another measure, the tax credit for 
charitable organizations. Since the government wants to 
implement a social program reform which will hit hard,  there is 
good reason to consider providing additional support, so that 
these groups 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8560"> 8560 </A></B>
<P>
would somehow have the option of finding their own sources of 
income. Many officials representing community groups, 
agencies, charitable institutions and philanthropic 
organizations told us that this was an avenue to pursue, adding 
that an evaluation should be made of how much it costs the 
government to either give funding to organizations, or 
encourage them more strongly to raise funds. Then the 
government's participation, from a fiscal point of view, should 
be looked at.
<P>
	This is an avenue which must be pursued thoroughly, and the 
minister should conduct such an analysis before going ahead 
with in a social program reform which will adversely affect 
these groups.
<P>
	The few measures proposed to close some loopholes are 
symbolic of the will of this government to eliminate all existing 
loopholes in the taxation system. We keep raising the issue of 
family trusts, which is still being examined by a committee. 
More people than ever before feel that there is a lot of money 
involved. It is very difficult to get information. In fact, it is 
almost impossible. But the government does not seem interested 
in getting that information.
<P>
	The government will consult on just about anything, but it 
cannot provide the required information to form an opinion on 
this issue. Eliminating family trusts might be much more 
profitable for the government than implementing the few 
proposed measures. These measures must be taken too, but there 
are initiatives which would help restore public confidence.
<P>
	People say that there is a problem with family trusts. When it 
comes to RRSPs, the government says: What we want to do is 
take a chunk of your future income now, either by taxing RRSPs 
or by lowering the maximum to which you can contribute. It is 
essentially telling people that they will have to pay taxes 
immediately instead of when they cash in their RRSPs. 
However, the government does not follow the same reasoning 
when it comes to capital gains in family trusts. Indeed, it may 
take up to 80 years before such gains are taxed.
<P>
	I do not see any logic there. The time has come to target the 
general public-and it is true that this is the most profitable 
move, because it affects the largest number of people-but the 
middle-class is tired of always being the scapegoat, while those 
who earn the most are left alone.
<P>
	I watched the Minister of Finance last week, when he was the 
guest on Jean-Luc Mongrain's program. There was a pyramid of 
small blocks representing social classes. Mr. Mongrain asked 
the minister: Where are you going to cut? The minister was 
hesitant in choosing a block, thinking: I cannot really go for the 
middle one, because all the other blocks will fall and it would 
not look good. He was reluctant to take the block at the top. And 
when he realized what he had to do, Mr. Mongrain asked him: 
``Why not take the top one?'' He took it without any  hesitation 
and said: ``I will take them first''. Surprise, surprise! Everybody 
saw him hesitate when he went for the block in the middle, 
representing the middle class. That was an object lesson people 
will remember.
<P>
	There is another aspect to this and I am referring to butterfly 
companies and tax shelters. This was partly addressed in the last 
budget. The government should listen a little more to the 
Auditor General instead of just paying him to publish his annual 
report!
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	The government has invested $50 million in the Auditor 
General's activities, so we might as well make sure this money 
is made more productive. I am not saying they are not doing a 
good job, but the government has to use the information they 
provide. There are still many so-called problem countries listed 
because of the opportunities they provide for tax evasion as a 
result of a lack of reciprocity between their tax systems and 
ours. There are still 16 countries on this list, and in some cases 
an investigation followed by corrective action would be 
necessary.
<P>
	It gets very complicated when you want to go after the top 
blocks. When you want to get at the top of the pyramid, it is not 
easy, and the government never seems to have the best tax 
experts. They are all in the private sector, and they know how to 
use the tax system to make money. So I do not believe that is the 
answer.
<P>
	We have resources here to be able to evaluate all this. People 
know that but of course there is a very strong lobby, and 
lobbying expenses are tax deductible, would you believe. They 
did not talk about that either. They may talk about cutting the 
amount you can deduct for charitable donations, things like that, 
but never a word about lobbyists. Perish the thought!
<P>
	I was talking about the measures we support and that there is 
room for improvement. I will now talk about the measures we 
oppose, because we will vote against this bill since it contains 
measures that would not appear and, in fact, are not in order. 
Those of my colleagues who will speak on this bill will have a 
chance to come back to this issue, however, the government 
singled out the age credit and I will devote a small part of my 
speech to that.
<P>
	Although we did not estimate its impact precisely, we have 
some questions about the reduced deduction for meals and 
entertainment. We are not necessarily dead set against it, but we 
would like to evaluate its impact, and we will be able to do that 
in committee, since there is some time left before its 
implementation.
<P>
	Then there are the investment tax credits. The notion of 
regional development seems to have been dropped. The region is 
Canada as a whole. I will come back to this to explain what 
happened. Technically speaking, it is rather complex, but things 
have happened. There again there is a lack of imagination. 
Revenue has to be raised but during election campaigns candi-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8561"> 8561 </A></B>
<P>
dates always say, and the Prime Minister was no exception: ``We 
will not raise taxes, at least not in the first two years''.
<P>
	Yet, we tax employee benefits like employer-provided life 
insurance. Previously the first $25,000 of coverage were tax 
free, this will no longer be the case. Why is the government 
afraid of saying that it is a new way to get more money? Because 
it would not be able to claim that it did not raise taxes. However, 
taxpayers realize that as the years go by, there is less money left 
in their pockets.
<P>
	They are told: ``No, we did not raise taxes''. They think: 
``This does not make sense! The government finds all kinds of 
tricks to come and take our money''. Then, people start getting 
mistrustful, and they think: ``It is my turn now to get even and 
find ways to avoid giving money to the government''.
<P>
	Therefore they deal under the table, they pay cash and avoid 
paying taxes. Merchants, too, get on the bandwagon, for they are 
also consumers. Many small merchants, who belong to the 
middle class, are just as frustrated as consumers; they 
understand their fellow consumers and they do the same thing. 
This is how the underground economy was created. The finance 
minister does not agree with his colleague, the revenue minister, 
on the size of the underground economy, nor do they agree on the 
importance of tightening the collection of unpaid taxes.
<P>
	For his part, the finance minister claims that efforts are 
needed, that it does not make sense, whereas the revenue 
minister tries to minimize the situation regarding unpaid taxes. 
With a sudden change of heart, Mr. Martin realizes that there is a 
good deal of money there, but he admits that there are few 
solutions for improving the situation.
<P>
	You know, we have seen it before. Year after year, it is the 
same thing. I recall especially the past three years, maybe 
because I am the youngest. I believe the next budget is going to 
be tough, it is going to hurt. This is what we see in the press 
every November or December. In January, the finance minister 
will say: ``I will not comment on individual measures, wait for 
my budget''. In February, we get a budget which is not all that 
tough and the deficit for the year is reasonable. The big deal this 
year is that the deficit is not higher.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	It will probably be around $38 or $39 billion, but some 
expenses are not recurring. This year, for instance, the 
Unemployment Insurance Fund has a surplus so that the deficit 
is two to three billion dollars less than last year. But this is not a 
reason to rejoice. We have skipped a turn, there was a 
non-budget or rather a budget without any effect. They believe 
that economic growth will solve the problem but we will need 
much more than that.
<P>
	I would now like to talk about the regional investment tax 
credit. I will try to be as simple as possible about all the 
technical aspects. There were three regional investment tax 
credits. There was the special investment tax credit; the 
investment tax credit in the Atlantic region and the investment 
tax credit for scientific research and experimental development, 
also in the Atlantic region. To tell you the truth, nothing is 
simple in the taxation system; there are numerous credits, and 
the fact that the federal government wants to take action of its 
own in regional development often results in that kind of 
situation.
<P>
	The first one, the special investment tax credit of 30 per cent 
is abolished. It was mainly used for buildings, machines and 
equipment.
<P>
	The second one, the investment tax credit in the Atlantic 
region, is reduced from 15 per cent to 10 per cent.
<P>
	The other one, the investment tax credit for scientific research 
and experimental development, which was 30 per cent in the 
Atlantic region and 20 per cent elsewhere, is reduced to 20 per 
cent across the board.
<P>
	We can see that regional investment tax credits are generally 
not considered as effective economic means to attract additional 
investments. After a while, we can see that they do not have the 
results expected.
<P>
	The real question to be asked is: Why? Why did it not have the 
expected results? Because there must be a direct incentive 
somewhere. Maybe if there were not always the same problem 
with two governments, each in its own way, trying to stimulate 
experimental development, especially aimed at small and 
medium size enterprises-because it is the thing to do 
nowadays, when you are a finance minister, to talk about small 
and medium size enterprises. They talk about it but they do not 
necessarily act on it. It always sounds good in their speeches. 
They talk about measures especially for them.
<P>
	When you look at the way things are, when you look at these 
people, who are born entrepreneurs, who came up with good 
ideas and were able to capitalize on it, you come to the same 
conclusion as many have, including the Standing Committee on 
Industry and other committees. These people have strong points, 
these are brave and enterprising people who are helping to build 
Canada and Quebec, but they also have some weaknesses, one of 
them is their lack of administrative expertise. This could explain 
why some projects have failed.
<P>
	These people are good businessmen and women, with good 
ideas, but we provide them with such complicated tools; 
depending on where they are located and what they do, with this 
type of tax credit, there are three possibilities- They become so 
disheartened that they start to think that, with all the time they 
are going to lose on these tax breaks, they might as well go back 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8562"> 8562 </A></B>
<P>
to their business and get some more work done. It would cost 
less and they would be able to save more money than they would 
have by using the tax credit.
<P>
	They are not entirely wrong, since consultant services in this 
area, whether we are talking about lawyers, tax specialists, or 
others can be costly. This may be why they are not widely used.
<P>
	With regard to regional development, here is what we say to 
the federal government: Instead of squandering your money, 
why not transfer these resources to the provinces which are 
probably in a better position to understand the specific needs of 
their regions. In turn, the provinces can allocate this money 
anyway they want to.
<P>
	For example, transfer the tax points and assess how much 
these credits are costing you. Tell yourself: We still want to help 
businesses, because we know there are future entrepreneurs out 
there and we want to help them work on their weaknesses, like 
their lack of interest in research and development, so we will 
provide them with the means to do so. Transfer the resources 
where they are needed. We are not talking here about 
transferring dozens of tax points, these are not major 
expenditures, but we will see what will happen.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	I am convinced, as many others are, that the closer a level of 
government is to people, the more it is able to understand the 
people's specific characteristics. We should stop managing 
everything from this level and we are certainly not doing so with 
this measure. What the government is doing once again is 
setting its own standards nation-wide, and it will continue. . . I 
am sure other tax credits will be created and soon the situation 
will be just as complex as what we have now.
<P>
	This year, the Auditor General was harsh in his judgment, 
especially on the issue of money. Even if our country lags 
behind in the area of research and development, the little we 
spend, we spend inadequately. And this comment applies to all 
areas. In almost all fields of activity, people say we are spending 
too much and they are convinced there is a better way to spend 
whatever amounts we do spend. Better spending practices alone 
would improve our performance in the area of economic 
development. But it is hard for such changes to get to the top, all 
the way to this place. Whether we are talking about the tax 
system or the transmission of information, it is always a 
problem for changes to reach the highest levels. The message 
does not always get there, in spite of numerous consultations.
<P>
	Another measure is the age tax credit. It certainly is striking. 
At one time, the present Minister of Human Resources 
Development was a member of the opposition. He was there 
during the Tory period. We all remember the Charlie Brown 
incident, when the Tories launched an attack on the old age 
pension. Just look at what he said in those days. He said this, 
about the budget, here in this House, on June 18, 1985: It is a fact 
that the government has reduced considerably, and in a 
backward way, the purchasing power of seniors. Not only are 
they being deprived of income assistance, but their purchasing  
power is also being reduced. And as if this was not enough, the 
government hits them again by cutting two billions-in dollars 
of 1985-in transfers to provinces, between now and 1990. 
Clearly, this budget is an attack on several fronts against 
seniors'incomes. Now, in their first budget, the Liberals reduce 
the age credit. Eight years later, they do exactly was they 
opposed back then.
<P>
	We sometimes have this impression of déjà vu. At one time or 
another, we all feel as though we have already lived a particular 
experience. Since the beginning of this new Parliament, we 
often have this feeling of being back to 1985, under a 
Conservative government. The Liberals conduct the same 
consultation exercises that they criticized before, and they do so 
regarding the same issues. They deal with problems in the same 
way as the Conservatives did, something which they would 
never have dared mention during the election campaign.
<P>
	Let me explain this age credit. People aged 65 and over can 
ask for a tax credit equivalent to 17 per cent of $3,500. This is a 
non refundable credit; in other words, it can only be applied to 
the tax payable. If there is excess tax to be paid, the credit cannot 
be refunded. That credit translates into a tax reduction of about 
$610 per year. From now on, seniors with a net income of over 
$25,921 will see this credit diminish progressively with every 
dollar over that amount. The credit will totally disappear when 
the income reaches $49,100. Is this the level to be found at the 
top of the pyramid the Minister of Finance was talking about 
during the TV interview he granted to Mr. Mongrain? Was that 
the top block, an income of $25,000 or $26,000 for the elderly?
<P>
	In the meantime, a new level of Old Age Security benefits is 
being added. The government clawbacks the old age pension it 
pays to people with incomes over $52,000. This level includes 
income from about $52,000 to $80,000. Now the government is 
proposing a new level for incomes between $25,000 and 
$49,000. Is this the basis for a new scale or, where old age 
pension is concerned, is the government trying to add new levels 
to the existing scale in order to reduce benefits? I think we have 
good reasons to be concerned. Very often, this is the way things 
happen. Once you have an in, it is easy to do whatever you want. 
Here, the government has set this new level and in the future we 
will most probably see the government adjust or recover 
pensions paid to elderly Canadians with a net income of over 
$25,000.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	Older Canadians are concerned and have trouble 
understanding why they are the first to be picked on in this 
budget. Over the next three years, the government will recover 
$500 million. In 1985, the Minister of Human Resources 
Development feared that the then government would clawback 
$2 billion over a period of five years. But now he is not 
concerned about the $500 million the government will 
recuperate over the next three years. The worst part is that what 
he was objecting to was partly implemented, therefore older 
people  already lost money. He 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8563"> 8563 </A></B>
<P>
thought that was indecent, but now that the government is asking 
for more he is in the Cabinet and he is going to do it.
<P>
	My colleagues will have a chance to elaborate on the issues 
regarding seniors, but I must say that senior citizens are more 
and more concerned. This is somewhat ironic, because members 
opposite, to fight Quebec sovereignty, go to retirement homes 
and talk to seniors, trying to scare them. They tell them that 
Quebec separation would endanger their well-being and they 
use the vilest substantives they can find. They blackmail them 
with their pensions, because the cheques they receive bear the 
logo and flag of the federal government.
<P>
	Yet, this same federal government is the first to pick here and 
there in their pockets. Yes, there is something to do collectively 
to fight the debt. While there might be some categories of senior 
citizens willing to do more, they do not want to be first because 
they do not seem themselves as different from other taxpayers. 
We should strike at the top of the pyramid, at those who 
benefitted from the capital gains exemption in the past. Today 
they are still alive, and probably rich. This is no coincidence.
<P>
	When we draw the pyramid, we realize that the top gets 
higher, but that the middle is slumping. We have a pyramid with 
an ever bigger base and an ever higher and narrower peak. The 
gap between rich and poor is widening.
<P>
	Of the 20 million taxpayers, 50 per cent have incomes of less 
than $20,000 and 60 per cent, below $25,000. At this level, there 
is not much hope of getting at the top of the pyramid, and by so 
doing perhaps make our society more equitable, high enough to 
dare demand that those who finance the major political parties 
do their share to solve the debt and deficit problem in general. It 
seems difficult to ask for such an effort.
<P>
	In conclusion, all committee members will look at these 
legislative measures in detail and report back at third reading in 
this House. This is a relatively timid and cautious budget, 
probably because the government ran out of time. People have 
high expectations for 1995; they expect us not only to reduce the 
deficit but to do it in a fair and equitable manner. Successfully 
meeting the debt challenge requires that everyone co-operate by 
fighting the temptation to evade taxes. To achieve this goal, 
people must know what the government's intentions are and feel 
that it is acting fairly and equitably. They are willing to give the 
Minister of Finance a chance because he is new at this and 
because this will be his first real budget this year.
<P>
	They may blame him for wasting a year. We lost two years 
because of the election; one year because after its leadership 
race, the Conservative Party did not dare table a budget. They 
decided to give some leeway to the new administration. Then the 
newcomers argued that they got there too late. As a result, we 
lost two more years in the fight against the deficit, two more 
years during which the debt grew by $40 billion. That is a lot of 
money. This  additional $80 billion is costing us between $5 
billion and $6 billion in interest charges alone.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	That is a lot of money, and I cannot help talking about an 
impending threat with respect to the next budget. Rumours to 
the effect that RRSPs will be affected continue to circulate. And 
there is no truth to the allegation that the Official Opposition is 
keeping it alive, contrary to what the hon. Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Finance maintained three or four 
weeks ago and, realizing it was not credible, stopped saying so, 
but now, someone is playing the parrot, taking an old quote and 
circulating the same rumour again.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance could very easily state, in any of the 
speeches he makes in his travels-because I am convinced that 
he gets media attention when he travels-that plans to put 
government finances in order, for next year, do not include 
taxing RRSPs. Because there is a problem. People who try to sell 
RRSPs, who are trying to get other people to contribute, are 
faced with the normal reaction of individuals telling them: 
``Sure, but there is much talk about RRSPs. Apparently, they are 
going to be taxed. We are going to have to pay tax on that 
money''. It does not sell well. Potential customers are sceptical.
<P>
	They may go for it, but it will probably be more difficult this 
year to sell RRSPs, and that constitutes saving. One of my 
colleagues, the hon. member for Rosemont, quoted statistics on 
consumer saving in Canada, showing the decline in saving. On 
one hand, we could be glad that people are consuming more and 
stimulating our economy, but on the other, we must be 
concerned because their ability to consume is increasingly 
limited.
<P>
	There is a problem, because our recovery could level off, 
especially with what is happening to economic growth in the 
United States, which is operating close to capacity, raising fears 
of inflation and all that this involves. So we need savings. 
Hitting savings would send a very bad signal. Not only is our 
future being mortgaged and our debt burden very high but today 
they want to take a bite out of our future income as well.
<P>
	I am very worried. I am trying to think what the situation will 
be for a finance minister in 15 or 20 years. He would be able to 
count on the income from retired people since they will be 
cashing in their RRSPs. Instead of collecting benefits, many will 
be taxpayers. If they are not encouraged to invest in their own 
retirement-and anyway, all they are doing is deferring income 
tax-what will happen in 15 or 20 years? Again, the room to 
manoeuvre will be limited.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8564"> 8564 </A></B>
<P>
	Let us solve the government's financial problem without 
touching RRSPs and within 15 or 20 years, we will have a much 
greater pool of revenue. I am concerned, but it also makes me 
smile, that in the finance minister's grey paper, it is listed as 
a tax expenditure, with a very awkward calculation, but 
basically it is deferred income. If someone puts money in an 
RRSP, it will be taxed when he takes it out.
<P>
	It is true that many taxpayers could find their RRSP taxed at a 
lower rate than it is today. That is the incentive for the 
government and that is a tax expenditure. The tax expenditure is 
not the amount which taxpayers can deduct this year: It is only 
the difference between what they would now pay in taxes and 
what they will pay when they cash in their RRSPs. This might be 
a sizable amount, but it is also the actual figure which the 
government should quote.
<P>
	However, the government uses a different approach. It would 
rather come up with huge figures and say: ``It costs us $15 
billion''. We are not only talking about RRSPs, but also about 
registered pension plans. The government says that it badly 
needs money and that it must get it somewhere. Then it is quick 
to add that it might be a good idea to look at this option, using 
the argument that rich people who put a lot of money in their 
RRSPs are benefitting more than others.
<P>
	But that is not necessarily the case. Indeed, when these very 
rich people cash in their RRSPs, chances are they will still be in 
the same tax bracket. Consequently, in their case, it is strictly a 
tax deferral.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	The government should tell it like it is. When it calculates tax 
expenditures, it should do so accurately.
<P>
	In conclusion, I want to point out that there are measures such 
as the use of RRSPs for the purposes of the Home Buyers' Plan. 
RRSPs could be a more effective tool for economic 
development, based on the argument that, maybe, people should 
invest more at the local level. Whether or not this is a good idea 
could give rise to a long debate.
<P>
	So, the government takes such measures but, at the same time, 
it is considering going after RRSPs. This is not good, and I hope 
that the Minister of Finance will have the courage to say: 
Enough is enough, RRSPs will not be touched this year. Just like 
he said he would not lower UI contributions.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois opposes the bill as a whole because it 
targets seniors. Some measures will have to be clarified in 
committee and, in any case, we will discuss it again at third 
reading. The real budget will be tabled next year and people will 
not be as tolerant as they were this year. That budget will have to 
bring results.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to address Bill C-59, an act to amend the Income Tax Act 
and the income tax application rules. This bill is nothing more 
than a 110-page sequel to the confusing, convoluted Income Tax 
Act which has become a 10,000 page script of income tax rules, 
regulations and subsections.
<P>
	I am beginning to think that the Income Tax Act is some sort 
of secret government IQ test. Like most sequels, Bill C-59 
serves up more of the same, showing no new ideas, no new twists 
and, for the most part, it would have been better if the writer had 
sat down and spent the time writing something new.
<P>
	With Bill C-59 the federal government eliminates the 
$100,000 lifetime capital gains exemption which will seriously 
impede the build-up of capital in Canada. This is at a time when 
most wealthy people have already used up their exemption, 
whether it was the $500,000 or the $100,000. It is nothing more 
than a tax on the middle class who are the very people the 
Liberals purport to represent.
<P>
	What the government should be doing is eliminating $5 
billion in direct subsidies to businesses and start privatizing 
some of the 380 crown corporations. Like the Conservatives, the 
Liberals have continued to pick the pockets of taxpayers.
<P>
	The biggest job that the Liberals are working on right now is 
figuring out how to get more money from the taxpayer without 
disturbing the voter. It boggles the mind to watch the 
government go after capital gains. It is considering taxing 
RRSPs and it is apparent that the Canada pension plan is in 
major trouble due to revenue shortfalls.
<P>
	The questions that beg to be asked by Canadian taxpayers are: 
What is in it for me? Where are the incentives? What benefit do 
we get from government spending? Can someone give us a 
break? The answer is no.
<P>
	The average benefit to taxpayers is about $20,000 per person 
while they are paying out about $22,000. In other words, they 
are getting less in benefits from the government than what they 
are paying in taxes. That is why people are very sensitive about 
paying taxes. We are at the high end of the tax scale. In fact, we 
are too far at the high end of the tax scale.
<P>
	For the Liberals it is the same old story. The answer to these 
questions and problems are very complex. They must be studied. 
They will need committees, subcommittees, task forces and of 
course, to quote the finance minister, input for effective output 
and we must square the circle to solve the problems facing 
Canadians.
<P>
	A planned economy is what the Liberals are targeting with 
infrastructure, a $2 billion expense; CIDA, Canadian Interna-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8565"> 8565 </A></B>
<P>
tional Development Agency, $2.2 billion, let us develop the 
other countries, let us help  them not Canada; direct grants and 
subsidies to businesses, $2 billion. Yes, a planned economy. 
That is when the politicians make the plans and the people make 
the economies.
<P>
	We have seen this movie before under directors Trudeau and 
Mulroney. Now we are going to add director Chrétien to the list. 
The only solution the current finance minister can come up with 
is to blame, first, the previous government for the inherited debt 
of $480 billion, as the Liberal government conveniently forgets 
that close to $200 billion of that was left by them when it left the 
House in 1983-84.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	Second, the finance minister blames the Bloc Quebecois, the 
separatist official opposition, which he claims is negatively 
influencing the investment community.
<P>
	Third and most recently, after a year in power he blames small 
and medium size businesses for not increasing productivity in 
the marketplace. It is their fault the economy went into a 
recession, according to the finance minister a couple of days ago 
in an interview with the <I>Financial Post</I>.
<P>
	What will be the fourth excuse? I do not know but it will not 
be addressing the real issue. I would like to tell Canadians that 
Reformers and the Reform Party are currently working on a 
different script, a new story that will have a better ending for all 
Canadians.
<P>
	If there is anything this bill proves it is the need for true tax 
reform. Listen to the 12 items the finance minister is trying to 
deal with: capital gains exemptions; employee benefits; age tax 
credits; homebuyers plan; charitable donations tax credit; 
business meals and entertainment expenses; tax shelters; 
partnership interests; divisive corporate reorganizations; 
investment tax credits; expenditure limit for scientific research 
and experimental development; small business deduction and 
mine reclamation funds.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Schmidt:</B> Mind boggling.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Yes, mind boggling.
<P>
	Although we support all of these measures with the exception 
of the capital gains elimination, it represents a whole bunch of 
tinkering with little gain for Canadian taxpayers and the 
government. It has spent a year doing nothing but politics as 
usual, as did the Conservatives. Canadians voted for change. 
They thought the Liberals would change the way we conduct 
business and they have changed very little.
<P>
	We need a new set of principles to set a new direction for 
federal taxation. The need for reform in matters of taxation is 
widely recognized. The federal government under Brian 
Mulroney raised taxes 33 times and implemented the GST plan 
in the face of widespread opposition.
<P>
	The Liberal government is now considering revisions that 
will inevitably prove to be even more unsatisfactory, a 
combination of the son of GST, called the NATVAT, or a surtax 
on income or both. Consumption taxes on top of income taxes 
are not the answer.
<P>
	Five fundamental principles should be applied to the 
Canadian system of taxation: first, all taxation programs of 
whatever kind should be for the exclusive purpose of raising 
revenue to fund authorized government spending and should not 
be for the purpose directly or indirectly to shape economic or 
social activity.
<P>
	Second, all taxation programs should be consistent with the 
governmental role of creating a framework. It can be square or 
round, whichever-we do not have to mess around, whether we 
square it or round it, or round it or square it-just do what is 
right so it widens people's choice and wherever possible leaves 
power and responsibility in the hands of the people.
<P>
	Third, tax legislation should be simple and easily understood 
by taxpayers, permitting most taxpayers to file their own 
returns.
<P>
	Fourth, taxation should be visible, that is, no hidden taxes.
<P>
	Fifth, rates of taxation should be limited and not punitive for 
both individuals and corporations. The incentive should be to 
reward production and leave more dollars in the hands of 
taxpayers and wage earners than the government. The only 
purpose of taxation should be to raise funds.
<P>
	However, we have become accustomed to a multiplicity of 
objectives in our taxation system. It tries to encourage domestic 
production, investment in certain industries, charitable 
donations and further education. It tries to discourage smoking, 
drinking, imports and pollution. Unfortunately it also ends up 
discouraging taxpayers.
<P>
	There will always be convincing arguments for making the 
taxation system more responsive to some other government 
initiative. Examples are taxes on petroleum products to protect 
the environment; taxes on alcohol or smoking to reinforce moral 
standards and healthier living.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	Once we give in to one of these arguments we leave ourselves 
open to making judgments based upon personalities, 
effectiveness of lobby pressure, political expediency and other 
human frailties.
<P>
	I believe the only purpose of taxation should be to raise funds 
needed to pay for government programs approved by the 
Canadian voters. I believe a proportional tax is the answer to 
creating a simpler, more efficient and more effective system of 
taxation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8566"> 8566 </A></B>
<P>
	The idea of a proportional tax is an attempt to improve upon 
the flat tax models that have circulated for many years to 
improve upon the single tax as proposed many years ago by the 
member for Broadview-Greenwood who is presently working 
on the single tax and trying to refine it, improve it and make 
it understandable to the government. Now that he is on the 
government side it would be hoped that members of the 
government would pay more attention to the proposal because 
it has a lot of advantages. There are a lot more advantages than 
disadvantages.
<P>
	Of course it has that one big weakness that governments do 
not like and that government bureaucracies do not like. It is too 
simple and because it is too simple it will not work. It has to be 
complicated, convoluted and confusing before governments 
will support it.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Isn't that a shame?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> That is a shame. Much has been made of 
simplifying the tax system. Successive governments have 
succeeded only in adding dramatic complications while 
explaining at the same time that they are simplifying it.
<P>
	The member for Broadview-Greenwood as he spoke to the 
bill today found himself saying-and it was the only part of the 
speech I did not like-that he supported the 12 measures and 
that it did improve the Income Tax Act. While it laid out a more 
level playing field in 11 areas, it distorted the capital gains area. 
It is easy to fall into that trap.
<P>
	We defend a bill by explaining that it simplifies things, yet we 
are adding to the problem. I do not know the cost in millions of 
dollars for this one bill alone, but it probably involved 
modifying different regulations, sections and subsections to get 
the 12 items changed in the Income Tax Act.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Schmidt:</B> It is 110 pages.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> No, the Income Tax Act is more than 110 pages.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Schmidt:</B> No, no. That is the addition.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> The addition is 110 pages. It is amazing. The vast 
majority of individual Canadians should be able to confidently 
prepare and file their personal income tax returns without the 
services of tax consultants. Tax consultants should be busy 
calculating taxes on profits, not companies going into 
receivership.
<P>
	Requirements of a simple and fair income tax system are one 
flat rate of tax, one personal exemption amount per individual, 
the same deductions for all individuals and corporations, and a 
clear understanding of the definition of income. A simplified tax 
system also allows lower income individuals to claim a personal 
exemption to avoid taxes on a basic living income. An 
individual's income is much easier to track than an individual's 
expenditures.
<P>
	I would suggest that a proportional tax on income is the most 
acceptable tax model for Canada. It is a flat tax model that 
would be ideal for provincial and municipal governments, 
although I am aware that the federal government cannot and 
should not force provinces and municipalities to adopt any 
particular tax policies.
<P>
	What I mean is that the government determines where it 
should spend the money, what programs Canadians want and 
need and how much is required to deliver services. In the 
process it has to be evaluated which government can better 
deliver a service. As some of the services are pushed down to 
lower levels of government and are within provincial 
jurisdiction, they are given the same points in taxation to raise 
the money for services because the federal government will no 
longer need them.
<P>
	That is how the system would work. That is how we could 
clean up the current Income Tax Act. That is what I mean by 
taking out income taxes as the driving vehicle for economic and 
social development and social policy.
<P>
	I call our version of the flat tax a proportional tax versus a flat 
tax or a single tax because it would be calculated in proportion to 
family size, income and therefore according to the ability to pay. 
I will explain that a little further on when I get into a sample of a 
single page tax return that I know members would look forward 
to filling out one day in the near future.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	There is considerable logic to adopting a taxation system that 
can be efficiently administered. The calculation of income 
would utilize generally accepted accounting principles without 
special rules specified by government.
<P>
	This proposal defines income to be productive income from 
employment, business and investments, including interest 
income, capital gains, pensions and dividends. It also allows 
immediate deduction of capital acquisitions in the year of 
purchase but would not tax capital gains on an individual's 
primary personal residence due to many economic variables 
over a long period of time.
<P>
	Let me review two tax forms that I believe would improve our 
international competitive advantage if we adopted them within 
two years. I am borrowing some of these points from the 
member for Broadview-Greenwood, but it is very critical at 
this point to get a handle on excessive spending by governments, 
have more efficient and effective spending by governments, 
determine which levels of government should be raising and 
spending that money for delivery of services to the people, 
determine which crown corporations should be privatized and 
which ones are better administered and run by the private sector 
versus the public sector. I cannot be told that all 380-plus crown 
corporations are better in the hands of government bureaucracy. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8567"> 8567 </A></B>
<P>
I recommend that over 90 per cent of them are better off in the 
hands of the private sector.
<P>
	Yes, there are some businesses and corporations that should 
be administered by the crown and we should retain them, but we 
should have a review of which crown corporations should stay in 
government hands and which ones should go to the private 
sector.
<P>
	By deciding which level of government should deliver a 
service we have removed the need to raise <I>x</I> amount of funds for 
the federal government. By privatizing we eliminate the need of 
direct subsidies to crown corporations and businesses of $2.2 
billion. That is another saving.
<P>
	Another aspect is the process of doing a government review of 
government programs. No standing committee that I know of 
reviewing the prior year's spendings on the main estimates 
talked about a sunset clause. We do not have a habit of doing that 
in the House.
<P>
	Very few programs expire on a certain date; they go on ad 
infinitum. In many cases cabinet ministers, ministers of the 
crown who are currently trying to do the job that they were 
elected to do a year ago, are in no way, shape or form in control 
of the purse strings. Money is being spent by administration, by 
the departments, that they only find out about if it hits the 
newspapers or if opposition parties point out the misspending of 
moneys. That just proves my point that we hold cabinet 
ministers accountable but in effect they are not the ones who are 
spending the money.
<P>
	This has to be fixed and we are trying to tell the government 
how to fix it. We are trying to point it out to the government, yet 
somehow it refuses to listen to us and ends up embarrassing 
itself. It knows full well that it is not in charge of these funds in 
all cases.
<P>
	Let us get back to the proportional tax system and what a flat 
tax would be like. It would be one page in length. It would be one 
side only. The other side would be blank so it could be folded 
and mailed like that. It would have employment income; 
investment income which includes interest, dividends, capital 
gains and rental income; and any other income which includes 
UI benefits, pensions, old age security payments, alimony, child 
support payments and foreign income. That would be all the 
areas of income that would be defined. The key principle under 
income is that a buck is a buck. All personal income generated in 
any form should be taxed with no special treatment for various 
forms of income.
<P>
	From this income would be deducted, for example, the 
personal exemption. Everybody would have a personal 
exemption of $12,000 to generate income; a spousal income of 
$6,000 less the spouse's income; a child care deduction of 
$5,000 up to age 7 and $3,000 between ages 7 and 14. RRSP 
contributions would be deductible but the maximum would be 
$6,000, not the current $13,500. That would tax higher income 
people. They would not be able to find loopholes to reduce their 
taxable income.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	This tax form is geared toward the middle income which 
comprises the majority of Canadians. This taxation system 
would help them. It is a taxation system geared to help people 
who make between $45,000 and $65,000 per year so they can 
raise families, look after their homes, look after their spouses 
and look after themselves.
<P>
	There would be an age deduction of about $2,000 for 65 years 
of age and over. If foreign income is declared, any foreign tax 
paid would be offset. Other mandatory deductions would be UIC 
premiums, CPP contributions and any alimony or child support 
payments.
<P>
	The deductions I have gone through on a personal tax form are 
at levels the middle class can afford. It would result in more tax 
being extracted from the wealthy than is now the case and would 
leave more disposable income in the hands of taxpayers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood)</B> What is your rate?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> I will get to my rate in a minute. Lower income 
earners would be basically exempted from paying tax and 
families would be granted a generous deduction to help them get 
by on one income.
<P>
	Leaving the dollars in the hands of the people who make them 
in the first place eliminates the need for the government to 
collect and redistribute the funds. There are handling costs both 
ways and the net result is that the person who is dishing it out 
and is making $18,000 a year and qualifies for some social 
assistance gets less back than what he or she had in the first 
place. Why not leave it there? That would help relieve some of 
the strain, stress and pressure on our welfare program. It would 
be a form of savings for the government as well.
<P>
	The purpose of the RRSP contribution being reduced to 
$6,000 from $13,500 would be to gear the program more toward 
middle income earners, thus not appearing to favour the 
wealthy. Spousal income up to $6,000 would be filed on one 
return. However any spousal income exceeding $6,000 would 
require a separate return with a $12,000 exemption allowance. It 
might be a little difficult for two people to fill out two forms but 
I do not think that is as difficult as the current tax form.
<P>
	Let me refer to the advantage of the deductions I have 
described. The child care deduction would help solve two of the 
biggest problems in our society today. We have the Suzanne 
Thibaudeau case wherein the recipient of child support 
payments said they were not enough money and she does not 
wish to pay tax on them, whereas the payer of the child support 
payments has a deduction. If we do not allow the deduction for 
the payer and do not tax the recipient, we will find that 
settlements will be less and the whole single family syndrome 
will be distorted.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8568"> 8568 </A></B>
<P>
	To help solve the problem, we would allow a reasonable 
amount for child care to be given to all families, to all wage 
earners, of $5,000 up to age 7 and $3,000 between ages 7 and 
14. If there is a divorce, and it happens in 50 per cent of the 
marriages these day, the recipient of child support payments 
would be allowed to offset that income. The deductibility would 
be back to normal. It would help solve a big headache for the 
finance minister.
<P>
	Members of the government have private members' bills that 
conflict with what the finance minister knows to be valid and 
true in terms of the taxation and deduction system. They are at 
odds and have a problem on their hands. I am offering them a 
constructive solution.
<P>
	That is what a proportional tax form would look like. Some 
people have asked me outside the House: ``How are we going to 
make investments? It is going to hurt the economy''. The rate 
charged in the proportional tax would be between a low of 15 per 
cent and a maximum of 20 per cent. It would be somewhere in 
that rage. It is a range right now because we have to determine 
what services the federal government will keep. What services 
is it going to look after? How much money is required for those 
programs? To raise that amount of money it can look at the gross 
incomes, look at the GDP and establish the rate.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	A corporate tax return would be just as simple. It would be one 
side of one page. The gross income would include GST or 
NATVAT or a combination, and all corporate income. The 
deductions from this would include GST or NATVAT paid and 
the cost of operations: goods, services and materials; wages, 
salaries and benefits; interest payments; and pension 
contributions. Another deduction would be dividends paid out 
for domestic shareholders only. This eliminates the current 
problem of double taxation on dividends.
<P>
	Another deduction would be capital investments at cost, no 
depreciation. That might surprise some people because a 
company might be generating $2 million in sales and qualifies 
for a loan at the bank and qualifies for a $4 million land and 
building. That would be deductible against the $2 million 
income and would create a loss. That loss would be carried 
forward until the profits chewed it up. I believe we should only 
tax income once and the recipient of that $4 million would be 
paying the income tax.
<P>
	The total deductions would be subtracted from the income and 
the answer multiplied by the rate of 15 per cent or 20 per cent. I 
recommend not to go higher than 20 per cent and not to go lower 
than 15 per cent. A system like this is simple. It is 
understandable. It is equitable and would be a lot more efficient.
<P>
	The fundamental approach to corporate income is to ensure 
that income is only taxed once, as I mentioned before. If we 
apply this principle to the current GDP of $750 billion this could 
generate a 15 per cent tax rate. Assuming that income is only 
taxed once that goes through the economy and would generate 
$112 billion. At a 20 per cent tax rate it would generate $150 
billion.
<P>
	We could almost have a balanced budget. If the government 
spends around $160 billion including the interest on the debt to 
raise $150 billion out of a taxation system at a 20 per cent rate 
and leaves disposable income in the hands of those earning it, 
the corporations and individuals, they would be making their 
investments with after tax dollars.
<P>
	There would be no need to have tax driven deals and tax 
driven models. Accountants and tax lawyers would not be 
figuring out ways to create loopholes for the following two years 
which have to be shut off. That cycle would end.
<P>
	People who take care of their basic needs, their food, shelter 
and clothing and make over, say it is $25,000 or $45,000 
whatever the amount is, might have a few thousand dollars to 
invest. They would invest after tax dollars. They would give it to 
a corporation. It could be a mining company trying to raise 
money, an oil or gas company trying to raise money, or a 
manufacturing company trying to raise money.
<P>
	That company would invest the seed capital, generate its 
product or services and would make a profit. The company 
would pay out dividends to the shareholders. The company 
would get a deduction and the recipients would pay the tax. It all 
works. You do not need tax driven investment in this society.
<P>
	If we just get our mindset into an acceptable mode for a 
paradigm shift then we could make progress. The problem is that 
not enough people in this country are ready for the change. I will 
echo what I heard earlier from a government member on this 
issue. Until people say they want change, until Canadians 
recognize that change is attainable and there is an alternate 
solution to this dreaded Income Tax Act and the income tax that 
continues to rise and confuse people, until they accept the need 
and demand change, nothing will happen.
<P>
	I encourage all those who hear this debate to write their 
members of Parliament or the finance minister with a copy to 
their members of Parliament. Demand a response to the 
question: Mr. Finance Minister, why will a flat tax not work? If 
he has no answer, then ask him to check with the member for 
Calgary Centre. I will provide him with some talking points.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	I want to speak about the provinces again for a second. The 
current provincial tax rate would apply on the federal tax 
payable as it is now.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8569"> 8569 </A></B>
<P>
	With corporations paying for tax this could mean more 
revenue. We always hear from the Bloc members and some 
government members that corporations do not pay their fair 
share, that we have to tax corporations more, individuals at 
their maximum, but we have to go after corporations.
<P>
	Corporations would be glad to pay 15 to 20 per cent. 
Individuals would not be glad but they would be willing to pay 
15 to 20 per cent. Then we would get rid of a good portion of that 
underground economy which people know can vary from as low 
as $18 billion to $100 billion depending on the economists and 
their mood for that day. If we brought this income out into the 
open we would make gains.
<P>
	The GST or the NATVAT, or a combination of the GST and 
NATVAT, and a surtax on income, whatever the finance minister 
finally does in a year, I am sure it will be the NATVAT. If it is not 
the Deputy Prime Minister will have to resign. She made a 
commitment during the election campaign to resign if the 
government did not scrap the GST. I am going to hold her to that. 
I will remind her of that as we get closer and closer to January 1, 
1996 which according to the red book is the date by which it will 
have eliminated or scrapped the GST.
<P>
	With a combination of solid revenues and reduction in 
government operations and expenses the result would be an 
impressive surplus to go toward debt retirement. Then we could 
lower taxes further if we wanted to. We could go to 10 per cent or 
12 per cent. The Japanese currently have a single rate of 17 per 
cent.
<P>
	This system would be simple, understandable, equitable and 
efficient. It would eliminate the need for convoluted tax bills 
like Bill C-59. The government would not have to tinker with all 
these social programs, the economic and business driven 
programs. It would supply programs to the Canadian public, 
determine the cost and raise the money to pay for them. It is 
done and they are not tax driven.
<P>
	Tax reform of this magnitude cannot take place without a 
renewed commitment by the federal government to cut spending 
and balance the budget. There are two sides to this issue. As the 
song goes, you can't have one without the other. Thank goodness 
that at least now after a year of our harassing the Liberal 
government is listening to Reform and the finance minister is 
planning cuts of $9.5 billion over the next two years.
<P>
	I am pleased we are making some progress. I am pleased our 
pressure is working because it is important. It is not important 
for us to make political gains. It is important for us in terms of 
being Canadian citizens that we are doing something in this 
House for the good of all Canadians.
<P>
	Canadians have been unequivocal in expressing their 
opposition to further tax increases. Here is a solution that lowers 
taxes. We in the Reform Party have heard the message.
<P>
	The bottom line for the Reform Party is that the next federal 
budget must not increase the total tax burden on Canadians. 
However I have a hunch the finance minister will be forced to 
find ways and means by tinkering around and probing, a little 
thing here, a little thing there and will increase the overall tax 
burden on Canadians.
<P>
	The Reform Party does not object to the principle of 
eliminating inequities in the existing tax system. That is why we 
support 11 out of the 12 elements of this bill. It does level the 
playing field. It does make necessary modifications. With the 
exception of the elimination of the $100,000 capital gains, we 
would be in favour of the other items.
<P>
	We believe the solution to our structural deficit problem must 
be found on the expenditure side rather than the revenue side. 
Elimination of the deficit in three years requires substantial 
measures. It is not the reduction of the deficit to 3 per cent of 
GDP, it is the elimination of the deficit that will help us out of 
this mess.
<P>
	The Liberal government did a good study. It found that in 
Europe the Maastricht treaty recommended that those 
economies should target themselves to 3 per cent of GDP. What 
it did not tell the Canadian public I am going to tell them right 
now. In the economies in Europe the 3 per cent of GDP in the 
Maastricht treaty applies to all levels of government.
<P>
	Here in Canada if the Liberal government's intention was to 
copy what is being done in Europe, then we would have to look 
at the size of the provincial debts. They add another $250 billion 
collectively. The reduction and the target for the deficit as a 
ratio to GDP should be 4.5 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1655 ) </B>
<P>
	That is why we say that 3 per cent is not enough and not fast 
enough. It is the elimination of the deficit that is important so 
that this wonderful country, this beautiful home we live in can 
finally have a mortgage. We could finally take that debt, equate 
it to a mortgage on a home and remortgage our home over a 30 
year period. We could start to pay off the principle and not just 
borrow money to pay the interest.
<P>
	Assuming a deficit of approximately $40 billion based on the 
finance department's total 1994-95 deficit forecast and revenue 
growth in the range of $14 billion to $18 billion based on the 
finance minister's grey book scenario, it becomes apparent that 
government expenditures must be reduced by $22 billion to $26 
billion over a three year period.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8570"> 8570 </A></B>
<P>
	Deficit cutting is an exercise in setting priorities. We have 
pointed these out. Many members in the Liberal Party laugh 
at us and mock us, but we are serious. I stand before the Liberal 
Party today in all seriousness and suggest that the people at the 
top of government must be the first to make significant and 
visible sacrifices before introducing cuts to government 
spending.
<P>
	Many members of the Reform Party have done so and many 
members of this party will continue to do so. It is not to belittle 
nor to embarrass any member in this House. All members should 
be free to do what they want to do, but I am of the position that 
we are going to show leadership by example. If we expect the 
Canadian public to recognize that cuts are necessary, then we as 
politicians should be prepared to make sacrifices as well.
<P>
	Duplication and overlap between federal and provincial 
governments must be reduced. That is why we have to 
decentralize and evaluate both levels of government. Based on 
these principles for instance if we applied this decentralization 
theory and eliminated the duplication of services, $3.5 billion to 
$6 billion could be saved, if the interprovincial barriers to trade 
were also addressed. These are serious numbers and they are 
worth considering.
<P>
	The overhead costs of government could be reduced as a part 
of a comprehensive restraint program. A 15 per cent reduction 
would save $1 billion. At home if we had to reduce our budget by 
8 per cent we could do it. That is all the Reform Party is 
suggesting, 8 per cent in one year. With the increased disposable 
income that this new proportional tax would present, more 
money would be in the taxpayers' hands. That money in the 
hands of the wage earners is more productive than in the hands 
of a politician or a bureaucrat.
<P>
	The federal government should not subsidize business or 
special interest groups. There is a savings there of $2 billion.
<P>
	Social policy review is important. After all the studies are 
done it will get back in this House and we will look at it 
seriously. This area is 67 per cent of the current federal budget. 
Over a three year period there have to be cuts in the 
neighbourhood of $12 billion to $18 billion or the Liberal 
government will not reach its deficit targets.
<P>
	The advantage of deficit elimination includes lower taxes for 
Canadians which leaves them with more disposable income. 
That will continue to fuel the economy. We would be able to 
remortgage our debt over a 30 year period. We could introduce a 
new taxation system as outlined in the proportional tax or work 
with the Liberal government on a single tax system if we were 
forced to. One way or another, I believe that together we could 
come up with a tax system that would put us ahead and on the 
leading edge of economic development and growth. We would 
be ahead of rather than always following the United States.
<P>
	In conclusion, Canadian taxpayers have already made it clear 
that they want politicians with the guts and the vision to lead the 
way with changes that will benefit them and their children, no 
matter how difficult those changes may be. We have the guts on 
this side of the House to recommend where we should cut 
excessive spending. We also have the guts to put forth some tax 
reform ideas.
<P>
	It is a shame that government members are nothing more than 
Conservatives in red clothing. It is a shame they have only 
succeeded in adopting Conservative bills for a year. It is a shame 
that in one year they have spent $40 billion more than they have 
generated, just like the Tories. They host $1,000 a plate 
fundraising dinners for their Prime Minister, just like the Tories. 
They make patronage appointments, just like the Tories. In three 
years I predict that if the Liberal government does not listen to 
this party, the Liberal government will fall, just like the Tories.

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the question to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment is as follows: the hon. 
member for Jonquière-Native Peoples.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I have received notice from the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell that he is unable to move his 
motion during private members' hour on Friday, December 2, 
1994.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Since it was not possible to arrange an exchange of positions 
in the order of precedence pursuant to Standing Order 9(2)(<I>a</I>), I 
will ask the clerk to drop this order to the bottom of the order of 
precedence.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Pursuant to Standing Order 94(2)(b), private members' hour 
will thus be suspended and the House will continue with the 
business before it prior to private members' hour.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I cannot move that private 
members' ballot item tomorrow. It has something to do with 
Safe Driving Week, and I will leave it at that.
<P>
	Pursuant to Standing Order 43(2), I wish to indicate that the 
Liberal members will be sharing their time for the rest of this 
day's debate.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have listened to the Reform Party speak. I would 
like some clarification. The hon. member has talked a lot about 
support, that the Reform Party is collectively supporting a flat 
tax idea. I would like him to explain the rationale for that briefly 
if he could.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8571"> 8571 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I want to remind the 
member that we have now gone from the first three 
interventions of 40-minute debate without questions or 
comments to a new stage. Resuming debate.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Chamberlain:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be pleased to give my 
speech.
<P>
	I am pleased to participate in this debate on Bill C-59, an act 
to amend the Income Tax Act and the income tax application 
rules. Last February the Minister of Finance told this House that 
he was restoring fiscal sanity to government.
<P>
	That budget was about jobs for Canadians now and lasting 
jobs for their future. More important, that budget also offered 
Canadians for the first time in memory real deficit reduction and 
comprehensive changes to government programs.
<P>
	Guelph-Wellington residents are concerned about their 
future. They know that in the past governments have overspent. 
They are also concerned that our current debtload includes 
increased borrowing from foreign lenders. They see their money 
being sent abroad and they would prefer that we concentrate on 
programs that will encourage domestic growth.
<P>
	They know that the only way to show the world that Canada is 
committed to real deficit reduction is to prove our commitment 
to fiscal discipline. This bill is an example of this commitment 
and I am sure that all members of Parliament will want to 
support this government in these measures.
<P>
	Guelph-Wellington residents voted Liberal because they 
know we promised to bring the deficit down to 3 per cent of GDP 
in three years. That is a real commitment we intend to make. 
They knew then and they know now that the Reform Party does 
not have the plan for deficit reduction. They know that the 
Reform Party has admitted that Reformers have no idea what 
impact their ideas for spending cuts will have on Canadians.
<P>
	Guelph-Wellington residents want spending cuts and 
government action to be wise, made with their well-being in 
mind. They want a government that is serious about its 
commitment to Canadians.
<P>
	Let me remind this House that our program of net spending 
reduction over the next three years is the most significant of any 
budget in a decade. Eighty per cent of the net fiscal 
improvements set out by our government will be from spending 
cuts.
<P>
	These cuts as demanded from my constituents and 
constituents all across Canada will reduce the operating budgets 
of government departments by $400 million in the next fiscal 
year, with savings rising to $620 million annually in 1995, 1996 
and beyond.
<P>
	As well, the extension of the freeze in government salaries 
including those of members of Parliament will provide an 
additional saving of almost $1 billion annually by 1996-1997.
<P>
	We have extended our ideas to include all facets of 
government. Grants and contributions made by government 
including foreign aid and grants to businesses have also been 
trimmed for savings of $253 million this year and $409 million 
in 1996-1997.
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	Changes to unemployment insurance will reduce 
expenditures by $725 million this year and $2.4 billion annually 
thereafter. We are reducing. There is no question. We are making 
changes to our social security system. These changes are 
necessary in order to respond to a different and more 
challenging society.
<P>
	In an earlier speech in this House I outlined the support that 
my constituents have shown for changes to social security. They 
know that I as their member of Parliament and we as government 
are listening, but they also know we can no longer provide 
everything to everyone.
<P>
	Social security changes like those announced to 
unemployment insurance will recognize our diverse society, our 
difficult economic situation and our commitment to ensuring 
that our children, and my children, have a future.
<P>
	Our budget is about co-operation. We have launched various 
consultation initiatives asking Canadians what they want in our 
future. These consultations have been welcomed by my 
constituents. They also welcome co-operation with the 
provinces and local levels of government which study reforms 
and test new approaches. The challenge for deficit reduction and 
wiser spending is not only going to result from spending cuts but 
also from revenues.
<P>
	My constituents have told me that taxes are too high and I 
agree with them. Lower deficits will mean lower taxes. People 
in Guelph-Wellington do not mind paying taxes as long as they 
are fair and as long as they know the money is well-spent.
<P>
	Bill C-59 answers some of those concerns. Included in this 
legislation are changes to the corporate tax system that make it 
fairer and also allow it to better target the tax assistance made 
available to certain businesses. These include the reduction in 
the business income tax deduction and GST credit for meals and 
entertainment expenses; the elimination of certain tax 
preferences aimed at small businesses that are utilized by some 
large, private corporations; the elimination or reduction of 
certain regionally based investment tax credits that have not 
been cost effective in attracting new investment.
<P>
	This legislation is about tax fairness and further broadening 
the tax base. For example, the full value of employer paid life 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8572"> 8572 </A></B>
<P>
insurance premiums will now become taxable. This will remove 
the advantage that people with  corporate plans enjoy over 
self-employed Canadians or those whose employers do not offer 
insurance benefits.
<P>
	The $100,000 lifetime capital gains exemption will no longer 
be available for gain realized after budget night. The income tax 
credit provided to persons over the age of 65 will be income 
tested, affecting one out of every four seniors in Canada.
<P>
	This legislation also modifies the provisions of the home 
buyer's plan, extending it indefinitely for first time home 
buyers, a move welcomed by real estate people in my area and 
all across Canada.
<P>
	The 1994 budget and this legislation are only the beginning. 
These fiscal measures are but the beginning to our efforts to 
reach our goals. Action must be taken. Our response must be 
comprehensive and wide reaching.
<P>
	Last year we spent $38 billion on interest payments, money 
my constituents believe could have been used for programs and 
services. My constituents have asked me to come to Ottawa and 
end the past excesses. Most are prepared to do without certain 
government services if it means we really make an effort to end 
that cycle of deficit and debt.
<P>
	Our government is committed to action. We will meet our 
budget targets. There is no question. We have put an end to 
unrealistic projections. We are serious about meeting our 
commitments to the Canadian people. The measures included in 
Bill C-59 deserve speedy passage so we can move on to the next 
stage of our fiscal challenge. This legislation includes 
significant measures that will improve the fairness of our tax 
system while at the same time improving our fiscal situation.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	These measures originated in last February's budget. This was 
a budget that took concrete committed action to bring 
government finances under control, action that is an essential 
step in Canada's economic revitalization.
<P>
	My constituents heard the message in February. They 
accepted it during the last election. My constituents want a 
return to fiscal sanity. If we accept the challenge of fiscal 
management we will not only restore our faith in ourselves, but 
we will have made a real step in ensuring that our children will 
have faith in us because we have acted for them and for their 
future.
<P>
	We cannot turn back, and this legislation today calls for our 
support.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to congratulate the hon. member for her fine statements 
today in support of this bill. I know that she is very concerned 
about social justice within our country, to ensure that we are 
taking care of those in most need and certainly the children.
<P>
	We listened to the words of the member for Calgary Centre 
who somehow decided he was going to outline for Canadians a 
simple one page tax return that you fold over and just send in, 
that this somehow is going to make the world a panacea and that 
we can reduce taxes all of a sudden by having a smaller form. I 
know that the hon. member who just spoke shares my view that 
having a shorter form is certainly one thing and lowering a tax 
rate is another.
<P>
	She probably also would agree that the income taxes, for 
instance, for an ordinary member of Parliament under the 
Reform Party proposal would be reduced by about 13 per cent. 
Of course, that 13 per cent, if we assume that the total amount of 
revenue still has to be collected, would have to be collected from 
somebody else which means that under the plan it would 
certainly be unfair to lower income Canadians.
<P>
	I want simply to ask the member if she feels that the finance 
minister has brought in appropriate changes and that more 
changes would be required, particularly in the areas of child tax 
credits or child care expense deductions which would maybe 
assist even further those most in need in our society.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Chamberlain:</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank my hon. 
colleague from Mississauga South. There is no silver bullet to 
the mess that we are in, quite frankly. That is the reality. I think 
it is going to take numerous methods and types of procedures to 
decrease this deficit. I think that we all have to be committed in 
this House, every party in this House. It is going to be necessary 
that we put our energies together to bring some sort of financial 
stability to this country again.
<P>
	Some of the methods that my colleague from Mississauga 
South has talked about are certainly going to be some of the 
options that the finance minister is going to explore.
<P>
	As the finance minister has spoken about many times, we are 
going to hit our budget targets and that is going to make things a 
lot better in this country.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Susan Whelan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome the 
opportunity to support Bill C-59 today. Action that increases the 
fairness of Canada's tax system, as this legislation does in a 
wide range of areas, deserves non-partisan support from all 
members of the House. I am surprised there is any debate on this 
bill at all.
<P>
	The specific measures in this legislation have already been 
amply highlighted but I think it would be worthwhile to remind 
members of the context which set out this legislation, the 
February budget.
<P>
	I believe it is fair to say that our 1994 budget set in motion the 
most comprehensive, fundamental change in decades. It is 
change that focused on three central goals, goals that directly 
answer the concerns and priorities expressed by Canadians 
during last winter's first ever series of consultation conferences. 
Canadians wanted to see action to restore our country's 
economic vitality and  to create the jobs so many people 
desperately need. The budget took that action through funding 
for the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8573"> 8573 </A></B>
<P>
infrastructure program, a commitment to rolling back 
unemployment insurance premiums and through new strategies 
to promote small business and technological innovation, the 
sinews of the new economy.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	It is worth pointing out that the Canadian job situation has 
seen a substantial improvement. So far this year, about 307,000 
new jobs have been created. Just as important, those are full 
time jobs.
<P>
	Second, in last year's consultations Canadians also told us 
they wanted reform of the social security system to ensure it is 
fair, compassionate and affordable, a reform that delivers 
incentives for work and creates jobs and opportunities. That 
reform has been launched by the Minister of Human Resources 
Development. The budget highlighted important steps in 
meeting this challenge. The link between the length of time a 
person works and UI benefits was strengthened. Assistance was 
enhanced for those with dependents. These and other actions 
growing from the sweeping policy review process now taking 
place should reduce the cost of the program further and allow 
premiums to come down.
<P>
	The 1994 budget consultations delivered the third blunt 
message: get government finances under control and make 
government more effective, cost conscious and less of a burden 
that undercuts job creation and entrepreneurship.
<P>
	The government has consistently made clear that these are 
obligations we must accept, not options. That is why the Prime 
Minister and Minister of Finance have staked out a concrete 
commitment to reduce the deficit to just 3 per cent of gross 
domestic product in three years. They have made clear that this 
is just a first step toward the ultimate goal: a balanced budget.
<P>
	To support this goal the 1994 budget took fiscal action to 
bring the deficit under $39.7 billion this year. Just as important, 
the action plan was based on $5 of cuts in spending for every $1 
of action on the revenue side. It is aspects of this revenue side 
action that are included in Bill C-59. Measures such as the 
elimination of the $100,000 lifetime capital gains exemption 
and the reduction of the meals and entertainment expense 
deduction for business will help the government's bottom line.
<P>
	These actions do not respond to fiscal pressures alone. They 
are also based on improving the tax system and ensuring that all 
Canadian taxpayers are treated equally and equitably. To me that 
makes such measures an example of win, win action at its best.
<P>
	Let me return to the overall fiscal challenge of the budget and 
our commitment to bring the deficit down to 3 per cent of the 
economy. I know that some hon. members feel this is too little, 
too slow. But I and the government continue to share the view of 
many Canadians, that too drastic action could risk the  economic 
progress needed to sustain consistent fiscal improvement.
<P>
	One issue that I believe most members here can agree on is 
that reducing the fiscal burden of government is not enough. We 
must give better value for the taxpayers' dollars. That includes 
eliminating unnecessary or cumbersome barriers to business. 
The 1994 budget highlighted action here as well, including our 
continuing commitment to replace the GST and an intensified 
effort to eliminate program overlap and duplication between 
levels of government.
<P>
	As members can see the 1994 budget undertook vitally 
necessary measures of which Bill C-59 represents merely a few. 
This wide ranging action plan is still not enough. That is why we 
emphasized that the 1994 budget was just the first important 
step in a two stage process.
<P>
	Canadians have made clear that further, more fundamental 
change is needed in virtually every area of government activity 
if our country is to face the future with renewed confidence. 
They have told us that they must consulted on these changes. 
That is why the budget highlighted an extensive process of 
policy review and consultation to improve a wide range of 
policies and programs. The House has seen this process at work 
in the papers and reports such as those dealing with social 
assistance reform and financing for small business.
<P>
	Based on the continuing process of policy reviews and 
consultations, future budgets will carry forward further detailed 
strategies to encourage growth and new jobs. These will also be 
strategies that will help ensure continuing progress on deficit 
reduction.
<P>
	Let me remind all Canadians that this two stage approach is 
not a case of deferring action and evading responsibility and 
leadership. Rather it reflects the dimension of the challenge 
facing us all. As the finance minister has said, for Canada to 
recover and grow we must regain a sense of national purpose, a 
sense of national will. What we require now is the kind of effort 
that we have agreed to expend only a few times in our history.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	To achieve this effort we must accept a fundamental fact of 
Canadian life. Without reasonable consensus and real 
consultation, dramatic change can become a disastrous failure. 
We do not intend to fail because Canadians deserve success.
<P>
	It is timely to highlight another aspect of our commitment to 
consultation and more effective government. This is the change 
we have made in the budget planning process itself. In the time 
available before last February's budget we undertook public 
consultations across the country, through conferences organized 
by independent institutes. The Minister of Finance issued a 
report on this process, openly addressing the advice we re-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8574"> 8574 </A></B>
<P>
ceived, how the budget has responded, and why we did not 
accept some suggestions.
<P>
	This was just the start of a deeper process of reform to bring 
budget planning from behind closed doors and to enlist the 
insight and wisdom of Canadians, including parliamentarians. 
As was promised in February the government has acted to 
further expand the consultation process for the 1995 budget. 
This has included the cross-country hearings by the finance 
committee, ongoing town hall sessions by the finance minister 
and other members, and the debate on budget options that 
occupied the House yesterday.
<P>
	To support this process of public consultation, to ensure that 
interested Canadians are fully informed of the fiscal challenges 
we face, the government has arranged for a range of materials to 
be made available. This includes the workbook prepared by the 
Canadian Foundation for Economic Education which has been 
acclaimed for its ability to make the fiscal facts accessible and 
engaging.
<P>
	Bill C-59 is just one part of the 1994 budget that delivered 
real action while setting in place the policy reviews and 
consensus building that will deliver further action in the years 
ahead. It was a budget that took steps to spur job creation while 
recognizing the need for real fiscal discipline and improvement. 
It is a budget that refused to abandon the values of compassion 
and support for those in real need in Canada.
<P>
	Politics has been described as the art of the possible but 
Canadians want more than possibilities. They want to see a 
government committed to doing all it can through concrete, 
measurable action to help build a future of real opportunity and 
real growth.
<P>
	That is the challenge the government has accepted. That is the 
goal the budget acted on, through the measures before us today. 
That is the vision we will continue to build on in the next budget 
and those the government will deliver in the many years ahead.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I really enjoyed the reference to balancing the budget, 
being fiscally responsible and making sure that expenses are 
under control. Those are the absolutely right things that one 
should be saying. We have been saying them over here.
<P>
	I failed to discover in the remarks made just a moment ago 
exactly how this would be done by actually making a promise to 
people that says we would reduce the deficit to 3 per cent of 
GDP. This really does not ever get to the point of reducing the 
deficit to zero.
<P>
	We need a particular sort of plan. In my opinion it is not good 
enough to say that it will be reduced to 3 per cent of GDP. That 
means a deficit in perpetuity. Or is there something I missed in 
the speech that shows us clearly that there will be a reduction of 
the deficit to zero at some time?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Whelan:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member may want to take 
a look at the red book and the government's commitment. We 
stated very clearly that our goal was to reduce the deficit to 3 per 
cent of GDP in the first three years. Our ultimate goal is and 
always will be a balanced budget. If we can achieve it sooner, we 
will. The finance minister will set out a new fiscal plan in the 
next budget. I anticipate that Canadians will review this plan 
and be very pleased.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank the member for her excellent presentation.
<P>
	I wonder if she could make a comment in the area of 
accountability. Members of the Reform Party have been 
speaking about this quite aggressively. They presented one of 
their proposals to the finance committee last Friday.
<P>
	I took the time to add the figures up. There are five sections in 
their program. The bottom line when we add up their $10 billion 
reduction program is it adds up to $9.035 billion. It is short $1 
billion. It is a $10 billion program for deficit reduction by the 
Reform Party that is already short $1 billion.
<P>
	I wonder if the hon. member would comment on a party that 
would propose that sort of accountability.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Whelan:</B> Mr. Speaker, Reform members have said over 
and over again that we should be reducing the deficit to zero 
tomorrow. They made a proposal to reduce it by $10 billion and 
the figures did not even add up to $10 billion.
<P>
	Canadians need to take a second look at what the Reform 
Party has been talking about before, during and since the 
election. They should also take a more serious look at what the 
government has been talking about, what the Prime Minister, the 
finance minister, and what all the government members have 
been talking about.
<P>
	We are serious about meeting our commitment. We are 
serious about going beyond that commitment. We are serious 
about reaching a balanced budget in the future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, given the closeness of 5.30 p.m., I 
wonder if the House would consider calling it 5.30 so this debate 
would not expire and we could resume it tomorrow. If there is 
unanimous consent to call it 5.30, perhaps we could proceed 
now to private members' hour.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The House has heard the 
suggestion of the chief government whip. Is there unanimous 
consent that I see the clock as being 5.30 p.m.?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="8575"> 8575 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 5.30 p.m., the

Members' Business as listed on today's Order Paper.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CORRECTIONSANDCONDITIONALRELEASEACT">CORRECTIONS AND CONDITIONAL RELEASE ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from October 7 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-240, an act to amend the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act and the Criminal Code, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Prince Albert-Churchill River, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member from the Reform Party has 
made a proposal concerning the safety of the Canadian public.
<P>
	We as the legislative body of this great nation must take a lead 
role in ensuring that our citizens live in safe communities. That 
responsibility extends even with greater seriousness to those 
who are simultaneously most vulnerable and most vital, those 
who carry our future in their hands, our children.
<P>
	Let me take a moment to tell of some of the things we in 
Parliament have done to date to try to give both immediate and 
long term protection to our citizens from people who have 
shown little regard for the welfare of others.
<P>
	In Canada's early history, clemency was unconditional and 
only granted through the royal prerogative. In 1899 Parliament 
passed the ticket of leave act which established conditional 
release and a system of supervised freedom. The Governor 
General could grant conditional release to anyone as a method to 
bridge the gap between the controls and restraints of 
institutional life and the freedoms and responsibilities of 
community life, as one historian has noted. The Department of 
Justice provided supervision and eventually established the 
remission branch in 1913.
<P>
	In 1938 the Archambault commission recommended that 
rehabilitation become the purpose of incarceration. The Fauteux 
report recommended the creation of the National Parole Board 
which came into existence with the passage of the Parole Act in 
1959.
<P>
	It is important to note that in 1969, 31 years after the 
Archambault report, the Ouimet report reaffirmed that 
rehabilitation was the major purpose of conditional release. 
More recent developments suggest that the protection of the 
public is the primary goal of conditional release.
<P>
	In 1978 Parliament amended the Penitentiary Act to permit 
offenders to earn time off for good behaviour. Good conduct in a 
penitentiary, it was hoped, was some indication that an offender 
had changed the type of behaviour that led to incarceration in the 
first place. In 1978 this period of remission when offenders were 
in the community was called mandatory supervision.
<P>
	By 1981, the Law Reform Commission expressed concern 
about the small group of offenders who constituted an imminent 
danger to public safety but had to be released under the 
provisions of that law.
<P>
	In 1982 the National Parole Board began suspending the 
release of a small number of offenders who it believed presented 
a danger to public safety.
<P>
	The Supreme Court of Canada struck down this practice in 
1983, saying that the board could only suspend in reaction to an 
offender's behaviour on release, not in anticipation of 
problematic behaviour.
<P>
	In 1986 Bill C-67 amended the Parole Act to permit the 
National Parole Board, after a referral from Correctional 
Service Canada, to detain in custody until the end of their 
sentence those offenders it deemed likely to commit an offence 
causing serious harm before the expiration of their sentence. 
The legislation introduced a schedule of offences which were 
considered to have caused serious harm and required CSC to 
review the cases of all offenders convicted of one of these 
scheduled offences to determine whether they should be referred 
to the board for a detention hearing.
<P>
	On November 1, 1992 the Corrections and Conditional 
Release Act replaced both the Parole Act and the Penitentiary 
Act. This new act, known as the CCRA, eliminated the previous 
system of earned remission and provided that statutory release 
take effect at the two-thirds point of the sentence for offenders 
who had not been granted parole earlier. In addition, it included 
and amended the provisions for detention that had been added to 
the Parole Act through Bill C-67.
<P>
	The CCRA expanded the schedule of offences to include a 
greater number of specific sexual offences. As well, the CCRA 
calls for notifying victims upon their request of when detention 
and other hearings are to take place and permits them to observe 
such hearings.
<P>
	Other measures in the CCRA include requiring an annual 
review of offenders ordered to either remain in prison or to 
reside in community facilities and one chance provision for 
statutory release which means that certain offenders felt to 
represent a certain level of risk but probably manageable in a 
residential facility are given this one chance to prove 
themselves.
<P>
	Any breach of condition or increase in risk requires that they 
return to prison until the end of the sentence with no further 
opportunities to complete the sentence in the community.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8576"> 8576 </A></B>
<P>
	These steps have all been designed to give immediate, short 
term protection to society by removing dangerous offenders 
from the streets and, more important, to give long term 
protection by effecting change in the behaviour of offenders so 
that they will never commit another crime. The bottom line, 
however, remains the same. We must do more to protect our 
children.
<P>
	We said in the red book that we share Canadians' concerns 
that more must be done to better protect society from repeat sex 
offenders. These measures are part of ongoing reforms to 
improve our handling and management of these offenders in 
federal correctional systems, especially those who victimize our 
children.
<P>
	We are all outraged by crimes perpetrated against our 
children. We are angry and we demand measures that will 
protect them.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	At present, the CCRA permits the National Parole Board to 
detain sex offenders and certain other high risk offenders until 
the end of their sentence if they cause serious harm and if they 
are likely to commit an offence causing death or serious harm if 
released.
<P>
	What about when the victim is a child, a person who cannot 
articulate the problem or even realize that there is a problem 
until many years later? We now know that when the victim is a 
child, the serious harm caused by a particular offence may not 
become evident for a number of years.
<P>
	In addition, the victim may be too young to communicate 
adequately the trauma inflicted by the offence. We must protect 
and support our vulnerable children. It has been difficult for the 
National Parole Board and CSC to determine that a child was 
seriously harmed using the legal meaning of the term serious 
harm.
<P>
	Without this determination, the National Parole Board could 
not legally detain the offender until the end of the sentence. The 
Solicitor General has already introduced amendments that make 
it easier for the National Parole Board to keep sex offenders who 
victimize children in a penitentiary until the end of their 
sentence.
<P>
	This amendment removes the requirement to establish serious 
harm as a criterion for detention in these cases. This gives the 
board the authority to detain a sex offender if a further sex 
offence against a child is likely. I would like to add that the 
government has proposed to expand the list of offences for 
which an offender could be referred for detention until the end of 
the sentence.
<P>
	This list includes criminal harassment, commonly known as 
stalking, conspiracy to commit serious drug offences and 
serious drinking and driving and criminal negligence offences 
which result in bodily harm or death.
<P>
	These behaviours also put our citizens at risk, including our 
children. We all have a responsibility to protect our most 
vulnerable citizens, our children, from predators like 
paedophiles.
<P>
	The National Parole Board must now detain offenders who it 
feels may cause death or serious harm before the end of their 
sentence. With the proposed amendments, if the victims are 
children, the board will not have to determine serious harm. It is 
assumed. This means that whenever the board finds that an 
offender might reoffend against a child, it must detain that 
offender.
<P>
	The hon. member from the Reform Party oversteps the bounds 
of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. No administrative 
tribunal such as the National Parole Board would be granted 
such broad powers of post-sentence detention without due 
process nor would the courts countenance this.
<P>
	No government would put into place a system it knows would 
be struck down by the courts, a system that is presently being 
proposed by the hon. member from the Reform Party who is 
promoting this private members' bill.
<P>
	This government is certainly committed to strengthening 
Canada's criminal justice system to protect the public and most 
especially our children from dangerous offenders. Our 
government has acted in an increasing number of ways to bring 
about public safety, whether it be revisions to the Young 
Offenders' Act, whether it be much tougher action against 
criminals who utilize guns during the commission of a criminal 
offence and other progressive change which will greater ensure 
the protection of all our citizens.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
after the news we just heard about Mr. Bouchard's illness, I can 
assure you that I will do my duty as I am expected to do as a 
member of Parliament.
<P>
	Bill C-240 is a prime example of a philosophy that is both 
reactionary and repressive. The Reform Party is pulling out all 
the stops to give the impression that this is a crisis and they are 
the only ones who can save us. The bill introduced by the hon. 
member does not provide any realistic or practical answers to 
the problem of repeat offenders.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	In fact, it favours a drastic and simplistic response to a 
complex problem. The bill consists of two parts. The first part 
concerns the conditions to be met for conditional release, in the 
case of an offender convicted of sexual assault involving a child. 
Under the new conditions it would be easier to continue the 
detention of such offenders by denying them a conditional 
release.
<P>
	They would have to serve their full sentence. The second part 
of the bill concerns new regulations that would permit danger-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8577"> 8577 </A></B>
<P>
ous offender findings to be made after sentencing. The concept 
already exists in the  Criminal Code. At the present time, the 
dangerous offender finding can be made at the time of 
sentencing. In the bill before the House today, this finding could 
also be made just before the end of the sentence.
<P>
	Once a dangerous offender finding has been made, the 
offender's prison sentence may be extended for an 
indeterminate period, irrespective of the original sentence. I 
will first consider that part of the bill that concerns individuals 
convicted of sexual offences involving young victims. These are 
among the most repugnant crimes we can imagine. As I have 
said before, society must protect itself against this kind of 
individual.
<P>
	Bill C-240 has the advantage of preventing the premature 
release of these offenders. However, similar provisions already 
exist in Bill C-45, whose purpose is to amend the Corrections 
and Conditional Release Act. In fact, Bill C-45 provides that in 
the case of a sexual offence involving a child, the National 
Parole Board would not have to establish the existence or 
probability of serious harm.
<P>
	The Board must be satisfied that an offender is likely to 
commit a sexual offence involving a child before the expiration 
of his sentence. These provisions may be found in section 43(1) 
of the bill to amend the Corrections and Conditional Release 
Act. Bill C-45 has been referred to the Standing Committee on 
Justice and Legal Affairs where it is now under consideration. 
Since the amendment proposed by the hon. member is in all 
respects identical to the amendment from the Department of 
Justice, I think it would be premature to comment at this stage.
<P>
	The second part of the bill presented by my colleague deals 
with finding an offender to be a dangerous offender. Clause 26 
introduces an important amendment to the Criminal Code, 
which would make it possible to detain in a penitentiary for an 
indeterminate period an offender found to be dangerous. It 
would be post-sentencing detention since this penalty would be 
imposed after sentencing.
<P>
	By presenting a bill of this kind, the Reform Party member 
shows to what extent repression and vengeance underly that 
party's policies with respect to criminal law. Looking at this 
bill, I have the feeling that Reform members have never heard of 
the principles of fundamental justice, procedural fairness, and 
presumption of innocence. These are the principles which make 
our society free and democratic.
<P>
	To undermine these principles puts our society at risk. As 
members of this House, we must be on guard and defeat rightist 
proposals, which are taken up by a press eager to make us 
believe that we are still in the midst of a crisis. Before 
commenting further on this, let us first look at what constitutes a 
dangerous offender.
<P>
	Section 753 of the Criminal Code allows the court to find to be 
a dangerous offender an individual convicted of a serious 
personal injury or sexual offence. These offences are listed in 
section 752 of the Criminal Code. Once the accused is found 
guilty of any one of the offences listed in section 752, the court 
hears the evidence presented by the Crown and hands down its 
decision based on the following factors, as listed in section 753:
<P>
	A pattern of repetitive behaviour showing that the offender is 
failing to restrain his behaviour; the offender is showing a 
substantial degree of indifference respecting the consequences 
of his behaviour; the behaviour associated with the offence is of 
such a brutal nature that it is unlikely to be inhibited by normal 
standards of restriction of freedom.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	The decision of the court is given after the offender has been 
convicted, but before sentencing. The court finds the offender to 
be dangerous and, instead of imposing a regular sentence, 
imposes a sentence of indeterminate imprisonment. This is the 
harshest sentence that can be imposed by a court, since the 
offender is not eligible for mandatory parole.
<P>
	The case of the person is reviewed three years after the 
conviction and every two years thereafter. In practice, these are 
pro-forma reviews, since officers of the National Parole Board 
never hesitate, except in a few rare cases, to recommend the 
continuing of the sentence.
<P>
	In her bill, my colleague proposes that the whole judicial 
process be repeated just before the end of the sentence of a given 
offender. Bill C-240 proposes nothing short of a new trial, with 
new evidence and a new sentence. Let us remember that this new 
procedure would not apply to a crime already committed, but to 
a crime that might be committed.
<P>
	In fact, it would amount to convicting again someone who has 
already served his sentence. May I remind this House that the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms protects individuals 
against double convictions. Section 11(h) says, and I quote: 
``Any person charged with an offence has the right- if finally 
acquitted of the offence, not to be tried for it again and, if finally 
found guilty and punished for the offence, not to be tried or 
punished for it again''.
<P>
	As we can see, this bill would not withstand a constitutional 
challenge. It also seems incompatible with the principle of basic 
justice to go after an individual by reopening the investigation 
and introducing new evidence on which the initial verdict could 
not be based.
<P>
	Another issue raised by this bill is that of relevance. The hon. 
member herself admitted in this House that her bill only affects 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8578"> 8578 </A></B>
<P>
a very small number of inmates. The problem of repeat 
offenders is much broader and requires more comprehensive 
solutions than those proposed by my colleague.
<P>
	She even wildly exaggerated an isolated case, arguing that her 
bill would solve that kind of problem. The truth is that Bill 
C-240 suggests only partial solutions and affects only 
dangerous offenders representing 0.5 per cent of all Canadian 
inmates now in federal correctional institutions.
<P>
	If we look at the statistics a little more closely, we will see 
that, as of December 17, 1992, there were 121 offenders 
designated as dangerous in Canada. Interesting enough, none of 
them were in Quebec, the vast majority of them being found in 
Ontario and the Western provinces. Between 1985 and 1992, the 
number of dangerous offenders on parole was limited to one per 
year, a number which has always remained constant.
<P>
	There are no facts which justify such drastic action. The 
reactionary measures proposed by my colleague are also 
superfluous, as the courts already have tools to identify as 
dangerous any offender before them. Judicious enforcement of 
the Criminal Code could solve many problems.
<P>
	It is not enough to respond to public opinion as conveyed by 
tabloids trying to boost sales and it is not enough to go after a 
very small number of individuals. From now on, the Liberal 
government must decide, in co-operation with the provinces, on 
a global approach to identify repeat offenders and ensure that 
society is better protected.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise in the House today to 
speak to Bill C-240, an act to amend the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act in the Criminal Code.
<P>
	I would like to thank the member for Surrey-White 
Rock-South Langley for introducing this much needed 
legislation. The member is my southern neighbour and we share 
the same community of Surrey, a growing vibrant community 
but also a community which has experienced many tragedies 
over the past few years. The number of murders in Surrey and 
the surrounding area is astonishing.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	It is also completely unacceptable, most of all to the people of 
Surrey. A day does not go by without someone from the 
community contacting me or my staff about problems with our 
justice system in such areas as lack of deterrence, repeated 
offenders, parole, young offenders, criminal intoxication 
defence, and so on.
<P>
	It is these concerns that we in this Chamber must respond to. 
Canadians across this nation will no longer accept a slap on the 
wrist justice system or a system which holds the rights of 
criminals above the rights of victims.
<P>
	Canadians from all walks of life are demanding action from 
Parliament, not tomorrow or not next week, but now.
<P>
	My colleague has responded to that demand by introducing 
this legislation aimed at preventing violent offenders from 
perpetuating further violent crimes upon our community and the 
country.
<P>
	This bill is the result of the concern that many Canadians have 
with regard to repeat offenders repeating violent offences, 
particularly sex offences. This bill would amend the Corrections 
and Conditional Release Act to permit offenders convicted of 
certain serious offences to be denied statutory release if they are 
likely to commit sexual offences involving children.
<P>
	This amendment would change the current legislation 
basically by removing the serious harm aspect. Under this bill it 
would only have to be established that a sexual offence was 
committed by the offender and that further sexual offences 
against a child are likely upon release. This bill would also 
amend the Criminal Code to permit dangerous offender findings 
to be made after sentencing but near the conclusion of the 
offender's sentence.
<P>
	The reason for permitting dangerous offender findings to be 
made after sentencing and near the conclusion of the sentence is 
that the court would have evidence as to how the offender 
responded to the treatment and the degree of his or her progress 
while in custody. This corrects a flaw in the present system 
where dangerous offender findings must be made at the time of 
sentencing. Only those who are still considered dangerous near 
the end of their original sentences, as opposed to the beginning 
of their sentences, would be detained.
<P>
	How one will behave after a course of treatment and 
educational sessions cannot be judged before they participate in 
the sessions. Prejudging in this manner is not a motivating 
factor for any individual to make an effort to change their 
behaviour while they are in these courses of treatment.
<P>
	The process that this bill proposes for identifying and 
detaining offenders is as follows. The correctional service act of 
Canada would identify those who are likely to commit offences 
causing death or serious harm if they were released at the end of 
their sentence. These offenders would then be referred to the 
National Parole Board. If the parole board agreed that this 
person were likely to commit such an offence, the board would 
then refer the person to the appropriate Attorney General. The 
Attorney General would then consider asking the court to find 
that the offender is still a dangerous offender.
<P>
	If the court accepts the application it could make an order for 
continued detention. The results of this process continued 
custody for an indefinite period of time, continued custody for a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8579"> 8579 </A></B>
<P>
definite period of time, or supervised release in the community 
for a period of 10 years.
<P>
	This is fair and reasonable and serves two essential purposes. 
It allows dangerous offenders to be kept out of the community, 
and it ensures that the state or justice system does not detain 
persons at its whim without good reason and due process.
<P>
	When this bill was debated in the House on June 10 of this 
year some members were concerned that this bill would be 
contrary to certain sections of the Canadian Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms. Specifically the resentencing provisions of this 
bill were thought to contradict section 11(h) of the charter:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If finally acquitted of an offence, not to be tried for it again and, if finally found 
guilty and punished for an offence, not to be tried or punished for it again;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1755 ) </B>
<P>
	The judiciary is the final arbitrator with regard to the Charter 
of Rights and Freedoms. However, this bill does not contradict 
section 11(h). This section guards against being found guilty or 
punished for an offence for which one has served the full 
sentence.
<P>
	Bill C-240 amends the serious harm definition of the 
dangerous offender's designation. This means that those who 
are designated a possible dangerous offender by the process 
outlined earlier are done so on the basis of their past history, 
their treatment and progress which incarcerated and the 
likelihood of their offending again. This does not equate with 
resentencing a person for the same offence.
<P>
	Also this legislation is almost identical to the current 
dangerous offenders legislation which was found to be 
constitutional.
<P>
	In October of this year the community of Surrey experienced 
another tragedy when Pamela Cameron was murdered. It 
appears that the chief suspect in this case could have been 
detained had post sentencing detention legislation such as my 
colleague is proposing been in effect. This is something which 
all members of this House should carefully consider.
<P>
	What we do in this Chamber with this proposed legislation 
shows how serious we are in combating violent crime in our 
nation and in providing for the offenders positive rehabilitation 
programs that are not cut short of their effectiveness by a date on 
the calendar.
<P>
	I urge all members of this House of all political parties to 
respond to the nationwide concerns over the justice system and 
support these reasoned amendments to our existing system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague from 
Surrey-White Rock-South Langley for providing me with 
this opportunity to speak on her private members' bill C-240. I 
strongly believe in the merits of the proposed legislation and 
what it endeavours to address. I encourage all my colleagues on 
both sides of the House to support it.
<P>
	There are two essential components to the proposed 
legislation before us today. The first deals with the application 
for dangerous offenders designation. The second part would 
eliminate the requirement of the crown to prove than an offender 
is likely to commit serious harm, especially as it relates to 
assaults of children. It is this second component on which my 
remarks will focus this afternoon.
<P>
	Childhood is supposed to be a time of innocence, of 
exploring, learning and growing. For far too many kids, 
however, their childhood has become an unending nightmare 
created by those repugnant sexual predators who prey on 
children. It is a sad commentary on today's society that more 
and more frequently we read in our newspapers about cases of 
sexual abuse or assault where innocent children have been the 
victims, in some cases ending with the death of a child.
<P>
	Imagine the terror in those instances where the abuse 
continues for years, where the child is terrified into silence by 
threats against themselves or their parents and family. This is a 
common tactic used by these monsters to control their victims. 
Not one of us in this Chamber can forget the atrocities of 
Clifford Olson. The very fact that man still breathes today is an 
affront to the memory of his victims, defenceless, innocent 
children.
<P>
	This bill addresses these problems. Bill C-240 provides for 
indefinite incarceration of dangerous offenders who prey on our 
young society.
<P>
	Whose rights are more significant here, the rights of a 
convicted sexual predator or the rights of a child? Who among 
us wants to condemn any child to the danger posed by these 
offenders? Do they pose a threat? That is the question we should 
ask. Cases upon cases show that upon release these predators are 
likely to reoffend. Research shows a very poor rate of 
rehabilitation in these cases. The very least we can do is make 
provisions for the courts and the judicial authorities to protect 
our children from those who are likely to turn another child's 
life into a nightmare, or even murder a child.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	Law-abiding Canadians, and maybe that is too legalistic, or 
ordinary Canadians like you and me and the people who live on 
our main streets in our communities are absolutely fed up with 
hearing about offenders' rights. What about the rights of the 
little child? How can the House even consider any measure that 
puts the perpetrators' rights above those of innocent victims? If 
these offenders pose a risk of any sort to the public, to little 
children, for goodness' sake let us keep them in jail. Some 
would say let us keep them in jail until they rot.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8580"> 8580 </A></B>
<P>
	Canadians will no longer tolerate the lenient Liberal justice 
system of the past 20 years. They are struck with disbelief of 
the travesties of justice about which they have read in their 
daily newspapers of repeat offenders who are released on parole 
or on work release into unsuspecting communities.
<P>
	The rage that is felt by the public at these crimes demands that 
we in this place, their representatives, take action and take 
action now. The public no longer has the patience to deal with 
MPs who will not respect their constituents' wishes. If the 
members opposite have any doubt in their minds about that, they 
had better consult with their constituents.
<P>
	This fall 16-year old Pamela Cameron of Surrey, B.C., was 
raped and murdered. The man charged with the murder, James 
Owen, is in the words of the director of the Canadian Police 
Association ``a walking advertisement'' for the dangerous 
offender legislation before us today. He has a record of 28 prior 
criminal convictions, including rape, and refused all sexual 
behaviour and substance abuse treatment programs that were 
offered to him in prison. The authorities should be able to look at 
this case and keep offenders like Owen in prison beyond their 
sentence. Perhaps, just perhaps, maybe Pamela Cameron would 
be alive today.
<P>
	I have held a number of townhall meetings in my 
constituency. My constituents have voiced their concerns and 
outrage at this crime and many others. They have called on hon. 
members in this place to act.
<P>
	Perhaps little eight-year old Mindy Tran of Kelowna would 
be alive today if the provisions before us had been enacted.
<P>
	Today in my riding alone there are some eight cases of sexual 
assault before the courts involving children: eight lives 
damaged, eight kids forced to go through the hell of abuse. 
Recently a school principal was convicted of molesting his 
15-year old foster child. There have also been two recent cases 
where fathers were convicted of sexually abusing their children. 
There is another case before the courts where a neighbour 
sexually assaulted a little girl for two years before it came to 
light, and this suspect, a known sexual offender, had been 
released.
<P>
	Even the B.C. attorney general has recognized the need for 
more severe sentences in these cases and, as my local 
newspaper, the Penticton <I>Herald</I>, reported in an editorial: 
``Respect for the individual rights should not take precedence 
over public safety''.
<P>
	These crimes involving children tear into the heart of the 
communities where they occur. Every parent must shudder in 
horror at the atrocities committed on these poor children.
<P>
	What of these young victims? Currently the onus is on the 
system to prove that an offender is likely to commit serious 
harm in cases that involve sexual assault on children. The actual 
harm to the child may not be evident for several years or even 
decades. It is difficult for adults, let alone children, to 
adequately communicate the effects  of a sexual crime on them. 
It is our responsibility as a society and as members of this place 
to protect children from these vile, sexual predators.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	Parents in communities across the land raise a hue and cry 
when such criminals are released into their communities. Why? 
It is because experience shows that there is a very good chance 
they will offend again, and this time the victim could be their 
own child.
<P>
	Parents want to protect their children. Short of imprisoning 
kids at home they cannot because the judicial system does not 
give them a chance to do so. Even courts have ruled that 
convicted child molesters have the right to hang around 
schoolyards and playgrounds. They have that right. That is 
absurd. If the benighted charter of rights is causing this insanity 
then it had better be amended.
<P>
	Many of my hon. colleagues in this place are parents or 
grandparents. This tragedy has to strike in their own homes 
before the House hears their cries of outrage. Can we as people 
stand by and see even one more defenceless child brutalized or 
murdered by a sexual predator? I think not.
<P>
	I call on all members of the House to unite on Bill C-240 and 
protect our children. We have a chance to make a difference. Let 
us not throw it away. Canadian kids are counting on us.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to remind everyone how this day 
started and each day starts in the House when the Speaker says 
these words: ``Grant us the wisdom, knowledge and 
understanding to preserve the blessings of this country for the 
benefit of all and to make good laws and wise decisions''.
<P>
	Bill C-240 is a good law and I pray all members make the wise 
decision and vote yes to Bill C-240.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I know the hon. whip of 
the Reform Party is very vigilant. I will try to be equal to the 
task.
<P>
	Seeing no members rising for debate, I have received notice 
from the the member for Surrey-White Rock-South Langley 
who moved Bill C-240. Under right of reply she will have two 
minutes to conclude the debate. Members must understand that 
no one else can rise and that this will in fact conclude the debate.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> I thank you, Mr. Speaker, for allowing me to close debate 
on Bill C-240.
<P>
	I have appreciated the level of debate the bill has received in 
the House. It has been interesting to see that members of the 
Bloc have continued to debate against any changes of this 
nature. They find them draconian. I suggest that they are not 
listening to their constituents. A poll was taken by Léger et 
Léger which indicated that 76 per cent of the people in the 
province of Quebec support this type of legislation. It is nice to 
<P>

<B><A NAME="8581"> 8581 </A></B>
<P>
know that  although Bloc members do not support it the people 
of Quebec support it.
<P>
	I have heard the argument on the opposite side that Bill C-240 
may not withstand a court challenge. While there are countless 
pieces of legislation that may not withstand such a challenge, I 
believe that as parliamentarians we cannot abrogate our 
responsibility as lawmakers because of the possibility of a court 
challenge. I certainly hope that feeling is shared by all my 
colleagues here. We cannot afford to shy away from legislation 
solely because of a court challenge.
<P>
	When I first introduced the legislation I did not think that it 
would hit home quite so quickly. However, on October 4, as my 
hon. colleague mentioned, a 16-year old girl was pulled off one 
of the busiest streets in my community in the middle of the 
afternoon and murdered. This legislation may have prevented

<P>
	If this bill is not passed it is inevitable that in the future there 
will be more such deaths. This bill will not put an end to all 
murders but if it prevents even one, it would succeed.
<P>
	I ask all members of this House to please be concerned about 
the lives of our children, the lives of the victims and support Bill 
C-240.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to, bill read the second time and referred to a 
committee.)
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> For proper verification, is 
there unanimous consent to proceed to the proceedings on the 
adjournment motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>

	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I put a 
question to the minister of Indian affairs concerning the pitiful 
state of public health in aboriginal communities on reserves. 
According to Statistics Canada, the tuberculosis rate among 
status Indians is 43 times higher than for Canadians born in 
Canada.
<P>
	This rate is comparable to those found in the third world, 
whether we are talking about Africa or Asia, in countries that do 
not enjoy the benefits of the kind of economy we have in this 
country. The Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development let the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Health reply on his behalf. The parliamentary secretary 
mentioned the amounts now being spent by her department to 
improve the health of aboriginal communities.
<P>
	She mentioned one million dollars this year and several 
million dollars over the next couple of years. I think this is not a 
satisfactory answer, considering that such a high tuberculosis 
infection rate, according to many experts, is an indication of 
sub-standard housing conditions. I think it would have been 
appropriate for the minister of Indian affairs to answer the 
question, since he has a fiduciary responsibility for aboriginal 
communities, for aboriginal reserves in this country.
<P>
	Moreover, the minister could have mentioned that two years 
ago, the aboriginal affairs committee had examined the state of 
aboriginal housing and that the title of its report was <I>Time to Act</I>. 
In its report, the committee found there was a backlog in housing 
construction on reserves, and it also pointed out that there was a 
lack of funding to renovate existing units.
<P>
	Furthermore, in recommendation No. 7, the members of the 
committee asked the government to deal immediately with the 
health and safety problems arising from the condition of 
aboriginal housing.
<P>
	Finally, it is essential that the minister of Indian affairs, until 
such time as appropriate and much needed action is taken, make 
it clear to his colleagues at Health, Public Works and Finance 
that budgetary cutbacks are not to be used as an excuse for 
allowing these appalling conditions in aboriginal communities 
in Canada to continue, shaming us in the eyes of the rest of the 
world.
<P>
	I would like to know whether the government really intends to 
do something about this.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George S. Rideout (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when we 
look at the frequency and the situation of the disease, we must 
consider not only where we are but also where we have come 
from and where our strategy to reduce the frequency of this 
disease should take us.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In the 1930s we were faced with death rates, not incidence 
rates but death rates, of 700 per 100,000 population among 
Canadian Indians.
<P>
	An extensive program to discover and treat active cases of TB 
was begun in 1938. In the late 1940s the necessary funding and 
expertise were provided, new sanitoria and nursing stations 
were built and aggressive case finding, extensive vaccination 
and new treatment regimes were begun.
<P>
	These early efforts bore fruit and today the mortality rate is 
almost negligible while the incidence of TB has been 
dramatically reduced. In 1992 the rate was 60 per 100,000 
population using official population figures for the First Nations 
communities.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="8582"> 8582 </A></B>
<P>
	The reason we were allocating additional funds to implement 
a national strategy for the elimination of aboriginal 
tuberculosis was because the decrease in rates had stalled. 
There remains a number of active TB cases in older people who 
continue to harbour tuberculosis and who become infectious as 
they get older and suffer from other diseases and debilitating 
conditions.
<P>
	The government has been spending $1 million per year to 
address this problem and has allocated an additional $2.8 
million over the next three years.
<P>
	While the spread of TB to other people is facilitated by 
overcrowding and other personal and environmental conditions, 
the main way to eliminate the disease from the population is to 
find active cases at an early stage and treat them before the 
bacterium is spread to contacts, particularly young children who 
are especially susceptible.
<P>
	The strategy which this department in partnership with First 
Nations communities is putting in place aims to reduce the 
incidence of TB to less than 20 per 100,000 by the year 2000 and 
to eliminate the disease by the year 2010.
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 38, the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to 
have been adopted. Accordingly the House stands adjourned 
until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.18 p.m.)
