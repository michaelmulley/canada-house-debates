</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As many members will already know, the Canadian tourism 
commission was actually founded in 1992 after an extensive 
consultation with various stakeholders in the tourism industry 
across Canada.  At that time, when the former government was 
trying to get the commission up and running quickly, government 
and industry agreed that the CTC should be created as a special 
operating agency instead of a crown corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Special operating agency basically means that it has all of the 
responsibility and none of the authority. The CTC was responsible 
for running the program but it was the deputy minister of tourism 
who was responsible for the administration.  Because of the 
speech with which the CTC was originally created, it missed a 
whole bunch of key points and operations were often held back 
because of the bureaucratic nightmare that was created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were some marketing operations that had to sit around for 
months because they were going through the bureaucratic sign-off 
process which required 13 signatures.  By the time they got to 
their signatures circumstances had almost always changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One could spot the potential for problems a mile away. 
Government contract issuance processes were just too slow to keep 
up with the rapid changes that occur in the tourism industry. 
Business does not have to be allowed to move much more quickly 
whether it is in the private or public realm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues and I in the NDP support the move from a special 
operating agency to a crown corporation provided that the 
government provide the tourism board the support it will require 
to fulfil its objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The development and accomplishments of the Canadian tourism 
commission is a unique and promising model of a private-public 
partnership.  The tourism industry currently provides over 
two-thirds of the funding for the commission's operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Labour relations will move from the Public Service Employment 
Act to the Canada Labour Code, and while existing bargaining 
units will be merged, there will be a one year transition in 
eligibility for public service competitions and grievance 
procedures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tourism industry supports the change, the provinces support 
the change and the staff support the change.  I believe that 
today in the House we should be able to co-operate and put Bill 
C-5 through the House as quickly as possible.  One only wishes 
every government policy with respect to tourism was as beneficial 
for the industry as this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this opportunity to remind the House of the sudden and 
hurtful changes which our two airlines made with respect to their 
commissions for international ticket sales.  This change alone 
threatens some 7,500 jobs in small communities across the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically the two airlines got together to set the new 
commission structure and informed the travel agents.  I repeat, 
the two airlines got together to set the new pricing structure. 
Then, when the travel agents' association wanted to meet with the 
airlines to discuss the rate structure, it was threatened with 
anti-competition charges under the Competition Act by the very 
same airline. In other words, the Competition Act could be used 
by the airlines to bully small businesses, but where oh where is 
that act now that the big airlines are in trouble?  Talk about a 
Liberal double standard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point that I feel I must make in this debate on tourism 
comes more in the form of a warning.  The preamble to Bill C-5 
sets out the vitality of the tourism industry to the social and 
cultural identity of Canada.  While I do not wish to necessarily 
disagree with this statement, it must be somewhat qualified.  It 
is not tourism that is going to safeguard our identity.  Instead, 
it is our distinct social and cultural identity as Canadians that 
will safeguard the continued interest for tourists in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tourism can never be more than and certainly never less than an 
integral part of our economy.  A well-balanced and vibrant 
economy of scale cannot be built upon tourism alone.  I make this 
point because it is extremely important for us in Cape Breton to 
remember this at a time when our federal government is telling us 
that tourism will be our saviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tourism also rides economic roller coasters, the big economic 
ones and the smaller seasonal variations.  It is important to 
note that while we acknowledge the increased dollar figures 
generated in Cape Breton, from $211 million to $230 million this 
year which will make tourism one of the important factors in 
rebuilding our shattered economy, it is by no means the only or 
the whole answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As some of my hon. colleagues may already know, we, the NDP 
caucus members from Nova Scotia, have been working with tourism 
operators across the maritime provinces.  We are facing a 
situation of a monopolistic food supplier if the Sobey's-Oshawa 
group merger goes ahead.  This merger could potentially spell 
disaster for the restaurants, bed and breakfast establishments 
and hotels that are price-takers from their food suppliers. If 
the merger goes ahead there will be virtually no competition in 
that sector.  I think I could elicit support from just about any 
part of the House that a situation where no controls or 
competition is in place could spell disaster for the people who 
depend on these suppliers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nearly 77,000 people are directly or indirectly employed by 
tourism operators in Nova Scotia.  The fact that the government 
has taken no initiative toward protecting the interests of small 
businesses that will potentially be hurt by the merger is yet 
another example of the federal Liberals abandoning the interests 
of working people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I feel I must support the passage of Bill C-5, I do not do 
this without some reservations with regard to the Liberal 
government's policies toward tourism and tourist operators.  I do 
not feel that the Liberal government supports tourist operators, 
especially those who are small business owners and employees.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the hon. member for her speech.  I would like to ask her how Bill 
C-5, an act to establish the Canadian Tourist Commission, would 
be different from what the Canadian Tourist Commission does now. 
I will read a paragraph about what the Canadian Tourist 
Commission is doing at the present time: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CTC is industry led and market driven.  It is a consortium of 
Canadian private sector, provincial, territorial, regional and 
federal tourism partners who collaborate closely to match 
Canada's tourism products and services with customer 
demand...both regional and global...and to focus the Canadian 
industry's efforts as a whole.  The CTC actively pursues 
partnership opportunities for its marketing, research, and 
industry and product development programs.  Interested 
organizations or individuals are invited to contact the 
Commission with ideas and proposals.  It should be noted, 
however, that the CTC does not provide grants or subsidies, nor 
does it act as a lobby group on behalf of the industry. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member explain how the new tourist commission, 
under the corporate banner of being a crown corporation, would in 
any way be different?  Would it be more efficient?  Would it do 
the same kinds of things?  Would it do things differently?  How 
does she see it operating? This is what is happening now.  Is 
that bad?  Does she not like it?  What is the real advantage to 
forming a crown corporation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the answer is quite 
simple.  As I stated in my comments the tourism industry supports 
the change.  I respect the individuals in the industry and their 
ability to decide what best suits them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The industry supports the change.  The provinces support the 
change.  The staff supports the change.  I would only have to 
question why members of the House would not respect individuals 
in the industry who should obviously know what is best for their 
industry.

Speaker, I would like to add my compliments to the member on her 
speech.  I have a concern that is perhaps a bit more general. 
Just recently on November 1 we saw the Department of Revenue 
Canada become an agency.  While it is not entirely a crown 
corporation, it is certainly moving in that direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The number of crown corporations is growing.  For example, Nav 
Canada took over the navigation services of Transport Canada.  It 
is supposedly a non-profit entity right now.  It is interesting 
the Museum of Nature is a crown corporation.  These corporations 
are arm's length from the government but their arms are about an 
inch and a half long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have distorted the meaning of a corporation by setting up an 
agency of the government, dependent on the government for 
funding, with board members most often appointed by the 
government.  The distinction between a crown corporation and a 
department or government agency is so small that it makes me 
wonder why we are going through these motions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we look at Bill C-5 it strikes me that we are going through 
much the same motions, as though we are singing the hit tune of 
the day.  What will the consequences be for the government in 
establishing these corporations?  More particularly what will be 
the consequences for these corporations and those they serve when 
in fact the government is still running the show under a 
different guise?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member respond to my dilemma with setting up crown 
corporations which are so close to the government that arm's 
length is a meaningless term? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we have to be clear. 
Reform has always taken the position that if there is a 
government connection it is no good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I asked the colleague who questioned me prior, who are we to 
tell individuals in the industry what is good for them?  We in 
the House are supposed to listen to the people we represent and 
bring their concerns here, not vice versa.  We are not supposed 
to inflict our personal beliefs on individuals within industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I hear that the staff supports it, the provinces support it 
and, more important, the people in the industry support it, that 
is certainly good enough for me and my colleagues in the New 
Democratic Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member does a 
pretty good job of turning the question around, and I compliment 
her on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has she ever asked why the industry is supporting this approach? 
Why is the staff supporting this approach?  Why does this seem to 
be something different?  Is it better?  If the functions are the 
same, if the objectives are the same and if the CTC is operating 
effectively now, why would a crown corporation be more effective 
than the present commission? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Judd Buchanan, present chairman of the CTC, was a very strong 
Liberal cabinet minister in the Trudeau regime.  He does his work 
for $1 a year.  If the crown corporation is established, does 
that mean that the president of the corporation will work for $1 
a year?  Is one of the reasons the staff is supporting it that 
their salaries will rise?  Why is it supporting it?  Could the 
member answer that question? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have real concerns 
with where Reformers keep coming from with respect to their 
questions.  We are talking about the creation of a crown 
corporation.  We all know, certainly those of us from Cape 
Breton, the Reform position with regard to Devco.  If Reformers 
had their way they would fell all crown corporations and leave 
all Canadians on their own.  Those that survive, great and those 
that sink, too bad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Free enterprise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill:</B>  The member says “free 
enterprise”.  What, then, is our responsibility to individuals 
in the industry?  In my home town in Cape Breton a number of 
individuals depend on the tourism industry for their bread and 
butter.  The member asks why they feel this is better.  As I have 
said before, they are the people in the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not a tourist operator.  I respect why they are saying this 
is best for them.  I do not understand why Reformers would take 
the position that they do not think it is good and therefore 
inflict their beliefs on the industry. 
<P><A NAME="LINK7"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to explain very specifically 
why we in the Reform do not think this is a good bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason that individuals are supporting the crown corporation 
concept is simple.  It is likely that a lot more money will be 
spent on the institution but there will be less accountability. 
When members of parliament try to get information from the access 
to information department on crown corporations, we run into a 
virtual roadblock because crown corporations do not have to be 
accountable for the way they run their business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think it takes a rocket scientist to figure out that 
private business can do a job better than government can.  Under 
the current set up we have a program that is directly responsible 
to parliament through the Department of Industry.  We do not want 
to see that taken away from us.  We do not want to see the 
accountability taken out of this place and given to an 
untouchable board.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I heard my hon. 
colleague make the remark that the creation of a crown 
corporation would mean more money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side of the House do not have any problem at all in 
investing in small businesses across the country.  When I listen 
to members of the Reform, their position has always been let us 
sell off everything in the country and allow those who can 
survive to survive and those who cannot to waste away. 
<P><A NAME="LINK8"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
speak to an issue that is fundamentally vital to the Canadian 
economy, the issue of tourism.  Bill C-5 is an initiative that 
will see the Canadian Tourism Commission transformed from its 
present status as a special operating agency into that of a crown 
corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Tourism Commission was originally set up in 1994 by 
order in council and under the guidance of the Department of 
Industry.  Its mandate is to manage, plan and implement programs 
that generate and promote tourism in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us represents an evolutionary step in the 
process by turning the agency into a crown corporation.  Such a 
change will result in many fundamental differences, all of which 
are designed with the intent of providing greater flexibility to 
the CTC, thus allowing it to better serve the tourism industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of the components contained in the bill are without 
controversy.  For instance, there seems to be broad support 
offered by the provinces.  This support is predicated upon 
several factors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the act gives a legislative mandate to the function of 
marketing Canada as a tourism destination.  That mandate 
specifies a significant role for industry, provinces and 
territories in national tourism marketing.  This role of the 
provinces raises a few questions as to why we are not respecting 
the equality of all provinces in the bill, but I will touch on 
them later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second reason provincial governments seem inclined to 
support the bill centres around the restrictions placed on the 
CTC specifically.  The commission may not initiate or finance 
programs involving the acquisition or construction of real 
property, immovables or facilities related to tourism.  This 
ensures that the commission's interest will be focused on 
marketing.  In the past federal tourism funds have somehow been 
used with mixed success on facility development programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third and most important reason has to do with the perceived 
commitment by the federal government to have the marketing of 
tourism led by industry rather than by government.  I say 
perceived because as the legislation presently stands the 
corporation will be made up of 26 directors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sixteen of the directors will be appointed by the Minister of 
Industry and will serve at the pleasure of the minister.  The 
other 10 directors will essentially be made up of provincial 
deputy ministers of tourism or their equivalent.  I am doing the 
math and it does not look good for the provinces.  Worse still is 
the notion that the minister maintains a comfortable majority on 
the board by having 16 pleasure appointments that he can yank 
whenever one steps out of line.  Honestly everybody wants to rule 
the world but we must protect against this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I reviewed the stated objectives of the bill I was not 
struck by any intentions that would be overtly out of line.  The 
CTC objectives include sustaining a vibrant and profitable 
Canadian tourism industry; marketing Canada as a desirable 
tourist destination; providing information about Canada's tourism 
to the private sector; and supporting a co-operative relationship 
among the private sector, the Government of Canada, the provinces 
and the territories.  No alarm bells here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can these initiatives be achieved if the deck is stacked 
against provincial representatives to begin with?  If the true 
intention is to sustain a vibrant industry we should not 
introduce a predetermined barrier to that dynamic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make clear that I am not discussing patronage.  I do 
not question the intention of the minister.  The reality of the 
situation is clear.  Provincial representatives will certainly 
watch out for their own regional issues.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, even if all provincial governments are in agreement on 
a specific policy, the minister maintains a very heavy hammer to 
pound in order to achieve what he wants.  This is not enough for 
my party to oppose the bill at this time, although I look forward 
to exploring this further at the committee stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point in this bill that concerns not only myself but 
also the tourism minister of Prince Edward Island is the 
regional representation breakdown for the appointed directors. 
The bill, in clause 11, delineates six different regions of the 
country.  They are as follows:  the Atlantic provinces, Quebec, 
Ontario, Manitoba and Saskatchewan, Alberta, which is combined 
with the Northwest Territories and Nunavut, and British Columbia, 
which is combined with the Yukon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-5 does not respect the fundamental equality of all 
provinces and that will be explored further.  However, there is 
another issue that I want to raise, which has to do with the 
relative importance of tourism to the economies of the individual 
provinces.  While the gross figure for revenue generated by 
Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia may not come 
close to those generated by other provinces, their tourism 
dollars as a percentage of GDP speak volumes for their need to 
have effective representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raise these issues out of a desire to improve the bill and to 
respect the fundamental nature of Canada, but by and large the 
minister has done a commendable job in producing a bill that has 
such initial broad support.  I have had positive feedback from 
the governments of Alberta, Ontario and Prince Edward Island for 
the general aims and principles of the bill.  Since those are 
provinces governed by members of my party, I know they are 
therefore quite reasonable and astute on such matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tourism endures the peculiar legacy of being big business 
carried out by thousands of small operators.  This commission is 
a very important initiative since tourism injects nearly $47 
billion a year into our economy.  These are not constant dollars 
that we can count on to be there year after year.  We must do our 
part to assist tourism operators to grow their revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998 Canada witnessed a drop in visitors from some of our 
major overseas markets.  Japan was down 14%, France was down 8% 
and Germany was down 5%.  When we consider that tourism employs 
over 500,000 Canadians directly, plus a multitude of spin-off 
jobs, it is an industry that is too important to keep our hands 
at bay.  Of course, an active hand does not mean an 
interventionist hand.  I am aware that the minister understands 
that, which is why he is endeavouring to make it an industry 
driven venture.  It is a difficult task, to be sure, especially 
when we consider that government nets 31 cents out of every 
tourism dollar spent in Canada.  It is certainly an incentive 
that would have some advocate a more activist role for 
government.  That is why my party is supportive of Bill C-5 and 
its less intrusive approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tourism is Canada's 12th largest revenue generating industry, 
with 40% of that revenue generated in my home province of 
Ontario.  Like many of my colleagues in the House, I have a 
vested interest in assisting this bill forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to understand and judge the viability and worth of any 
government project, I find it useful to start from the premise of 
what the situation would be if it did not exist.  There is no 
need to reinvent the wheel to answer that question.  All we need 
to do is look to our neighbours to the south where we see a 
situation that has a certain amount of disarray to it.  The U.S. 
federal government did away with the U.S. travel and tourism 
authority at few years back.  Now the U.S. tourism industry is 
actively lobbying for a new national body. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we start from the premise that this body is absolutely 
necessary, and for the most part I think we are there, then it is 
incumbent upon us to get it right.  We must be open to all input 
on proper structuring, especially from industry members 
themselves, since at present the private sector and the provinces 
are paying more than 50% of the tab. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the limited time I have had to meet with stakeholders, it has 
become clear that we are just scratching the surface with tourism 
now.  What we need to achieve is the creation of a commission 
that will allow the industry to maximize our potential growth 
areas with destination strategies and growth in areas like 
adventure travel and ecotourism.  We also need to develop a 
strategy that will assist rural tourist operators in their 
ongoing struggle to obtain financing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously we are not going to be able to address such specific 
issues in an effective way as a parliamentary body.  That is why 
I hold out such hope for this commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we do our job properly, we will have a tourism commission 
that will be a model for other nations for years to come.  That 
is why the Progressive Conservative Party is supporting Bill C-5 
at second reading. 
<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
enthusiasm of the hon. member who just spoke is well directed. I 
think we all agree that the tourism industry in Canada is a very 
significant issue and that it has not been developed as well as 
it might have been.  That goes without saying.  I am a very 
strong proponent of supporting the development of the tourism 
industry.  I agree with the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the member see this crown corporation advancing the 
cause of tourism more effectively, more efficiently and more 
rapidly than is the case with the Canadian tourism commission 
that currently operates under Industry Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are 26 directors under the Canadian tourism commission at 
the present time, including the president and the director.  That 
is exactly the same number that exists under the provisions of 
the new legislation to set up the crown corporation.  The 
representation from the various parts of Canada, the provinces 
and the regions, is more or less the same, if not exactly the 
same.  The way in which the distribution takes place as to which 
parts of the tourism industry ought to be represented is also the 
same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member really believe that a crown corporation 
will more effectively meet the advancement of tourism in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree, that should be the case for Canadians.  It ought to be 
happening.  That is why the CTC was established in the first 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member really believe that a crown corporation 
will be more effective and more cost effective than the current 
tourism commission? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I indicated in my speech, 
I have some concerns about the composition of the board, with 16 
members reporting to the federal minister and one member from 
each of the provinces reporting to the deputy minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, by moving it from an agency of Industry Canada to a 
more autonomous body, a crown corporation, I think we have a 
better opportunity to exploit the opportunities that exist in 
tourism.  It is a vital industry.  Hopefully the industry will 
grow because of this corporation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK10"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Ref.):</B>   Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to pursue this a bit further, and I thank 
the hon. member for his thoughtful presentation on this subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be 26 board members in the new corporation, as there 
are with the Canadian tourism commission.  Sixteen of the board 
members will be appointed by the minister.  There is already a 
majority, but then the remaining representatives will be 
appointed with advice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know how this could possibly be seen as anything 
other than complete domination by the federal government.  Where 
is the arm's length relationship?  The federal government 
appoints the majority, appoints the remainder on advice, and it 
has the ability to rescind those appointments.  It is totally 
dominated by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not speaking against the need for tourism operators to have 
all the support they can get.  Goodness knows, there is no part 
of the country that does not seek to enhance itself through 
tourism.  It has been a wonderful advantage for Canadians and for 
people outside the country to come and know where and who we are, 
as we are, and to appreciate Canada and Canadians.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it seems to me that what we have here is a step 
backward from the limited accountability that even the Canadian 
tourism commission has, where the board is appointed by the 
minister, acts like a corporation and has a curtain between it 
and openness with the public.  I fail to see how the corporation 
will be able to do more than the Canadian tourism commission does 
and at the same time have the same accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the 
hon. member from the Reform Party for his comments and his 
question.  I have the same difficulty that he does with the 
composition of the board.  As I said, there are six regions that 
the government is setting up.  The provincial people will 
designate who would normally be the deputy minister of tourism 
for their particular province.  I think it should be made more 
fair and that the composition of the board should change if we 
really want to advance tourism and ensure that every one of the 
six regions which are promoted in the bill has a powerful say at 
the table about what should be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a dynamic industry.  It is probably a hidden asset for 
Canada which we can exploit.  When I first saw the bill and 
received the presentation from the department, my initial concern 
was the composition of the board and it is still my concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, at this point in time I am supporting the bill at 
second reading so that the bill can go to committee.  I will be 
further addressing that issue because I have a concern in that 
area as well. 
<P><A NAME="LINK11"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we have today before us a bill that was 
first introduced in the last session.  It is entitled an act to 
establish the Canadian tourism commission, which is part of 
Industry Canada.  The government wants to give it crown 
corporation status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose the first question to be asked is exactly what does 
the Canadian tourism commission do and why does it need to be a 
crown corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CTC, or the Canadian tourism commission, was created in 1995 
to promote Canadian tourism and establish partnerships with the 
private sector, the provinces and federal tourism partners.  It 
uses the money it receives from various sources to do research 
and to market Canada as a travel destination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CTC receives an appropriation of about $65 million every 
year.  Of that amount $12 million goes to salaries and overhead 
and approximately $52 million goes to promotion and product 
development.  The tourism industry in Canada matches that amount, 
so that a total of about $130 million is spent annually.  The 
CTC, by the way, has 62 employees in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To go a little further in the explanation of what the CTC is, it 
has a 26 member decision making board of directors which 
functions as a special operating agency in delivering the tourism 
mandate of the federal government.  The board of directors is 
comprised mainly of private sector companies with direct interest 
in establishing Canada as a preferred tourist destination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I received a briefing on this bill from the CTC I was told 
that the commission wants to become a crown corporation because 
it feels constrained and cannot operate effectively within the 
government.  It said that it cannot move quickly enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess I can be a bit sympathetic with that request.  What part 
of government ever moved quickly enough? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1045"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think there is ample evidence that crown corporations do not 
exactly have a sterling record of moving quickly either. It has 
been my experience that crown corporations can get away with a 
lot but I and many Canadians have never realized that they could 
actually move more quickly than government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Except when it comes to closure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am reminded by my 
colleague that there is one area in which the government can 
certainly move quickly and that is when it brings closure to 
debate in the House.  It is moving quickly to surpass the 
previous Tory government's record.  It is going to blow by the 
Mulroney government in grand style within a matter of weeks on 
bringing closure to the House and stopping democratic debate.  I 
thank my colleague for bringing that to my attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has a philosophical problem with crown 
corporations.  We believe that ownership and control of 
corporations should be placed in the sector that can perform the 
task the most cost effectively with the greatest accountability 
to owners and the least likelihood of incurring more public debt 
or any public debt for that matter. There is overwhelming 
evidence this would be the private sector in the vast majority of 
cases.  History has told us that a private sector organization or 
institution can perform far more effectively than any government 
arm or crown corporation could ever hope to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that many crown corporations, as we have stated 
publicly a number of times, should either be privatized or go 
back to the departments that spawned them in the first place. 
Then the ministers who have them in their departments could be 
accountable to the people of Canada through the opposition, 
certainly through the official opposition, the Reform Party of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think everyone knows that no party in the House has ever 
questioned the operation of crown corporations and demanded 
accountability more than the Reform Party of Canada has since we 
came here as an official party in 1993. We are proud of that 
record because we have the interests of Canadian taxpayers at 
heart.  That is why we ask questions that no other party has ever 
bothered to ask.  Those who have been members of the cozy country 
club that has existed for so many decades in Ottawa do not want 
to do anything to upset the people in that club.  We are not in 
that club and we are proud of it.  That is why we ask the tough 
questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party will be opposing the bill.  We feel that there 
is no good reason to give the Canadian Tourism Commission crown 
corporation status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not know how much more money it will cost.  We know that 
the chairman of the existing CTC which operates under the 
Department of Transport is paid $1 a year.  Judd Buchanan, a long 
time Liberal, is working for $1 a year.  We do not know what 
other compensation or perks he is getting but $1 a year sounds 
pretty good to us. Does anyone think for a minute that the new 
chairman of the crown corporation style CTC will want to work for 
$1 a year? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One has to wonder if there is not a friend of the Liberals out 
there that they have forgotten to reward since 1993.  One has to 
imagine that the appointment of the head of that crown 
corporation is already picked.  By golly, I think we would find 
that he is someone who is well known to the Prime Minister, to 
the Liberal government and to any of those members. It is a 
guarantee and I would be willing to put a few dollars on that 
appointment.  It may even be a friend of the deputy government

responsibility of the Minister of Industry, we lose almost 100% 
of the accountability. 
This crown corporation will operate with an autonomy that will 
basically guarantee that it is going to be free from any inquiry 
through access to information as to how its operation goes and 
how it is spending its money.  We do not want that to happen.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris:</B>  The member from Surrey just 
reminded me that it is taxpayer money once again.  I shudder to 
think that I have been here six years and I forget that important 
little point, and I do not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The industry department issued a paper which supports the rapid 
divestiture of crown assets.  This makes me wonder why the 
department is sponsoring the bill in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to a paper in the House entitled “Canada in the 21st 
Century—Institutions in Growth—Framework Policy as a Tool of 
Competitive Advantage for Canada”.  This sounds like it is going 
to cost Canadians a lot of money.  If we start getting academics 
trying to figure out how to spend taxpayers' money, it could be a 
pretty sad situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that in comparison to other OECD countries, Canada 
has had historically high levels of state ownership.  In a 
country that is considered primarily a free enterprise country, a 
country where the people of Canada should take a role in private 
enterprise, the private sector and industry, Canada has a very 
unusually high level of state ownership.  That is a little scary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1986 the Economic Council of Canada reported that government 
owned and controlled companies accounted for 26% of the net fixed 
assets of all Canadian corporations in 1983.  That is pretty 
astounding and pretty shocking.  Yet these firms accounted for 
less than 5% of the total employment in the country.  They 
accounted for 26% of the net fixed assets of all the Canadian 
corporations, yet less than 5% of the total employment.  This 
adds even more credibility to the fact that the private sector is 
the best place to create jobs.  The government should recognize 
that instead of trying to usurp the efforts of private sector 
industry in helping our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These numbers do not say very much about the employment creation 
capacities of government owned crown corporations and companies.

requests through access to information to get some information 
about certain crown corporations and we hit a brick wall, to put 
it fairly specifically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister will say that this new entity is at arm's length 
and he is not responsible.  The minister should be responsible to 
the House for how taxpayers' money is spent.  He should not be 
permitted to duck this responsibility by turning the CTC into a 
crown corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure you will understand this, Mr. Speaker, because you 
have been a member of the House for some time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minute the crown corporation is formed it will immediately 
begin to plead that the confidentiality of its private or 
commercial stakeholders will be compromised if it starts talking 
about how it spends its money or how it operates its little 
business.

it is time we changed the title of the public works minister to

Canadian Mint. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gilles Champagne of Montreal, who is a member of the Liberal

patronage post. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This week the minister appointed a 30-year veteran of the 
Liberal trough, André Ouellet, as Canada Post's new president 
where he will double his salary as Post Office chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most offensive of all, the public works minister just appointed 
his long time personal friend Emmanuel Triassi as chair of the

has never studied metals and does not have a coin collection.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
sometimes feels like there is a choice between having a job and 
having a life.  Overwork and long hours are epidemic in Canada. 
In the first four months of 1997 almost two million workers put 
in overtime, most of it unpaid, while one-third of working 
Canadians say they are constantly under stress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time unemployment remains staggeringly high when 
compared with other countries.  There are serious social issues 
and human costs associated in a society divided between the 
chronically overworked and the chronically unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that a reduction and redistribution of work time 
deserves to be the new public policy priority.  A substantial 
reduction of work time, such as a standard 32 hour work week, 
deserves to be the target early in the new millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time for governments to take up this challenge.  If we can 
achieve a better distribution of work time and leisure, stories 
about an improving economic situation might start to ring true 
for the vast numbers of Canadians who are unemployed, 
underemployed or overworked.

with the referendum rules.  He says there has to be a clear

Mr. Speaker, the way the Reform approached this issue in the past

that the leader of the Reform Party is the statesman he claims to 
be and should be as Leader of the Opposition in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the Reform Party will keep the debate at the level where 
it should be because our country must be more important than our

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would 
have certainly liked to have been included in the debate rather 
than hearing about the debate from some caucus meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister should be worried more about heading into the 
next referendum without positive changes to our federation.  He 
should be more worried about not offering Quebecers an 
alternative to either status quo federalism or separation.

accommodate Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the question is legitimate.  The issue is why the 
Reform Party took three days before asking the question.  Instead 
it blamed the Prime Minister for raising the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister raised the issue because the Quebec 
government is threatening the country with the possibility of a 
unilateral declaration of independence.  This is what the Reform 
Party should have attacked, and not the Prime Minister for two 
days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Reform Party is now willing to take the high road and to 
look at the matter seriously, obviously the Reform Party is right 
that we need clarity.  We truly agree with that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, at

adamant at the beginning of the week and now by Friday they say 
that we will be perfectly clear on the required majority and will 
do that by not telling anyone the actual number required.  That 
is not a brilliant strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if they think that separatists will be shaking in 
their boots over that.  Imagine—brace yourself, Mr. Speaker—the 
Prime Minister will be very clear that he will be very unclear in 
the days to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the intergovernmental affairs minister not realize that the

<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we 
are asking questions.  Certainly we have not had a single answer 
yet this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It reads like the stuff of a cheap teenage novel, the Shawinigan 
strongman and the mystery majority.   You have to picture it, Mr. 
Speaker.  Imagine this week the advisers saying “We'll put the 
Prime Minister out there.  We'll get him to be very blustery. 
We'll get him to bang on the table a few times and then we'll 
have him declare: let me be perfectly clear.  I have known since 
a long time that I don't know where to go from here and I have 
nothing to be more clearer than that”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what has happened this week.  More could have been done 
than reigniting the separatist flame.  Why do they not tell 
Canadians what they mean by a clear majority? 
<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr.

personal attacks on the Prime Minister instead of joining him in 
his fight for a united Canada and against separatism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are reaching out to the separatists.  We are reaching out

the last year we invested $300 million in RRAP to 
make houses accessible to low income people.  I remind the hon. 
member to talk to provincial governments of his political 
affiliation that are not participating in the RRAP program.  If 
they would participate, we would have more money and more units. 
<P><A NAME="LINK126"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
minister knows that Canada continues to be the only developed 
nation in the world that does not have a national housing policy 
or a national housing strategy.  Here is what the current 
Minister of Finance said when he was the chair of the Liberal 
task force on housing: “This government just sits there and does 
nothing.  The lack of affordable housing contributes to and 
accelerates the cycle of poverty which is reprehensible in a 
society as rich as ours”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is now in a position to do something about this 
reprehensible situation.  In fact he has had six years to fix 
this reprehensible situation.  Will he or will he not answer the 
call from around the country and announce that he will reinvest 
in social housing in this coming budget? 
<P><A NAME="LINK127"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me also say that 
the Government of Canada through CMHC and the mortgage insurance 
program, create and build about 475 units a year. Under the 
program of private and public partnership, we created 13,000 
units.  This year alone it is more than 3,000 units.   We want to 
do more and we are going to do more.  I remind the member that we 
do have a national housing policy.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans has again shown blatant 
disregard for South Shore lobster fishers.  In 1998 the industry 
started a voluntary V-notch program with a 1/32 carapace increase 
to follow in 1999.  Weeks before the season opens, the carapace 
size has been increased from 3 1/4 to 3 5/16, or a 1/16 increase 
instead of a 1/32 increase.  Why has the government changed 
regulations that were agreed to in 1998? 
<P><A NAME="LINK130"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to correct the hon. 
member.  This was the policy on conservation put forward by the 
previous minister and it is something we are going to follow 
through on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the hon. member something because his party 
and the member have talked about conservation repeatedly in the 
House.  Carapace size is a tool for conservation to protect the 
resource.  Are the Conservatives now abandoning their position on 
conservation and saying that we should not protect the resource? 
The hon. member should stand in the House and say whether or not 
they are still for conservation.  They should make it pretty 
clear. 
<P><A NAME="LINK131"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
minister is well aware that carapace size was supposed to 
increase by 1/32 in 1999 and by 1/32 in 2000.  That is a 1/16 
increase over two years.  He has increased it by jumping it in 
one year because of mismanagement by his department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How are fishers that were issued a variance order for carapace 
size to begin on November 28 to understand that order when DFO 
officials are saying that they have until December 15 to bring in 
the carapace size increase?  So why—

<P><A NAME="LINK132"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, increasing the carapace size is 
consistent with our policy throughout that region.  This policy 
was introduced a number of years ago by my predecessor. 
Conservation is going to be a priority for the government.  That 
is why we are increasing the carapace size by 1/16. We will 
continue to ensure that conservation and protection of our 
resource to make sure we have a sustainable lobster fishery will 
be our priority.

consideration please.

having an order paper with the list on it, and so does the hon. 
member.  Perhaps if he stuck with the order paper he would be 
able to follow rather easily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am reluctant to take up a great deal of the time of the House 
going through the same form because these bills are all in 
exactly the same form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee:</B>  Mr. Speaker, given the repetitiveness of 
the proceeding, as is required by the rules, I wonder if there 
would be consent in the House to allow the request of the member 
for Ottawa Centre so that we might dispense with the repetitive 
introduction of each bill on the same subject.  Perhaps the 
Speaker could request if there is now a disposition for unanimous 
consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there consent to treat these bills

respect the fact that all members have the advantage of having 
the order paper to look at to see what it is you are referring 
to, but we have an enormous following that watches the 
proceedings through the television camera.  They do not have the 
advantage of that and they are trying to follow, with I am sure 
rapt attention, what you are doing and saying.  I think they 
would be having the same difficulty.

.[Text] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Question No. 8—<B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the United Nations 1994 recommendation that 
Canada appoint a monitor to ensure that all provinces folowed the 
terms of the UN Rights of the Child, what actions has the

<P><A NAME="LINK309"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> The UN Committee 
on the Rights of the Child, in its 1995 concluding observations 
to Canada's first report under the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child expressed its concern that sufficient attention had 
not been paid to the establishment of a permanent monitoring 
mechanism that would enable an effective system of implementation 
of the convention in all parts of the country. Since that time 
the Government of Canada has funded the development of a 
monitoring mechanism by the Canadian Coalition for the Rights of 
Children. Since the monitoring project began in February 1996 a 
growing number of organizations and individuals have contributed 
their knowledge and ideas. As a result the monitoring framework 
continues to evolve.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADIAN TOURISM COMMISSION ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK312">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-5, an 
act to establish the Canadian Tourism Commission, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Before question period the hon. 
member for Prince George—Bulkley Valley had the floor.  He has 
eight minutes remaining in his time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK313"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to resume debate on the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before question period I was talking about the problem members 
of parliament such as my colleagues and I have of getting 
information through the Access to Information Act regarding crown 
corporations.  It is virtually impossible.  It ends up certainly 
being an exercise in futility.  That is why we are concerned 
about the tourist commission being taken out of the office of the 
Minister of Industry.  That is exactly what will happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time we at least have some access and some 
accountability through the minister who is obliged to answer 
questions, at least if he feels like it.  The CTC is accountable 
directly to the minister and the minister is accountable to 
parliament, including those of us in the Reform Party when we are 
asking questions to pursue accountability in terms of the 
spending of taxpayers' dollars.  That is the way it should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suspect that the cost of running the CTC as a crown 
corporation is going to be a lot higher than it is now.  The 
briefing I received suggested that moving the entire operation to 
Toronto is a distinct possibility.  I can picture it. Instead of 
taking up a floor in the building that houses Industry Canada, it 
will need some prominent downtown real estate in Toronto at the 
top dollar the market demands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The salaries will have to go up.  It costs twice as much to buy 
a house in Toronto.  Then there are the moving and relocation 
costs for the 62 current employees.  That certainly will not be 
cheap. I am sure there will be the emotional costs of moving to 
Toronto for all of the families involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party believes Canada is a spectacular tourist 
destination and we should promote Canada as a travel destination. 
Tourism is a big industry for Canada whether one is a 
parliamentarian or whether one happens to run a specialized 
restaurant in some city in Canada such as Edmonton for example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We rely on tourists to come to our country and to spend their 
dollars.  In fact, it is Canada's 12th largest industry. We are 
talking big dollars. Last year it generated jobs at twice the 
pace of Canadian business. It generated $44 billion in revenue to 
the Canadian economy.  We are not talking small dollars here.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A press release issued by the CTC states that the international 
travel numbers for the first three months of 1999 indicate that 
this year may well be another record breaking one for Canada's 
tourist industry.   Compared to the same period in 1998, 
international tourists made 11% more trips of one or more nights 
to Canada so far this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, it is clear that Canada needs tourism and that we 
should market our wonderful country abroad, notwithstanding the 
high taxes. But it is not clear that we need a crown corporation 
to carry on this activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that you would find, Mr. Speaker, consent for the 
following motion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That for the remainder of this parliament, motions pursuant to 
Standing Orders 26, 56.1, 57 or 78.3 and motions that the 
question be now put shall not be receivable by the Chair. 
Furthermore, this motion shall not be subsequently revocable or 
amendable by a government motion. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member has 
put a motion before the House.  Does the hon. member for Prince 
George—Bulkley Valley have the unanimous consent of the House to 
move the motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> No. 
<P><A NAME="LINK314"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want 
to commend my hon. colleague for the comments he made.  Mr. 
Speaker, I have to pay a special tribute to you too, sir. The 
hon. member mentioned certain things in his speech that I think 
refer directly to the efforts you have made toward tourism and 
the establishment of industries in Canada and in particular, a 
certain establishment that has some taste, that makes some bread, 
and which has brought together some cultures in Edmonton. It 
brings to mind one of the purposes of the tourism industry which 
has to do with the promotion of culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague would recognize only too well that one of the 
functions of tourism is to bring people to Canada to let people 
see the culture we have here.  It is such a varied culture. 
There is the French culture, the aboriginal culture and all the 
various ethnic groups that have come to Canada over the years. 
It is a real kaleidoscope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a wonderful combination of the way people can actually 
work together.  People of different ethnic backgrounds come from 
other parts of the world where they actually fought with one 
another and got into not just minor fights in the back streets 
but they would shoot each other, maim each other, kill each 
other, plant mines in the ground so that people's legs would be 
blown off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could my colleague make a comment about how Canada through the 
expansion of our tourist industry can demonstrate to the rest of 
the world how we can live together more harmoniously? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am only too pleased 
to respond to my colleague from Kelowna.  Certainly Canada is a 
marvellous country to live in. People from all over the world 
have come to Canada to take up residence and become Canadian 
citizens.  There are those who are still seeking to become 
citizens of Canada. We have a lot to offer the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tourism gives people from all over the world an opportunity to 
come to a country that perhaps they have never visited before. 
For the first time they can see how people can live and exist 
together despite their cultural or religious differences, their 
differing points of view. 
We are a free and democratic country.  I think we are able to 
hold ourselves up as a standard to the world.  I can only say 
that—and I have to add this—I really believe that the people 
who come to Canada from different countries can best exhibit and 
accomplish this spirit of co-operation, not with the help of 
government but rather without the help of government. People come 
to Canada recognizing that it is a beautiful country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last 30 years, the current government and past 
governments have done more to foster the divisions amongst the 
different types of people in the country than bring them 
together.  The government should just stop trying to make people 
so different in the country.  It should let the people themselves 
embrace what it is like to live in a multicultural country 
without its involvement. They will do a far better job and a job 
that will move along the lines of getting together, rather what 
the government does, which is to promote divisions among the 
people of Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK315"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague for Prince 
George—Bulkley Valley for his intervention and for his recent 
remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I think about this bill, I remember, when I was the deputy 
critic for industry with responsibility for the Canadian Tourism 
Commission, an instance that took place over a period of time 
where I wanted to have a meeting with the director of the 
commission.  This was not as simple a matter as I had thought it 
would be.  We had been told how open it was and how they were 
looking for opportunities to discuss the business of the 
commission with various people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a meeting in British Columbia with some of the tourism 
people and wanted to take some of the information and discuss it 
with the director.  It took a long time for this meeting to be 
arranged.  The director was busy in town or out of town.  One day 
we finally made an appointment.  It was not in the near future, 
but after some time passed and I was preparing for the meeting, 
guess what, I got a phone call saying “I'm sorry, the 
appointment has been cancelled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I began to explore the reasons why.  I was told that I could 
have no meetings with members of the commission without the 
minister's approval.  I took this directly to the Minister of 
Industry and, to his credit, he said that he would never stop me 
from doing that.  Regardless, in his name, I never did have a 
meeting with the director of the commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This, in my mind, brings up the question of accountability.  The 
Canadian Tourism Commission is accountable to the minister and 
accountable through the minister to parliament.  Yet a 
parliamentarian, myself, the deputy critic responsible for this 
commission in my party, wanting to represent the constituents of 
British Columbia to the commission, was not able to have a 
meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking myself, with this further separation, this inch and 
a half arm's length that has been created between the commission 
and the government, how much more opportunity is there for a lack 
of accountability by the new crown corporation and members of 
parliament and the citizens of Canada who are vitally concerned 
about this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the member what his concerns are.  Does he 
recognize some of the dangers I am alluding to?  Could comment on 
them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the fact that there 
is little enough accountability presently through the Minister of 
Industry with regard to the CTC, or for that matter through any 
of the government ministers, does concern me. 
If they do not want us to know something about their departments 
they simply throw up as many roadblocks as possible to keep us 
from getting the answer to our question.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have spoken about before, if we move the CTC out of the 
minister's department to a crown corporation, it automatically 
becomes almost 100% immune to anyone from the opposition looking 
into how it runs the new institution, how it spends taxpayers' 
dollars or how it operates.  It will simply say that it is a 
crown corporation, not answerable to parliament and therefore 
does not have to reply.  It can always say something to give it 
some credibility in its own mind that if it were to reply to our 
question or inquiry it would be letting out some strategic 
secrets which it cannot do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is a strategic secret that we would like to have let out, 
and that is just how it is spending the taxpayers' dollars.  That 
is a secret to which I think the Canadian people have a right to 
know the answer.

of Canada, the government introduces an act to establish the 
Canadian Tourism Commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the outset, it is rather incomprehensible. 
Why is the federal government bent on interfering in this 
sector, which is outside its jurisdiction?  Why is it bent on 
using a Canadian tourism commission to do so?  I looked to the 
objects of the commission as stated in the bill for some 
answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first object is to sustain a vibrant and profitable Canadian 
tourism industry.  I told myself that the Canadian tourism 
industry is really the sum total of the tourism industry in each 
of the provinces.  In Quebec, we have a tourism policy which was 
developed some years ago and which has been very successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the 1978 summit on tourism, Quebec has made important 
progress as a tourist destination.  In 1996, revenue was $5.4 
billion. 
In Quebec this industry comprises 29,000 businesses and over 
100,000 workers concentrated in the sectors of accommodation, 
food services, transportation, travel agencies, entertainment 
and recreation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, it is the 6th ranking Quebec export next to 
aeronautics, with international exports of $1.9 billion. 
Tourism investments in Quebec total $1.3 billion and its annual 
tax revenues $1.2 billion. As well, it offers considerable 
employment to young people, as 28% of workers are under the age 
of 25. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec has therefore equipped itself with a policy to intervene 
in this sector which is a provincial jurisdiction.  It has the 
means required, and has set in place some highly pertinent 
structures, such as the regional tourism associations.  It 
therefore has an approach to tourism and to services to tourists 
that has been highly successful. 
We attract tourists from all over, other Canadian provinces, the 
United States, South America and Europe.  We boast a number of 
truly interesting tourist attractions and it is not mere chance, 
but rather the result of a well-organized tourism effort, that 
has led to worthwhile results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tourism industry in Quebec is guided by Tourisme Québec, a 
department which directs government actions relating to tourism. 
There are 19 regional tourist associations, like the one I have 
already referred to, and their mandate is to group together 
those involved in tourism in their region, encouraging concerted 
efforts and co-ordinating the development and promotion of 
tourism in the region.  I believe they are doing this very 
successfully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give as my example the Lower St. Lawrence region, the one 
I represent here in the House of Commons. 
It is a region that had problems 10, 15 or 20 years ago 
convincing tourists passing through our region to stop and spend 
some time there, instead of simply heading on to Percé and the 
maritimes.  Creation of the regional tourism association has 
really borne fruit.

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We eventually established tourism commissions in several 
municipalities, participated in the effort to promote our 
tourist attractions, proposed nominees for national tourism 
awards across Quebec, because there is a contest to choose the 
province's best tourist businesses, and so on. Thanks to this 
promotion and emulation, the Lower St. Lawrence has become a 
major tourist area in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have very distinctive attractions. For example, there is our 
heritage. We have families that were among the first ones to 
settle in Quebec, such as the Lévesques, the Ouelettes and the 
Pelletiers. They organize family reunions in our region. These 
families have been in Quebec for 250 or 300 years. 
They get together and tour our heritage. We also have an 
extraordinary religious heritage. It is one of the most vibrant 
in America, thus making it another interesting attraction for 
those who come to visit us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, we have a whole network of hotels and restaurants 
with a well established reputation at the national level. I am 
thinking of the hotel Lévesque and the hotel Université in 
Rivière-du-Loup. These facilities can accommodate a fairly large 
number of people and are nationally renowned for the high 
quality of the food they serve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have a network of inns and other attractions, including 
ecotourism. 
Ecotourism is a sector promoted by Quebec with the result that 
we now have a very good structure at the Canadian and European 
levels, and we do not need a parallel structure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our region, ecotourism involves anything that has to do with 
nature, including the St. Lawrence River. The new 
Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park will attract tourists from all 
over the world. That is an interesting prospect. Mountain 
climbing is also becoming a popular activity in 
Saint-André-de-Kamouraska, among other places, which offer 
incredible opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, we made the lower St. Lawrence a reception area and 
we established an area people want to visit in terms of new 
tourist values and what they want to see.   The result—and it 
is not just with us as an ATR, but it applies to all regional 
tourist associations—is the promotion of the appeal of these 
regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think Tourisme Québec's mandate already contains everything 
necessary to ensure that we manage our tourism industry well. 
When we look at the objectives of the bill, we realize that 
there is duplication.  Tourisme Québec talks of “orienting and 
co-ordinating public and private action in tourism”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The board of directors they want to establish for the Canadian 
tourism commission is the same sort of representation as for 
this commission. 
They will select people representing a province from within the 
population of the province, but these people may not be the 
actual delegates of the province, and this fact may cause 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mandate of Tourisme Québec also provides for “the 
development of a knowledge of tourist products and clients”.  It 
is also found in the mandate of the Canadian tourism commission 
as “to support the improvement and development of tourism”.  I 
spoke of this earlier: “to inform clientele on Quebec's tourist 
products and to develop and operate tourist facilities”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see there are many things that are similar to the 
mandate of the Canadian tourism commission. 
The federal government has told us that it wanted to get out of 
this sector, but it is now presenting a bill to establish the 
Canadian Tourism Commission. One wonders why. The reason is 
stated under the second goal of the act: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>b</I>) market Canada as a desirable tourist destination; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking here about tourism in Canada and from abroad. 
That is a roundabout way to engage in propaganda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hidden motive of this bill is to promote and increase the 
visibility of the federal government and to reinforce national 
unity, one of the preferred themes of this government. I think 
it is going beyond what is normal and acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The promotion of Canada that is being done by the federal 
government in Canada does not deal only with tourist 
attractions, but also with the value of Canada itself as a 
federation. That is a way to compensate for the weaknesses in 
the operation of the federation, all the more because this 
government lacks flexibility and is unwilling to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of trying to meet the needs of the various members of 
the federation, it is content with setting up tougher hurdles in 
the path of the sovereignist or nationalist movement in Quebec, 
which should be able to express itself and and develop to its 
full potential. 
We see this in all the federal government's areas of activity.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, the Canadian tourism commission is one more tool for 
promoting the Canadian federal system.  When the stated object 
is to promote tourism within Canada, it is very clear that this 
is the goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the bill had been limited to promoting Canada in 
international markets, the tourism structures of each province 
might perhaps have agreed to establish a common fund for 
international promotion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But when the government starts talking about a domestic mandate, 
and tells us that the Canadian tourism commission will organize 
and promote tourism within Canada, we know very well that, 
further down the road, the present Liberal government will use 
these words in the bill as justification for promoting not 
Canadian tourism but the Canadian federal system.  I find this 
unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objects in the bill also include the following: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>c</I>) support a cooperative relationship between the private 
sector and the governments of Canada, the provinces and the 
territories with respect to Canadian tourism; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No account has been taken of what I mentioned earlier concerning 
the tourism development policy of Quebec, which held a tourism 
forum in 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the fall of 1996, the government held a summit on the economy 
and employment.  This was followed by a tourism forum in March 
1997, which brought together over 200 people representing all 
sectors, products and regions, as well as the main departments 
having anything to do with tourism.  The forum produced a number 
of observations, consensus, and various courses of action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec's current tourism policy incorporates all the conclusions 
of this meeting and the work done by the chair of tourism of the 
Université du Québec à Montréal at the forum, the consultations 
of public departments and agencies by Tourisme Québec, and the 
August 1997 consultation of the tourism industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, the province of Quebec has come a very long way in terms of 
tourism, thanks to a tourism policy that makes sense and which 
has concrete goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The policy includes the priorities and intervention strategies 
developed by both the government and the industry in order to 
ensure the growth of tourism businesses and to maximize the 
contribution of the tourism industry to our economic, social and 
cultural development in the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We, Quebecers, have trouble feeling at home within the Canadian 
Tourism Commission. We do not really understand why the federal 
government is promoting this vision of tourism development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us turn to the constitution of the Canadian Tourism 
Commission and its board of directors. There will be twenty-six 
directors, including the federal deputy minister of Industry. 
The chairperson and the president will be appointed for five 
years. Sixteen directors from the private sector will be 
appointed by the industry minister for a term of not more than 
three years, with the approval of the Governor in Council and 
under the advice of a committee set up by the board of 
directors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seven of these 16 directors will be tourism operators and nine 
will be private sector representatives. Seven public sector 
directors will also be appointed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a huge structure that will work in parallel with what we 
already have in the province of Quebec. Again, we feel that our 
money goes to finance two parallel operations, one from the 
Canadian federal government and one from the Quebec government. 
We do not need this kind of duplication. 
We know from experience that this way is not right for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 26(1) of the bill reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>26.(1) The Commission may enter into an agreement with the 
government of any province or territory to carry out its 
objects. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that, before entering into an agreement with a 
province, the Canadian Tourism Commission may want to make sure 
that the goals of the agreement are in line with its own. These 
goals might be different from those in the tourism policy of 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The language issue also comes into play if we want to attract 
French-speaking tourists to Quebec. 
It naturally appeals to people from France, Africa and many 
other countries. There is a tradition. In setting up this 
service, we must make sure that we are not required at the same 
time, under an agreement with the Canadian Tourism Commission, 
to pursue other goals in terms of mobility and the clientele we 
want to attract, in return for benefits and funds.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its present form, the bill contains many elements the Bloc 
Quebecois finds unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should take the time to go and see what is being 
done in other jurisdictions, get reacquainted with the policy 
developed by Quebec in the area of tourism development and look 
at what has been accomplished in this area. If after that it 
still wants to introduce a bill, it should be one that gives 
enough manoeuvring room to those who are already organized in 
this regard, and makes sure that they can access the necessary 
resources to implement their own policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This sort of action, this recognition of Quebec's dynamism in 
the area of tourism development are not reflected in the 
Canadian Tourism Commission Act.  This leads the Bloc Quebecois 
to the conclusion that it cannot support this bill in its 
present form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would need to be either referred to a committee for in-depth 
examination or quite simply withdrawn, but it is totally 
unacceptable in its present form.  It is unacceptable not only 
because it requires many amendments, but also because its very 
basis, the very mandate the government assigns to the 
commission, will not yield satisfactory results for Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not worthwhile for Quebec to get involved in the action to 
be carried out by the Canadian tourism commission under its 
present mandate. 
Certainly, on the practical level, there can be areas of 
co-operation, but in the long term there is no future for Quebec 
in the way they want to organize tourism within the commission 
and the way the present federal government perceives it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one other aspect I want to address, which I have not 
touched so far.  It is one often found in legislation passed by 
this government in recent years.  This concerns the way accounts 
will have to be rendered to the government by the commission. 
It is part of a trend on the government side, and a fine example 
is the millennium scholarship foundation.  I use this as an 
example because we had concrete information on it in the 
Standing Committee on Human Resources Development yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two officials appeared before the Standing Committee on Human 
Resources to speak on interventions in the field of education, 
which is not under federal jurisdiction, but which the federal 
government would really like to invest in.  I asked them if they 
were aware of the differences remaining between the Government 
of Quebec and the Government of Canada in resolving this issue. 
They indicated that they were not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The representatives of the department did not know what point 
the millennium scholarship negotiations had reached.  They were 
unable to tell us, because the foundation had inherited the 
mandate.  This is the same sort of situation we could end up 
with in the case of the Canadian tourism commission and, 
furthermore, this is an area where little action may be taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an area where a lot of contracts are handed out.  It is 
an area where firms are told, for example, that the government 
wants to establish trade policy to sell Canada on Asian or 
American markets, and this sort of thing costs lots. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They could be sectors of activity where things must be done 
properly, but because of the way in which the government opts 
out of its responsibility for administering sums of money, there 
will be an opportunity for patronage without any requirement for 
accountability before the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that even for a federalist, even for someone who thinks 
it is a good idea for the Canadian tourism commission to invest 
in a provincial sector, questions remain.  Questions on the 
relevance and fairness of making it very easy to reward one's 
friends.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by stressing again that the Canadian tourism 
commission does not have the proper mandate to adequately 
promote tourism in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have developed tools to promote tourism in Quebec and we have 
a concerted approach. While there can be levels of services, 
common initiatives and exchanges in that area, there is no need 
for a superstructure such as the Canadian tourism commission, 
which will get involved in jurisdictions where Quebec is already 
very active. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think Quebecers will see with this initiative, as with others, 
that Canadian federalism does not serve them properly, it does 
not provide them with what they expect. For all these reasons, 
the Bloc Quebecois will vote against the bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
Canadian, I come from Ontario and I am an anglophone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I often visit Quebec, and I really like Quebecers, their culture 
and Quebec City. I am proud that the world's most beautiful 
francophone region is a part of Canada. As a Canadian, as a 
member of this House and as a colleague of the Bloquistes, I 
want to tell everyone that Quebec is the world's most beautiful 
francophone region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the hon. member: Why can we not share with 
you and tell people that Quebec is one of the world's most 
beautiful regions? I like that region, but unfortunately I do 
not speak French very well. It is the first time I ask a 
question in French in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B> This is an important moment, because it is a 
question that comes from the heart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the hon. member for 
his intervention in French. I have known him for several years 
now and I can tell he has made remarkable progress. I think he 
deserves our congratulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> However, I think that he proved the point I was 
making earlier. We are here to discuss the Canadian tourism 
commission and its mandate but we just heard an intervention 
aimed at selling Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad that the hon. member spoke in French. We understood 
clearly that what he was telling is that, basically, the mandate 
of the Canadian tourism commission is to promote Canada as a 
federation. That is what he said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I respect his opinion, but I do not think that we need the 
Canadian tourism commission to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as beauty is concerned, I agree with him that Quebec is a 
fantastic region, which is very unique in North America due to 
its French speaking majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I do not think that there is only one French speaking 
area in Canada. I believe that we are one of its two founding 
peoples, one of its two distinct societies. We have a right to 
try to find the best way to be represented within Canada, on 
large, medium and small issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit, however, that the Canadian tourism commission is not 
the good vehicle to sell our tourist attractions to the world.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have developed all the tools we need to be able to do that 
adequately. What we need much more from the federal government 
is to project, outside Canada, the image of a country where 
there is a francophone people. If this were the image projected 
in all Canadian embassies, it would make a much stronger 
contribution than creating a tourism commission with a very 
large board filled with the government's friends. The fact is 
that it will be able to get federal money in a sector it has no 
business being involved in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two years ago, the federal government said in the throne speech 
that it would get out of certain sectors, including tourism. 
Today, it is introducing a bill to establish the Canadian 
tourism commission. Where is the logic? It is an unseemly action 
similar to the Prime Minister's position on the issue of the 
majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are used to dealing with such situations. Our only wish is to 
end this debate by forming an economic partnership with Canada, 
on an equal footing, where we will have control of all the

the other person will always be recognized before a member from 
the same party.

Mr. Speaker, for respecting the rules of the House.  The member 
who spoke on the bill said that they could not support the bill 
in its current form.   That does not surprise me because they 
would not support it anyway, no matter what form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I get on to my question, I was disappointed because the 
member took this opportunity to take the bill in an entirely 
different direction, which is unfair to the industry, unfair to 
us, and unfair to the country.  For years the member for 
Broadview—Greenwood has been promoting tourism.  I commend him 
for it.  We have been presenting it as a pan-Canadian initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I compliment the member when he talks about the beautiful areas 
of Quebec.  I am very proud to say that my daughter will be 
teaching French next year.  We share its beauty and that of the 
rest of Canada.  On other hand, as the CTC is unfolding I want to 
clarify for members and the listeners out there that the Canadian 
Tourism Commission was there, is there and will continue to be 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a partnership agreement where the stakeholders come in and 
provide financial support along with government appropriations 
and proper accountability.  The sad part I heard while listening, 
as much as I heard many wonderful things, was the way it was 
portrayed in terms of marketing Canada or promoting federalism. 
The word propaganda was there.  There is no propaganda when we 
talk about the beauty of our country from coast to coast to 
coast, helping small businesses grow, bringing about employment 
and capturing the market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member tell me how the CTC, the government or any 
Canadian, could prevent any French speaking individual from any 
part of the globe from coming to Canada?  That I cannot see.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member says he is surprised and 
that our party would vote against the bill in any case.  I wish 
to remind him that, in this House, the opposition party that has 
most often voted with the government when bills were appropriate 
is the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no way that we can be accused of not making a 
constructive contribution to the debate. 
And as for the reason behind our present position, we wonder why 
the government introduced this bill.  The provinces, and more 
specifically Quebec, already have their own infrastructures, 
well developed tourism networks, and strategies geared to the 
needs and characteristics of their respective regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is particularly true for Quebec, as I explained in my 
speech.  It has a policy, and it has regional structures, in the 
form of regional tourism associations.  Tourism has taken off in 
Quebec in recent years, since we pooled all our resources, and 
we do not see the need for this kind of agency to help promote 
tourism in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the needs of each of the provinces be better served by the 
Canadian tourism commission, whose object is to promote several 
competing tourism products?  It will become a battle over 
whether to put more money into promoting Ontario, New Brunswick 
or Quebec, rather than letting each province organize its own 
tourism supply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not how tourism operates, and it brings politics into a 
sector where it is not needed.

begin my debate by recognizing how significant is the 
tourism industry.  I commend the level of debate that has taken 
place up to this point, especially by the hon. member opposite 
when he said how beautiful the provinces of Quebec and Ontario 
were, how people move back and forth between them, and the 
significance of tourism to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The constituency of Kelowna which I represent is actually in 
another world known as paradise.  It is a great and wonderful 
place.  It is a place that would stack up to anywhere.  I notice 
an hon. member clapping.  I agree with him.  It is a wonderful 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This demonstrates that western Canada, Quebec and all the rest 
of Canada benefit from tourism.  We need to get together in this 
whole operation.  The part that bothers me is that we would use 
this debate as some kind of a vehicle or wedge to drive between 
Canadians.  This should be a unifying activity, not a divisive 
one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I move to the actual substance of the bill I would first 
like to ask a question.  Why has the bill come before us?  The 
bill creates a tourist commission that already exists and will 
somehow create a crown corporation.  Why would this happen? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time we have the Canadian Tourist Commission. The 
bill will establish a crown corporation to be known as the 
Canadian Tourism Commission, which is the same agency that 
presently exists.  If the name is the same and if it is simply to 
create a crown corporation for something we already have, what is 
different? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I looked at the objectives of the corporation.  The bill says 
that the corporation shall sustain a vibrant and profitable 
Canadian tourism industry. 
That is the first point.  The second one is that it shall market 
Canada as a desirable tourist destination.   The third is that it 
shall support a co-operative relationship between the private 
sector and the governments of Canada, the provinces and the 
territories, with respect to Canadian tourism.  The final point 
is that it shall provide information about Canadian tourism to 
the private sector and to the governments of Canada, the 
provinces and the territories.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are wonderful objectives, but are they different or more 
comprehensive than what exists at the present time with the 
Canadian Tourism Commission?  I went to the commission and asked 
what was the issue.  Here are the exact statements from the 
Canadian Tourism Commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it exists at the present time the major purpose of the 
Canadian Tourism Commission is to create a vibrant and profitable 
part of the Canadian economy.  Let me go back to the first 
objective of the crown corporation:  to sustain a vibrant and 
profitable Canadian tourism industry.  With the exception of one 
or two different words the meaning is identical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go to the next one.  It states that the main thrust of 
the tourist commission as it exists today is to position Canada 
as a desirable destination to both international and domestic 
travellers.  If I look at the bill before us it states that its 
second objective is to market Canada as a desirable tourist 
destination.  What is the difference?  There is no difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the Canadian Tourism Commission as it exists today is a 
partnership among tourism industry businesses, provincial and 
territorial governments and the Government of Canada.  Lo and 
behold the bill before us states that it shall support a 
co-operative relationship between the private sector and the 
governments of Canada, the provinces and the territories with 
respect to Canadian tourism.  The only difference is in the order 
in which the words are presented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fail to see that the bill creates anything different from what 
we have today, except the relationship with the government is a 
bit different in the sense that it is now a crown corporation. It 
is currently an agency within a department and under the bill it 
will become a crown corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought then if there is not a difference in the objectives 
perhaps there could be a difference in the preamble that gave 
rise to the bill.  Very often it is in the preamble that we find 
the rationale that gives rise to the bill.  I examined it to see 
whether it materially justified and created a solid, sound and 
very substantive reason for the creation of a crown corporation. 
The preamble states: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas the Canadian tourism industry is vital to the social and 
cultural identity and integrity of Canada; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas the Canadian tourism industry makes an essential 
contribution to the economic well-being of Canadians and to the 
economic objectives of the Government of Canada; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas the Canadian tourism industry consists of mainly small 
and medium-sized businesses that are essential to Canada's goals 
for entrepreneurial development and job creation; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And whereas it is desirable to strengthen Canada's commitment to 
Canadian tourism by establishing a Tourism Commission that would 
work with the governments of the provinces and the territories 
and the Canadian tourism industry to promote the interests of 
that industry and to market Canada as a desirable tourist 
destination; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of 
the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, creates an act.  I 
emphasize the last paragraph I just read.  We have that, so what 
are we doing here? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What on earth possessed whoever it is who had the audacity to 
bring this matter to the House?  Why would something like this be 
done?  We have the commission.  We have the agency.  We have the 
minister.  Now we are to do it all over again.  How many 
different ways is a spare tire put on a car? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Perhaps that 
question will be answered the next time the bill comes before the 
House because the hon. member will have 13 minutes remaining. 
Unfortunately there is no time to hear the rest of his comments 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It being 1.30 p.m., the House will now proceed to the 
consideration of Private Members' Business as listed on today's

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.)</B>  moved 
that Bill C-223, an act to amend the Witness Protection Program 
Act and to make a related and consequential amendment to another 
act (protection of spouses whose life is in danger), be read the 
second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I will begin my remarks today by stating 
that this is an exciting day for me.  Although I have submitted 
private members' bills many times in the past six years, this is 
my first bill to be deemed votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-223, an act to amend the Witness Protection Program Act 
or the new identities act, as I have called it, attempts to 
accomplish one thing, to save lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my remarks today I will address the problem of domestic 
violence in our society, the inadequacies of our present laws, 
the current new identities program and explain the initiatives 
proposed in Bill C-223. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Domestic violence is one of the most horrendous problems facing 
our society.  It is my opinion, and that of the hundreds of women 
who have responded to this issue, that domestic violence is 
indeed a national problem deserving increased attention from 
parliament. I do not believe that we as parliamentarians have 
done enough to address the violence that all too often occurs 
behind closed doors.  This is an issue that requires us to put 
aside our partisan ways and address the true needs of those in 
danger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just listen to these statistics.  In 1996, 21,901 cases of 
spousal assault were recorded in a sample of 154 police 
departments across the country.  In 1996, approximately 80% of 
victims of criminal harassment or stalking were women.  Over half 
of all female victims of criminal harassment were harassed by 
ex-spouses or other intimate partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between 1977 and 1996, there were 2,048 spousal killings in 
Canada.  In over 56% of spousal homicides, investigating police 
officers had knowledge of previous domestic violence between 
victims and the suspects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process of eradicating domestic violence is not easy and I 
am fully aware that process will take some time.  In the 
meantime, there are women and children in our country who live in 
fear for their lives.  When I began to research this issue I was 
shocked by the lack of laws focused on preventing domestic 
violence and spousal abuse.  Aside from anti-stalking laws and 
restraining orders, there are few remedies available.  Most of 
the laws focus on punishment for crimes committed and are often 
too late for victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such was the case for Mary-Lynne Miller from Dawson Creek in my 
riding.  In February 1997 Brad Neuman, Miller's former common-law 
spouse while on probation beat her into a coma in her own 
apartment.  Mary-Lynne suffered on the floor with severe head 
injuries for over 21 hours before getting medical attention.  She 
remains in a coma to this very day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of Neuman's probation conditions was that he was to have no 
contact with Mary-Lynne Miller.  Other than go into hiding, 
Mary-Lynne could not ensure her own safety and paid a heavy 
price.  It was this case that really opened my eyes to the 
tragedy of domestic violence.  Sadly, there have been thousands 
of others equally tragic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In January of this year I was reading the Vancouver 
<I>Province</I> on my flight from Vancouver to Ottawa where I came 
across an article.  The story detailed a maverick program run by 
bureaucrats in the Department of Revenue Canada, in conjunction 
with Human Resources Development Canada, to provide new 
identities for those people who find themselves in life 
threatening situations.  It allows them to change their names and 
social insurance numbers in order to hide from an abusive spouse 
or former spouse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The woman featured in the article had endured beatings, death 
threats and emotional torture.  The new identities program helped 
her to relocate and get new documents.  Unfortunately, her 
academic credentials were not transferable to her new identity 
nor was her resume.  This meant finding any job she could in 
order to support herself and her child.  When her husband caught 
her trail again she would have to run and start the same panicked 
process of self-preservation over again.

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>After reading this article I felt frustrated and motivated to do 
something.  That is when I began to research this issue to seek 
out a solution.  The result is the bill before the House today. 
Originally numbered C-494 in the first session of this 
parliament, I sent copies of this bill and background material to 
over 500 women's shelters and transition houses across Canada 
seeking feedback and their input. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I got in return were letters of support; tragic, horrifying 
personal stories and petitions signed by hundreds of people in 
support of the bill. It was reassuring to know that those who 
deal with the brutality of spousal abuse on a daily basis endorse 
the principles contained in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This summer a woman contacted me after hearing about the bill. 
She came into my office in disguise to tell me firsthand the 
story of her abuse.  She has been on the run from her former 
husband for over 10 years.  She and her son live in a constant 
state of readiness to move.  Just this fall her husband, through 
a private investigator, found them again.  The threat of violence 
is so severe that her son's school was put on lock down to assure 
his safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She has been harassed, stalked, beaten, permanently disfigured 
and threatened with death.  It is hard to believe that these are 
Canadian citizens living in such fear in this very country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without a new identify, this woman is positive that her former 
husband will kill her.  Even though he has had several 
restraining orders filed against him there, is little that can be 
done until he decides to strike again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier in my remarks, the new identities program 
is an ad hoc program providing assistance to those in need. 
However, the program is not well known and operates without a 
mandate or formal funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the 
tremendous service that the bureaucrats in these departments have 
undertaken.  These individuals went far and beyond their job 
descriptions to help those in need.  They exemplify the true 
meaning of the term “public servants”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the witness protection program is the natural 
home for new identities.  Women brought into the program will 
benefit from the expertise and knowledge of the RCMP who already 
relocate crown witnesses.  All law enforcement agencies across 
the country are connected electronically, granting access to this 
program from the most remote reaches of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By bringing the new identities program under the Witness 
Protection Act, I believe we can do more for these women and 
their children.  The Witness Protection Act defines protection as 
including relocation, accommodation and change of identity, as 
well as counselling and financial support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This program is not for everyone.  In fact the exact opposite is 
the reality.  The new identities program is an escape of last 
resort for those who the law has failed and are in fear for their 
lives and the lives of their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listed earlier the tremendous sacrifices undertaken to change 
one's identity.  However, there are some in our society who would 
try to use such a program for ulterior motives.  To ensure this 
does not happen there is a list of factors or criteria to be 
considered for admission into this program:  the nature of the 
risk to the security of the person would be assessed; alternative 
methods of protecting the person without admission into this 
program would be considered; the nature of the injuries suffered 
by the person or the severe psychological damage inflicted by the 
spouse and any criminal history; the circumstances that cause the 
spouse to believe that their life is in danger would obviously be 
assessed; and, such other factors that the commissioner of the 
RCMP would deem relevant. I believe that the criteria are fair 
and will ensure that those who truly need the program will have 
access to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is supposed to be the best country in the world in which 
to live.  But for women living in fear from abusive spouses, it 
is a hell on earth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fully realize that according to the standing orders I can 
speak for 20 minutes when moving a votable bill.  Certainly this 
is such a tragically vital bill I could not do the subject proper 
justice if I spoke all day.  However, I believe in my heart that 
this issue is non-partisan and is of such a nature that I will 
limit my remarks in order to allow more members to participate in 
this important debate.

those most needing our help.

<P><A NAME="LINK324"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on Bill C-223, an 
act to amend the Witness Protection Program Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my hon. colleague said a few minutes ago, this bill 
transcends political issues and is totally non partisan. Our 
government wholeheartedly supports any measure to ensure the 
protection of people whose lives and sometimes the lives of 
their children are being threatened by a spouse or a former 
spouse. Nobody can really disagree with that. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an issue that this government has taken very seriously. 
A joint federal, provincial and territorial process has been in 
place for a number of years.  It is called new identities for 
victims in life threatening relationships.  It was developed 
under the leadership of Human Resources Development Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In situations where there is no other viable alternative, this 
initiative offers persons in life threatening relationships the 
opportunity to change their identities to avoid serious or fatal 
harm.  In short, it does what Bill C-223 seeks to do.  But the 
new identities initiative does so in a manner which, I would 
submit, is more acceptable. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will come back in a little while to the advantages of the new 
identities initiative compared with the provisions of Bill 
C-223, but first, I want to address in a broader way this issue 
of establishing new identities as a way to ensure the protection 
of victims of domestic violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given new identities to victims of life threatening domestic 
violence is an extreme measure that, for obvious reasons, can 
only be used under exceptional circumstances and as a last 
resort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New identities may ensure better protection, but do come with 
many problems. The people being given new identities must leave 
their community and break with their family and their friends. 
And where children are involved, things get a lot more 
complicated. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, although it is a matter of last resort, 
establishing a new identity is sometimes necessary.  Since 1992 
the joint federal, provincial and territorial new identities 
initiative has helped some 203 victims and is proving to be a 
very useful method of providing an additional measure of safety 
to those who are most at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a number of respects, Canada is at the very forefront of 
nations in its response to conjugal violence.  The new identities 
initiative is one of the areas where we are at the cutting edge. 
I understand that International Social Services Canada has made 
inquiries and found no other similar initiative in any other 
country except for the beginnings of a slightly similar process 
in the United States.  As such, Canada has much to be proud of. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, we can and must do more.  Education, counselling, 
prevention and other social service measures are essential if we 
are to do away with family violence.  When all else fails, we 
must take steps against the violent partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal, provincial and territorial partners have already 
worked on the development of a new identity program.  There is 
always room for improvement, but we do not need to reinvent the 
wheel.  We need to build on what is already established. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of unsettled questions.  In particular, there 
is the need for more formal co-ordination of the new identities 
program, a process in which, I would remind hon. members, the 
federal, provincial and territorial governments participate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also need to examine the eligibility criteria and issues 
relating to mobility, as well as the matter of the financing of 
a fully operative program.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these issues require consultation and co-ordination.  The 
issue of responding to spousal violence is one that is a shared 
responsibility for governments at all levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to report that officials are already examining 
possible improvements to the new identities initiative.  This 
month a federal-provincial-territorial working group has begun 
consultations to address the very questions that I have just 
raised. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That brings me to the question before the House, that is Bill 
C-223, whose object is to amend the Witness Protection Program 
Act so that situations of family violence would come under it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The witness protection program, run by the RCMP, is used to 
protect certain individuals who help in the application of the 
law.  A perfect example is the case of witnesses asked to 
testify in trials involving organized crime. 
So, naturally, this program concerns specific situations linked 
particularly to the application of the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process of establishing a new identity is a separate program 
run jointly by governments.  It applies to situations and 
persons other than those who come under the witness protection 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In essence, Bill C-223 would incorporate the security measures 
provided in new identities into the Witness Protection Program 
Act. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue before us is not whether we should seek to ensure that 
safety and security measures for victims of spousal violence are 
the best they can be.  Similarly, the issue is not whether we 
should take steps to build upon processes such as new identities. 
The issue is what steps should be taken.  My view is that Bill 
C-223 simply is not a proper step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have indicated, there are a number of specific questions 
that must be addressed if we are to build upon the excellent 
initiatives that have already been developed.  Bill C-223 does 
not answer the questions or address the issues that must be 
examined.  For those, consultations are necessary.  The process 
of holding these consultations has been put in place and is 
currently getting under way.  Proceeding with Bill C-223 would 
undercut this important process. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I admit that one of the solutions that could be considered in 
order to increase protection for victims of domestic abuse would 
be to incorporate the new identities process into the Witness 
Protection Program Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is clear from preliminary consultations with various 
interested agencies, including victims' rights groups, that 
including the protection of spouses in the Witness Protection 
Program Act is not the best solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before any thought is given to this option, the complex 
underlying issues must be resolved, particularly as regards the 
services available to victims and the co-ordination of action by 
the federal, provincial and territorial governments. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am saying that very sincerely.  I respect the initiative taken 
by the hon. member.  I share the objective that is pursued with 
this initiative.  These goals are fundamental, but the importance 
of this issue makes it necessary that we not take hasty steps. We 
must consult with those involved.  We must avoid imposing top 
down solutions that may undercut what has already been built. The 
working group now in place must be allowed to consider all the 
dimensions of the problem without being locked into one single 
solution.  For these reasons I do not support Bill C-223. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I conclude, it is important to note that yesterday was 
the United Nations International Day for the Elimination of 
Violence Against Women, and also the opening day of the white 
ribbon campaign commemorating the tragic killings of women in 
Montreal a few years past.  It is so very fitting that we have 
had the chance today to address an issue as important as conjugal 
violence within this context.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique—Mactaquac, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to rise again on behalf of the PC Party and my 
constituents of Tobique—Mactaquac. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me begin by stating that I have somewhat mixed reactions 
with regard to this bill.  At first glance I felt that this was a 
very important bill and I had hoped for it to receive positive 
consideration from all members of this House.  However after more 
careful review, it is evident that this bill is an attempt to 
enact legislation that already exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PC Party supports the premise behind this bill.  The PC 
Party has been consistent in its support of law and order, the 
protection of society and victims rights.  Other than the 
specific reference to spousal protection, every other amendment 
already exists in the current legislation. If the Reform Party 
feels that it is necessary to amend the legislation and make 
specific reference to the protection of spouses, then we will not 
oppose it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill itself will provide for the establishment and operation 
of a program to enable certain persons to receive protection in 
relation to certain inquiries, investigations or prosecutions and 
to enable certain spouses whose life is in danger to receive 
protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed legislation, like that of the current legislation, 
will protect those in society who are willing to come forward and 
testify against offenders who have the means to exact retribution 
from their accuser, even from a jail cell.  The special mention 
of spouses recognizes a common occurrence that has affected 
spouses of the accused in a negative manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Presently the criminal code states that we cannot force someone 
to testify against his or her spouse.  Rightly or wrongly, one 
could argue that this is one of the more noble sections of the 
criminal code.  Still the section has created problems for the 
justice system and the spouse of an accused offender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many cases the spouse of an accused offender often possesses 
the most intimate knowledge with regard to the accused.  Such 
knowledge often includes information that police and prosecutors 
need to obtain a conviction, yet spouses cannot be compelled to 
testify against each other.  This limitation for prosecutors can 
create real problems in securing a conviction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-223 recognizes that there are spouses who are willing to 
testify against their partners.  It also recognizes that the 
testimony of spouses is often required to bring some of the 
country's most notorious criminals to justice.  It also 
recognizes that many of these criminals have the means at their 
disposal to intimidate their spouse through threats of bodily 
harm, harm to their children, et cetera.  This intimidation can 
be initiated by the accused or by supporters of the accused.  The 
intimate knowledge that spouses have can also be used to the 
advantage of the accused.  The accused involved in these kinds of 
cases often possess knowledge of many effective scare tactics to 
use on their spouse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an attempt to correct this longstanding problem, the witness 
protection program was created.  Its role is to provide 
protection, a change of identity and location in exchange for 
testimony against a dangerous criminal.  This protection is 
offered to everyone, including spouses.  This is the reason I 
question the need to make amendments for the inclusion of 
spouses.  They are already included. If the House feels that such 
an amendment is necessary, our party will not oppose it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to witness protection, we do not know much about the 
program other than the basic facts.  The RCMP does not provide 
any more information than is required under Bill C-78 which was 
passed in 1996.  This legislation set out clear rules for witness 
protection but in the interests of safety, required only the 
disclosure of basic data. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we do know is that in trials where witness protection is 
needed, the testimony often comes from victims of the accused. 
Thus, the disclosure of more than the basic data could place at 
risk the lives of these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The witness protection program is not much of a reward for 
helping to place a criminal behind bars.  However, through the 
valiant efforts of the RCMP in this secretive operation, the 
witnesses in this program are at least safe from criminal 
retribution. In recent years, thanks to the Liberals' soft 
approach to crime and the gouging of RCMP budgets, all aspects of 
crime prevention have suffered.  This includes the witness 
protection program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Canadians are seeing the proliferation of criminal gangs 
across the country and increasing high tech crimes, drug 
smuggling and money laundering, we know that it is no longer the 
individual criminal who must be stopped but the entire 
organization to which the individual belongs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Liberal government, Canada has become a favourite home 
for organized crime. 
As I stated previously, when dealing with a criminal involved in 
organized crime, one deals with the entire organization. If a 
witness were to come forward to testify against the accused, he 
or she may suffer repercussions from the entire organization.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike in the movies, the organized crime groups of today do not 
subscribe to any code of honour.  In many cases if a person 
agrees to testify against one of their members, they will do 
their best to ensure that the person does not make it to the 
courtroom.  Without witnesses, there is no case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel that Bill C-223 helps bring attention to this fact but it 
would be easier to simply deal with the problem under the current 
act.  Bill C-223 will change the name of the witness protection 
program to the witness and spousal protection program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similar to the current act, Bill C-223 will promote law 
enforcement by facilitating the protection of persons who are 
involved directly or indirectly in providing assistance in law 
enforcement matters where the witnesses and spousal witnesses 
believe on reasonable grounds that their lives are in danger due 
to their testimony. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The term spouse will include a former spouse and a person who 
has cohabited with another person in a conjugal relationship for 
a period of not less than one year. We agree that the term spouse 
must be liberally applied so as to offer protection to all those 
who could be adversely affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also recognize that there will be those who will attempt to 
enter the program but do not need this sort of protection.  Thus, 
before a witness or a spouse can be placed in this program, they 
must be recommended by a law enforcement agency and the 
commissioner of the program must review the recommendation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, an agreement has to be made between the witness or 
spouse and the commissioner setting out the obligations of both 
parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are all positive steps but they already exist in the 
current legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the specific case of the spouse, section 7 of the act is 
amended to allow for the consideration of the following factors 
to determine whether a spouse should be admitted to the program: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) the nature of the risk to the security of the spouse; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) the nature of the injuries caused to the spouse or the severe 
psychological damage inflicted on the spouse by the other spouse 
and the criminal record, if any, of the other spouse; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) the circumstances that cause the spouse to believe that the 
spouse's life is in danger; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(d) alternate methods of protecting the spouse without admitting 
the spouse to the Program; and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(e) such other factors as the Commissioner deems relevant. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are all sensible recommendations that I feel will protect 
those who need protecting while eliminating from the process 
those who would abuse it.  Once again, I must state that the 
current legislation deals with such criteria for people in 
general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accountability is built into the selection process as it was in 
the previous legislation for cases of refusal.  In these cases 
the commissioner shall provide the law enforcement agency with 
written reasons to enable the agency or witness or spouse to 
understand the basis for the decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To sum up, I would like to thank the member for Prince 
George—Peace River for bringing the bill forward.  I feel that 
it is a good bill as it indirectly brings light to the lack of 
funding from the federal government for matters of public safety. 
It reinforces the existing efforts of law enforcement to ensure 
that witnesses will not be intimidated while performing their 
public duty.  We must ensure that criminals cannot exert a 
negative influence on our courtrooms and on our society in 
general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-223 does not change the existing legislation.  Yet if the 
debate shows that the House is in favour of specific spousal 
protection, the PC Party will have no problem in supporting the 
bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK326"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in support of Bill C-223. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate my colleague from Prince George—Peace River for 
taking a leadership role in this very important issue.  Like many 
of us, he has seen the result of spousal violence and it is a 
very sad thing indeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague has brought this bill forward because this issue is 
not formalized within the current statutes of the land and 
therefore, people are falling between the cracks. Furthermore 
there is not an opportunity for people whose lives are being 
threatened and whose children's lives potentially are being 
threatened to be aware of and access this type of program.  That 
is the only reason this bill is being put forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government is really interested in this as it has 
expressed today, then members should stand in the House and say 
they will support and enact the elements of Bill C-223 so that 
people who are living in fear for their lives will be protected.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ad hoc situation right now is okay, but it is not entirely 
acceptable.  There is much more that can be done and the bill 
enables us to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an issue of the protection of innocent people.  If a 
spouse is in fear of his or her life, we cannot empathize with 
the person unless we have been in such a situation to express 
stark terror. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague who spoke earlier in the House mentioned her friend 
who travelled all over the world to get away from a spouse who 
was terrorizing her.  Indeed she feared for her life.  She had to 
go to China.  She had to go to other parts of the world.  She 
could not use a credit card.  She could not even make a phone 
call back home because there was no way she could be protected in 
Canada.  What a sad reflection on our laws that they cannot 
protect people and their children who are being subjected to this 
type of terror. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also draw attention to an important issue that needs to be 
told.  It is politically incorrect to say so but I think we need 
to talk about it.  I am referring to the fact that spousal 
violence affects men and women.  Clearly there are women who are 
violated, but there are also men who are violated.  It is 
important to put it in the context of a genderless issue. Spousal 
violence is wrong regardless of who happens to be on either side. 
A man or a woman can be a victim and the assaulter can be a man 
or a woman.  We have to bear that in mind so that we establish a 
series of laws that will be fair regardless of gender and that 
the issue can be based on the people involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to speak about how we can deal with preventing 
spousal violence.  We do not mention heading it off at the pass. 
Right now police officers have a very difficult time protecting a 
person at home who is terrorized and whose life is in danger. 
Does somebody's jaw need to be broken or does somebody need to be 
assaulted in an egregious fashion or even killed before the 
police act?  Currently all too often we find that issues of 
spousal violence are swept under the carpet and that not enough 
protection is given to the spouse involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shelters exist to protect people, in this case it is usually 
women, but they are underfunded and there are not enough of them 
to handle the situation.  Furthermore the Reform Party believes 
that the courts and the system in place now do not do enough to 
protect that person whose life is terrorized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also draw attention to something very exciting that I learned 
about recently, the issue of victims rights.  Premier Harris is 
often accused of being a conservative person, somebody with whom 
we would see eye to eye on many principles as a provincial 
Conservative in Ontario.  He is accused of not really caring and 
being right wing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The office of the Attorney General of Ontario has set up, with 
Scott Newark and Sharon Rosenfeldt, the first victims rights 
element of an attorney general's office in the country.  No other 
province has one and it is possible that no state in the United 
States has such an organization.  Mr. Newark and Ms. Rosenfeldt 
are out there trying to ensure that victims rights are an 
integral element in the court system of Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the government will work with the Attorney General of 
Ontario and in fact spread that message across the country so 
that people living in other provinces and territories will have 
an opportunity to have access to the benefit of what is going on 
in Ontario.  It is very exciting.  It will formalize and put 
victims rights into the courts system so that victims will 
finally have a place in the system, will have their rights 
protected, and will have access to the care and treatment they 
require when they engage in the rehabilitation their souls 
require after being victimized.  It is a very constructive 
program.  I would strongly encourage the government to take a 
look at it and spread the word to the other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue raised earlier by one of my colleagues was that of 
the RCMP.  The province of British Columbia has a very serious 
situation on its hands.  Right now there is a severe lack of RCMP 
officers, as there are in other provinces.  This situation will 
only get a lot worse in the future.

<A HREF="#LINKT48"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The population of RCMP officers is aging.  When we look at the 
demands placed upon them and our needs in the future, we will 
have a shortfall far in excess of what we have today.  This is a 
serious situation.  How can we hope to be able to enforce the law 
if we do not have enough police officers out there to do the job? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general has spoken about this matter from time to 
time, but we have not heard any constructive solutions that will 
enable the RCMP to get the resources or have the numbers in its 
ranks to do its job.  That is not happening now.  We would be 
happy to work with members on the other side to make it a reality 
for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue I want to talk about is Correctional Service 
Canada.  A serious issue in British Columbia was recently brought 
to my attention.  Because of cost cutting, I would imagine, many 
or most of the anger management counsellors, psychologists, and 
such attached to the prisons are being replaced with correctional 
officers who have one or two weeks of training.  Correctional 
officers do an excellent job, a difficult task at that, but they 
are not counsellors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are cutting our noses off to spite our faces.  If we do not 
allow the penal system to have the anger management counsellors, 
the psychologists and the drug rehabilitation experts who deal 
with the people once they are in jail and with those factors that 
contributed to their coming in front of the judicial system, then 
those released from jail will be worse off than they when came 
in. We will be releasing people who have a much higher chance of 
engaging in another criminal act, only to be put through the 
courts again.  Not only is this utterly expensive, but it is also 
inhuman to the Canadian public.  It is unworkable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I ask the Minister of Justice to work with the solicitor 
general and to work with their provincial counterparts, 
particularly those in the province of British Columbia, to make 
sure that we reverse this trend and that the correctional system 
will have the capability of hiring those people who are an 
essential part of the rehabilitation process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last issue I would like to address is the issue of organized 
crime.  The Reform Party has been pushing the government for many 
years to take some immediate and urgent action to deal with 
organized crime.  More than half the crime in the nation is 
related in some way to organized crime.  An example of smuggling 
people was raised earlier, which is attached to organized crime. 
In many cases in British Columbia it is attached to Chinese 
gangs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hardly heard anything from the government on the issue of how 
to deal with organize crime.  Again I ask the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs to work with the Minister of Justice to call together 
other nations in the world suffering from a similar problem to 
develop a rules based method and a system of attacking organized 
criminal syndicates which are multinational in nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also on the issue of crime prevention I bring to the attention 
of the minister the head start program, which is exceptionally 
good at preventing crime, and the work of the National Crime 
Prevention Council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I compliment the member for Prince George—Peace 
River for putting together Bill C-223.  Members on the other side 
mentioned that they were sympathetic toward it.  We ask that the 
government act and act now before more victims show up on our 
doorstep. 
<P><A NAME="LINK327"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
please to have the opportunity to address Bill C-223, an act to 
amend the witness protection program.  I acknowledge the 
initiative of the member for Prince George—Peace River in 
bringing the issue before the House for consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill seeks to address the protection of spousal abuse 
victims under the witness protection program.  There is no doubt 
that the victims of spousal abuse are in an extremely difficult 
and sometimes even life threatening situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As all of us are aware most of the victims are women.  Often 
their children are involved as well.  Addressing their needs and 
ensuring their safety have involved many agencies in our 
communities: government and social services, law enforcement, and 
as voluntary and non-profit organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the federal government has an important role to play in 
this regard, it is my view that the safety of victims of spousal 
abuse will not be improved by going forward with the measures 
under Bill C-223 at this time. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1410"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT49"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to explain why Bill C-223 is not the right initiative 
let me first say a few words about the Canadian witness 
protection program.  The program is managed by our national 
police force, the RCMP.  It has become an important weapon in the 
law enforcement arsenal of investigative techniques.  Its primary 
use has been to protect witnesses who may be at risk because they 
assisted with police investigations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it was formalized into legislation in 1996, it was enacted 
as a federal government initiative in partnership with provincial 
and territorial governments and law enforcement organizations to 
combat organized crime.  Historically witness protection programs 
are most closely associated with the investigation of organized 
crime.  As most of us know, organized crime covers a broad range 
of criminal activity, including large scale drug trafficking, 
murder, serious assault, money laundering and extortion, and 
robbery.  As often as not, these crimes go hand in hand with the 
use of fear and intimidation to ensure the silence of potential 
witnesses and informants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, witness protection today has a broader application.  A 
disturbing trend in recent years has been the use of fear and 
intimidation by lone criminals.  These people are willing to go 
to any length to avoid conviction or to extract retribution from 
witnesses.  As a consequence there are a growing number of people 
who need protection as a result of their roles in cases that have 
nothing to do with organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To deal with this growing need for witness and informant 
protection in response to the increased enforcement priority 
placed on fighting major national and international drug 
trafficking organizations, the RCMP source witness protection 
program was started in 1984.  It was the forerunner of the 
legislative program now in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current program offers protective services to provincial and 
municipal police forces across Canada.  While many of these 
police forces rely entirely on the RCMP for witness protection 
services, some of the larger police departments also have their 
own witness protection initiatives.  Obviously not every witness 
qualifies for witness protection despite numerous serious 
assaults that take place in Canada each year.  The RCMP and other 
police forces must exercise care and good judgment when deciding 
who is eligible for witness protection and who is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the years witness protection programs of the RCMP and other 
police departments have become highly effective enforcement tools 
against criminals who previously were able to use threats and 
violence against witnesses as a means to avoid prosecution and 
conviction.  Witnesses and informants who assist the police are 
an invaluable asset to the criminal justice system and in many 
cases their testimony cannot be replaced by any other 
investigative means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is especially true in drug enforcement.  Here the 
availability of the RCMP witness protection program has prompted 
informants and witnesses to come forward to assist the police and 
to testify in court against major national and international drug 
traffickers.  These witnesses have provided crucial firsthand 
information to further investigations which otherwise would have 
been obtained at considerable cost in police resources, human or 
otherwise, or not at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Major police investigations often require the police to use a 
wide variety of investigative techniques.  A witness protection 
program is one of the most sensitive of these techniques. Witness 
protection is not a cure for violent crime or organized crime, 
but it is an important tool that is being used for law 
enforcement investigations, one that has been of major help to 
police in fighting organized and serious crime in Canada.  For 
that reason I do not think the special needs of the victims of 
family violence would best be addressed by simply tacking spousal 
safety measures on to this law enforcement program as suggested 
by Bill C-223. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Family violence is more than just a law enforcement issue. While 
enforcement certainly plays a role in addressing the problem, 
family violence is a problem that Canadians have also addressed 
through social services such as counselling to ensure the 
well-being of spousal abuse victims and their families.  A 
response of this kind is not within the normal domain of a police 
administered witness protection program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government currently addresses family violence 
through a number of programs in place.  In addition, the national 
strategy on community safety and crime prevention has funded 
several community programs to address the problem.  The federal 
government has renewed its commitment to reduce family violence 
in Canada.  The family violence initiative promotes public 
awareness of the risk factors of family violence and the need for 
public involvement in responding to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The initiative has strengthened the ability of the criminal 
justice system and the housing system to respond.  It supports 
data collection and research and evaluation efforts to identify 
effective interventions.  It is an initiative that marks a new 
stage in federal efforts to reduce family violence.  The issue of 
family violence has been integrated into ongoing programs in many 
government departments.  We have learned that the best way to 
address family violence is to support a common vision and a 
co-ordinated approach.

<A HREF="#LINKT50"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This does not mean, of course, that we can ignore the very real 
security issues that arise in spousal abuse situations.  These 
issues must be addressed as part of a co-ordinated approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to say that there is, in fact, a national 
initiative in place to assist certain spousal abuse victims.  It 
has been developed with provincial and territorial partners under 
the leadership and co-ordination of Human Resources Development 
Canada.  The initiative is called the “New Identities Program” 
and it is for victims of life threatening relationships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This initiative allows a chance for abused spouses and their 
children to start new lives in greater safety and security. 
Various measures taken under this process are designed to help 
remove those at risk from the access of their abusers and to 
ensure that their safety and security is maintained.  It is, of 
course, a measure of last resort, since removal of the victims 
can create hardships on the victims themselves.  It is only used 
in exceptional cases where other safety measures have been or 
will be inadequate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our present day responses to spousal abuse can always be 
improved, but I believe that the specific measures under Bill 
C-223 are not the best way to do this.  While the proposals in 
Bill C-223 may appear to offer a response to the immediate 
security concerns of spousal abuse victims, it may not best serve 
their interests when there are other more appropriate and viable 
alternatives possible.  These alternatives, which build on what 
is already in place, must be pursued. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among the possible alternatives is that some future connection 
to the witness protection program may be considered.  However, 
the various alternatives must be fully evaluated together and 
should be allowed to evolve out of the current spousal security 
measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not predetermine a single choice and implement it 
through an unco-ordinated mingling of different initiatives.  Let 
us not forget the role of the provinces and territories in this 
matter.  Providing support for victims of family violence 
includes important elements falling under provincial 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provincial consultation and co-ordination are absolutely vital 
to the success of additional efforts in this area.  Of course, we 
also cannot forget the needs and concerns of those who would be 
directly affected, the family violence victims themselves. 
Establishing a new identity is only part of the solution and it 
cannot be considered separately from other needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Human Resources Development Canada is taking steps to improve 
the new identities program.  It has established a working group 
that includes the provinces and territories to examine possible 
changes and suggested improvements in consultation with victims' 
groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is seeking to improve Canada's response 
to family violence.  We do that through our family violence 
initiative.  We do it through our national strategy on community 
safety and crime prevention and we do it through what Human 
Resources Development Canada is doing right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe our best option is to let existing programs and 
processes continue their excellent work.  We should support those 
efforts currently under way. 
<P><A NAME="LINK328"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is interesting that the government 
talks about these interesting programs.  It is interesting that 
the Liberals have shown such concern for children in the Speech 
from the Throne.  It is interesting that the government professes 
to be so concerned about women's issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, we heard the government member say “Let the programs do 
their job.  They are working well”.  I would suggest that they 
are not working well because people do not even know these 
programs exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were three issues that surprised me when I became a member 
of parliament six years ago which concern the number of 
individuals who have issues they cannot deal with and who have no 
idea where to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first issue was that when people are being harassed and 
threatened by Revenue Canada, they have no idea how to fight the 
taxman.  It is very difficult for most Canadians to use the very 
expensive court process and legal process to fight their own 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second issue was the number of concerned fathers who came to 
my office because they had lost access to their children.  The 
courts would not recognize that they had any right to continue to 
be fathers and to have access to their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third issue was the number of women who came into my office 
with horrific examples of what they had to put up with, and there 
was no protection for them from spousal abuse.  A number of women 
had tried to use the legal process.  A number of women had gone 
to court to get restraining orders.  They found, usually through 
a violent episode, that restraining orders really do not mean a 
whole lot.  Those restraining orders do not allow anybody to 
protect them from somebody physically threatening their life or 
abusing them physically.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The courts are not in a position through restraining orders to 
deal with this.  The police are not in a position through 
restraining orders to deal with this.  There is nothing in 
legislation that gives the courts or the police a way to offer 
these women and children a way out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that I do not stand alone as a member of parliament in 
having these women and fathers come into my office.  Some of the 
situations that the women find themselves in are horrific.  One 
woman came in who had been stabbed seven times by her previous 
spouse.  The court would not find that it was attempted murder. 
He was charged and convicted of assault.  She could not even have 
him incarcerated for a long period of time to give her some 
freedom from worrying about her life and the lives of her 
children, because it was becoming threatening to them as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know how many members of the House have heard stories 
of women who are trying to remove themselves from these 
situations, who are trying to find safe havens.  Having gone on a 
ride along with the RCMP I know they do their best in driving by 
these safe homes for women, the hostels that are set up so that 
women have a place to go when they leave their homes.  They have 
to find safe havens for themselves and their children in 
circumstances of abuse.  I know that the police try their best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in Montreal an ex-spouse actually went into a hostel, 
into a women's shelter, and shot his wife dead, so even those 
shelters cannot provide a safe haven for women who are afraid for 
their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had an incident in Vernon, B.C. where a spouse not only 
murdered his wife, but her whole family.  I believe there were 
seven or eight people whom he managed to wipe out in that one 
event. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to ask myself why the government cannot see that until we 
have specific legislation that the courts can refer to, that the 
police community can refer to, there will not and cannot be a 
safe haven for women who are trying to remove themselves from 
this constant threat of violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can a government that professes to be so concerned about the 
children of Canada not realize that with these women are usually 
children, children who may have been abused by their fathers or 
mothers, and if not abused then they are certainly part of this 
threat of violence to their mothers, this threat of death to 
their mothers?  These children are being uprooted and moved from 
community to community.  They cannot stay in the same school for 
any length of time.  They cannot keep the same friends.  They may 
not even be allowed to have an association with their extended 
families.  They live in a constant state of fear and mobility. 
For a government that is so concerned about the welfare of the 
children of this country, we would think that it would see the 
need to have some statutory protection, some vehicle by which the 
courts and the police community could direct women who are in 
such fear for their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not something that women would do or that families would 
do for a lark.  For people to give up their security within a 
family unit must be very, very hard indeed.  They give up the 
stability of that history.  They do not have a background to fall 
back on.  They give up their identity.  For people to give up 
these things for long periods of time cannot be easy. 
This is not something that would be abused.  This is something 
that would be used as a very last resort by persons who have no 
other options.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not see why it should be so daunting for the government to 
consider a legislative remedy to protect women and children. 
Perhaps some men might be in the same position, but I think we 
all recognize that the majority of people who may find themselves 
in this position are women and possibly the children with them. I 
am sure that most members in the House have examples to support 
why this bill is badly needed by society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As in most cases, the government is reluctant to take a bold 
step forward.  It says that we cannot use the witness protection 
program because it is outside the limits and because witness 
protection is used to further the investigative arm of the police 
department.  Why can that not be changed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why can the aspect of protection programs not be expanded to 
recognize that there are more people in society who may need 
protection, who may need identity changes and the start of a new 
life than people who are going to be ratting on someone in a 
court of law?  Why can it not be expanded?  The government has 
expanded other legislation to broaden its dimensions.  Why can 
the legislation not be broadened? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard that the government feels that the program, which 
is a joint program between the Minister of Finance and, I 
believe, human resources, is working just fine.  I suggest that 
it is not working just fine.  Most women who are afraid for their 
lives do not know about the program.  How are they supposed to 
find out about it?  The police do not even know about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have talked to the prosecutor's office in Surrey.  There are 
working groups that are trying to deal with this issue.  I do not 
recall hearing this program mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people who are trying to find an answer for women who are in 
distress and who are looking for a safe haven do not know about 
the program and the police departments are not aware of it. 
Therefore how can they refer families to it?  How can the people 
who are looking for answers and help know about it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government is serious about protecting the children and 
women who are fearful for their lives, then the government has 
the responsibility to do something about it.  And it should not 
just study it for another 10 or 15 years.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will use the two minutes remaining to quickly clarify some of the 
things that were spoken about this afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been some discussion about whether or not we need this 
bill.  Let me clarify what the hon. member from Prince George is 
attempting to to with the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill on the RCMP witness protection program serves as a 
last ditch safety net for spouses in cases where counselling and 
criminal law measures have proved ineffective, with the result 
that their very lives are in danger. Special protection is 
allowed for witnesses who are in jeopardy because of involvement 
in police activity but interestingly enough, we do not have any 
vehicle for spouses to access that same protection.  We can 
protect witnesses but not spouses who are subject to violent 
abuse.  The addition in this bill would allow spouses to access 
that kind of protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to the House.  We have heard some people say that we do 
need this bill and others say we do not need it.  Clearly we do 
need it and I support the bill.  The best thing we can do when 
this comes to a vote, which it will, is to pass the bill, get it 
into committee and get this clarified so that we do not leave the 
door open for more harm and damage to families and spouses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Calgary Centre will have approximately eight minutes when next 
the bill comes to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time provided for the consideration of Private Members' 
Business has now expired and the order is dropped to the bottom 
of the order of precedence on the order paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It being 2.31 p.m., the House stands adjourned until Monday next 
at 11 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 2.30 p.m.)
