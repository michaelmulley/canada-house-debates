	<B>Ms. Judy Bethel (Edmonton East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
premier of Alberta recently received a B-plus grade from the 
Fraser Institute for his government's approach to fiscal 
management and deficit reduction in my province. In its eyes he 
is an honour student.
<P>
	However in another report card, one given by the people of 
Alberta, the premier received a failing grade for his approach in 
cutting essential services. The disapproval is growing. Some 69 
per cent believe changes in health care services have been 
brought about irresponsibly while 67 per cent disapprove of how 
the province has handled cuts in education.
<P>
	Albertans, like all Canadians, support leaner and more 
efficient government but they will not accept an assault on their 
most valued and essential services. The premier's approach may 
be praised by a few but it is not a responsible one in the eyes of 
many.
<P>
	The federal government on the other hand will act responsibly 
in the upcoming budget by controlling spending and reducing 
waste. However we refuse to sacrifice the things that Canadians 
value most for the sake of a few accolades.

	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Quebec seniors' federation or Fédération de l'âge d'or du 
Québec celebrated its 25th anniversary yesterday. On this 
occasion, its president, Mr. Philippe Lapointe, reiterated the 
FADOQ's commitment to participate in the important 
discussions on sovereignty and on the reform of social 
programs, in which the Fédération was quick to support the 
students.
<P>
	Seniors are currently taking part in the vital process of 
consultation on the future of Quebec. Every day, the 
Commission des aînés meets with many seniors who come to 
voice their questions, fears and aspirations.
<P>
	Mr. Lapointe said the FADOQ would follow the debate 
closely. The Bloc Quebecois is delighted by the calm and 
watchful attitude of the FADOQ and hopes that its members will 
participate actively in the consultation process so they may 
define the country they helped build.

	<B>Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz (Yellowhead, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, over 
the years western economic diversification has sunk taxpayers' 
money into all kinds of projects: the Custom Gourmet Coffee 
Shop, Dave's Pizza, Imperial Oil. Even Novatel had the pleasure 
of receiving taxpayers' dollars courtesy of WED.
<P>
	Today taxpayers can take delight in knowing their hard earned 
dollars are going to yet another worthy project, the Artificial 
Reef Society of British Columbia. WED is loaning $160,000 to 
this group so it can buy a ship from DND. It wants to use 
government money to buy a government ship so it can be towed 
out to sea and sunk.
<P>
	What an investment. To top it off this group claims it will pay 
WED off by selling salvaged boat parts. We hear old boat parts 
are selling like hotcakes. WED will be repaid its $160,000 in no 
time flat at the used boat flea market.

	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to take this opportunity to honour the life of a great 
Canadian and former Lieutenant-Governor who passed away 
recently.
<P>
	Dr. J. A. Doiron was one of the first Acadians on Prince 
Edward Island to serve as the Queen's representative as 
Lieutenant-Governor.
<P>
	Dr. Doiron was a true patriot both to his country as well as to 
his Acadian heritage. It was his belief that to understand the 
heritage of all Canadians was the first step in building a strong 
Canada. He took pride in serving as one of the only bilingual 
dentists on Prince Edward Island and was a member in many 
island francophone organizations. Dr. Doiron received honorary 
doctoral degrees in humanities, laws and the social sciences.
<P>
	Perhaps one of his proudest moments was receiving the Order 
of Canada in July of last year. Dr. Doiron was a true gentleman, 
was loved by all who knew him and will be missed dearly by his 
family, friends and all Islanders.

<P>
	On behalf of the ethanol task force, I wish to thank the Prime 
Minister, the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food and the 
Minister of the Environment for their commitment to making 
domestic ethanol production a reality.
<P>
	This program has already inspired nearly $300 million in 
private investment for two ethanol plants in Ontario alone. 
These plants are expected to create 1,500 construction jobs, 150 
permanent jobs and add $175 million annually to the local 
economies of Chatham and Cornwall.
<P>
	As the name of the program suggests, this is a national 
program and all of Canada will benefit from this announcement. 
Canadians will now be able to use renewable, clean air fuel which 
is domestically produced from Canadian biomass.

offensive action in Chiapas and who proposed a truce to the 
rebels of the Zapatista National Liberation Army.
<P>
	We hope that the resignation of the governor of the state of 
Chiapas will help bring peace once again to the region.
<P>
	Let us hope now that the Mexican government will take 
whatever steps are required to improve the appalling living 
conditions of the Indians in the state and that it will succeed in 
changing the region's political and economic structures in the 
near future, so that the claims of the people of Chiapas may be 
defended fairly within the law. By proposing to bring a return to 
peace and avoid armed confrontation, the Mexican government 
is giving us hope for the future.

	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
Sunday, February 12, 1995, 2,500 citizens of Surrey, B.C. 
braved the elements to join Mr. and Mrs. Steven Carpenter's 
walk in memory of their daughter Melanie who was tragically 
slain in early January.
<P>
	Today in my riding, the citizens of Cranbrook, British 
Columbia are conducting their own march in support of the 
Carpenter family and to speak out against early parole of 
dangerous offenders. The march is spontaneous. It is grass roots. 
I commend the efforts of my constituents and only wish I could 
join them.
<P>
	Fernand Auger, the suspected assailant of Melanie Carpenter, 
only served two-thirds of his sentence and was obviously not 
rehabilitated, let alone ready to be released into society.
<P>
	The Liberal government has shown in the past that it is not 
interested in listening to the concerns of Canadians. I therefore 
implore the justice minister to listen to the hundreds of 
thousands of Canadians who are worried for the safety of their 
families and support my Reform colleague's Bill C-240 which 
would prolong the detention of these high risk offenders.

	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, as we approach the release date of the federal 
budget, Canadians are expressing some very strong opinions 
about what should be and should not be contained in that budget.
<P>
	One thing we should not overlook in this process is that the 
current emphasis on expenditure cuts will leave people living in 
rural areas of Canada more adversely affected than their urban 
neighbours.
<P>
	If the emphasis remains where it is today, the reduction in 
rural services, which began with former Prime Minister Brian 
Mulroney's cuts and closures to post offices, will continue in 
transportation and rural support services. For example, the 
national highways program is threatened, the rail system is 
under attack and rural local airports have lost support.
<P>
	Rural residents will find that they have to go further and spend 
more money to maintain their quality of life because of these 
and other cuts.
<P>
	The policies expressed and implied by the federal finance 
minister are not being delivered in a fair or even handed way and 
Canadians should take note of this.

have expressed abhorrence concerning videotaped hazing 
rituals and other deplorable conduct that has occurred within our 
military service.
<P>
	The reputation of the Canadian military has been significantly 
harmed by these revelations. To suggest that these activities are 
innocuous or nothing more than male bonding essential to 
teamwork is an affront to dignity and common sense.
<P>
	What we have witnessed is human degradation, racism and 
other completely unacceptable activities. The Minister of 
National Defence has acted prudently, expeditiously and 
decisively in order to send a clear message from the bottom to 
the top of the military establishment that these activities are a 
disgrace to our proud military tradition and that they will not be 
tolerated now or ever.

are working hard to restore integrity and professionalism in the 
military and to restore its now tarnished image.

today to Dr. George Stanley.
<P>
<B>(1410 ) </B>
<P>
	Dr. Stanley is a former Lieutenant-Governor of New 
Brunswick and a key player in designing the Canadian flag.
<P>
	During Dr. Stanley's tenure as dean of arts at Canada's Royal 
Military College in Kingston, he drew a design of a maple leaf 
placed on a red and white background. This design Dr. Stanley 
modelled after the college's own flag.
<P>
	On February 15, 1965, the maple leaf was raised over 
Parliament Hill. To quote Dr. Stanley:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A flag is more than a means of identification. It is the embodiment of what a 
country stands for: It is the symbol of the ethos or spirit of a people, its 
aspirations, its will to live and its determination to play its role in history.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	How true are those words, Mr. Speaker. I add that our flag is 
also the symbol of unity, one that speaks for all the citizens of 
Canada.

	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, a decision handed down by the Ontario Court 
highlights the need to adopt legislation to establish the legal and 
ethical framework for new reproductive technologies. After 
separating from his wife, a man was declared the legal father of 
a female child, although the child was conceived by artificial 
insemination from an unnamed donor.
<P>
	In the absence of legislation on new reproductive 
technologies, the judge gave priority to the child's interests, but 
there is nothing to say that this will always be the case.
<P>
	This situation points to the important impact of new 
reproductive technologies on the people who use them. The 
government has not yet stated that it will soon introduce a bill to 
prevent potential abuses in this area. Is it waiting for a mockery 
to be made of children and parents' rights before taking action?

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TRANSFERPAYMENTS">TRANSFER PAYMENTS</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday, the Prime Minister said in this House that his 
government was preparing to offload financial responsibilities 
on the provinces without giving them sufficient resources, let 
alone tax points, to deal with this new development.
<P>
	Would the Minister of Finance confirm that in his next two 
budgets, thus reflecting what was said by the Prime Minister, he 
is planning a wholesale shift of certain federal commitments to 
the provinces, without transferring the requisite financial and 
fiscal resources?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, yesterday we had 
an excellent meeting and some very useful discussions with the 
provincial Finance ministers. I presented them with the main 
parameters of the reforms we have in mind. First of all, I told 
them there would be no surprises and second, before anything is 
done affecting the provinces, we will first look at federal 
spending. I think the message was very well received and that 
these discussions came at the right time. I am very pleased with 
the meeting we had yesterday.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, would 
the Minister of Finance agree that no matter how he intends to 
shift the burden of financial problems on to the provinces, 
nothing will change as far as the Canadian taxpayer is 
concerned, since if the federal government manages to lighten 
its debt load by transferring part of it or part of the deficit to the 
provinces, as far as the average citizen is concerned, the 
financial problem remains the same? Would he agree that is 
basically what his approach boils down to?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the answer is, of 
course, no. We are not dumping our problems on the provinces. 
Yesterday's discussion was about the fact that we have a national 
problem, at the federal level and at the provincial level. The 
Quebec Minister of Finance agreed, incidentally. Upon leaving 
the meeting, he said there was a consensus on the need for all 
levels of government to work together. And that is what we 
intend to do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Finance may wish to refer to certain statements by 
the ministers, including the minister from Quebec who said that 
this approach would become a disaster for Quebec in 1996.
<P>
	Would the Minister of Finance agree that his decision to 
postpone until next year the drastic cuts he intends to make in 
transfer payments to the provinces for social programs 
financing was made in order to avoid weakening the federal 
position on the eve of the referendum? Will he be frank and 
forthright and admit that major cuts are to be postponed until 
next year, for purely political reasons?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, in our last 
February budget, we made it very clear to the provinces that we 
intended to examine the matter of transfer payments in 1996-97. 
In other words, what we did yesterday was entirely in line with 
what we said in our last budget.
<P>
	Second, what I did yesterday and my announcement about the 
one year postponement was something we promised in the red 
book, and I would advise the hon. member to read his copy 
again.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, during his meeting with his provincial counterparts, 
the federal Minister of Finance carefully avoided discussing the 
issue of the GST replacement which, according to the 
commitment made in the red book, should normally be 
implemented next year. I would ask him to reread the red book, 
since the commitment was made in it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9651"> 9651 </A></B>
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. Will the minister 
concede that he refused to discuss the issue of reforming the 
GST because Alberta, and especially Quebec, want nothing to 
do with a national sales tax that would limit their freedom to 
tax when Ottawa is also preparing to reduce transfer payments 
to the provinces?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the specific 
purpose of yesterday's meeting was to exchange points of view 
on budgetary issues because the federal government is getting 
ready to table its budget, and several provinces, for example 
Saskatchewan and Alberta, will also be tabling theirs very 
shortly. So, the meeting was quite short and its only objective 
was really to air viewpoints on the upcoming budgets.
<P>
	Furthermore, I do not need to reread the red book; 
unfortunately or fortunately, I know it by heart.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, how can the Minister of Finance plan, on the one hand, 
to reduce the provinces' transfer payments, which will cause a 
shortfall in social program funding, and on the other, to shrink 
their tax bases by putting in place a Canada-wide sales tax 
which would replace provincial sales taxes? Can he explain this 
to us?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in yesterday's 
meeting which I must say was very constructive all the 
provincial finance ministers without exception basically 
recognized that we have a huge problem at the federal level and 
at the provincial levels and that it is crucial we work together to 
solve it. That is really the spirit that animated the entire 
meeting.
<P>
	As far as the sales tax is concerned, that was not the purpose of 
the meeting. I find it incredibly difficult given the tremendous 
desire of the business community and consumers across this 
country in every province, including Quebec-all one has to 
look at is the Conseil du patronat, the consumers associations in 
Quebec-that everybody in Quebec wants a national sales tax so 
that we can lower the cost and make it fair.
<P>
	The only people I know who are against it are Bloc Quebecois 
members. Then again, they are against everything.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, after weeks of telling this House that he could not 
reveal the contents of the budget, the finance minister appears to 
have spilled the beans to his provincial counterparts and the 
national media. He indicated yesterday that he intends to raise 
taxes on corporations and so-called better off Canadians.
<P>
	At what levels of household income does one become a better 
off Canadian and therefore a target for a tax increase?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the discussion we 
had yesterday with the provincial finance ministers, which was 
actually the second because we had one prior to the last budget, 
was very worthwhile. It is really part of making federalism work 
when finance ministers can sit down and basically off the record 
exchange views and build a common consensus. It was very 
good.
<P>
	I did not go into complete detail. What I did was provide the 
broad outlines, and they did as far as I was concerned.
<P>
	The point I made yesterday in terms of taxes was that I pointed 
out what I thought was a reasonably perceptive glance into the 
obvious. However, I will draw it to the member's attention 
again. We are going to close loopholes. To the best of my 
knowledge it is not the poor in this country who are utilizing 
loopholes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Finance of all people must understand 
the impact of tax increases on the economy. If tax levels or other 
charges paid to governments are increased, one effect is to drive 
capital, jobs and companies out of the country.
<P>
	Canada Steamships, for example, which is owned by prudent 
and patriotic people, has registered a number of its vessels under 
foreign flags of convenience to no doubt avoid paying 
astronomical registration charges, et cetera.
<P>
<B>(1425 ) </B>
<P>
	Does the minister not agree that there will be a flight of 
capital, companies, jobs and productive individuals out of 
Canada if they are the targets of tax increases in the next budget?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would suggest to 
the leader of the third party that if he wants to go into the details 
of any company with which I happen to have had some 
association all he has to do is talk to the Ethics Commissioner 
who would be delighted to lay the whole thing out in front of 
him.
<P>
	I would also suggest that if the leader of the third party wants 
a lesson in international taxation I am sure that some of his 
colleagues might explain it to him so that he might begin to 
understand it.
<P>
	There is no doubt that any country must be competitive in its 
tax policies. I can assure the hon. member that we are not the 
party that brought in 39 tax increases in a row. We are the party 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9652"> 9652 </A></B>
<P>
that in the last budget dealt very fairly with the whole question 
of taxes. I do not believe that corporate Canada is so shaky that  
making the tax system fairer is going to make it leave the 
country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the present premier of Ontario was chosen as citizen of 
the year in Buffalo, New York because his tax and spend policies 
drove so many companies across the line to Buffalo, New York.
<P>
	Is it the aim of the finance minister to become citizen of the 
year in Panama by including tax increases in his next budget?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is not the height 
of my ambition to stand up in this House and defend the current 
premier of Ontario.
<P>
	All I can say to the hon. member is that he is obviously a far 
greater expert on taxation in Panama and so I will let him answer 
his own question.

	As I mentioned yesterday, I am disappointed at the approach

<P>
	In the meantime, let me address the specific questions asked 
by the hon. member. With the enactment of this legislation 
commencing in January of next year the registration system will 
be under way. Two years after that the registration of firearms 
will commence. By reason of incentives for early registration 
we fully expect that registration will be in place within two or 
three years of the undertaking of the program, which I think is an 
objective for which we should all work together.

some 60,000 new jobs for young people in this country. The 
unemployment rate is now down to its lowest level since 1990. 
Of those 60,000 jobs, over 15,000 were as a direct result of

	Next week, the Prime Minister is scheduled to ratify with 
President Clinton a treaty to liberalize Canadian-American air 
space and provide Canadian carriers better access to the 
lucrative U.S. market, particularly at the New York and Chicago 
airports.
<P>
	Since the Minister of Transport deprived Air Canada of the 
very lucrative Asian market, to the benefit of Canadian 
International, can he tell us if, this time, he intends to favour Air 
Canada as regards access to the U.S. market?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, first, the question asked by the hon. member is based 
on an absurd statement. Indeed, since I was appointed Minister 
of Transport, the government granted Air Canada access to the 
new Kansai airport, in Osaka. Air Canada also has flights to 
Seoul, in South Korea, and has landing rights in Singapore, even 
though it does not go there. You can rest assured that when the 
time comes to allocate U.S. routes, assuming the bilateral 
agreement with that country is ratified, we will-as we have 
always done-ensure a balance and a reasonable sharing of the 
benefits for the two Canadian airlines.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, BQ):</B> Mr.

reserve international routes for only one carrier, except for the

that has been worked on in this country for nearly eight or nine

these backroom meetings and that any future changes of such

	The previous government had a clear bias toward contracting

	Will the minister as part of this theme seriously address the 
fact that capital gains in Canada are not taxed as other income as

<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage,

first is that in the year of the 25th anniversary, the government in

perhaps was not as interested in the Canadian flag as we are.

	<B>Mrs. Jane Stewart (Brant, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, several 
women in my riding are extremely concerned about the ability 
of defence lawyers to subpoena the confidential records of 
sexual assault crisis centres for use in court. They are afraid that 
the protection gained by the rape shield legislation is being 
eroded as lawyers use a back door to gain access to their 
confidential information.
<P>
	What actions will the Minister of Justice consider taking to 
ensure that the personal records of assault victims remain 
confidential?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am well aware of and 
share the concerns identified by the hon. member.
<P>
	The House should know that at my direction as Attorney 
General the federal government intervened in a case recently 
argued before the Supreme Court of Canada in which the 
circumstances under which such evidence can be compelled and 
the circumstances under which it can be introduced at trial were 
canvassed and argued.
<P>
	In that case the federal government argued that the Supreme 
Court of Canada should adopt and strengthen guidelines 
stipulated by the Court of Appeal of British Columbia to protect 
sexual assault centres from harassment. The court reserved its 
judgment and we will await the disposition.
<P>
<B>(1500 ) </B>
<P>
	Let me make it clear to the House that if necessary the federal 
government is prepared to introduce legislation under the 
Criminal Code to ensure that we strike the right balance between 
full answer and defence on the one hand and the freedom of 
sexual assault centres to operate without harassment.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="STANDINGCOMMITTEEONHUMANRESOURCESDEVELOPMENT">STANDING COMMITTEE ON HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT</A></H4>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, I am now ready to rule on the 
question of privilege raised by the hon. member for 
Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing on February 6, 1995 concerning 
media disclosure of the report of the Standing Committee on 
Human Resources Development prior to the report's 
presentation to the House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I thank the hon. member for bringing this matter to the 
attention of the House. The hon. member submits that the 
privileges of the members of the House of Commons have been 
breached because this report was given to the media before 
being tabled in the House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The hon. member pointed out that until they are presented in 
the House committee reports should remain confidential. On 
this he is absolutely correct. However, as all members are aware, 
the Speaker is loath to intervene in committee matters unless 
difficulties arising in committee are brought to the attention of 
the House by way of a report from the committee. This tradition 
has been outlined by many Speakers before me and in particular 
by Speaker Fraser on November 7, 1991 in a ruling on a question 
of privilege involving committee proceedings.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In circumstances similar to those currently before us, a 
standing committee might decide to examine the matter of a 
breach of confidentiality and decide to report it to the House. 
Only then can the Speaker intervene.
<P>
	Although I do not find a prima facie question of privilege in 
this situation, the premature release of a committee's 
confidential information is nonetheless a very serious matter.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In his submission the hon. member further noted that as an 
associate member of the committee in question he was denied 
access to the report.
<P>
	Let me remind the House that the role of associate members, 
as outlined in Standing Order 104(4), is basically two-fold. 
They can be designated by a standing committee for 
membership on a subcommittee it establishes and, as such, 
become full members of that subcommittee and enjoy all the 
rights of a permanent member.
<P>
<B>(1505 ) </B>
<P>
	They can also serve as substitutes in the committee for which 
they have been named as associate members, thereby having the 
same rights as those of the permanent members they are 
replacing.
<P>
	However, in the case now before the House these situations 
did not occur. Furthermore, according to citation 766 in 
<I>Beauchesne's</I> sixth edition, non-members of a committee 
normally retire when the committee is about to deliberate upon 
its report.
<P>
	Therefore, in this case the fact that the hon. member was not 
given access to the draft report does not, in the view of the Chair, 
constitute a breach of his privileges.
<P>
	Finally, the issue of confidentiality is one of great importance 
for the House. I would remind all members of their obligation to 
see to it that the confidentiality of committee deliberations and 
reports is respected.
<P>

	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to table before this House a document on 
the expenditure management system of the Government of 
Canada, which describes the government's new 
decision-making process in matters of programs and 
expenditures.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	With this overhaul, the first in 15 years, we ensure the system 
responds to today's economic and fiscal realities. It recognizes 
the way this government has been doing business since elected 
in October, 1993.
<P>
	To reduce spending to meet our fiscal targets and to free up 
resources for reallocation to new priorities requires that we 
make tough spending and program choices. Our ultimate 
objective is to deliver quality programs and services within the 
resources that Canadians can afford.
<P>
	We are demonstrating to Parliament and to all Canadians that 
we are fulfilling our red book commitment to fund new 
initiatives through reallocating expenditures, not with new 
money, not with adding further to the debt, but to set our 
priorities by reallocating for new expenditure items.
<P>
	The document outlines the formal mechanisms that will foster 
greater fiscal responsibility and help this government to meet its 
targets.
<P>
	I would like to bring to members' attention some of the 
system's major features, quite briefly. It formally eliminates 
central policy reserves. It integrates practically all decisions 
about spending into the budget planning process. The document 
clearly outlines the cycle that will now be followed.
<P>
	We will deliver information on program performance to 
Parliament in better and more timely ways. Departments will 
produce documents on the outlook for their program priorities 
and expenditures over the next few years and provide them to 
Parliament. These documents will increase parliamentary 
involvement by assisting the standing committees in fulfilling 
their mandates to examine future year expenditures, trends and 
priorities. These outlook documents are new to this Parliament 
and expand the involvement and role of members of Parliament 
in the budgeting and estimates process.
<P>
	We will adjust these processes over the next few years. It will 
take some evolutionary time as we gain experience with them.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I am confident that they will help us make the difficult 
decisions that are involved in providing quality services and 
reducing the cost of government.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
must tell the President of the Treasury Board that I will carefully 
read the document he has just tabled on the expenditure 
management system of the Government of Canada.
<P>
	Like all Quebecois and Canadian taxpayers, I am concerned 
about the current management of federal public expenditures. In 
view of the information supplied to us every year by the Auditor 
General, it is high time for the federal government to make an 
in-depth review of its expenditures and, above all, of its 
management practices.
<P>
	I hope the document tabled today will address the concerns 
voiced by parliamentarians and that the proposed improvements 
will be consistent with the auditor general's recommendations.
<P>
	The criticisms expressed by the auditor general regarding 
program evaluation, for instance, should be taken into account. 
Given the abysmal performance of the Canadian government in 
the area of program evaluation, the Bloc Quebecois hopes this 
new document will contain not only new tools to more 
adequately inform parliamentarians of public expenditures, but 
also real solutions to evaluate the results of such programs.
<P>
	Each year, the auditor general presents us with an impressive 
list of waste in the use of public funds, and the government must, 
as a first step, clean up its expenditures before it can justify 
cutting programs.
<P>
	By eliminating the central policy reserves, the government 
will lose its flexibility to fund new projects. Since such projects 
will be funded by reallocating moneys committed elsewhere, the 
government must clearly express its priorities for the coming 
years.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois will be keeping a very close watch on the 
political choices to be announced in the upcoming budget. I 
would also like to take the opportunity to congratulate the 
minister for expressing himself so well in French.

	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, if I 
have to congratulate the President of the Treasury Board on the 
introduction of this policy it must surely be with a very small <I>c</I>.
<P>
	The country is crying out for cuts, elimination of waste, 
downsizing, less government, and yet the number one item in 
the minister's statement is that he will formally eliminate 
central policy reserves. Surely we could do much better than 
this.
<P>
	There is nothing in this statement about departmental cuts or 
elimination of departments. The minister is shuffling the policy 
chairs on the deck of the <I>Titanic</I>. These policies provide a 
different look at a serious but old problem of runaway deficits. 
There is not one single word in this statement about cuts, about 
smaller government, about downsizing the civil service.
<P>
	We can only say that we are extremely disappointed in the 
statement and we look for more, bigger and better news in the 
budget.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House call upon the government in its next budget to avoid any tax 
increases targeting low and middle-income taxpayers and to consider instead 
trimming the fat from the government, eliminating tax expenditures which 
primarily benefit large corporations and wealthy Canadians and collecting on 
unpaid tax debts owed to the federal government.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Madam Speaker, I am pleased to debate this motion 
in the House because it is consistent with what the official 
opposition has been defending, since the last election, as a 
means of putting our finances in order, as short term or medium 
term corrective measures, since most experts agree, as we do, 
that, without fundamentally changing the system, it will be 
difficult to get control over public finances again.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is of the opinion that the government 
must, in its upcoming budget, substantially reduce its 
expenditures and refrain from increasing income taxes for the 
middle class or low income taxpayers. The Bloc Quebecois asks 
that the federal government undertake a complete review of the 
tax system in order to eliminate unfair tax expenditures and 
ensure that companies currently not paying taxes pay their fair 
share.
<P>
	The federal government should, in particular, eliminate tax 
shelters benefiting high income taxpayers and big business. Not 
the measures which favour middle or low income individuals, 
but the real tax loopholes benefiting very wealthy Canadians 
and big business who have not been paying their fair share in the 
federal system for at least 12 years.
<P>
	The government has tried to justify a possible tax increase, 
stating that the rise in interest rates is forcing them to do so, 
forcing the Liberals, when in fact this rise is in large measure 
attributable to their inaction in fighting the deficit in the last 
year. I would like to remind you that just days after the Minister 
of Finance tabled his first budget last February 22, Canada's 
credit rating was lowered significantly for the first time in five 
years and the interest rates demanded by domestic and foreign 
investors on Canadian securities increased considerably, which 
in turn caused mortgage rates in particular to rise.
<P>
	Middle class taxpayers are past their tolerance level. Any 
increase in their tax burden is unacceptable, and the Prime 
Minister should be reminded that he made promises and 
commitments regarding the issue on the <I>Téléjournal</I> newscast, 
on October 1, 1993. He said then that he would not raise taxes 
during his first two years in office. This is year two.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9664"> 9664 </A></B>
<P>
	Last December, the Liberal representatives on the finance 
committee paid no heed to the Prime Minister's commitment 
and recommended an across the board surtax on income. This 
proposal, in the official opposition's opinion, is utterly 
unacceptable, and I would like to remind you, Madam Speaker, 
that according to the OECD, individual Canadian taxpayers pay 
33 per cent more taxes than the average taxpayer in the United 
States. We are neighbours, we have a free trade agreement in 
common and it is inadmissible to have such a disparity between 
levels of taxation.
<P>
	The official opposition also warns the government not to 
make any attempt to use devious means to increase the tax 
burden of the middle class and others by hitting RRSPs. The 
Bloc Quebecois is also firmly opposed to the option considered 
by the federal government to impose a one per cent capital tax on 
RRSPs. I would say to you that this hidden tax, which could net 
up to 5 billion dollars annually, would be an insidious blow to 
taxpayers who are trying to plan for a comfortable retirement, at 
a time when public funds are inadequate and Canadians' savings 
are at their lowest in thirty years. This would be an 
ill-considered and irresponsible measure.
<P>
	Neither should the federal government abdicate its 
responsibilities by shifting its deficit onto the backs of the 
provinces. This approach is irresponsible and has been resorted 
to time and again in the past, by this government. As an 
example, since 1982, in the health and education sectors alone, 
the federal government has deprived the provinces of 48 billion 
dollars-no small amount-by cutting transfers to the 
provinces, a loss of 12 billion dollars just for Quebec. Members 
will recall that, in his February 1994 budget, the present finance 
minister again made additional cuts of over 2 billion dollars in 
transfers to the provinces.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	Since meeting with his provincial counterparts, the Minister 
of Finance has left open the possibility that the federal 
government might make new cuts in transfer payments to 
provinces. This dumping of the deficit and this scheme to force 
the provinces to shoulder the burden of the cuts to social 
programs are unacceptable and irresponsible.
<P>
	The official opposition feels that the federal government must 
withdraw from provincial fields of jurisdiction and provide full 
financial compensation. After all, and in spite of what we are 
often led to believe, transfer payments to provinces are not gifts 
from the federal government. The money being transferred 
comes from taxpayers, including Quebec taxpayers.
<P>
	Between 1982 and 1992, taxes paid to the federal government 
by Quebecers increased by 121 per cent. Over that same ten year 
period, financial transfers from the federal government to 
Quebec only rose by 50 per cent.
<P>
	If the federal government makes cuts in transfer payments to 
the provinces, it should also transfer to  provinces tax revenues 
or tax points equivalent to those cuts, so that the provinces can 
assume their new responsibility.
<P>
	The issue of duplication and overlap must be a priority in the 
government's upcoming budget. Any attempt to eliminate these 
problems will fail if it is not supported by a withdrawal of the 
federal government from provincial fields of jurisdiction, as 
well as full financial compensation. Our friends opposite know 
that it would be irresponsible for the federal government, after 
creating duplication by meddling in areas of provincial 
jurisdiction, to cause a sudden and serious imbalance by 
withdrawing from social programs while keeping Quebecers' 
savings and taxes in Ottawa.
<P>
	I wish to raise a last point. The Liberals have forgotten that the 
fight against the deficit involves creating jobs. We will create 
jobs not by cutting post-secondary education funds, as proposed 
by the Axworthy reform, or by raising taxes, but above all by 
assuming our responsibilities.
<P>
	A consensus was reached long ago, in particular in Quebec, on 
the generalized decentralization of everything having to do with 
manpower training, job training, the re-entry of unemployed 
workers into the labour force and even income security. The 
time has come for the federal government to open its ears and 
eyes and do what is needed to stimulate employment. It is not by 
quoting the red book to us every day and telling us that their 
infrastructure project has created thousands of jobs, when they 
only created 45,000 casual jobs, that they will convince us that 
they are concerned about employment. This government must 
learn the difference between wasteful spending and investing in 
human capital. That is something it has forgotten in the last year 
and that is unfortunate.
<P>
	Finally, last October and last December, when the Liberal 
majority on the finance committee tabled its report concerning 
the prebudget consultations, the official opposition made some 
suggestions to put our finances back in order in the short or 
medium run, but mostly on the short term. We made these 
suggestions to allow the Minister of Finance to boast and to 
reduce the deficit to $25 billion, or 3 per cent of the GDP, by 
1996-1997.
<P>
	We came up with measures to find the money where it is. 
Cutting social programs will not help us to straighten out our 
finances. Let me briefly recall the recommendations we put 
forward.
<P>
	The first thing the official opposition suggested was for the 
federal government to withdraw from the provincial areas of 
jurisdiction upon which it has encroached since the second 
world war and from all the areas it has invaded, oftentimes by 
ignoring the provincial governments' prerogatives. We suggest 
that it withdraw completely from areas that belong to the 
provinces, with financial compensation.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	This withdrawal must not be drastic, it must not steal away 
like a thief, but in areas of provincial jurisdiction, it should give 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9665"> 9665 </A></B>
<P>
the provinces all the tools they need, especially fiscal, with full 
tax points so that they can meet their new obligations. The 
provinces are not asking for a handout. They just want the 
federal government to have the honesty to say: We are pulling 
out of certain areas, we are eliminating the costs of duplication 
and overlap, and we are going to let the provinces, who are in the 
best position to do so anyway, manage their own affairs, as 
provided in the Canadian constitution, in the fields of health, 
post-secondary education and social assistance, to name a few.
<P>
	This proposal has a dual objective. First, it sets out to 
eliminate contradictory policies and to allow the provinces to 
adopt an integrated policy on job training, education, job 
creation and health, in short truly comprehensive social 
policies. Second, this proposal allows the provincial and federal 
governments to reduce their operating expenses by eliminating 
costly overlap and duplication in programs and services. In 
Quebec alone, the cost of duplication and overlap is in excess of 
$3 billion. I think it would be worthwhile for the minister to 
consider this proposal.
<P>
	The second recommendation from the official opposition 
contained in the minority report submitted to the finance 
committee in December, as part of the finance minister's 
pre-budget consultations, is to stop providing subsidies to 
business immediately, as these subsidies total more than $3.3 
billion and are more a source of patronage than a source of 
assistance for businesses facing modern day challenges, mostly 
in terms of productivity and international competitiveness.
<P>
	The president of the Conseil du patronat du Québec himself 
made the same suggestion in his testimony. He said something 
like this: these subsidies only foster competition between those 
businesses which are subsidized and those which are not, and 
this is unhealthy in terms of management and business growth. I 
think that it is fair to say that, however much wisdom Mr. 
Dufour may have displayed in the past, on several occasions, he 
really outdid himself this time.
<P>
	We are suggesting that the Minister of Finance immediately 
cut business subsidies, in other words to forget about his 
corporate chums for once and make sure that expenditure 
restraint targets are met, this year as well as next year.
<P>
	Third recommendation: these are times of reduced 
international tensions. Experts we consulted before the last 
election when the Bloc Quebecois became the official 
opposition say that it is possible, practical and, in fact, desirable 
that the defence budget be cut by 25 per cent. That is what they 
said a year ago. National Defence's budget has since been 
reduced by some 13 per cent, which leaves 12 per cent more cuts 
to be made, for savings of $1.6 billion. It is definitely worth it in 
times of  constraint, when the Minister of Finance is actively 
seeking to save. I think there is a good potential for savings 
there.
<P>
	We also recommended and continue to recommend that the 
federal government withdraw from a huge money pit project in 
which the government has already sunk over $3 billion in direct 
transfers or loan guarantees. I am referring to Hibernia. 
According to all the studies conducted, except government 
studies justifying its continued involvement in this harebrained 
project, oil prices are unlikely to rise in the next 20 years and 
may even fall in relation to today's prices. If Hibernia is not 
profitable with today's prices, how can it be profitable in 20 
years with lower prices?
<P>
	If the government really believes in sound financial 
management, it should start there. I think it is an interesting 
idea.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	Our fifth recommendation was that the government, the 
Minister of Finance, undertake a full review of the taxation 
system in preparing his next budget. We are no longer the only 
ones asking, although we were the first in the last two years to 
push for the establishment of a special committee, made up of 
elected parliamentarians, to review the whole tax system, item 
by item.
<P>
	The Canadian tax system is very complex and has not 
undergone a thorough review in 25 years. Some tax experts 
mired in administration will, of course, tell us that changes have 
been made, but these changes are nothing more than patchwork 
and cannot be compared to a thorough review.
<P>
	They added some provisions and removed others, and made 
more additions and deletions. For example, they allowed big 
businesses to hire renowned tax experts familiar with Canadian 
tax loopholes. And there are many of them. We have discovered 
new tax loopholes every day since becoming the official 
opposition.
<P>
	The time has come to undertake a thorough review of the tax 
system. I do not understand why finance department officials, 
the finance minister himself, the revenue minister and the 
members of our third party are all opposed to this idea. I do not 
understand why they are against reviewing the Canadian tax 
system when many experts, if not the vast majority of them, see 
this as a necessity at this time.
<P>
	Our tax system-and particularly our corporate tax 
system-is the most complicated one in the world. And I am not 
just expressing my own opinion.
<P>
	There are people in the United States, including tax experts 
and economists, who simply cannot figure out our system. I 
should point out that, towards the end of the Reagan 
administration, the United States undertook such a process. The 
Americans reviewed their whole tax system. They did not only 
look at the corporate tax system, but also at the personal income 
tax program. They streamlined their whole system to the 
greatest  possible extent. The Americans did not do that just to 
simplify matters, but also to facilitate detection of tax evaders, 
including those who take advantage of their financial means or 
corporate income to hire experts who help them avoid the tax 
man. It is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9666"> 9666 </A></B>
<P>
now more difficult in the United States to avoid paying one's 
due to the government.
<P>
	Why not do the same here? Why is the government so 
reluctant to follow up on our suggestions to target two sectors on 
a priority basis? The first one is the tax conventions signed with 
16 countries considered to be tax havens. Investment 
management companies will tell you that they can easily find 
loopholes. It is easy to establish subsidiaries in some of those 16 
countries and take advantage of tax loopholes which will allow 
you to save hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions, or 
even billions, in federal taxes.
<P>
	Why does the government refuse to review these 16 tax 
conventions? Is it because of possible conflicts of interest? Is it 
because some friends of the party might be taking advantage of 
these tax havens by creating bogus companies in these 
countries? They also declare phoney operating losses in these 
tax havens, so they can deduct them from their profits in Canada 
and avoid paying taxes.
<P>
	It is time something was done about this. When the 
government talks about cutting back, when Quebecers and 
Canadians are asked to tighten their belts and make incredible 
sacrifices, maybe it is time the Minister of Finance acted 
responsibly and stopped protecting his friends and the friends of 
the Liberal Party of Canada, whose incomes are not necessarily 
those of the average Canadian.
<P>
	Tax treaties should be a priority in the next budget. The 
minister should overhaul some of these treaties which are 
riddled with tax loopholes.
<P>
	Family trusts are another case in point. In November, and 
even in his last budget, the minister tried to make a good 
impression when he said he would create a sub-committee of the 
finance committee to analyse the impact of family trusts on 
federal tax revenues.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	The subcommittee was set up, but despite assurances that the 
process would be completely open, first of all we never got the 
co-operation of senior officials from the Department of Finance 
who just laughed at us in committee; second, whenever we asked 
for additional information and studies, the real stuff, we were 
turned down; and third, before Christmas, when the official 
opposition presented a motion in the finance committee to 
review the policy on family trusts for wealthy taxpayers who 
never have to pay a cent of capital gains tax, the committee's 
Liberal majority and the Reform Party voted the motion down. 
They even voted against a study of family trusts. I think that is 
unconscionable.
<P>
	In concluding, I have another recommendation. In his report, 
the auditor general referred to federal accounts  receivable still 
outstanding. He mentioned the $6.6 billion, owed by taxpayers, 
especially wealthy taxpayers, to the federal government. They 
did not deny the fact that they owed the money, but because of 
this government's spineless attitude, no attempt is being made 
to recover the $6.6 billion. According to the auditor general, we 
could recover 80 per cent of this amount.
<P>
	If the minister needs a few more billion, we suggest that he 
can get around $14 billion without even touching social 
programs. It is high time government members woke up to this 
fact, because people have had enough.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I listened attentively to the member's statements. As he well 
knows, when leading up to a budget there is always speculation 
and rumour. Indeed, what we have heard today from the member 
is a lot of speculation and a lot of rumour.
<P>
	The member started off by talking substantially about 
somehow shifting the tax burden to low and middle income 
Canadians. The member knows that when the Minister of 
Finance addressed the finance committee on October 17 and 18 
the very clear message was that the minister was not looking at 
increasing taxes as a primary vehicle for deficit reduction and 
meeting his target of 3 per cent of GDP.
<P>
	As the debate and the work of the committee have gone on, 
there has been no question that the committee, of which the hon. 
member is a member, has concentrated on many items the 
member has raised. These include the elimination of overlap and 
duplication among different levels of government; the reduction 
of subsidies to businesses; and dealing with loopholes that are 
not illegal but were brought in to handle certain situations at a 
certain time which may no longer serve their purpose.
<P>
	The member also spent quite a bit of time referring to the rich 
and making the rich pay. I thought it might be helpful to pass on 
to the member for his information some facts that were 
published by StatsCanada.
<P>
	The top 10 per cent of taxpayers in Canada in 1992 started at 
some $50,000 a year. Those top 10 per cent of taxpayers paid 34 
per cent of all taxes. In addition to that, that top 10 per cent of 
taxpayers also contributed 42 per cent of all charitable 
donations.
<P>
	When we are talking about who is paying for what, it is clear 
we have to take into account the full dynamics of the financial 
affairs of those people who are successful. I think the member 
would agree that we want Canadians to aspire to do as well as 
they possibly can. If we have successful leaders in businesses 
and industry, we will also have successful people working 
within those businesses and industry.
<P>
	I have a question I want the member to deal with. He talked 
about tax reform. I think most members will agree that tax 
reform is an important process of this House. He  talked about it 
in the sense of reducing the complexity of our taxes and 
simplifying them.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9667"> 9667 </A></B>
<P>
	The member then went on to talk about corporate taxation. He 
abandoned the arguments about complexity on a personal level 
and went on to tax havens and other exotic tax matters that do 
not have anything to do with the ordinary Canadian. Would the 
member care to comment on tax reform from the perspective of 
making it simpler or less complicated?
<P>
<B>(1555 ) </B>
<P>
	Would he not agree that changing the way in which income tax 
is calculated is not going to improve government revenues in 
itself? Would he not agree that in fact we need fundamental tax 
reform, not in the way we are doing things now but in the 
fundamental way in which we actually assess taxation on 
ordinary Canadians?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Madam Speaker, I do not know where to start 
with this question. It is huge, and it is more of a commentary 
than a question as such. My statement contained neither 
speculation nor rumour, it was based on fact. The facts are as 
follows: since it came to power, the Liberal government has 
done exactly the opposite, or just about, of what it said it was 
going to do in the red book, except for infrastructure projects.
<P>
	It said it would protect society's most disadvantaged; it said it 
would not tax middle income Canadians. The first thing it did in 
its first budget, on February 22, was cut unemployment 
insurance by $7.5 billion. If these are not the most 
disadvantaged-I think these are people who are somewhat 
desperate. They are looking for work and have little to do as 
well, because, with the tightening up of unemployment 
insurance measures, whole families have been thrown on 
welfare. This is what happened in my riding and in the ridings of 
my colleagues as well. I hope my Liberal colleagues are still 
checking on the people in their ridings.
<P>
	Secondly, as for the taxation measures, in 1993 the Prime 
Minister said: ``No problem, we will not tax, we will not 
increase taxes or income tax''. Since we have been here, since 
we started questioning the government, led off by the Prime 
Minister, has not ruled out the possibility of an increase in taxes 
and income taxes. So, they are looking at increasing taxes and 
income tax for taxpayers, but they are not prepared to clean up 
the tax system. Where is the logic? There is no way the tax return 
can be simplified with the present tax legislation.
<P>
	This is not what I was saying earlier. I was not talking about 
simplifying tax returns. In any case, we have decided not even to 
raise this issue any more. Each time we called for a simplified 
tax return, senior government officials would complicate tax 
returns even more. So we have stopped raising the issue. People 
are beginning to get used to the present forms. What I am talking 
about is an in depth reform of the tax system. I do not know 
whether you have read the tax legislation for the past 40 
years-it is awful.
<P>
	I have tried to do my best. I have often taken those books out 
of the library and have gone to consult them there as well. It is a 
monumental mess. Only the experts can find their way around. 
Secondly, you will admit that without this reform, we have a 
serious taxation problem. Forty-five years ago, corporate taxes 
accounted for 50 per cent of federal revenues, while the 
remaining 50 per cent was drawn from individual taxpayers.
<P>
	Now nearly 83 per cent of federal tax dollars are collected 
from individual taxpayers. The remaining 17 per cent is 
collected from businesses. This is an imbalance, an unhealthy 
one, I would say, and people are increasingly aware of that. It is 
no wonder that, just about everywhere, and I am not referring to 
the revolt stirred up by Reformers, people are outraged to see 
this, they see what is happening and see us walking away from 
our responsibilities, they see that the government will not even 
go so far as to review the tax system.
<P>
	Even if it takes two or three years, it has to be done, such a 
review must be done. This should have been the first step, the 
first measure taken by the Liberal government. They talked 
about it before the election campaign, during the campaign, and 
even before bringing down the first budget and the Minister of 
Finance has turned a deaf ear to it all. So has the Prime Minister. 
Reformers are doing the same because it is a direct attack on 
their friends, and even on a number of the people they represent 
who have considerable personal assets.
<P>
	This review must be carried out, I feel, and so must tax 
expenditures be reviewed. There was talk earlier of tax treaties; 
they really must be reviewed individually because, in this area 
too, people are becoming aware that some large, very profitable 
companies benefit by establishing phoney companies abroad, in 
countries considered as tax havens, and thereby avoid paying 
taxes. Ordinary people cannot do that. They cannot set up such 
companies and, when they owe a dollar in taxes, be assured that 
they are hunted down for it.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, a motion introduced by the 
Reform Party regarding the government's next budget was 
debated in the House yesterday. Now the Bloc Quebecois is 
taking a crack at it. Both parties' motions clearly demonstrate 
that neither has what it takes to accomplish this imposing task or 
to run a country like Canada, let alone an independent Quebec.
<P>
	In both cases, political grandstanding takes precedence over 
real and credible action. The two motions also prove that the two 
opposition parties do not dare acknowledge the budgetary 
principles the Minister of Finance applied in last year's budget.
<P>
	I know that the historic budget he will soon table will be based 
on these principles. The minister repeated several times that the 
emphasis of this budget will be on spending cuts and not on tax 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9668"> 9668 </A></B>
<P>
increases. And he stressed  that if tax measures must be taken, 
their purpose will be to make the tax system fairer, not to 
increase the tax burden of low income taxpayers, as the 
opposition claimed today.
<P>
	We have also clearly indicated that we believe that the first 
steps that must be taken to pare down the government machine 
are to downsize it and cut fluff and waste. This is what the 
opposition has been telling us. We have already taken real action 
on the issue.
<P>
	Last week, the Minister responsible for Public Service 
Renewal tabled a bill to dissolve or reorganize 22 organizations. 
Taxpayers would save almost one and a half million dollars. I 
understand that this is very little, really just a drop in the bucket, 
but I know that this budget will be the result of the most 
extensive review of government programs and operations ever 
undertaken in recent history in this country.
<P>
	I am also convinced that the budget will demonstrate to all 
Canadians that we have the courage to do what we say we will do 
and to keep our promises. We need to take action to reduce the 
cost and size of government because it is vital to the deficit 
reduction goals we set last year. And it is precisely this question 
of the deficit, in the debates yesterday and today, which brings 
out clearly the fundamental shortcomings of the two opposition 
parties.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As for members of the Reform Party, eliminating the deficit 
but without tax action seems to be their only concern. They seem 
to think that deficit action alone will ensure Canada's economic 
success and renewal. They refuse to recognize that there is a role 
for government in promoting economic development and in 
protecting Canadians in real need.
<P>
	It is also interesting to note that where Reform sees only the 
deficit, the Bloc seems to have completely forgotten it exists at 
all. The result is a motion on the budget that ignores Canada's 
real fiscal problems.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	After all, the Bloc's separatist cousins in Quebec City include 
a finance minister who feels that Quebec's obligations with 
respect to the national debt need be honoured only when it is 
convenient to do so. But our government refuses to slough off its 
responsibilities. We are aware of the burden of decades of debt 
and galloping deficits, which have given rise to an increase in 
taxes and interest rates, and a certain mistrust on the part of 
investors; all are factors detrimental to growth and job creation.
<P>
	You know, the latest statements by the Quebec finance 
minister did not help the province's ratings, and it is the middle 
class that will pay the price.
<P>
	However, our government is determined to do what is 
necessary to maintain growth and create jobs in all regions of the 
country, including Quebec. And in order to reach these 
objectives, it is essential, and Canadians themselves are 
demanding it, that we put in place an effective financial reform 
strategy.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Our government believes that winning the debt challenge 
starts with laying a clear, concrete and credible foundation. That 
means keeping to the deficit track we set out on to bring the 
deficit down to 3 per cent of GDP in three years.
<P>
	That is exactly what we will do, as the minister said, ``come 
hell or high water''. The federal deficit now near 6 per cent of 
GDP has not been as low as 3 per cent since 1974-75, 20 long 
years ago.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In addition, setting specific deficit reduction goals is a 
significant change from past practices. That is why our 
government used a different approach. We set realistic goals and 
we will take all necessary steps to achieve concrete results. Our 
success in this regard will make our long-term objective of 
totally eliminating the deficit more credible.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We believe it is best to set out short term targets, concrete 
milestones, and achieve them. With short term targets there is no 
excuse for delay, no acceptable grounds for not taking tough 
action to address the problem. When we set unrealistic long term 
goals, we can always find a reason to avoid tough action today, 
tomorrow and the tomorrow after that.
<P>
	Let us remember that we have done more than just set out a 
goal. Last year's budget took dramatic bottom line action. It set 
out measures to deliver $20 billion in deficit reduction over 
three years. For every $1 of revenue action there were $5 of 
spending cuts. No budget in a decade moved so strongly to cut 
spending.
<P>
	We also know that even stronger action might be necessary. 
The problem is interest rates. They are much higher than we or 
the private sector expected.
<P>
	There is no mystery about the pressures at work. To begin 
with, there is action by the U.S. central bank to control 
American inflation. There is also the lingering concern about 
the Quebec situation and the worry over Canada's debt and 
deficit burden.
<P>
	The problem is our accumulated $500 billion debt. It is so big 
that an increase in rates has been a frightening wallop. Let us 
remember that last year the interest charges on the debt 
consumed almost $40 billion of taxpayers' money, the single 
largest expense of government. Every time the rates go up one 
per-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9669"> 9669 </A></B>
<P>
centage point our carrying costs jump by $1.7 billion, and that is 
just in the first year. By the third year it is a $3 billion penalty.
<P>
	It is this punishing dynamic of compound interest that makes 
tough budget action the right action. The fact is that we have 
always recognized the need for continued fiscal action. The 
1995 budget process started the minute we introduced the 1994 
plan. That is why we combined immediate action with a 
sweeping series of program reviews on government operations, 
defence and social security reform. These have set concrete 
foundations for this year's budget and the tough decisions 
needed.
<P>
	In this regard let me remind both opposition parties, given 
their calls for eliminating government waste and inefficiency, of 
the six questions that have framed our program review of 
government operations.
<P>
	(1) Do the program areas continue to serve the public interest?
<P>
	(2) Is there a legitimate and necessary role for the government 
in this area?
<P>
	(3) Is the current role of the federal government appropriate, 
or can the program be realigned with the provinces?
<P>
	(4) What programs should or could be transferred to the 
private or voluntary sector?
<P>
	(5) If the program continues, how can its efficiency be 
improved?
<P>
	(6) Is the resulting package of programs affordable?
<P>
	Before concluding my remarks I should also reiterate a point 
made yesterday on the issue of tax increases. Only a foolhardy 
politician would ignore the real ``tax fatigue'' felt by Canadians. 
It is felt on this side as well. That is why cuts in government 
spending must and will be our priority in reducing the deficit. 
We proved that last year when we cut spending by $5 for every 
$1 in revenue measures.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	However, most Canadians know that in order to cut taxes in 
the future and, in the short term, to ease the pressure on interest 
rates and the dollar, we must bring the debt under control. And 
this will only be possible after we achieve our deficit reduction 
goals.
<P>
	Given the magnitude of this challenge, I understand why the 
Minister of Finance will not promise a budget without measures 
to increase revenue. But, if such measures are included, I am 
confident that they will be aimed at improving the tax system 
and closing loopholes. To those who are opposed to tax 
measures, I ask this: Do you really feel that the existing system 
is totally effective, that there are no loopholes or unjustified 
advantages? Given our financial situation, Canadians do not 
want or need such stupid political games.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	I could say much more but I think that the budget will be more 
eloquent. Yes, we have a long road ahead of us, but I think that 
we are off to a good start. I am confident that the budget to be 
tabled in late February or early March will show all Canadians 
and world markets that our government meets its financial 
commitments.
<P>
	By doing this, we will reinforce the conviction of the vast 
majority of Canadians, including my fellow citizens from 
Quebec, that this country, Canada, will fulfil its destiny of 
greatness and unity it deserves.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I listened to the hon. member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine. I wish I was as confident 
about anything as the hon. member opposite seems to be about 
everything, especially since it was the party opposite that was 
the father, the parents and the grandparents of the present 
dilemma our country faces today.
<P>
	The member opposite is very quick to criticize opposition 
parties. However it does not seem to sink into members opposite 
that there is a good deal of distrust in the nation of the Liberal 
government, the parents of the dilemma that our country is in 
today, the very people who got us into this mess. A lot of people 
perhaps mistrust the fact that the Liberals present themselves as 
the people who have seen the error of their ways and are now 
going to be the ones who will lead us out of this dilemma and 
into the promised land. A lot of people in Canada have a healthy 
degree of scepticism about the ability of the Liberals to come 
through and do what they acknowledge must be done.
<P>
	I have a question for the hon. member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine whom I know to be 
earnest and hardworking. I honestly believe he speaks with 
conviction. What in his opinion is the single most important 
ingredient in getting our nation's finances back on track? What 
is the single ingredient on which everything else hinges?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> Madam Speaker, I think I will include some of 
the very favourable remarks of the hon. member opposite in my 
next householder.
<P>
	Yes, being a Liberal I am somewhat confident. There is 
confidence out there in the general population that the Liberals 
can deliver. The minister said it very clearly when he said that he 
would bring the deficit from a high of 6 per cent down to 
approximately 3 per cent of GNP within the next three years. 
This is something we are striving to do.
<P>
	Of course it will not be done without any pain. We might be 
talking about short term pain for long term gain. We are not 
going to cut indiscriminately in every area. We still have social 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9670"> 9670 </A></B>
<P>
conscience on this side of the House. I believe it still exists 
among certain members on the benches opposite.
<P>
	After hearing what the member told me earlier I am convinced 
a number of the members will recognize the efforts made by the 
government to decrease the deficit and to make sure that we 
eliminate the deficit by some time at the beginning of the turn of 
the century.
<P>
	It will be a long term process. This is what we have to prove to 
outside investors and Canadian investors. Canadians are 
expecting us to make sure that we come out with a reasonable 
budget, given the situation we are faced with, so that we can look 
at the future with hope and encouragement, thanks to the first 
steps taken by the Minister of Finance. In the next few weeks the 
course will be set.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
first of all, further to the remarks made by the hon. member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de la-Madeleine, of course Canadians as 
well as Quebecers are aware of the fact that the national debt has 
grown to $600 billion, with debt charges totalling about $115 
million per day.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	We all know that, just to pay the interest on this debt, the 
Canadian government now has to borrow money. We are also 
aware of the need to paid off this debt someday, or at least to 
reduce the deficit. The last budget the Minister of Finance tabled 
in this House was passed with a deficit of approximately $52 
billion, this being the biggest deficit ever approved by this 
House.
<P>
	Naturally, this budget was passed by the Liberal majority who 
had approved in this House the biggest deficit ever in Canadian 
history. Today, it is suggested to create a deficit to solve the 
deficit problem.
<P>
	The people are prepared to tighten their belts and make 
sacrifices. What they will not accept is the shameless 
government overspending. They have a problem with 
expenditures like the $475,000 spent just recently on the 
installation of the Governor General. They find it difficult to 
accept that members of Parliament be entitled to a pension for 
life after serving for just six years.
<P>
	And this causes concern and social insecurity from coast to 
coast. The concern caused by such things as the Minister of 
Finance contemplating tax hikes, contemplating replacing the 
GST with a tax hidden in product prices so as to be able to tax 
everything that is presently tax-free, such as food, prescription 
drugs and health care, is not making seniors feel any safer, 
because there is even talk of taxing RRSPs.
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Minister of Human Resources Development 
is considering making cuts in education programs, loans and 
scholarships for students, who represent our future. The 
minister is considering making cuts in the UI program, which 
should not be used for government administration purposes 
since it is an insurance for those who lose their jobs. The 
minister is also considering making cuts in the government 
support  to seniors and to low income families. When I think of 
low income families, I am reminded of all the cuts made by the 
previous Conservative government, including the subsidies to 
provinces for social housing.
<P>
	The minister is also considering making cuts in the subsidies 
to women's organizations which promote employment and equal 
pay. Then, there is the Minister of Finance who is also 
considering cuts in airport and airline services, or even 
privatizing these services. If the equipment is transferred to the 
provinces, it is like shifting the burden onto their shoulders.
<P>
	So, I ask the hon. member: Is it possible that, this year, the 
government will manage to reduce its deficit without targeting 
the poor and, if so, how will it do that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> Madam Speaker, I can assure you it was never 
the intention of the Liberals to introduce budget cuts at the 
expense of the most vulnerable in our society, and I said as much 
in my speech.
<P>
	As the member for Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, and 
like the hon. member from the North Shore, I represent a riding 
that has to live with financial, economic and social problems.
<P>
	However, in his comments he referred to the fact that people 
needed security, and I also heard him say that people thought we 
spent too much money on the installation of the new Governor 
General of Canada and all the activities that were organized 
around this event. I would like to remind the hon. member 
opposite that the Premier of Quebec is going to spend, not two 
million, as he promised, but more than five million on the 
commissions going around Quebec that want to discuss only one 
topic: Quebec's independence. There is nothing that makes my 
constituents feel more insecure, and I hear people say this. I hear 
this from people in Quebec's remote areas, when they see a 
provincial government that is intent on only one thing: the 
break-up and, in fact, the end of the best country in the world.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	The only way we can survive is by introducing a new fiscal 
policy, making certain cuts and reallocating our spending 
priorities. Reallocation is necessary to ensure that we can 
become leaders in important fields.
<P>
	However, we must stay together, because dividing Quebec 
and dividing Canada and making all kinds of statements, as the 
opposition sometimes does, is not the answer. I am not 
necessarily referring to members opposite, but it was the 
Quebec finance minister who said recently that he felt Quebec 
was not necessarily obliged to meet Canada's international 
commitments in terms of paying off loans and servicing the 
debt.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9671"> 9671 </A></B>
<P>
	In concluding, we want Quebecers to feel secure, and I think 
we are going about it the right way. This is a caring government, 
and I think the Chrétien government has proved repeatedly 
during the past one and half years that we are in touch with the 
grass roots, that we are fully aware of our financial obligations 
in terms of the national debt and that we also realize that the 
federal government has an obligation to take care of the 
neediest in our society.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, for the benefit of those watching on television I would 
like to read the Bloc motion once again. It is non-votable and it 
reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House call upon the government in its next budget to avoid any tax 
increases targeting low and middle income taxpayers and to consider instead 
trimming the fat from the government, eliminating tax expenditures which 
primarily benefit large corporations and wealthy Canadians and collecting on 
unpaid tax debts owed to the federal government.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	How do we go about disagreeing with that? We cannot. It is 
like motherhood and apple pie. Furthermore, it makes sense. 
Why should we not be doing the things that the Bloc suggests? 
As a matter of fact, we are doing most of them now.
<P>
	Our party agrees 100 per cent with the notion that we should 
avoid any tax increases targeting low and middle income 
taxpayers. We are very adamant in saying that we should not 
have any new taxes on anybody for any reason, period; not on 
people, not on businesses, not on anyone for any reason, not 
direct and not indirect. The reason for this is we have to 
establish the political will to do what has to be done.
<P>
	Earlier in questions and comments I asked the hon. member 
for Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine to tell me what in his 
opinion was the most important single thing that needed to be 
done, what was the factor above all other factors that would 
ensure success in eliminating the deficit and getting our 
country's finances in order. For those watching and for those in 
the House it is no surprise that we did not get an answer to that 
question. I asked the question specifically because I wanted to 
know whether the member opposite really had a sense of what 
had to be done. We did not get an answer to the question. I 
assumed that the member opposite did not know what that 
ingredient was.
<P>
	I am going to give him the answer. I am going to let him and 
other members opposite know what the single ingredient is 
which must be there. Without that ingredient there will not be 
success. It cannot happen. That single ingredient is political 
will. Members opposite control the purse strings. They have 
their feet on the pedals and their hands on the wheel that steers 
our nation. We in opposition can influence but we do not make 
the final decision. It is the government opposite that makes the 
final decision. Unless the government  opposite has the political 
will to do what has to be done it simply will not be achieved.
<P>
	How does it go about getting this political will? What does it 
take? That is why it is so important that the government not look 
for tax fairness at this time. Tax fairness is not the issue. 
Spending is the issue.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	If we allow ourselves as a Parliament to wriggle off the hook 
instead of saying to ourselves our problem is that spending is out 
of control, instead of being absolutely committed and convinced 
of this and start burrowing around looking for little ways that we 
can pick up a few bucks here and a few bucks there, we will very 
quickly lose the political will to do what has to be done, reduce 
spending.
<P>
	Programs have to go. If we do not do it we absolutely will not 
achieve the goal that has to be achieved. Our nation is quickly 
getting behind the power curve financially.
<P>
	For those present who do not understand what the power curve 
means, getting behind the power curve is an aviation term. What 
that means is that if a person is flying along and there is a 
mountain ahead and that person pulls the nose of the aircraft up, 
they will have to increase power so that they can climb up over 
that mountain. If there is not enough power in that aircraft to 
keep the nose up and to keep flying, they will very quickly lose 
speed, lose control, spin, crash and burn.
<P>
	Our nation is in an aircraft and there is a mountain of debt 
ahead of us. That mountain of debt is growing rapidly through 
the magic of compound interest which is people's greatest 
enemy when they owe money and their greatest friend when they 
do not owe money.
<P>
	Here we are hurdling along in the sky. This mountain of debt 
is in front of us and we have to keep pulling our nose up. As we 
pull our nose up, which is increased taxes, we are losing power.
<P>
	There is the point when our economy has lost so much power 
because we have to keep increasing the taxes so that we can get 
over the mountain we simply will not be able to do it. That is 
why the political will to get our spending under control is of 
critical importance.
<P>
	That is not to say that there are not elements of our taxation 
policy which should not be corrected. That is not to say that my 
colleague and friend from St. Hyacinth-Bagot is not absolutely 
correct in saying that in our tax life you have to be a Philadelphia 
lawyer to fill in your tax form.
<P>
	Have members ever tried to make money in this country? 
People pay taxes on making money. People pay taxes on 
spending money. Every time we turn around there is a 
disincentive to be productive in our economy. There is an 
incentive to be non-productive.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9672"> 9672 </A></B>
<P>
	We have to get those changed. We have to simplify our tax 
regime in this country. As a matter of fact our hon. colleague 
from Broadview-Greenwood has been working diligently for 
years to introduce the single tax in Canada.
<P>
	Our party is 100 per cent supportive of that but we have to set 
priorities. Right now our nation and all Canadians are in a 
lifeboat. We have already hit the iceberg. The <I>Titanic</I> is going 
down and we are in this lifeboat. There are holes in the lifeboat 
and what are we doing? We are talking about who should be the 
captain and what colour we should paint it.
<P>
	We better get some priorities together. We better be plugging 
the holes in the lifeboat and bailing because if we do not, we are 
going down, and we are going down together.
<P>
	It does not matter if one is bankrupt in French or English. One 
is bankrupt. It does not matter if one is bankrupt and cannot 
afford to buy a gun. Does it matter if one has to register it? Does 
it matter if one is gay or straight? One is bankrupt.
<P>
	Our priority is to get our nation's finances in order. That is 
what we have to do. Once we have done that, this Parliament 
should rightly put its interests in all the other thousands of 
things that drag us away from where we should have our noses 
focused, one of which is on government spending.
<P>
	We need as a Parliament to get our noses on the ground, to get 
our butts in the air and work on priority number one, that which 
is most important above all other things, to get the political will 
so that we can make the tough decisions. We can look our fellow 
Canadians in the eyes and say we have made the first sacrifice 
ourselves. We have done away with this outrageous pension plan 
that acts like a magnet for all the ire of everybody in the country.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	When they look at that and say: ``How can these people who 
are elected to lead us write laws that protect them from the very 
mismanagement they have put on to our country in the first 
place? How is it that people can spend 20 years here and get a 
pension that allows them to live so they do not ever have to 
worry about the consequences of their mismanagement of our 
economy?''
<P>
	We have to restore the bonds of trust between the elected and 
the electors. We have to put the rights of victims ahead of the 
rights of criminals. Above all, we must get our nation's finances 
in order and we must have the political will to make the very 
tough decisions necessary.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am not able to 
associate with this picture by my colleagues in the Reform 
Party. Day in and day out they try to paint this as a sinking 
country that one cannot live in and that has so many things 
wrong with it.
<P>
	For the third time in a row the United Nations has clearly 
stated that Canada is the best country in the world in which to 
live and raise a family. Twenty years ago when I came to this 
country I knew Canada was the finest and best country in the 
world. I say that over and over again.
<P>
	I do not understand what is wrong with my colleague. Perhaps 
we should establish a fund for our colleagues in the Reform 
Party to send them abroad to look at the world. When they come 
back to Canada, maybe then they will start talking about the 
positive things that exist here. Then they could truly appreciate 
all of the good things we have and will come to the conclusion 
that we have to work collectively in order to make it even better.
<P>
	This negativity day in and day out, the doom and gloom is not 
serving anybody. It is not serving the interests of Canada. 
Business people have told us over and over again: ``Give us the 
tools and we will make it happen''. Government has to provide a 
proper environment in order for business to create jobs and we 
are doing that.
<P>
	Economic indicators by all agencies, whether from Canada or 
abroad, whoever we talk to, all of the economists agree that 
Canada and this government is going in the proper, right 
direction. We are leading the other industrialized countries in 
terms of growth. According to the Minister of Finance and the 
Prime Minister we are way over what we have forecast in terms 
of economic growth.
<P>
	What is wrong? In terms of what the government is spending 
annually versus what we are getting in terms of revenue, we are 
in a surplus position. However, we have a debt and interest to 
pay on it.
<P>
	For my colleague to turn around and attack the government 
for its track record is unfair. He should stand up and congratulate 
this government, the Prime Minister, the Minister of Finance, 
every member of the cabinet and government for a job very well 
done. That is what he should do. Stop the doom and gloom. Talk 
about the positive. Smell the roses. Have some coffee. Maybe he 
would wake up.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Madam Speaker, it is such a delight to 
respond to the hon. member opposite as he whips his rose 
coloured glasses from his nose.
<P>
	You do not have to be a brain surgeon to figure that if you have 
been running up debts, you can live like a king if you are doing it 
on someone else's money. The problem is the bank is about to 
cut off our Visa card. Our Visa card, American Express, 
Mastercard and our bank line are as high as they will go. We 
opened up a home equity line of credit which we are using and 
still we cannot pay our bills. We are going further into the hole 
every day. That, sir, is the problem.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9673"> 9673 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	Step number one in solving a problem is that you must deal 
with things as they are, not as you would wish them to be. This 
Pollyanna wishing and saying that the United Nations says we 
are number three in the world, why are we not number two or 
number one in the world? We are borrowing it. We are going 
down the hole. Our grandchildren and our children will be 
paying off debts that our generation and the generation that 
preceded us ran up. And these people are saying: ``Everything is 
fine in the world''. It is insane.
<P>
	Let me read from <I>The Wall Street Journal</I> about this number 
one nation in the world. I am quoting Mr. Alan Reynolds in <I>The 
Wall Street Journal</I> of Friday, October 14:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The drop in the Canadian dollar, 20 per cent since 1991, is largely caused by the 
uncompetitive tax climate for both labour and capital. World investors do not like 
to invest in countries with rising tax rates.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The article goes on:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The weak currency means Canadians, and the Canadian government, have 
less buying power in the world. When the Canadian dollar falls, the government 
needs more Canadian dollars to make the interest payments on its large foreign 
debt. The increased tax rates after 1989 have thus increased the spending side of 
the government's budget by sinking the currency and raising interest rates, as 
well as shrinking real revenues.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Now this is not the party opposite. This is a world renowned, 
respected economist from the Hudson Institute.
<P>
	These are the kinds of comments, the kinds of articles that 
affect our interest rate on the 30 per cent of the foreign debt 
owned by other countries. Every time we make an interest 
payment on that foreign debt we are putting German, Japanese, 
and American people to work.
<P>
	Why do you think our interest rates are five points higher than 
the American interest rates? Is it because we are such great 
money managers? Why do you think our unemployment rate is 3 
or 4 per cent higher than the American unemployment rate, yet 
our economies have matched each other for 40 years? Is it 
because such masterful people have been running our economy, 
the Liberals, the Conservatives, and again the Liberals?
<P>
	In 1984 the Conservatives were elected with a mandate to get 
our country's finances under control. They did not. They blew it. 
There are two Conservatives in this House today. Count them. 
The Liberals have the same opportunity today to address the 
number one problem. If they do not do it there will be two of 
them left after the next election, maybe. Canadians are sick and 
tired of this Pollyanna attitude to what is really hurting our 
country.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the Reform Party member is right when he says that 
Canada is heading for national bankruptcy. The hon. member is 
also pretty much on target when he says that  the government 
lacks the will to put some order in its finances.
<P>
	This lack of political will, as well as the fact that we are 
obviously heading for bankruptcy, has been quite noticeable 
since the Liberals took office. Foreign investors are extremely 
concerned about the state of the federal government's finances. 
The fact that Canada's economic situation is truly out of control 
may not be the main reason why Quebec wants to become a 
sovereign state, but it is certainly one of the reasons. As the 
Reform member pointed out, this government lacks the will to 
act.
<P>
	We can accept the fact that Liberal members rise in this House 
to say that Canada is the best country in the world. However, 
with impending bankruptcy looming on the horizon, Canada 
may not hold that honour for much longer. This reminds me of 
the captain of the <I>Titanic</I> who, in 1912, said that his ship was the 
most beautiful in the world and referred to it as ``the unsinkable 
<I>Titanic</I>''.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	The <I>Titanic</I> sank, but that does not justify the fact that Canada 
is experiencing very serious problems. The whole world is 
aware of that, and particularly investors. Yet, this government 
does not have the political will to correct the situation. This is 
serious, especially since the government and the minister could 
take a whole slew of realistic measures to help the economy. 
However, they simply will not do that. On the contrary, the 
government is bent on eliminating the debt at the expense of the 
poor. And that makes this federal regime even more unfair.

<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Madam Speaker, I think my hon. colleague 
from the Bloc hit upon quite a salient point. We are facing yet 
again this question of how we are going to survive as a nation 
united with Quebec as a part of Canada.
<P>
	The Bloc brings forward the notion that what is it about the 
federation of Canada financially, is this country so well 
managed that we could not manage on our own just as well? I 
guess it does that because of the mess we are in and that 
argument has some weight. In my opinion, and I think in the 
opinion of most Canadians, we would all be much worse off, 
Canada and Quebec, in the event of a separation. That very 
question is hurting us today in interest rates.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> It is my duty, pursuant 
to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to 
be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the 
hon. member for Saint John-Trans-Canada Highway; the hon. 
member for Mercier-Manpower training.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9674"> 9674 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
like to add my words on the issue of Canada's financial 
circumstances.
<P>
	The other day I heard it described as a prize fight in Canada. It 
was a prize fight between the fiscal disciplinarians, and I would 
characterize the fiscal disciplinarian as our Minister of Finance, 
and the social capital advocates. I would describe the minister of 
HRD as the social capital advocate. This prize fight had been 
won by the fiscal disciplinarians. The commentary was that this 
was a tragedy for Canada because our social programs were 
going to be eaten away by fiscal disciplinarians, those who had 
understood and realized the depth and severity of our debt 
problems.
<P>
	My difficulty with that discussion and argument is that surely 
there is a connection between our social programs and financial 
responsibility. Surely there is a connection that will not allow 
that to be broken.
<P>
	I would like to go over a few individual statistics. I hear over 
and over again that the way out of our debt problems is simply to 
close loopholes and make our taxation system fairer.
<P>
	Taxes now account for a much bigger proportion of the 
average family budget than shelter, food and clothing combined. 
It is a complete reverse of what is normally present in the 
country. In 1961 the reverse was true.
<P>
<B>(1645 ) </B>
<P>
	There are those who say that the rich in our society should 
take a heavier hit from taxes. Last year the top 30 per cent of 
families, those earning $61,660 or more, paid 62.4 per cent of 
the taxes. ``Let's hit them harder'', say some. To those who say 
that we are not taxed too highly compared to our major trading 
partner, Canadians pay $50 billion more tax per year than 
Americans after adjusting for the size of our economy. We are 
taxed to the eyeballs. We are taxed until we are drowning. We 
are taxed so much that anyone who says we can pay more taxes is 
dreaming.
<P>
	I liken this to two individuals. One is a prize fighter who is 
lean, mean, quick and knows all the tricks. The other prize 
fighter looks like a Sumo wrestler. The Sumo wrestler waddles 
into the ring and says: ``I'm going to take you on'' and does take 
on the quick, alert prize fighter by lying on him and squashing 
him. There is no talent in that at all.
<P>
	The overweight, bloated debt in our country is a Sumo 
wrestler and it is going to kill completely the prize fighter who 
has the ability to move quickly, to adjust to circumstances and to 
be competitive.
<P>
	I tried to look for an international comparison to see if Canada 
could look at some other location. I looked at New Zealand. I 
took an opportunity to review what happened in New Zealand in 
1984. New Zealand has a House much like ours and these same 
conversations were going on in 1984. The government of the day 
said: ``Everything is fine. We are in third place in the world.  We 
are the third best country in the world. Everything is fine''. We 
heard that.
<P>
	One day after the debt wall-the member opposite said not to 
be so violent-I was going to say smack into the debt wall but 
instead I will say gently nudge up to the debt wall and hip check 
the debt wall. New Zealand did a hip check of the debt wall. 
They did not smash into the wall. In one day New Zealand went 
from the third highest in the world to twenty-second.
<P>
	My field is health care so I looked at what happened to health 
care in New Zealand in that one day. The same scenario faces 
Canada. In one day they ended up with advertising on the 
ambulances to pay for the fuel. To go to sick patients they had to 
advertise chocolates and booze, in order to get the sick patients 
to the hospital. In one day they went from a system very similar 
to ours where everything was free to a system where there were 
user fees for everything.
<P>
	One of my friends who practised medicine in New Zealand 
said: ``The tragedy for those individuals who came to the 
hospital with a coronary was that they lay sweating in bed 
worrying about how much it would cost''. This was from a 
society that said: ``Everything is fine. All is well''. One day 
later, their health care system was gone. Can members sitting on 
the other side tell me that is not a problem?
<P>
	What do I see in our health care system that caused me to 
come to Parliament, to leave a medical practice that obviously is 
better than doing this? What caused me to come here? These are 
the things that caused me to come here.
<P>
	First, the waiting lists for my patients were getting longer. I 
am told there are no problems in Manitoba today. Hip 
replacement is a 60-week wait. The standard for Canada should 
be 12.7 weeks. No problems in Canada.
<P>
	I watched technology in our country slipping behind other 
countries. We have in Canada 1.1 MRI machines per million 
people. The U.S. has lots of them. They are techno freaks so I 
will not talk about the U.S. Germany, a country very close to us, 
has 3.6 MRI machines per million people. Where do we go if we 
need an MRI in our country? We go to the U.S. We cross the 
border. We put our Canadian dollars on the table in the U.S.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	The technology that we need, that we deserve, that we must 
have, is being denied by a rigid set of rules that say we cannot 
provide more funds to the health care system. That might 
privatize something.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9675"> 9675 </A></B>
<P>
	If an individual here needs health care should we wait for 
New Zealand? I suppose that is the answer. Monumental 
waiting lists will be the legacy of a government that will not 
pay attention to our debt.
<P>
	I had a young student face me not so long ago and say to me: 
``You are so hard-hearted. All you care about are finances''. All 
I care about is a health care system that will survive. If we go 
New Zealand's route and I say to my grandchild that everything 
is fine, my grandchild will say to me, ``You are not a good 
grandad''.
<P>
	Health care will not survive with a government that does not 
pay attention to its debt. I will not allow that to happen.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Because the last 
speaker's time ran over by five minutes on questions and 
comments I will allow one comment and one question in 
response.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I was somewhat surprised by the comments of the 
Reform member, especially when he talked about health care. 
Obviously the Reform Party wants to privatize health care. It is a 
party that has not defended social programs. We are the only 
party that has defended social programs in this House, in spite of 
the attacks and reductions by the Liberal government.
<P>
	The Reform Party has not spoken in defence of social 
programs. It is obviously opening the door to privatization of 
health care. Our health care system is one of the standards of 
Canada, one of the hallmarks of Canada, one of the 
achievements of Canada. This party is talking about privatizing 
health care and giving us the model, obviously, of the American 
system where if a person gets sick he or she risks going bankrupt 
very quickly.
<P>
	Under the cover of comments of New Zealand's problems and 
success story, among all the other comments that have been 
made, which unfortunately Americanize things that have been 
good for Canada, he is again opening the door to a system that 
has proven to be costly and wasteful and even dangerous, where 
people go bankrupt if they become ill.
<P>
	That is not an avenue which is very constructive. It is 
probably even worse than what the federal government is now 
doing. The federal government has not been doing very much in 
terms of helping people, in terms of the social programs, in 
terms of health care. The government in trying to reduce its 
deficit has attacked unemployed people and senior citizens. It 
has tried to put more debt on students. It is now even increasing 
the rent of the poorest people in our society. That is what the 
government is doing now, which is probably the worst thing that 
I can imagine, and the hon. member is suggesting something 
which is even worse.
<P>
<B>(1655 ) </B>
<P>
	I ask the member how privatizing the health care system in 
Canada would improve the debt problem?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> Madam Speaker, I will have to be brief. 
That was quite a discourse.
<P>
	The response of the health minister in Quebec to the new 
proposals from the federal health minister is quite interesting to 
me. The health minister in Quebec said simply: ``Health is a 
provincial responsibility. The federal government should keep 
its nose out of health''. That is a proposal I strongly support.
<P>
	Alberta, my province, says that Quebec has it right. We may 
disagree on whether or not there is any place in health care for a 
safety valve. We may disagree but surely we do not disagree that 
health is an important program. Surely this is not a partisan 
issue.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
happy today to speak to the motion presented by my colleague, 
the member for Saint-Hyacinthe. I think it is important for the 
official opposition to raise once again this pressing matter 
which the government should address, but about which it keeps 
on procrastinating.
<P>
	The government is supposed to present its budget very soon; it 
was said to be in early February; but it would appear that it will 
not be until late February or even early March. The social reform 
was announced for the fall; it had been postponed until winter 
and now it is postponed indefinitely. In the meantime, the 
situation is deteriorating, the deficit and the debt are increasing.
<P>
	Why is the government dragging its heels? It is dragging its 
heels because it knows it must take steps which are going to hurt. 
It is afraid to do anything which will make it the enemy of the 
people or which will cause the vast majority of Canadians to 
hate it.
<P>
	In the past, we have made many suggestions on how to solve 
the deficit problem. We have offered numerous options to the 
government in order to solve this problem without raising taxes, 
but it refuses to listen. The solutions it favours, the only ones it 
is considering are those aimed at the majority of people, namely 
the under-privileged members of our society.
<P>
	What we are proposing instead is that the government target 
the minority of Canadians who are more fortunate, the people 
and corporations which are in a position to contribute more 
through their taxes. However, because these corporations, these 
executives, these wealthy people are friends of the government, 
it is reluctant to tackle a job which is most urgent. It refuses to 
assume its responsibilities for fear of alienating those 
Quebecers who are about to vote, in the referendum, in favour of 
a flexible Canada, a flexible constitution.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9676"> 9676 </A></B>
<P>
	The present government is playing hide and seek, when we 
require openness. In my speech, I would like to emphasize the 
collection of unpaid taxes owed to the federal government.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	My colleagues already talked about other aspects of the 
motion. They talked about trimming the fat from the 
government. True, we could save millions by doing that, but 
when we talk about trimming the fat, we do not mean simply 
cutting jobs in the civil service. It is not true to say that all 
depends on the number of civil servants. If there are too many, 
fine, by all means cut, but I hope the cuts are going to be fairly 
spread among the various provinces, not made in the way 
recently announced by the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal. If 
a 25 per cent reduction in spending is anticipated, I hope we will 
not see a 33 per cent cut in Quebec, as is expected.
<P>
	That is not the only way to trim the fat from the government. 
To trim the fat, we could have only one bus service to take 
members of Parliament from their offices to the House of 
Commons. The same bus service could be used by members of 
both houses to reduce the cost. We never talked about that. Each 
House wants its own staff, its own accommodations, its own 
transportation system, its own allowances. We have two sets of 
everything; yet we still wonder what purpose the other place 
serves. However, no expense is spared.
<P>
	I will not dwell on this issue any longer, because I want to 
come back to what I said earlier about recovering delinquent 
taxes. The auditor general made several comments on that topic. 
Most taxpayers pay their taxes when they file their income tax 
return or when they get a notice of assessment. But sometimes, 
measures have to be taken to recover, for example, unpaid 
balances or tax deductions at source. Also, an employer can 
forget to remit on time to the government the tax deductions at 
source. Or some taxpayers can deliberately neglect to pay their 
taxes.
<P>
	Let me describe briefly the situation we have. Right now, 
there is about $6.6 billion in delinquent taxes, that is unpaid 
taxes that should have been paid. These $6.6 billion are owed by 
some 1.6 million taxpayers. These are the numbers we had as of 
December 31, 1993. Of these $6.6 billion, $3.6 billion were 
owed by individuals, self-employed workers, corporations, and 
include source deductions by employers.
<P>
	Of that amount, $900 million had been owed for less than 90 
days. This was the case in 1993 for 21 per cent of taxpayers in 
arrears. And $250 million had been owed for more than 90 days 
on small amounts. But $5.35 million had been owed for more 
than 90 days on larger amounts. This was the case for 25 per cent 
of delinquent taxpayers.
<P>
	Thus, of the 1.6 million delinquent taxpayers or corporations, 
25 per cent, or some 400,000, representing the smallest group, 
owe more than $5 billion in taxes.  That is to say that each of 
these 400,000 taxpayers owes a lot of tax money to the 
government. These are not humble and poor people. They are 
not people who are always in need.
<P>
	On the Public Accounts Committee, we were told that we 
sometimes go easy on the people who have some difficulty in 
paying, because we do not want them to go bankrupt. We say: 
``We have to be understanding. Sometimes, you know, floods or 
fires occur. So companies are given more time to pay their 
taxes''.
<P>
	But for individuals whose income tax is deducted from their 
pay cheques, not even a flood will stop their employer from 
taking off their share of income tax and sending it directly to the 
government. Even if a fire destroys their home, these 
individuals will not be able to use the money that their employer 
has already deducted from their pay cheques for tax purposes. 
For salaried employees, the income tax is collected 
immediately. And for those who have different means of paying 
their income tax, the state is always willing to show some 
understanding, which gives these people an opportunity not only 
to take advantage of the system, but in many cases to abuse the 
system.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	I think that the government must take action to give the 
Department of Revenue more control over individuals and 
corporations that owe taxes to the government. There has to be 
greater control if the just society that we have heard so much 
about in this country is to be reflected in the way Canadians pay 
their taxes. If we want a just society, everybody must pay their 
fair share of taxes. We must not have half of the population 
paying taxes for the other half.
<P>
	I know that my time has expired. I still have a lot to say and I 
hope that the questions and comments period will give me an 
opportunity to complete my remarks.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to congratulate my colleague on his remarks about 
this motion presented for the official opposition by the hon. 
member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot. This opposition day 
motion clearly demonstrates how appropriate it is to warn the 
government of the consequences it will face if it continues to 
overburden low income taxpayers, the have-nots, the needy, and 
the unemployed, if it keeps doing what previous governments 
have been doing for years, and if it does not get its money where 
it should get it by following our ten point plan. Could the hon. 
member for Joliette who just spoke further explain the solutions 
advocated by our party, the Bloc Quebecois, in order to help the 
government better understand public finances?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for 
this opportunity he is giving me to add a few comments. Since 
the tabling of the last government budget, the Bloc Quebecois 
has gone out of its way to propose numerous solutions to help 
reduce the deficit.  One of the first measures we recommended 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9677"> 9677 </A></B>
<P>
was the creation of a joint committee on the financial situation. 
The Bloc Quebecois would have participated and we could have 
studied possible solutions together, out in the open. The 
government refused.
<P>
	Given that situation, we took a different approach. We 
proposed solutions to the Standing Committee on Finance. We 
asked that government pass legislation to prohibit family trusts 
as we know them today, because they are tax havens for a 
privileged few in our society. These are real solutions. There are 
billions of dollars in those trusts.
<P>
	Here in this House, and also in committee, we suggested that 
the government should focus more on finance and tax control. I 
have just spent the last ten minutes talking about taxes. Just 
think that there are now $6.6 billion in unpaid taxes which 
delinquent taxpayers will not pay; $6 billion is a lot of money 
and the interest on such an amount adds up to more millions. We 
asked the government to provide for stricter controls on those 
overdue accounts.
<P>
	We asked the government to look into the issue of businesses, 
tens of thousands of businesses, which have not paid taxes over 
the last ten years, in spite of profits earned in Canada. Why do 
we allow those companies to profit from such a tax exemption 
system, albeit a legal one? That is not normal; all taxpayers, 
corporations as well as individuals, should pay their fair share of 
taxes in Canada. That is another solution that we proposed to the 
government.
<P>
	We also proposed to slim down the government machinery. 
We talked about that many times. We also asked the government 
to avoid duplication in the various administration sectors, 
duplication of provincial and federal spending in the same areas.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	These are suggestions that we made to the federal government 
and, each time, we were met with an outright refusal. Why? 
Because in each of these solutions, the government saw an 
opportunity to decentralize its powers to the provinces, which it 
does not want to do, because its leitmotiv is to further centralize 
powers and to leave the provinces with their problems.
<P>
	It is clear today that this government does not intend to make 
concessions to the provinces. On the contrary, it intends to give 
them more responsibilities, without the tax points which would 
go with those responsibilities.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to say a few words on the opposition's motion, which 
reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House call upon the government in its next budget to avoid any tax 
increases targeting low and middle-income taxpayers and to consider instead 
trimming the fat from the government, eliminating tax expenditures which 
primarily benefit large corporations and wealthy Canadians and collecting on 
unpaid tax debts owed to the federal government.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It seems a bit strange that the opposition should feel the need, 
on the eve of the government's second budget, to ask it to think 
about getting off the backs of the disadvantaged and the 
unemployed and start spreading the wealth more equitably.
<P>
	However, the government has never stopped talking, in its 
electoral promises and in the red book it waved about 
throughout the entire electoral campaign, about equity and tax 
reform. It always defined itself as the protector of the ordinary 
citizen. It spoke of balance. It spoke of redistributing the 
country's wealth. Yet, since it has been in office, it has done just 
the opposite.
<P>
	Is this surprising behaviour from a Liberal government? Is it 
surprising that a government led by old crocks like the Prime 
Minister and the Minister of External Affairs, old political 
hacks, who have always backed down on their electoral 
commitments, who have always reneged on their promises?
<P>
	Let us go back a bit in the history of this moribund party. A 
party without a soul, that fails to keep its promises, interested 
only in staying in power to fatten up the friends of the regime, 
and let them take a turn at the trough. This has always been the 
Liberal party style.
<P>
	Do you remember, in the 1970s, when Robert Standfield 
promised in an election campaign, as the head of the 
Conservative party, that he would freeze wages and prices, and 
Pierre Trudeau, the head of the Liberal Party, said wages and 
prices should never be frozen? He was elected on this promise. 
What did he do six months after? Just the opposite of what he 
said he was going to do: he froze wages and prices. That is the 
Liberal party, for you: two different messages, one for the 
elections, another for once they are elected.
<P>
	Once they are elected, the promises are forgotten. Everything 
is forgotten. The red book becomes a red, blue or green paper 
depending on the occasion, and electoral commitments become 
simply good intentions that, unfortunately, the current 
economic situation obliges them to put off-like the 
postponement of the Axworthy reform or the promises to help 
the disadvantaged.
<P>
	Do you also remember, in the 1980s, when the Conservatives 
brought down a budget providing for an 18 cent increase in the 
price of gasoline, what the Liberals did?
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	There was an historic vote, which in fact defeated that 
government on the pretext that an 18 cent increase in the price of 
gasoline was unacceptable. The Liberals said: ``If we are voted 
back into office, there will be no increase in gas prices. We will 
exert better control over government spending. We will decrease 
the number of unemployed. All in all, we will reduce the deficit 
which has reached $13 billion''. Once again, we believed them. 
Very naive, in the opinion of many Quebecers and Canadians, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9678"> 9678 </A></B>
<P>
we believed them. And what did they do once they got back into 
office? In less than a year, the price of  gasoline increased by 65 
cents, not 18, contrary to what they had promised.
<P>
	During their term in office, from 1980 to 1985, the deficit rose 
from $13 billion to $38 billion. Sixteen months went by and no 
budget. In spite of this, Mr. Trudeau was travelling around the 
world. They were spending money left and right. Apparently 
they felt the need to interfere in all provincial jurisdictions to 
counter the rise of the sovereignist movement. Public 
expenditures were about $76 billion, but gradually rose to just 
over $100 billion.
<P>
	So much for the Liberal government. Is it surprising that we 
feel compelled, as the official opposition, to enjoin the 
government to remember the less fortunate, to think of its 
election promises and the promises made in the red book? We 
have to make the government realize and state publicly that we 
remember.
<P>
	I see members of the governing party lower their heads, and 
well they might. They are embarrassed in their ridings. They go 
to their ridings every weekend and are ashamed of all of these 
cuts.
<P>
	Take the first budget, for example. They had so much hope 
after being elected. But no, the first budget made an incredible, 
unacceptable attack on the unemployed. And yet these same 
Liberals while in opposition had cried murder over the Valcourt 
reform. And the cuts made by the Minister of Finance in the last 
budget are 5, 10, 15 times worse than those made by Minister 
Valcourt in the former government. Such criticisms have been 
completely forgotten.
<P>
	The Hon. Minister of Human Resources Development cried 
murder when there was talk of touching social programs. Now, 
he will deal the fatal blow to these programs. He proudly 
defends this, completely forgetting the commitments he made 
while in opposition and during the election campaign.
<P>
	We could also talk about the Liberal Party of the 1980s, which 
has not changed, is still run by the same people, who broke all 
their commitments, even betrayed their people, for example the 
Prime Minister and the Minister of Foreign Affairs, in order to 
rise to the leadership of, or to an important position in, the party. 
So in 1980 they said: ``Do not back sovereignty. This could 
jeopardize our seats. The dollar will fall to 80 cents if you do''. 
At the time, the dollar was worth $1.03. Suddenly after the 
Liberals came to power, the dollar sank to 69 cents.
<P>
	That is the Liberal Party, and the same people are still running 
it. Can we believe them when they say they will table a fair 
budget? Never. So, we openly say to them: ``The eyes of the 
public in Canada and Quebec are on you. They are watching you. 
Your commitments are still printed in the red book and you will 
have to fulfil them. We beseech you to find concrete solutions''. 
As the hon. member for Joliette said earlier, we recommended 
10 ways to clean up the government's finances, to trim the fat, to 
make people who have the means pay and to  unearth those who 
bury their money in tax havens. We have repeated this many 
times. We will see whether you will take into consideration our 
suggestions or if you will continue to break your promises.
<P>
	Now, let us recall the last speech on free trade that the Prime 
Minister made in Montreal. He warned Quebecers that they will 
be shut out of free trade. However, when the vote on free trade 
was on, the Prime Minister travelled Canada-wide to preach 
against it, to spew out lies about it. Now, he warns Quebecers 
that if they declare sovereignty they may not be covered under 
the free trade agreement, which he now considers as an element 
that is essential to Canada's survival, even though he denied this 
throughout the 1988 campaign which was based on free trade. 
Two different messages, one for the election campaign, one for 
when he came to power. The Liberals as they have always been.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	I will end on the following note: As a Bloc Quebecois member 
and as a representative of Quebec, I remind my fellow citizens, 
Quebecers, that trusting this government, trusting these 
politicians, has always led to disappointment. The time is long 
overdue for us to take over full power to tax and to pick and 
choose the services we want to share with this federal state.
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
congratulate my colleague from Richelieu on his heartfelt 
speech in which he shared his past experience with the House. 
Of course, he raised points denouncing the behaviour of our 
Liberal friends opposite who, when they were in opposition, 
criticized the Tories on the issue of cuts to social programs and 
often on the tax system. He told us clearly that the Liberal Party 
was not the same after the election.
<P>
	I wish to ask my colleague from Richelieu if, on the basis of 
his experience in federal politics, he could explain to us how a 
party like the federal Liberal Party, which initiated major social 
programs, which used to pay lip service to the need to defend the 
most disadvantaged in society, is now cutting UI benefits and 
transfer payments to the provinces for social assistance and 
education, while at the same time closing its eyes to the fact that 
some members of society do not pay the taxes they owe the 
government. The question I want to ask my colleague is this: 
Based on his experience, how did the federal Liberal Party reach 
this point?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9679"> 9679 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> Madam Speaker, I welcome this question. 
Nothing the Liberals do should ever come as a surprise. They 
will stop at nothing. But when you say that certain social 
programs were instigated by the Liberal Party, make no mistake 
about this party. It happens that it often formed the minority 
back in those days. There was a left-center trend in Canada, 
Quebec, America and even Europe then, and this leftist 
sentiment often found a voice in the third party, that is to say 
the New Democratic Party, who traded its support to the 
government for rather important social measures. Therefore, 
the credit does not go the Liberal Party for instigating the 
measures, because it simply acted to ensure its survival and 
remain in power.
<P>
	Now, there is a shift toward the right, as can be seen with the 
emergence of the Reform Party. So, what do the Liberals do? 
They go with the flow, shifting toward the right, casually casting 
aside any commitment or promise made and anything it has been 
forced to do by the NDP in the 1970s. They are now forced by the 
Reform Party to renege on all that. They are making this shift to 
the right for the sake of staying in power.
<P>
	The Liberal Party can also be expected to go to any length to 
succeed. It has never had an ounce of social conscience. Not 
only does it renege on its commitments, but this is the kind of 
party that will happily squander public funds and do whatever it 
takes to stay in power. You do not have to go far to find evidence 
of this. Take today for example, with these Canadian flag 
celebrations. This is hilarious. Have you ever heard of an 
organization celebrating its 30th anniversary? Of course not. 
You celebrate a 25th or 50th anniversary. And not a penny had 
been spent on the 25th anniversary of the flag.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	It has now been decided to spend $1 million on propaganda 
against Quebec sovereignty. They will do anything, have 
800,000 posters printed, 400,000 in Quebec alone. The 
propaganda effort is under way, taking up million upon million 
of dollars, but that is no problem. That is the Liberal way. You 
set up three floors of office space in an office building in 
Ottawa, pay salaries of $90,000 to $100,000 to everyone if 
necessary, and you have the money to set the propaganda 
machine in motion. The Liberals will do anything, anything 
short of having open and honest discussions, honouring their 
commitments and going back to their red book to check what 
promises were made and concentrate on fulfilling them. And 
these are basically the things the Bloc Quebecois is asking for in 
its motion.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry but the hon. 
member's time is up.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Parliamentary Secretary 
to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened with intent to members of the Bloc and members of the 
Reform Party. I must say I heard a lot of rhetoric from the 
member for Richelieu  but not many solutions to the problem he 
has put forward.
<P>
	I am wondering where members of the Bloc have been. A lot 
of the points they have brought forward have been discussed. In 
the motion they have put forward today they refer to no taxes on 
lower and middle income taxpayers. As a Liberal member the 
last thing I want is taxes. I think Canadians are overtaxed. As a 
government and as a member of Parliament we are working 
toward reducing taxes if anything. That is what the Canadian 
public wants.
<P>
	The member for Richelieu spoke extensively about 
commitments. The recent byelections show where the Canadian 
public stands and that the government has fulfilled its 
commitment. That is why we won three out of three seats in the 
byelections. It is a pretty good signal for the government. We are 
following the agenda we put forward in the red book. We are 
fulfilling those promises and we will continue to do so.
<P>
	I heard both Bloc and Reform members talk about tax 
increases. I have never heard the minister say that there would 
be tax increases in the budget. He has said that we will have a 
fair taxation system. No taxes does not mean that we do not want 
fairness and equity. We want fairness in the tax system and we 
want equity in the tax system. That is what the minister did in the 
last budget and that is what I am confident he will do in this 
budget as well.
<P>
	Bloc members have talked about the other part of the motion 
which deals with trimming the fat from government. This is why 
I say I do not know where they have been. That is what we talked 
about; we talked about getting rid of duplication in government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Talk, talk, talk. No action.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dhaliwal:</B> We took action. I do not know where the 
Reform members were; maybe they were sleeping. Look at the 
boards we got rid of. That bill was recently discussed. Look at 
the number of patronage appointments we have dropped: 
one-third. I have to hand it to the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs who has reduced the number of political appointments 
from 3,000 to 2,000.
<P>
	We are not a party that wants to add. We want to reduce. We 
want to look at what federal agencies make sense and what ones 
do not, what are duplications and where changes need to be 
made. Those members should wake up. They should learn to 
understand and hear, not just listen.
<P>
	The bill that was before the House recently talked about a 
comprehensive program review on which the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs has done an excellent job. It will look 
from the bottom up in a comprehensive review.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9680"> 9680 </A></B>
<P>
	Too often government keeps adding programs. We have 
learned that now is the time to do a very comprehensive review 
and ask: ``Do we need this program? Does it make sense? Is 
it relevant today? Is the structure correct?'' We have taken 
action and we will continue to take action on those programs.
<P>
	If we look at the reductions of numbers on boards, some 
boards have been totally eliminated and other boards have had 
their numbers reduced. We can cut but there is a limit. We can 
only cut so much. I know Reform members want to slash and 
burn everything totally but that is not the solution. Those 
members do not understand we have to build the infrastructure, 
whether it is the cultural infrastructure or the scientific 
infrastructure.
<P>
<B>(1730 ) </B>
<P>
	If Reform members would listen they would learn something 
but too often they are not listening.
<P>
	People always want to build silicone valleys and tremendous 
infrastructures. Those cannot be done overnight. But it can be 
destroyed overnight by slashing the budgets. Members of the 
Reform Party were the people who were against the 
infrastructure program. They do not have a very good 
understanding of how important infrastructure is, whether it is 
the road system or the communication system. All those systems 
are very important.
<P>
	As a business person I know how important that is. If a 
business person wants to transport goods some 100 miles away, 
without a good road system it could take four hours instead of 
two hours, which would be more expensive. Therefore, good 
infrastructure is very important.
<P>
	The members of the Reform Party keep talking about this 
huge tax increase coming up. They know it is not true. Why are 
they doing it? It is because their membership is dropping and 
they want to increase their membership. They have sent out a 
brochure with all sorts of figures. In the middle of that brochure, 
lo and behold, is a membership form. What does it say? It says: 
``Join the Reform Party''. It is political opportunism. Shame on 
you. Let us give the reality to the Canadian public. Let us give 
the truth.
<P>
	We have to deal with the deficit and we have a clear program. 
As I said earlier, if the Reform members would listen they would 
learn but too often they have this one narrow view. Any other 
view to them is totally out.
<P>
	We have to deal with the deficit. We have to do it with a 
rational, realistic and reasonable approach. We have set 
ourselves very clear targets. We set them during the election and 
we are going to follow through. We said we were going to bring 
the deficit down to 3 per cent of GDP in the first three years.
<P>
	The members of the Reform Party had this crazy plan zero in 
three. They have abandoned that and are now calling it zero in 
five. They want to do it over five years now. They have realized 
that it cannot be done in three years.
<P>
	Part of dealing with a deficit is not only dealing with the 
expenditure side but dealing with the revenue side as well. We 
have to make sure there is economic growth and confidence in 
the economy. Under the Reform program you would take $40 
billion out of the economy over three years. Is that going to build 
confidence in the economy? Is that going to create economic 
growth? Absolutely not. That is why a rational and reasonable 
approach is very important.
<P>
	Reform members always talk about the pension-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> May I ask hon. members 
to address their comments through the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dhaliwal:</B> Madam Speaker, as I was saying, to deal with 
the deficit we have to have a rational and reasonable approach 
both on the expenditure side and the revenue side. We have set a 
clear agenda and clear goals. We are going to fulfil the goal that 
we set during the election. We continue to say that we will bring 
it down to 3 per cent of GDP.
<P>
	On the other side is the revenue part of it. We want to make 
sure there is confidence in the economy. If you look at what has 
happened, we have done that. We have had 4.7 per cent growth in 
the economy. We have created 400,000 jobs. That creates 
confidence in the economy where people want to invest and 
make sure that we are able to create growth.
<P>
	Another thing we have done is assist small businesses because 
we know they create employment and jobs. We want to make 
sure we reduce the paper burden on small business. We have 
taken steps to do that.
<P>
<B>(1735 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dhaliwal:</B> The member is applauding because we know 
we have taken concrete steps to reduce the paper burden on 
small business.
<P>
	Also, in the creating of wealth, we have set a very good 
agenda on the trade side. Members have seen what a successful 
program the Prime Minister has put forward to ensure that in this 
global economy we will be able to compete, that Canadian 
business will be able to go all over the world to promote their 
products, ensuring we are not left out of the global economy.
<P>
	Not only do we have an expenditure program, we also have a 
revenue program to make sure we deal with the current 
economy.
<P>
	We are going to deal with the deficit. Canadians want us to 
deal with it and I am sure members from both sides will support 
<P>

the budget, which will deal with our difficult situation in a 
rational, reasonable and comprehensive way.

my duty to inform the House that, pursuant to Standing Order 
81(19), proceedings on the motion have expired.

	<B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. Clair, Lib.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House, recognizing the fundamental Canadian right of religious 
freedom and the courageous contributions of our veterans of all faiths, urge the 
Royal Canadian Legion and its constituent branches to reconsider their recent 
decision so that all of their members will have access to their facilities without 
having to remove religious head coverings, including the Sikh turban and the 
Jewish kipa.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	She said: Madam Speaker, I am splitting my time with the 
hon. Secretary of State for Multiculturalism and the Status of 
Women.
<P>
	Although I proudly represent the riding of Windsor-St. 
Clair, I was not raised there. I grew up in a small town, a village 
actually, Thamesville, Ontario, in the riding of Chatham-Kent. 
I grew up in a warm, wonderful home with caring parents, four 
caring sisters, in a caring village of only 1,000 people. I grew up 
thinking that our way of life, my family's way of life, the way we 
related to one another, the expressions we used, our 
relationships to our extended family, the food we ate and all the 
things we did were just plain Canadian.
<P>
	However, as I grew older and my personal world expanded, 
my perception of what was Canadian changed radically. My 
parents adopted three sons, my brothers, who are proud to be 
aboriginal Canadians. I went to a university. I made friends with 
men and women of colour, of varying religions and heritages. I 
married a Jew and I raised with him our daughter in a new 
multicultural world.
<P>
	Eventually it came full circle as I came to know friends who 
were recent immigrants to Canada from Ireland. I visited their 
home. I watched their way of life, the way they related to one 
another, the expressions they used, their relationships to their 
extended family, the food they ate. I realized with something of 
a jolt that I was seeing my own roots. There remained things in 
my life that still hearken back to the Shaughnessys and the 
Brennans who came to Canada in the 1840s and to the Murrays 
and Bradys who came here at the beginning of this century.
<P>
	I realized then that I, a fifth generation Canadian on my 
mother's side, am different. I realized that I am a product of my 
heritage, and I am entitled to be proud of that heritage. Pride in 
my heritage is pride in my present. My heritage is very much a 
part of the Canadian fabric.
<P>
	Over the centuries there have been vast waves of immigration 
to Canada. Aboriginal people migrated here; Europeans came. 
People came from the Middle East, Africa, India, Japan, 
Vietnam, Korea, China and points east. With them came their 
heritage, their culture and their religious beliefs. My maternal 
ancestors, like many of them, came here not voluntarily but 
because of persecution in Ireland.
<P>
<B>(1740 ) </B>
<P>
	They were fleeing an artificial famine. They lost their 
property and were hoping to find a place where they could live in 
economic freedom and could practice their religion.
<P>
	That is one very good reason why new Canadians come here 
today. I say that it is the duty of all Canadians to welcome them, 
their heritage, their religions and to honour their traditions and 
let them practice them, just as my great-great-grandparents 
were allowed to go to mass, to dance their jigs, to drink their 
beer and to live in peace.
<P>
	This motion is not just about the Canadian Legion. This 
motion is about Canada, our multiculturalism and our tolerance 
of our fellow citizens. On Remembrance Day 1993, the Newton 
Royal Canadian Legion hall in Surrey, B.C. refused to permit 
four Sikh veterans into the hall because of their religious 
headgear.
<P>
	The four individuals were a retired Indian air force technician 
and three Sikh World War II veterans. Thirteen other veterans 
trooped from the hall to show their support for the Sikh 
members.
<P>
	On entering the Legion hall, removing hats out of respect for 
fallen comrades is a dearly and deeply held tradition. On May 
31, 1994 delegates to the Royal Canadian Legion's national 
convention voted against a bylaw that was revised by the 
dominion executive council that would have required all of its 
1,700 branches to admit those wearing religious headgear into 
public areas of Legion halls.
<P>
	Today only about 5 to 10 per cent of the Legion's constituent 
branches are opposed to the wearing of religious head-dress as 
they feel it displays disrespect to Canada's war dead. They claim 
that it is their right to make this decision because they have a 
private club. They say that because they took a democratic vote, 
the majority must rule.
<P>
	Both the Canadian Jewish Congress and the World Sikh 
Organization realize that this decision does not represent all 
veterans and is not binding on all Legion branches. I would like 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9682"> 9682 </A></B>
<P>
to point out that in zone 10 of the Royal Canadian Legion, which 
is the town of Tecumseh that I represent, the city of Windsor part 
that I represent  and the town of LaSalle, the newest town of 
Ontario which is part of the riding of Essex-Windsor, no 
Legion discriminates against people based on their headgear.
<P>
	I call on the Legions and I call on other organizations to 
recognize that headgear and other religious symbols are simply 
that. They are the symbol to that person of a deeply held belief.
<P>
	The Quebec Human Rights Commission yesterday ruled that 
the wearing of a veil by Muslim women is not something that 
can be interfered with by the state, nor is it something that 
should be forbidden in schools or in public places. The Royal 
Canadian Mounted Police have accepted religious headgear as 
part of their uniforms.
<P>
	My father, who is a veteran and my constituents who are 
veterans, are proud to march next to the many great Sikh 
veterans, the many great Jewish veterans who wear kipas or 
yarmulkas. They are proud to march with them and we all should 
be. Instead of forbidding them from entering our institutions, 
instead of giving them a hard time, we should be thanking them 
for the freedoms they have preserved, so that Shaughnessy 
Cohen can go to mass, so that she can serve in the House of 
Commons, the freedom that others have in this society that we 
would not have if it were not for them.
<P>
	I call on this House to support this motion. I call on all 
members to urge the Royal Canadian Legion and it constituent 
branches to reconsider their recent decision.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Secretary of State 
(Multiculturalism) (Status of Women), Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to second the motion brought before us 
and I thank the member for Windsor-St. Clair for raising this 
issue today, particularly as it comes so close to the beginning of 
a new year, one in which veterans will be much in our thoughts.
<P>
<B>(1745 ) </B>
<P>
	This year we observe the 50th anniversary of the end of the 
second world war. We recall the Canadians who fought in that 
conflict, above all those who lost their lives on the field of battle 
and also those who returned after the war to continue working 
peacefully for the same principles for which they had once 
fought. Those principles were democracy, human rights, 
freedom of the individual, and respect for people of different 
appearances, cultures and religions. These principles have 
become woven into the very fabric of Canadian society.
<P>
	I am sure all hon. members of the House honour Canada's 
veterans as well as the organization that has represented them 
with such dignity for nearly 70 years. I am referring of course to 
the Royal Canadian Legion. We admire its members for 
upholding Canada's traditions. The most important of those 
traditions are the principles for which legion members fought 
and bled on our behalf half a century ago.
<P>
	Back in 1986 a commemorative volume was published to 
mark the legion's 60th anniversary. It is a handsome book, full 
of warm anecdotes and evocative images. At one point it notes 
how the legion has evolved along with the country. It states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The people of today's Legion reflect the complex cultural mosaic of Canada. 
Though they hail from diverse ethnic backgrounds from Inuit and Indian to 
Greek, Jewish, Ukrainian, Polish and French Canadian, all Legion members are 
united by common ideals. They are joined by a spirit of volunteerism and a 
dedication to peace and democracy, patriotism and commemoration, mutual help 
and wide community service.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That spirit of service has made the Royal Canadian Legion a 
highly valued national institution. Through it our veterans have 
gone on contributing to our country in years of peace as they 
once did in wartime. It is a matter of deep regret now to find this 
organization embroiled in a controversy that threatens to lower 
the esteem of Canadians for this grand institution, the legion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is certainly not up to this House today to define the rules on 
how members of the Royal Canadian Legion should pay tribute 
to our country's victims of war. Nor should we decide how Sikhs 
and Jews should practice their religion in Canada. Rather, we 
must ensure that all Canadians are treated in compliance with 
the law and the fundamental principles which govern our 
society.
<P>
	While very unfortunate, that incident forced us to reconsider 
these principles and ask ourselves if we comply with them. 
Indeed, this review could help us define the kind of country we 
want and how we can build it. And that should be the most 
significant aspect of what happened on November 11, 1993.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Imagine, Madam Speaker, that you should meet a gentleman 
of the old school whose distinguished bearing is a sure sign of 
his military background. He tells you that, following in his 
father's footsteps, he enlisted at the age of 18 and served for 
nearly 40 years in the armed forces. During the second world 
war he fought in North Africa at El Alamein, Tobruk and many 
other famous battles.
<P>
	Since Remembrance Day is approaching, you invite this 
gentleman and some of his colleagues to join with you and your 
fellow veterans to mark the occasion. But when they turn up 
wearing their well-earned medals, you subject them to a public 
humiliation that shocks them and many of the participants in the 
observant ceremonies.
<P>
	It is hard to believe that such an incident could happen here in 
Canada. But it did happen in 1993 when Lieutenant-Colonel 
Pritam Singh Jauhal and four other Sikh veterans from Surrey, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9683"> 9683 </A></B>
<P>
British Columbia were refused admittance to the nearby Newton 
legion branch even though they were invited guests. The door 
was barred to them unless they agreed to remove their turbans, 
something observant Sikhs could never do.
<P>
	One would have expected them to have been made welcome in 
every way out of feelings of gratitude, respect for their years, or 
simple hospitality. Instead, less rational feelings held sway that 
day.
<P>
	Though within weeks the president of the branch offered an 
unconditional apology, last May the legion's dominion 
convention revived the controversy by voting down a proposal 
to allow religious head-dress in legion halls. The convention 
thereby barred from legion premises orthodox Sikhs who wear 
the turban, as well as orthodox Jews who wear a skullcap or kipa.
<P>
<B>(1750 ) </B>
<P>
	Legion members argued that their tradition requires all who 
enter legion halls to remove their head-dress as a mark of 
respect to those who fell in battle as well as to the sovereign. No 
one can question the desirability of showing respect, but surely 
there are different ways of doing this.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	What are these issues, and why do they generate such 
concern? One of them may have to do with freedom of religion, 
while another is undoubtedly related to the right of all 
Canadians to equal treatment, without discrimination based on 
race or on national or ethnic origin. However, these rights are 
part of Canada's global social and political structure. What is at 
stake here is the very nature of that structure, the type of society 
in which we live, as well as the kind of country which we want 
for ourselves and for future generations of Canadians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In a letter to the Prime Minister, Lieutenant-Colonel Jauhal 
and his colleagues recently wrote about their wartime service:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>During the second world war alongside the Commonwealth armed forces, we 
too put our lives on the line to protect the Commonwealth and preserve the 
democracy in which different people could live together and enjoy freedom in 
peace. Irrespective of different nationalities, faiths and cultures, we all in the 
Commonwealth armed forces developed comradeship, esprit de corps and 
tenacity and formed ourselves into a well-knit united family. Not only did we 
respect each other, we would have died for each other.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>During the second world war-no Canadian comrade asked us to remove our 
turban at that time. At Buckingham Palace Sikhs were allowed to appear in 
turbans before the King and Queen to receive awards. In Victoria last August the 
Queen met and chatted with each one of us. She did not ask us to remove our 
turbans.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	If there is a note of bewilderment here, I think it is 
understandable. The Queen is a living symbol of Canada's 
traditions as well as those of the legion. If she is able to 
countenance the turban, to look beyond the headgear to the man, 
cannot the Royal Canadian Legion do likewise?
<P>
	The Sikh veterans who were refused admittance have filed a 
formal complaint with the British Columbia Human Rights 
Commission. I have little doubt that through such formal 
channels they can gain a ruling in their favour. But would it not 
be preferable to do the right thing willingly rather than under 
court order?
<P>
	There is more at stake here than simply showing civility. The 
five who were turned away are Canadians as much as I am and 
everyone else is in this Chamber. Whatever their appearance or 
religion, they have the right to participate fully in our national 
life.
<P>
	Still more, all of us are impoverished if any group is 
marginalized and denied full participation. Even in the case of 
those who refuse to accept religious head-dress, we gain 
nothing by putting the worst interpretation on their actions. In 
fact, I think we misrepresent them by doing that.
<P>
	The comments of legion members who voted against allowing 
headgear suggest that they were acting to uphold traditions. In 
the decades since they fought for our country they have seen 
Canada change at a dizzying pace. Successive waves of 
immigrants have transformed the face of Canadian society. This 
change is thought by some to be jeopardizing our fundamental 
values and traditions.
<P>
	Let us recall what our traditions truly are, what being a 
Canadian and possessing a generosity of spirit is all about. 
Ultimately, I think we can all agree it is not a matter of 
appearance. This country derives its identity and its greatness 
from the principles for which our veterans fought: democracy; 
basic human freedom; fairness; justice; and equality of rights 
for all. Just plain decency.
<P>
	By acting on these principles we uphold Canada's traditions. 
By working to realize these ideals in our ever evolving 
multicultural society, we show that we have not forgotten the 
sacrifices of our veterans. We will always remember them.
<P>
<B>(1755 ) </B>
<P>
	I am confident that the members of the Royal Canadian 
Legion will demonstrate in peacetime the same courage they 
showed in battle. For all of us, they can continue to set an 
example of generosity, of inclusion, and fairness.
<P>
	I thank the member for allowing us to have this discussion 
today.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
as the veterans affairs critic for the official opposition, I 
welcome the opportunity to take part in this debate. However, 
we cannot expect the debate on the motion moved by the hon. 
member for Windsor-St. Clair to provide us with the answer to a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9684"> 9684 </A></B>
<P>
problem involving the rights of the individual and the rights of 
the community. We can explain our respective positions and 
comment on  them, but it would be hazardous for anyone to 
claim that he or she has the answer.
<P>
	After establishing the principle of human rights a number of 
years ago, we started to establish the boundary between 
individual rights and the rights of agencies, corporations or 
companies. We know that these two kinds of rights-individual 
and collective rights-may or may not clash, depending on how 
tolerant or intolerant people are.
<P>
	Individual rights have been recognized for many years by 
various charters of rights and freedoms. One that stands out is 
the charter adopted unanimously by the Quebec National 
Assembly in 1975. These charters recognize the right to 
fundamental freedoms such as freedom of conscience and 
freedom of religion, freedom of thought, belief, opinion and 
expression, freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of 
association.
<P>
	Some of these individual or collective rights may impinge on 
one another. We all know this fundamental principle: one 
person's freedom extends to where the other person's freedom 
starts. However, although Parliament can indicate how we 
should see the nature of this boundary between my rights and the 
rights of my neighbour, it is up to the courts to make a decision 
in disputes that may arise between conflicting rights. We can 
suggest where the boundary should lie, without actually 
changing anything. In this case, we think that, in time, a 
consensus will develop in favour of greater tolerance.
<P>
	Tolerance, and by that I mean accepting the differences of the 
other person, is not always easy to accept when we are directly 
involved. Tolerance can quickly turn into resistance when we 
are directly confronted with a total departure from what we see 
as normal.
<P>
	In this particular case, the Legion tells us that the wearing of 
the Sikh turban and the Jewish kipa is not allowed in the 
facilities of the legion, any more than any other head coverings. 
To the legion, the religious aspect of certain head covering is 
irrelevant. The Royal Canadian Legion argues that an 
organization has the right to impose certain rules and practices 
within the framework of its activities.
<P>
	This position is not consistent, however. A spokesperson for 
the Canadian Jewish Congress pointed out last June that the 
Legion had no trouble with cowboy hats or baseball caps. Why 
the inconsistency?
<P>
	At a Christmas party in 1987, a branch of the legion in Alberta 
barred a Sikh wearing a turban from entering its premises, 
although the hall had been rented for the occasion and the Sikh 
was not a member of the legion. He then filed a complaint with 
the Alberta Human Rights Commission. A tribunal finally asked 
the branch to apologize and amend its discriminatory 
regulations since the legion does not have the right to deny 
access to public activities. The branch made minor changes 
without allowing full access.
<P>
	The 1990 turban scandal provoked strong negative reactions 
in many branches of the Royal Canadian Legion against 
legitimate differences that are not prejudicial to legion members 
in any way. On November 30, 1993, Sikh veterans participating 
in Remembrance Day ceremonies in Surrey, British Columbia, 
were denied access to royal legion facilities because they 
refused to remove their turbans.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	In February 1994, the president of a local branch in Cornwall, 
Ontario was reinstated after being suspended by the provincial 
branch after he spoke against the wearing of turbans. Either to 
clarify the situation or to try to hold back the movement against 
the religious practices of fellow soldiers, the Royal Canadian 
Legion took the opportunity, at its annual convention in late 
May 1994, to urge participants to pass a resolution allowing 
Sikh members to wear religious head-dress on branch premises.
<P>
	Those present rejected this proposal, forcing their national 
president to resign on the spot. Without a national policy, 
individual branches are still free to regulate access to their 
facilities as they see fit. This event has stirred up many 
reactions, here in the House of Commons as well as in the media. 
Local chapters of the legion that have formulated or maintained 
the restrictions concerning the wearing of head-dress have 
pointed out that they are exercising a right accorded to private 
organizations such as theirs.
<P>
	In fact, the Royal Canadian Legion has its roots in a private 
organization formed on July 10, 1926, which through federal 
statute assented to on June 30, 1948 was incorporated as the 
Royal Canadian Legion. The best conclusion that I can offer this 
Chamber is undoubtedly the one that preceded us by 24 hours, in 
Montreal. Yesterday, the Quebec human rights commission 
published a legal opinion concerning the banning of the Islamic 
head scarf. It ruled clearly that such bans were a violation of 
freedom of religion.
<P>
	In the same breath, however, it recalled that section 20 of the 
Quebec charter of rights and freedoms allows non-profit 
organizations to impose rules consistent with their objectives of 
a charitable, philanthropic, religious, political or educational 
nature. For the commission, this provision would not, however, 
allow interference with the freedom of conscience or religion of 
an individual.
<P>
	The Quebec human rights commission is in a way proposing a 
set of rules under which the current debate on religious 
pluralism could take place. They set out clearly the legal 
principles that the courts should rely on in dealing with these 
issues. Although it emphasizes that the Quebec charter would 
prohibit any discrimination on the basis of religion, the 
commission does not recommend that the courts be asked to 
settle disputes. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9685"> 9685 </A></B>
<P>
Instead, it invites the opposing parties and the general public to 
arrive at a consensus on the broader issue of conflicting rights.
<P>
	This is our choice. We hope that attitudes will evolve and that 
each of us will become aware of the worth of others, with respect 
for the self. We invite the Royal Canadian Legion to examine the 
opinions just published by the Quebec human rights 
commission.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak on Motion 
No. 310.
<P>
	My fellow colleague's attack against the Royal Canadian 
Legion, an independent association of veterans who risked their 
lives to fight racism and oppression, is in my opinion 
unfounded.
<P>
	The Royal Canadian Legion is not an organization permeated 
with bigots and racists-far from it. The legion is an 
organization of war veterans with their own valued customs and 
traditions to show respect for their fallen comrades.
<P>
	Their methods of showing respect are their own and should 
not be subject to parliamentary inquiry. I feel strongly that my 
colleague has misinterpreted the whole issue.
<P>
	During the 35th dominion convention of the Royal Canadian 
Legion which was held in Calgary from May 29 to June 2, 1994 
the legion passed a resolution:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Branch bylaws or house rules shall include a provision for the wearing of 
head-dress in the premises and when doing so must provide that religious 
head-dress is not considered to constitute head-dress in the traditional sense.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Therefore, once a person who is required to wear head-dress by his faith has 
been accepted as a Legion member, or invited as a guest to a Legion branch, he is 
authorized admission to all areas of that branch that are normally open to the 
general membership or invited guests.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1805 ) </B>
<P>
	This bylaw clearly states that once a branch allows an 
individual in as a member or as a guest that individual will have 
access to all areas of the branch regardless of religious 
head-dress. This is a sensible policy.
<P>
	However, individual branches can comply with this bylaw as 
they see fit due to their grassroots independence from the 
dominion command. Individual legion branches have the right 
to accept or refuse all new members, period, regardless of 
head-dress. Therefore, the legion has taken effective action to 
ensure that all Canadians have access to their facilities.
<P>
	President of the Royal Canadian Legion, Mr. Hugh Greene, 
stated after the convention: ``It is wrong to say that the 
convention banned turbans. The delegates did not vote to ban 
religious head-dress from branches. The vote was to rescind a 
national general bylaw that imposed a dress regulation on 
branches. This decision took the responsibility for branch 
head-dress rules back into the hands of the branches''.
<P>
	I find it hard to comprehend why my colleague wants this 
decision reversed. As she states in her motion:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-urge the Royal Canadian Legion and its constituent branches to reconsider 
their recent decision.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Is the return to a national general bylaw imposing a dress 
regulation in the best interest of all Canadians? I do not think so. 
I think it is important for Parliament to respect the right of 
organizations such as the legion to make and maintain their own 
bylaws. Nobody in Parliament would question the bylaws of the 
Kiwanis Club or the Optimist Club. Besides, the Royal Canadian 
Legion has been very generous in its interpretation of its 
customs. The vast majority of legion branches are following the 
resolutions passed by the conventions.
<P>
	If the members across the way would listen for a minute, the 
statement made was that the vast majority of legion branches are 
following the resolution passed by the convention.
<P>
	John Spellman, professor of Asian studies at the University of 
Windsor, documented that in the past 67 years and out of a 
membership of nearly 700,000 there have been fewer than six 
cases in all in Canada involving turbaned Sikhs not being 
admitted to Legion halls. No person of Jewish descent has ever 
been turned away. The Human Rights Commission has only ever 
decided against a legion branch once. Many veterans who 
require head-dress for religious reasons have been legion 
members for years.
<P>
	My colleague's motion has called into question the integrity 
of the Royal Canadian Legion and I feel strongly that I must set 
the record straight. I would like to take this opportunity to tell 
the House what kind of organization the Royal Canadian Legion 
is.
<P>
	We all know the legion was formed after the great war to help 
veterans secure adequate pensions and other well earned 
benefits for them and their families. Today's Royal Canadian 
Legion has many other stated purposes and objectives which 
include bringing about the unity of all who have served their 
country, furthering the spirit of camaraderie, striving for peace, 
goodwill and friendship among all nations, co-operating with 
the commonwealth and allied associations with similar aims and 
encouraging, promoting and engaging in or supporting all forms 
of national, provincial, municipal and community service or any 
other charitable purpose.
<P>
	Today's Royal Canadian Legion benefits everyone in this 
room and all Canadians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9686"> 9686 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	Its programs have had a very positive impact throughout the 
communities that are blessed with a legion branch. In 1993 the 
Royal Canadian Legion's 1,720 branches contributed $63 
million and over 2 million volunteer person hours to their 
communities.
<P>
	The Royal Canadian Legion, through its service bureau which 
acts as an advocate for thousands of veterans and their families, 
provided assistance to those veterans.
<P>
	In 1993 the Royal Canadian Legion provided $6.8 million in 
direct support and over half a million hours of volunteer time 
assisting 67,000 veterans.
<P>
	The legion is also active in supporting commonwealth 
veterans internationally. As a member of the British 
Commonwealth ex-service league, the Royal Canadian Legion 
has welcomed the responsibility for assisting Caribbean 
veterans through 15 Caribbean ex-service organizations in 
countries such as Jamaica, Trinidad and Guyana.
<P>
	The legion has also assisted peacekeepers who have been 
injured during peacekeeping activities. We are all familiar with 
the Royal Canadian Legion's remembrance and poppy 
campaign. It raised nearly $5.2 million in 1993 which is used to 
assist needy veterans and their families. It was also used to 
purchase medical supplies and funds, medical research and 
training.
<P>
	In 1992 the legion's senior program provided seniors with 
$3.9 million in direct support and contributed 400,000 hours of 
volunteer time assisting 57,000 seniors. It also provided 
hundreds of thousands of dollars to help train practitioners in 
gerontology and geriatric medicine.
<P>
	In addition, the legion sponsors Meals on Wheels and 
provides transportation for seniors and disabled Canadians. It 
helps them reach day hospitals, recreational activities and 
medical appointments.
<P>
	The Royal Canadian Legion is one of the country's leading 
community organizations. It contributes tens of millions of 
dollars to private charities annually.
<P>
	In 1992, $10 million was earmarked for direct support of 
youth activities such as the finest youth organization in the 
world, the Royal Canadian Air, Sea and Army Cadets across the 
country. Also, much needed money went to Scouts Canada. It 
provides the children and grandchildren of veterans with 
educational bursaries and scholarships.
<P>
	I would like to take a moment to offer all my colleagues in the 
House an opportunity to pay tribute to the good deeds of the 
Royal Canadian Legion. I can only pray that the Royal Canadian 
Legion remains an independent, grassroots, democratic 
organization, for without the input of the grassroots, the legion 
would not be the progressive community organization it is 
today.
<P>
	It has assisted more Canadians than any other 
non-government organization I know of.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (St. Paul's, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is 
with great pleasure that I rise today to speak to Motion No. 310 
which urges branches of the Royal Canadian Legion which do 
not permit Jews and Sikhs to wear religious head dress in their 
branches to reconsider this discriminatory practice.
<P>
	As my hon. colleague for Windsor-St. Clair suggests in her 
motion, all members of the legion must have access to legion 
facilities without having to choose between their legion 
affiliation and their religious belief.
<P>
	As most of us know, the Royal Canadian Legion does 
excellent work among other worthy things in perpetuating the 
memory and deeds of the fallen. Founded in 1925 by Field 
Marshall Haig, the Canadian Legion of the British Empire 
Service League was organized to bring veterans' concerns to the 
attention of government.
<P>
	In 1960 the organization was renamed the Royal Canadian 
Legion and continues to this day to act as an intermediary 
between veterans and government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Today, the Royal Canadian Legion is made up of 1,720 
branches and has over 570,000 members. The mere mention of 
the Legion conjures up the poppy campaign, the November 11 
parades as well as the design and literary contest for high school 
students. Indeed, the Legion has taken on the task of bringing 
together, within a democratic and non partisan association, the 
men and women who fought in the various branches of the 
Armed Forces.
<P>
<B>(1815 ) </B>
<P>
	However, the non partisan nature of the Legion has been put in 
question by the unfortunate incident where Sikh veterans were 
denied access to Legion facilities for refusing to take off their 
turbans. In trying to deal with subsequent allegations of racism, 
the Dominion Command of the Canadian Legion put forth a 
resolution to amend the rule concerning the wearing of the 
Jewish kipa and the Sikh turban inside Legion facilities. It read 
in part as follows:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Once a person who is required to wear a head-dress for (the Jewish and Sikh) 
faiths has been accepted as a Legion member, they are to be authorized 
admission to all areas of that branch that are opened to the general membership 
or invited guests.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Unfortunately at the general assembly in May last year more 
than 75 per cent of the legion's delegates voted down this 
resolution. In so doing they placed in jeopardy the non-sectarian 
nature of the legion. Those who voted to maintain a ban on 
head-dress within legion premises refused to depart from a 
principle to the effect that wearing a hat shows disrespect to the 
fallen. The national president was so outraged he immediately 
resigned.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9687"> 9687 </A></B>
<P>
	Fortunately not all members of the legion have similar 
narrow views. A letter published in the February 1994 issue of 
<I>The Legion</I> reminds legion members of the spirit of friendship 
and camaraderie that is supposed to be found in legion halls. 
It states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It seems to me some of my comrades have forgotten that one of the things they 
fought for was democracy and within that democracy is the right to practise 
religion. If, in so doing, it means that uncovering one's head would be an offence 
to one's god, then why should we be affronted? These people are not slighting the 
memory of those who paid the greatest sacrifice for freedom. Instead, we should 
be open minded enough to remember that some Sikh veterans fought in the same 
campaigns with great distinction, and wish the fellowship of their comrades in a 
Legion branch without being harassed by close minded discrimination.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[Translation] 
<P>
	In an effort to appease the strong public outcry against the 
proposed motion being rejected, the Dominion Command urged 
Legion branches to reconsider their decision. I am pleased to 
report to this House that almost 90 per cent of the branches have 
now passed motions recognizing the important contribution of 
Jewish and Sikh servicemen in the world wars and, 
consequently, repealed their discriminatory policy on religious 
head-dress. Unfortunately, another 10 per cent did not.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is important to state once again that Canadians of various 
religious backgrounds, including Jews and Sikhs, have in the 
past served and continue to serve with great distinction in 
Canadian and other Commonwealth forces. Their faith did not 
prevent them from serving and dying for their country.
<P>
	In the second world war alone, 10,235 Canadian Jews served 
in the army, another 5,889 in the Royal Canadian Air Force and 
yet another 596 in the navy. I am sad to remind the House that 
429 Canadian Jews were killed in action from 1939 to 1945, over 
200 were wounded and 84 were made prisoners of war. In 
recognition of their valuable contribution to the war effort 
almost 200 Jewish soldiers were decorated.
<P>
	Should not all veterans regardless of their gender, ethnic 
origins and religious affiliation receive fair and equal treatment 
by the Royal Canadian Legion?
<P>
	By refusing to adopt a resolution permitting Jews and Sikhs to 
wear their religious head-dress on legion premises, some 
members of the legion have shown themselves to be insensitive 
to the Canadian reality and to the members they are supposed to 
represent.
<P>
	Canada is not a monolithic society. Unfortunately some are 
still unwilling to acknowledge our cultural and religious reality. 
Some branches of the legion have adopted regulations that may 
contravene Canadian and provincial human rights legislation. 
These branches need to be reminded that Canada has a long and 
well respected tradition of tolerance. The legion should reflect 
upon its decision and its actions in this light.
<P>
	It is sad that in 1995 some still do not accept and respect our 
rich and diverse cultural and religious traditions. We must 
continue to work toward better understanding among all 
Canadians, not the opposite. This debate is extremely important 
for it causes us to reflect on the work that remains to be done; too 
much work unfortunately.
<P>
	Members of the branches that have banned religious 
head-dress must be made aware that the kipa is not a hat to a 
conservative Jew. He does not wear it for vanity but in order to 
observe a religious injunction to cover one's head before God. 
With respect to the turban it is more than a simple regalia to an 
orthodox Sikh. It is a powerful symbol of the mystery which 
binds the man to his faith.
<P>
<B>(1820 ) </B>
<P>
	Incredibly during the Calgary Stampede some branches allow 
their members to drink beer and socialize with their 10-gallon 
cowboy hats fitted nicely on their heads. The rationale behind 
this exemption is: What would the stampede be without our 
cowboy hats? Why do some legion branches believe that a 
legion member who wears a 10-gallon hat in the legion hall 
during stampede is only following tradition, while a Jew who 
wears a kipa or a Sikh who wears a turban is showing disrespect 
for the fallen.
<P>
	I am concerned that Jews and Sikhs are being denied entry by 
some branches because some legion members are 
uncomfortable with fellow members who look a little different 
or whose headgear may demonstrate that they are a little 
different. These members think that maybe they do not belong. 
They belong as much as any other Canadian. Our differences do 
not divide us; they enrich us.
<P>
	We each have a duty to denounce all forms of discrimination. 
Ironically it is in our own self-interest to do so. The Protestant 
theologian Neimoller said after World War II:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When the Nazis came to get the gypsies I did not say anything because I was 
not a gypsy. When they came to get the communists I did not say anything 
because I was not a communist. When they came to get the Jews I did not say 
anything because I was not a Jew. When they came to get me there was no one 
left to stand up for me.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We have a moral obligation to strive to understand one 
another as a people. Whether a Jew wears a kipa, a Sikh a turban, 
a Calgarian a cowboy hat or a Torontonian a Blue Jays cap, we 
are all Canadian citizens and have a right to express our beliefs 
without fear of discrimination.
<P>
	I urge branches of the Royal Canadian Legion which prevent 
members from wearing a religious head-dress to reconsider 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9688"> 9688 </A></B>
<P>
their position so that they foster a climate of tolerance and 
understanding. I believe the legion should be an agent for 
tolerance and understanding within Canadian society. I am only 
surprised that this is not universally the case.
<P>
	The legion should never forget the principles its members 
fought and died for. The legion, as should all Canadians, should 
remember the eloquent words spoken by our Prime Minister on 
the beaches of Normandy for the 50th anniversary of D-Day:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In death they are not anglophones or francophones, not from the west or from 
the east, not Christians or Jews, nor aboriginal people or immigrants. They were 
Canadians.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	They died as Canadians and I think some branches of the 
legion insult the memory of these Canadians by excluding other 
veterans from legion posts.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to Private 
Members' Motion No. 310.
<P>
	I would like to start by reminiscing a bit back to the sixties 
when I first immigrated to Canada. I remember a couple of 
incidents that happened during my early arrival to Canada that I 
will never forget. One was a fairly simple matter.
<P>
	When we were first invited into the homes of some of our 
neighbours, my wife and I went tramping in like one always does 
in Colorado where we came from. When other guests arrived and 
I noticed no one had any shoes on their feet it kind of surprised 
me. I asked: ``What is this? Don't you guys believe in wearing 
shoes any more?'' They informed: ``That is what is done in 
Canada. When we visit we take our shoes off''. I said: ``I can buy 
that. I will be prepared for it, though, in case I ever have to take 
my shoes off''.
<P>
	The next time we went out to visit somebody we removed our 
shoes because that was the way it was done. Of course when I 
went back to Colorado after getting accustomed to it, I took my 
shoes off when I went to visit and they laughed at me because 
that did not happen there. That is fairly minor.
<P>
	I remember another time my wife and I attended a community 
dance. When they announced it was the last dance I grabbed my 
best friend, my wife, and I said: ``Come on, let's have this last 
dance together''. They finished and then they played another 
song. I thought we were going to have one more. It took about 
three twirls before it dawned on me that everybody else was 
standing still because they were playing: ``God save the 
Queen''. That was a little embarrassing. I twirled around the 
floor just about three steps too many not to be embarrassed. I felt 
a little strange. I can say the next time there was a community 
dance I not only stood with the rest of them but I sang the words; 
I learned them.
<P>
<B>(1825 ) </B>
<P>
	I tell those stories because there were a number of things we 
had to get used to when we moved to Canada. Although we were 
not that far apart, a number of things were different.
<P>
	Another thing I remember that caught me off guard was going 
into a club. It was not the legion; it was an Elks club, I believe. I 
did not realize the difference in Canada. In my state they had an 
Elks club. I was not a member but I always went there. In this 
club in Canada I did not have a membership so I was not allowed 
in. I accepted that as being the way it was. It took me and my 
family a number of months to get accustomed to different things 
that were happening.
<P>
	What worries me about a bill of this nature is that it is a bill 
that says to a certain segment of society that it does not do things 
right, that we are going to legislate and do it the way it should be 
done. I realize it is just a motion to encourage the legions to 
reconsider. However my biggest fear is that if that is not the case 
and these wishes are not followed, would it some day become 
the wish of the House to legislate a rule that would affect an 
organization of this type?
<P>
	When we start making legislation that controls the rights of 
individuals or controls the collective rights of organizations, we 
are stepping out of our bounds as legislators. I do not think we 
are here to start controlling things. I hope we do not get to that 
point in our lives.
<P>
	I hope everybody here who has feelings today will express 
those feelings to the legions in the manner they should. I would 
not want it to be a collective thing coming down in any way, 
shape or form from the House saying: ``We know what is best for 
you people out in Canada. Let's get away from that idea. We are 
going to do it for you. If not then we are going to have to do some 
other things''.
<P>
	I recall attending a golf tournament one time. A fellow drove 
about 300 miles to join us in that tournament. He came from 
Peace River and the golf tournament was in Red Deer. He 
walked in with his 12-year old son. Immediately the golf 
managers told him that the son had to leave because he had Levis 
on. Levis were not allowed. He said: ``We came a long way. He is 
just going to caddy''. It did not matter. Levis were not allowed 
on the course.
<P>
	Are we to start going to golf courses and saying: ``You have to 
change your dress code because you are offending some 
people?'' Do we have to go to restaurants that say we have to 
wear a coat and tie to come in? They set the rules so we do not go 
in.
<P>
	We should get away from the idea that we have to be involved 
in controlling the situation and not leave it in the hands of good 
common sense thinking Canadians. If we give them time to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9689"> 9689 </A></B>
<P>
organize their thoughts, rules and regulations, it will come into 
play where we can all be happy with it.
<P>
	However when we start acting as government officials who 
know best and suggesting as legislators the way it has to be, it is 
wrong. It worries me that we would even consider to move in 
that direction. I encourage us not to do so by means of 
legislation, a member's motion of this nature or anything else.
<P>
	If members wish to express their desires as they have done so 
well today, they should do so to the legion clubs in their ridings 
as individuals and not as a collective unit of government saying: 
``It is our way''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Parliamentary Secretary 
to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
first let me congratulate the member for Windsor-St. Clair for 
giving the House the opportunity to debate the issue. Also let me 
congratulate my colleagues who were so articulate in this 
situation.
<P>
	I would like to inform the Reform member that we do have a 
law. It is called the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Under the 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms it says that we do not 
discriminate. There is a item called freedom of religion. I 
encourage him to take some time to look at that.
<P>
<B>(1830 ) </B>
<P>
	I do not think I can articulate better than members have 
already the concern in terms of the legion and how in certain 
branches-there are a few, not many-there is discrimination 
against Sikhs who wear headgear.
<P>
	My grandfather came here in 1906 and was one of those who 
wore a turban. He would not be allowed in certain legions right 
now because of his turban. That is terrible. A member of this 
House of Commons would also not be allowed into certain 
legions and I find that unacceptable.
<P>
	I would like to leave my colleagues with an example that 
happened in my riding. I think it articulates best what our young 
people are thinking. I believe we have to learn from our youth.
<P>
	In a Churchill high school, which I attended as a student, the 
members voted to not participate in the Canadian legion poppy 
fund. They gave very good reasons when they said: ``We want to 
support the veterans of this country, but we cannot do it through 
the Canadian legion''. The students voted in a democratic 
election. The overwhelming majority refused to get involved in 
the poppy fund. It was not because they did not believe in the 
veterans but because of what the legion did, the discrimination 
of some legion branches. That is why they refused to participate.
<P>
	That is leadership. That is looking ahead. But the students 
also said: ``We are going to have our own poppy fund. We are not 
going to let those veterans down. We want to support those 
veterans so we are going to make our own poppies''. I applaud 
those students for showing leadership and for showing us which 
way to go.
<P>
	I am a Sikh, as many of my colleagues know. I am not a turban 
Sikh because I am not an orthodox Sikh, but I can tell you that 
this is very important to me. Frankly, I was disappointed in some 
of the comments made by members of the Reform Party. I know 
that many members from the Okanagan would also be 
disappointed.
<P>
	That example shows that our young people are taking 
leadership. They are saying: ``We do not accept discrimination. 
We do not accept bigotry. We want to tolerate people. We want to 
include people. We do not want to marginalize anybody. We do 
not want to exclude people. We want to bring Canadians 
together''. That is what this is all about. We want to bring 
Canadians together. We want to understand each other.
<P>
	My own children who are seven, twelve and thirteen share 
Indian food with other children. My daughter came home 
singing a Hebrew song. That is what sharing is all about, what 
understanding is all about, what tolerance is all about. That is 
what all of this is about. Racial harmony is linked to economic 
prosperity. It is also linked to a better understanding. As 
Canadians we have to move forward.
<P>
	There have been times in Canadian history when there has 
been discrimination. We look back on it and ask: Did this really 
happen? In 20 years from now we will look back and ask: Did 
this really happen in Canadian history? And we will not believe 
that it did.
<P>
	I want to thank all the members who have articulated this 
issue so well. I am sorry I do not have more time to speak. I am 
sharing it with another member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton, 
Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased and privileged to rise in the 
House today to speak to Motion No. 310 presented by my 
colleague, the hon. member for Windsor-St. Clair.
<P>
	As the House is aware, I am the first turbaned Sikh to sit in the 
House of Commons. The turban is recognized by this House as 
religious headgear and no restrictions whatsoever are placed 
upon me. Likewise, Her Majesty the Queen has clearly indicated 
that the wearing of the turban in her presence is totally 
acceptable. The Queen's aide, Robin Janvrin, in a letter dated 
September 13, 1991 wrote: ``I confirm that many Sikhs have 
been invited to Buckingham Palace over the years. They were 
not asked to remove their turbans''.
<P>
	Today's motion urges the Canadian legion to recognize that 
the turban is not simply a hat, but rather it is an integral part of 
the Sikh faith.
<P>
<B>(1835 ) </B>
<P>
	The Sikhs have proudly served during the time of war all the 
while wearing their turbans. The fact that the turban has been 
recognized by the RCMP and the Canadian military as suitable 
<P>

<B><A NAME="9690"> 9690 </A></B>
<P>
dress for parade or duty should be extended to the wearing of 
religious headgear in the legions.
<P>
	What was World War II all about anyway? Was it just fearless 
exploits and dramatic battles? Or was it about fighting for 
freedom, including religious freedom at a time of virulent 
anti-Semitism?
<P>
	The brave soldiers of all faiths fought and died so that the 
living would be respected. They died so that a religious Jew 
would never be forced to remove his yarmulke and a devout Sikh 
would not be humiliated by being asked to remove his turban.
<P>
	On the battlefield, no one asked Jewish and Sikh soldiers to 
fight and die without their religious headgear. Yet now, the 
yarmulke and turban are deemed disrespectful, on par with a 
cowboy hat, baseball cap or fedora.
<P>
	In voting down the pleas of their own leadership to allow 
religious headgear into legion halls, the convention delegates 
violated the spirit of Canada's human rights laws and trampled 
on traditional Canadian values.
<P>
	Today's motion would ensure that this situation would not be 
allowed to continue. I urge all of my fellow members in the 
House to support this motion and once and for all put this 
humiliating situation to rest.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The time provided for 
the consideration of Private Members' Business has now 
expired.
<P>
	Pursuant to Standing Order 96(1), the order is dropped from 
the Order Paper.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TRANS-CANADAHIGHWAY">TRANS-CANADA HIGHWAY</A></H4>
	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise 
to pursue a question that I asked the Minister of Transport last 
week in the House about a proposed route for the Trans-Canada 
Highway through New Brunswick.
<P>
	In answering my question the Minister of Transport said that 
he could not address the matter because it was a provincial 
jurisdiction. What the minister failed to note was that the federal 
government cost shares on all trans-Canada projects. That 
makes it a federal concern.
<P>
	Although the ultimate route has not yet been determined, the 
New Brunswick government is leaning toward the idea of an 
expanded Trans-Canada Highway from Fredericton to 
Moncton, New Brunswick through Jemseg Marsh and CFB 
Camp Gagetown. This plan will cost an estimated $1 billion and 
will cause environmental problems.
<P>
	Under this plan, Saint John would not be on the Trans-Canada 
Highway route. As the province's largest city, its industrial 
centre and the city closest to the U.S. border, Saint John should 
be directly on the TCH. In fact, this new route would also cut off 
Sussex, New Brunswick and many other towns and villages 
along the way.
<P>
	There is an environmental assessment being done of Premier 
McKenna's choice of the route. The possibility of the route 
going through a designated flood plain and going through Camp 
Gagetown, including one of the province's largest inland 
marshes is worrisome.
<P>
	Citizens groups from my province say Premier McKenna's 
preference seems to fly in the face of a federal government 
policy calling for no net loss of water habitat for wildlife. Even 
if this is not of concern to the transport minister, it should of 
interest to federal ministers of the environment and defence.
<P>
	The preferable route would twin Saint John, Fredericton, 
Moncton and St. Stephen and can be built for $220 million. It 
could be done by upgrading the existing highways linking these 
four centres. This option will make the three largest cities in the 
province of New Brunswick equal and will pose no threat to the 
environment whatsoever.
<P>
<B>(1840 ) </B>
<P>
	I ask the minister once again to reassure the House that the 
government will not contribute one federal dollar to a 
trans-Canada highway project that is not only exorbitant in cost 
but may also be harmful to the environment. How could any 
member of this government agree to spend $1 billion when in 
fact it can achieve its objective by spending $220 million?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Fontana (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
her question this evening.
<P>
	Highways in Canada, except for those on federal property, are 
the responsibility of the provincial government. The member 
knows that. It is a simple fact but true.
<P>
	I do not think there is anyone in Canada who is more 
knowledgeable or concerned about highways than Premier 
McKenna of New Brunswick and his transportation minister, the 
Hon. Seldon Lee. Therefore, quite simply, the appropriate place 
to raise questions about the routing of a highway within the 
province of New Brunswick is in the New Brunswick 
legislature, not the federal House of Commons.
<P>
	Premier McKenna is doing the best job he can and we of 
course will do everything we can within our jurisdiction to assist 
him in his most laudable goals.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="9691"> 9691 </A></B>
<P>
	As for the choosing of the route, as I understand it, the 
province hired a consultant to review the options to improve 
the trans-Canada highway in New Brunswick. I should point 
out the study did not involve the federal government 
whatsoever. The province is working toward a four lane 
highway from the New Brunswick-U.S.A. border at St. Stephen 
through Saint John to the Nova Scotia border. That is its right, 
its duty and its jurisdiction.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="MANPOWERTRAINING">MANPOWER TRAINING</A></H4>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
yesterday, February 14, I put a question to the Prime Minister. I 
reminded him that the tenors of the federal government keep on 
repeating, hoping to convince Quebecers, that we do not need to 
reform the constitution, since federalism is flexible and in 
constant flux.
<P>
	Then, I said to the Prime Minister something like: ``If you 
want to be taken seriously, why do you refuse to recognize 
Quebec 's jurisdiction, requested time and time again, in the 
area of manpower training''. There is a consensus among all 
Quebec parties in this regard. A consensus to which even the 
president of the Conseil du patronat, a well known federalist, 
subscribes.
<P>
	Not only Quebecers share that opinion. The president of the 
Canadian manufacturers' association said recently: ``Why is it 
that the federal government does not let the provinces exercise 
this responsibility?'' There are powerful economic arguments in 
favour of it. Manpower training has to be geared to the job 
market.
<P>
	The Prime Minister, instead of answering my question, 
said-and I can repeat it, since it is on the public record-``I 
know very well that she would remain a separatist even if we 
resolved the workforce issue.'' Of course.
<P>
	However, what I find disturbing-and I cannot help but say it 
here-is that the Prime Minister is basically saying that he could 
not care less about what happens to young people, women and 
all those who need this efficient manpower training, because it 
is managed by the manpower agency we, in Quebec, have set up 
and which is not a government body. It is made up of 
representatives from the private sector, labour unions, 
municipalities, and of course, a few representatives from the 
Quebec government. It is an institution which should be 
recognized, if only the federal government cared about all those 
Quebecers who need manpower training.
<P>
	The fact is that even if the federal government agreed to it, I 
would still be a sovereignist. But I will tell you one thing, it is 
because there have been so many situations like this one that 
many people like me know now that there is only one option for 
Quebecers, and that is sovereignty.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I will address myself directly 
to the question and not debate whether the member is or is not 
going to remain a federalist.
<P>
	Let me reassure the hon. member that the situation of young 
people in Canada is an issue that concerns us all. Contrary to the 
member's claims in her previous questions, there is no 
conclusive data demonstrating that unemployment insurance 
changes contained in the 1994 budget have had an impact on 
provincial social assistance caseloads.
<P>
	What the hon. member ignores is that new unemployment 
insurance claims and the number of UI claims exhausted have 
both been decreasing since the government came into power. 
What is more, strong employment growth and job creation in 
1994 have been the most significant factors contributing to these 
decreases, bringing new UI claims down by 10 per cent.
<P>
	The latest labour market data also offer hope. In January 1995 
the unemployment rate for 15 to 24-year old Canadian workers 
decreased by 3.4 percentage points over the January 1994 rate. 
Employment is up by over 114,000 in Quebec alone since the 
government came into power, including 16,000 new jobs in 
January 1995.
<P>
	In response to my hon. colleague's concerns about the UI 
fund, she should remember that UI pays for itself through the 
premiums of employers and workers and that there is still a debt 
of $3.7 billion in the account accumulated over the past 
recession.
<P>
	As employment continues to grow in the coming year, that 
debt may well be repaid, providing more room to reduce 
premiums while still giving unemployed people the assistance 
they need to get back to work.
<P>
	I hope this answer is one the member can agree with.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 38(5), the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to 
have been adopted.
<P>
	Accordingly, this House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 
10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.48 p.m.)
