	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.)</B> moved for leave to 
introduce Bill C-263, an act respecting restriction on foreign aid.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, this bill was introduced in the last session. 
It was designed to stop the flow of financial or other aid to any 
foreign country that refuses to accept re-entry of its nationals or 
former nationals deported from Canada.
<P>
	Far too often when foreign born criminals are ordered deported 
from Canada, deportation is hampered because some countries do 
not want to take back their nationals.
<P>
	The foreign aid restriction act addresses this issue by freezing 
aid to countries that frustrate the Canadian deportation process. 
This bill is a strong measure to ensure an effective deportation 
policy in Canada. If a  country will not take back its citizens who 
have committed criminal acts in Canada or who have 
misrepresented their past involvement in organized criminal 
activity, terrorism or other activities as noted under section 19 of 
the Immigration Act and are ordered deported, the bill would then 
direct the Department of Foreign Affairs to suspend all foreign aid 
to that country.

introduce Bill C-264, an act to allow the electors of a province to 
express an opinion on who should be summoned to the Senate to 
represent the province.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to introduce my private 
member's bill, an act to allow the electors of a province to express 
an opinion on who should be summoned to the Senate to represent 
the province.
<P>
	The Reform Party's ultimate objective has always been true 
Senate reform: a triple-E Senate elected, effective and equal. We 
can change the method of appointing senators, that is, they be 
elected, without constitutional revision.
<P>
	This bill will change the method of appointing senators through 
an election process without constitutional revision. It will require 
that the Prime Minister wait to receive the expression of opinion 
from any province with a senatorial selection act similar to the 
Alberta senatorial selection act which resulted in Senator Stan 
Waters being appointed to the Senate.
<P>
	The current Senate has not been able to perform its role 
effectively because the selection process has undermined its 
legitimacy.
<P>
	There is considerable urgency for the introduction of this bill 
now because the Government of Canada is cramming through 
legislation that is not widely accepted.
<P>
	I am introducing this bill today as a result of the forced vote held 
last fall on Bill C-110. The long range interest of Canadian 
federalism will truly be served by Senate reform.

asked for it. The Senate has passed it and the Ontario Court of

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="FINANCIALSTATEMENTOFMINISTEROFFINANCE">FINANCIAL STATEMENT OF MINISTER OF FINANCE</A></H4>
	The House resumed from April 15 consideration of the motion 
that this House approves in general the budgetary policy of the 
government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Graham (Rosedale, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am grateful 
for the opportunity to address this motion. Today I will be sharing 
my time with the hon. member for Timiskaming-French River.
<P>
	I am proud to be a part of this government which has reined in 
the deficit while at the same time contributing to ensuring the 
collective necessity in this country of sound social policies. We 
have managed to do this in three years. This budget is an important 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1507"> 1507 </A></B>
<P>
contribution to that and to ensuring that the collective financial 
future and deficit reduction plan remain intact.
<P>
	Last November the government announced that it had surpassed 
its deficit target for 1994-95. It now looks like the target for 
1995-96 will also be achieved or even surpassed. The deficit will 
be reduced to 3 per cent of GDP as announced and to 2 per cent of 
GDP in 1997-98.
<P>
	The growth rate of the debt will be lower than the rate of 
economic growth. This is the first significant improvement in the 
debt to GDP ratio in over 20 years. As a result of this, there is a 
dramatic decline in the amount of new money the government has 
to borrow from financial markets.
<P>
	In 1993-94 Canada's financial requirements stood at 4.2 per cent 
of GDP or $30 billion. By 1997-98 the financial requirements will 
have dropped to 0.7 per cent of GDP or $6 billion.
<P>
	As the Minister of Finance pointed out, relative to the size of the 
economy, Canada's borrowing requirements will be at the lowest 
level in almost 30 years. Measured on this basis, Canada will have 
the lowest fiscal shortfall projected among central governments of 
all G-7 countries.
<P>
	As a result of this, international markets are responding 
favourably to the progress in deficit reduction. In fact, short term 
interest rates have fallen below those in the United States. For the 
first time the Government of Canada can actually borrow money 
for a short term at rates lower than those prevailing for United 
States securities which are the bellwether for all government 
securities in the world.
<P>
	When the government was first elected there was a spread 
between Canadian and American interest rates of approximately 3 
per cent. That spread represented the international market's view of 
the risk of investing in this country as opposed to that of the United 
States. I think we can take it from the fact that our securities are 
presently quoted at lower rates of interest than those in the United 
States that the international marketplace is putting on our securities 
a lower risk than that which would prevail on similar American 
securities.
<P>
	Canadians know and accept that restoring public fiscal health is 
essential for job creation and economic prosperity. The 
government's job is to help create the appropriate economic 
climate, one in which private sector activity will flourish. 
Economic indicators support the claim that the government's 
approach is well advised.
<P>
	As I pointed out, short term interest rates are down 3 per cent 
since March 1995. Inflation is at its lowest point in 30 years. Two 
hundred and sixty-three thousand private sector jobs have been 
created since 1995. The merchandise trade surplus has reached 
record levels and the current account deficit as a share of GDP is at 
its lowest level in 10 years.
<P>
	In my view that demonstrates the wisdom of the government 
having rejected the slash and burn approach to deficit reduction 
urged by some of the parties in this House.
<P>
<B>(1015 )</B>
<P>
	Our approach is a sensible, balanced, fair and compassionate 
approach, and the 1996 budget continues on that track. It 
recognizes there are sacrifices Canadians are willing collectively to 
make to reach the point we now have. There are sacrifices that are 
being made today by constituents of mine in downtown Toronto 
who recognize this is the track we must be on if we are to achieve 
greater prosperity in the years ahead.
<P>
	While saying this, we recognize as well that fairness and 
compassion are deeply held Canadian values. The Canadian 
commitment to helping the most vulnerable in society is an 
important factor in the government's philosophy. As a result, there 
will be no further cuts in transfer payments to the provinces.
<P>
	Provincial entitlements will eventually increase. The Canada 
health and social transfer will provide secure and stable federal 
support for medicare, post-secondary education and social 
assistance. For the first time there will be a cash floor for transfers. 
The CHST is designed to give provinces more flexibility in 
program delivery.
<P>
	Of course we would like to see more, particularly for 
post-secondary education. The government recognizes the 
importance of these issues, but the point is we must get our house 
in order after eight years of Tory mismanagement before we can 
build again. The beauty of this budget is that it lets us see that 
possibility clearly within the realizable near future.
<P>
	The new seniors benefit to replace old age security and the 
guaranteed income supplement is designed to help those who need 
it most. The benefit level of 75 per cent of Canadian seniors will 
remain at the same level or even increase. Certainly low income 
seniors will receive more under the new system and the income 
tested approach will help to ensure the sustainability of the pension 
system for our children and grandchildren.
<P>
	I take this opportunity to address an issue which is very much a 
concern to many people in my riding, social housing. Rosedale has 
a considerable amount of assisted social housing. It takes the form 
of straightforward government assisted housing and co-operatives.
<P>
	This social housing contributes a great deal to the social stability 
of our inner cities. It recognizes there are many people living in our 
cities, particularly in inner cities, with a high cost of living, who do 
require some form of government support.
<P>
	There have been misconceptions as a result of the budget. There 
were some suggestions in the province of Ontario that because of 
the approach of the present Conservative government social 
housing is under serious  attack. The federal government has 
indicated 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1508"> 1508 </A></B>
<P>
in this budget that it will continue its support for social housing and 
as a result for social stability in the inner cities. It will continue 
with $2 billion in support to provincial governments, $600 million 
of which will go to the province of Ontario.
<P>
	The minister has made it clear that while there will be changes in 
the way in which this service is delivered, national standards will 
be required. I urge the minister that when she is dealing with the 
provinces no federal money should go to private housing schemes. 
Social housing should be recognized as public housing and the 
administration of housing should not be turned over to provinces 
that indicate they do not have a commitment to publicly owned 
social housing. There are alternative competent partners the federal 
government could choose such as the Co-operative Housing 
Federation of Canada.
<P>
	This is an extraordinarily important issue which the government 
has indicated it intends to approach with sensitivity to the need for 
appropriate social policy while recognizing the need for deficit 
reduction. I am confident it will realize this goal in the way it has 
managed in other areas.
<P>
	When we look at the core of this budget we see the notion of the 
economy, of jobs and of growth. There are three priority areas in 
the budget: youth, technology and trade.
<P>
	The importance of investing in the country's future lies in 
investing in young people. We must give them the tools with which 
to recognize their aspirations. The creation of new youth 
employment opportunities, for example the Department of Human 
Resources Development summer student job action program, will 
help tens of thousands of young people to get summer jobs this 
year.
<P>
	Also, we will be helping students and their families deal with the 
higher cost of education by increasing education tax credits, raising 
the limit on transfer of tuition education credits and increasing 
limits on the contributions to registered education plans.
<P>
	My riding of Rosedale is home to three post-secondary 
institutions, the University of Toronto, Ryerson and George Brown 
College, and numerous high schools and youth groups.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	I have fairly frequent contact with young people in my riding 
who relate to me the special challenges they face in trying to find 
suitable employment in the new economy.
<P>
	Often suitable job experience is what they require but lack. This 
initiative in this regard should go some way to providing 
opportunities in my riding and across the country for youth who 
deserve an opportunity to participate in the challenges the new 
economy offers us.
<P>
	In addressing the issue of the new economy, this budget 
addresses the issue of technology. Existing moneys will be 
reallocated in order to encourage technological developments in 
key fields such as the aerospace sector, environment technologies 
and biotechnology.
<P>
	The Business Development Bank will be given the resources to 
provide more loans to knowledge based, exporting and growth 
businesses. Equity injection of $50 million will allow banks to 
provide an additional $350 million in loans.
<P>
	We will accelerate our efforts to increase access to information 
technology for all Canadians, especially for small and medium size 
businesses. This is a true recognition by government that 
technology is the way of the future and that we as a country cannot 
afford to be left behind in this important contribution to the global 
economy.
<P>
	Similarly, in terms of international trade, the budget has 
indicated that the Team Canada approach which has been so 
extraordinarily successful in international marketing of this 
country will remain a centrepiece of our strategy.
<P>
	Canada's trade performance has recently been excellent. The 
export sector has been expanding at 8 per cent per annum on 
average over the past decade.
<P>
	Our merchandise trade balance has reached a record surplus of 
$28.3 billion. To encourage the continuation of this success, 
government will provide $50 million of new equity to the Export 
Development Corporation in order to support new export sales 
financing vehicles and new partnerships with exporters in the 
commercial banks. This and other measures will increase the 
amount of financing available for Canadian exports by as much as 
$500 million a year.
<P>
	As the foreign affairs and international trade committee has 
realized, international trade is at the core of what this country is 
about. Small and medium size businesses are dependent more and 
more on international trade.
<P>
	This budget will contribute to enabling our country to prosper in 
its international trade and achieves a balance in respect of our 
social programs.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Serré (Timiskaming-French River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, before going into the details of the budget, I would like to 
salute the people of Verner and Lavigne in the south of my riding, 
who have had access to the parliamentary channel only since April 
1 of this year.
<P>
	I am pleased to rise today in this House to congratulate the 
Minister of Finance on an excellent budget. This budget is one of 
confidence and was well received by taxpayers and businesses 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1509"> 1509 </A></B>
<P>
alike. The minister put forward  an effective, well-balanced action 
plan that benefits all Canadians.
<P>
	The people of this country care about their social service 
network, and the minister reassured them that all services currently 
in place would be maintained. Our government has been listening 
and will continue to listen to all the people, as this compassionate 
budget shows.
<P>
	We all know how important social programs are. They benefit 
everyone and help sustain people going through hard times. 
However, a sluggish economy and the increasing burden of 
servicing the ever-growing public debt threaten the long term 
viability of Canada's social safety net. That is why it is so 
important to breathe new life into the economy and bring the public 
debt and deficit under control.
<P>
	It is also necessary to overhaul Canada's social programs and 
transfer system in order to make them more effective and more 
affordable, while at the same time preserving the basic fairness of 
our social safety net.
<P>
	In this budget, our government vows to revitalize the economy 
of rural regions and to tackle their problems. The new technologies 
put in place by this government, like the information highway and 
the community access component of SchoolNet, help our young 
people prepare for the emergence of the new knowledge-based 
economy.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	Rural Canada is rich in natural and human resources and faces 
different challenges than urban areas. The government will take the 
appropriate and necessary action to make sure that all Canadians 
benefit from economic prosperity.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The budget will renew the confidence of all Canadians, 
especially their faith in our social programs. All the measures taken 
in the budget will serve to reinforce Canadians' shared values in 
the system. These measures are to be implemented without raising 
taxes or disrupting the timetable to lower the deficit.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In his budget, the minister is proposing a new seniors benefit. 
This new system, which will take effect in the year 2001, is 
designed to protect current seniors, increase pension payments to 
low income seniors and ensure that income maintenance programs 
for seniors remain affordable and sustainable for generations to 
come.
<P>
	The new benefit will be fully tax free and it will incorporate the 
current pension income credit and age credit. It will be paid in 
monthly instalments and, in the case of couples, each spouse will 
receive a separate and equal cheque.
<P>
	Those who currently receive the guaranteed income supplement 
will receive $120 more per year, and  spouse's allowance payments 
will also increase by $120 per year. Moreover, pension benefits will 
be fully indexed to inflation, which represents an important 
improvement on the current system.
<P>
	This proposal will greatly benefit seniors. It will safeguard the 
pension system for seniors to enjoy now and into the future. Our 
government is fulfilling its commitment to current seniors and to 
those about to retire to maintain and, in many cases, to increase 
pension benefits.
<P>
	Unlike certain other parties, we are responsive to the needs of 
seniors and recognize the outstanding contribution they have made 
and continue to make today to Canadian society.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Let us not forget the younger generation. Our youth are finally 
seeing the light at the end of the tunnel as more jobs are being 
created and more money is injected to create summer jobs. 
Students are also pleased that tax incentives for education have 
been increased.
<P>
	On behalf of the mining sector, in which I have been actively 
involved since the election, I wish to thank the Minister of Finance 
for his support and concern. I am pleased the minister included in 
the budget some change to the flow through shares mechanism. It 
will certainly enhance the incentives for exploration and 
development activities and will end certain abuses.
<P>
	The budget proposes that issuers will have an additional period 
in which to make the expenditures that have been flowed through 
the investor. In February my recommendation to the minister was 
to change the 60 day rule of flow through shares and extend it to 
one year.
<P>
	Once again I thank the minister for accepting my 
recommendations. By doing so he is giving a real boost to the 
mining industry. Furthermore, I congratulate my colleague, the 
hon. member for Davenport, for his contribution to the 
environment by encouraging the extension of flow through share 
mechanisms for certain renewable energy and energy conservation 
projects.
<P>
	Also included in the budget is the proposal to improve access to 
financing for the renewable energy and energy conservation sector 
by relaxing the specified energy property rules. These changes will 
provide an essential level playing field in the energy sector and 
recognize the importance of renewable energy to Canada's overall 
energy supply needs.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In this budget, the government recognizes that special measures 
and policies need be developed to ensure the economic well-being 
of rural Canada communities. This budget proposes interesting 
measures regarding natural resources.

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In the budget the government recognizes that rural Canada needs 
special measures and policies to ensure the economic well-being 
and viability of this sector.
<P>
	The budget is following its course on debt and deficit reduction 
in an orderly and humane fashion compared to the slash and burn 
approach taken by the provincial Conservative government and the 
Reform Party. This is why I call upon provincial governments to 
work in collaboration with this government in its efforts to replace 
the existing GST. The objective is a system which is fairer for 
Canadians, simpler and less costly for businesses to comply with 
and more efficient to administer.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	Canadians have demonstrated strongly and clearly that they want 
one national sales tax. Therefore, it is essential that all provinces 
reach an agreement on this very important matter.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Graham (Rosedale, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member for Timiskaming-French River is very knowledgeable 
about the mining industry. I preface my question by pointing out 
that I understand the city of Toronto is now considered to be the 
financial mining capital of the world. That is where corporations 
and individuals from all over the world finance mining activities 
which are not necessarily located in Canada. By doing that they 
enhance the richness, the wealth and knowledge of Canadians and 
of the Canadian mining industry.
<P>
	I wonder, in that context, whether his view of the flow through 
share operation which he described recently in his speech would 
also be contributing to the development of not only the mining 
industry itself but to the very important securities industry which 
surrounds the mining industry and which is developing more and 
more in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Serré:</B> Mr. Speaker, the point the member raises is very 
important.
<P>
	Very few people know that there are more mining jobs in Toronto 
than in any of the rural ridings. There are more mining jobs in 
Toronto than there are in my riding, yet my riding has dozens of 
mines.
<P>
	Toronto is now the centre for mining investment in the world. 
Investment in mining especially for exploration has risen from 
about $400 million when we took office in October 1993 to a 
projected investment of  approximately $850 million this year. The 
mining industry is very healthy at this point in time. It is thanks at 
least in part to the actions taken by our government in the last three 
budgets.
<P>
	We started in the first budget by permitting the deduction of the 
money used for reclamation funds. We went on to relax the flow 
through mechanism in the budget to increase the accelerated 
capital cost allowance. All of these measures have contributed to 
create the proper economic climate. Investors across the world now 
have faith in the Canadian mining industry. Discoveries such as 
Voisey's Bay are doing a lot to enhance Canada's international 
reputation.
<P>
	Once again, by the actions of our government, we have put the 
Canadian mining industry back on the map. I hope my colleagues 
from urban Canada realize the importance of that sector not only to 
rural Canada but to all Canadians.
<P>
	The three main economic sectors, agriculture, mining and 
forestry, account for 60 per cent of Canadian exports. We depend 
on exports. If we remove rural Canada, the economy of the country 
would be in shambles.
<P>
	I hope these questions and comments will make my colleagues 
from urban Canada realize the importance of rural Canada. I hope 
they will work in co-operation with us to enhance the economy of 
rural Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with interest to the speech of the hon. member.
<P>
	The member commented about the Reform Party cutting too 
deeply into areas of social programs. I am curious to know why the 
hon. member did not mention that while we advocated cuts of 
about $800 million to health care, his party is carrying out cuts of 
$3.2 billion in health care. His party is closing hospitals across the 
country. While we advocated cuts of about $200 million to higher 
education, his party is advocating and carrying out cuts of $1.2 
billion in higher education. How can the member turn around and 
say that the Reform Party is being radical?
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	Finally I want to point out that while his government is in power 
the interest payments will rise. In other words the transfers to 
foreign lenders and foreign banks will rise from $40 billion to $50 
billion. That is absolutely ridiculous. That is slash and burn. I want 
the member to answer those questions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Serré:</B> Mr. Speaker, again we are hearing rhetoric and very 
little action by the Reform Party. Reform was to have submitted a 
budget ahead of the hon. minister and this budget never came 
about.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1511"> 1511 </A></B>
<P>
	We hear from the Reform Party day in and day out to cut, cut, 
cut. Reformers would like us to have a balanced budget by the 
end of our term. I ask the hon. member from where would he take 
that money?
<P>
	Our record speaks for itself. We have at this point in time the 
lowest deficit as a ratio of GDP of the G-7. Our interest rate is 
lower than the United States. For the first time we have the lowest 
inflation rate in the last 30 years.
<P>
	The Reform Party is always asking us to cut, cut, cut. Even 
Ralph Klein and his colleague Mike Harris, who by the way 
supports the Reform Party, is not going far enough for the Reform 
Party. The Reform Party is at the right of Attila the Hun. Reformers 
give us rhetoric. They want us to balance the budget in three years 
but yet they do not want to cut anywhere.
<P>
	I ask the hon. member how can the budget be balanced in four 
years if there are no cuts?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I 
want to draw your attention to the fact that until the end of the 
debate Bloc Quebecois members will split their allotted time in two 
ten-minute periods, followed by a five-minute period for questions 
and replies.
<P>
	I am pleased to take part in the debate on the last federal budget, 
not because I am particularly happy with this budget, far from it, 
but because it is my duty, as a parliamentarian, to take a very close 
look at the way the government intends to spend public money. We 
have to recognize that, over a month ago now, the Liberal 
government brought down a budget which was very disappointing 
in several ways for Quebecers and Canadians.
<P>
	The lack of vision in this budget is distressing, given that, based 
on its own figures, the government has added over $110 billion to 
the debt in the last two and a half years, which means $3,700 more 
for each and every Canadian. These figures speak for themselves. 
We have not even started paying back the principal on the debt, 
because the Minister of Finance has been totally incapable of 
substantially reducing the monstrous deficit of the Canadian 
government.
<P>
	It will be remembered that, during the last election campaign, 
the Liberal party released a so-called plan of action 
unimaginatively and subtly called the red book. I need not make 
things even more unbearable by reminding the House of the fact 
that the Prime Minister never gets tired of quoting this document, 
as though it were his bedside book.
<P>
	Let me quote a short excerpt from page 10 in the introduction of 
the document, which reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Liberal agenda, therefore, is premised on an integrated and coherent 
approach to economic policy, social policy, environmental policy, and foreign 
policy. Liberals understand that these policies are and must be linked.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	If we compare these claims with the measures contained in the 
last budget, we can only conclude that the Liberal government did 
not deliver. While it claims to have an integrated and coherent 
approach when it comes to implementing measures, the facts say 
otherwise.
<P>
	The hardest thing to accept when you take a close look at this 
year's budget is that there does not seem to be any guidelines 
regarding the objectives that must be met. At a time when everyone 
wishes the government would innovate in the field of public 
finances, at a time when everyone is aware that hard work is 
required to ensure a decent quality of life to future generations, the 
Liberal government prefers to improvise and make cuts without 
thinking things through.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	A blatant example of this lack of vision is the decision to 
eliminate the yearly $7.2 million subsidy to the Canadian centre for 
magnetic fusion, located in Varennes. The federal government's 
withdrawal from this area of scientific research is a sad and totally 
baffling development.
<P>
	The decision clearly does not take into account the foreseeable 
spinoffs in development of a new waste free energy system. In 
signing the death sentence of this research centre, the Liberal 
government is giving up on 20 years of efforts in magnetic fusion 
development. It is sacrificing a $70 million infrastructure, 
including $11 million worth of new equipment which will never be 
used. Finally, it is sacrificing about a hundred high technology 
jobs. Such is the Liberal Party's environmental and economic 
vision.
<P>
	But there is also a lack of vision and coherence in several other 
areas. For one thing, the remaining dairy subsidies will be cut. Last 
year's budget provided for a 30 per cent cut over two years. Yet, we 
were stunned to learn, when the last budget was brought down, that 
these subsidies will be totally eliminated, with no compensation at 
all for the producers.
<P>
	This decision will be extremely hard on milk producers in 
Quebec and throughout Canada. Last year, Western farmers 
received nearly $3 billion in compensation, following the 
elimination of the grain transportation subsidy. Here again, a 
double standard is being applied by the Liberal government.
<P>
	As for its economic and social vision, we must point out the 
government's poor performance in job creation. Between January 
1995 and January 1996, the unemployment rate barely eased in 
Canada, slipping from 9.7 per cent to 9.6 per cent. What solutions 
does the government have to offer? Nothing, except the measly 
$315 million to be provided over three years for summer jobs.
<P>
	It is rather ironical that the Liberal government is beginning to 
show concern for students, especially as it had previously reduced 
funding for summer job creation  programs from $86 to $60 million 
over two years. Moreover, it is imposing drastic cuts of $150 
million in postsecondary education funding for 1996-97, the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1512"> 1512 </A></B>
<P>
potential impact of which could be an increase of $1,000 in tuition 
fees for every student for this year alone.
<P>
	What is more, it has already announced additional cuts of $300 
million for 1997-98, which could lead to new additional costs for 
students. Therefore, this summer job creation program is a cynical 
move, since its only usefulness will be to help students pay the 
additional costs brought about by the cuts the Liberal government 
made in social programs.
<P>
	That is not all, however. The Liberal government is again 
showing inconsistency since it is now going after a major means of 
creating jobs by lowering from 20 per cent to 15 per cent the 
federal tax credit related to labour sponsored investment funds and 
lowering from $5,000 to $3,500 the maximum share purchase in 
such funds.
<P>
	Today, there are 19 labour sponsored funds with assets totalling 
between $2.5 billion and $3 billion. They have invested more than 
$850 million in the Canadian economy since their creation.
<P>
	In Quebec, for example, the FTQ fund alone has managed to 
create and maintain more than 58,000 jobs. This measure will slow 
down the expansion of these funds, thus decreasing their job 
creation potential. What makes this decision even harder to 
understand is the fact that a report by the Canadian Labour Market 
and Productivity Centre concluded that governments recover the 
fiscal costs of labour funds in less than three years.
<P>
	Instead of being a mere nuisance on the labour market, what 
does the government intend to do to implement real incentive 
programs to create jobs?
<P>
	The Liberal government is also targeting senior citizens. From 
now on, old age security will no longer be the basic tier of 
pensioners' income. It will provide replacement income to those 
who have been unable to save for their retirement during their 
working life. Through this reform, the government is creating two 
classes of senior citizens, those who were able to save for their 
retirement and those who were not.
<P>
	The important thing is that the new seniors benefits will now be a 
kind of welfare for senior citizens, and that they will be paid only to 
those most in need. So much for the consistency and 
complementarity of economic, social, and environmental measures 
of the government.
<P>
	Let us now turn to foreign policy.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	Here again, the Liberal government's last budget is a far cry 
from the commitments made over the last few years. We think the 
new foreign affairs minister should reacquaint himself with his 
government's commitments. The Liberals had promised to 
advocate and promote  democracy and human rights throughout the 
world. But the government's record in this is rather dismal.
<P>
	With the cuts the Liberal government announced during the 
previous budget year and confirmed in its last budget, Canada's 
development assistance expenditures have been reduced to less 
than 0.29 per cent of the gross domestic product, which is farfrom the 0.7 per cent target recommended by the internationalcommunity.
<P>
	After making these cuts, how does the Canadian government 
think it will be able to help the poorest people on earth?
<P>
	Development assistance is important on a human level, but 
equally important on an economic level. It provides jobs here at 
home. As the Bloc Quebecois indicated in its dissenting report on 
the review of Canada's foreign policy, one out of four jobs in 
Canada is linked to exports and the increasing impoverishment of 
the third world will obviously have a negative impact on the 
employment situation in our country. In the medium term, our own 
economic growth will partly depend on the increase of the standard 
of living of about 80 per cent of the world's population.
<P>
	As you know, the Bloc Quebecois supports and encourages the 
participation of Canada in United Nations peacekeeping missions. 
Of course, it is frustrating to see that several states do not pay their 
contributions to the United Nations, but Canada still has to 
continue to defend and promote human rights and democratic 
development.
<P>
	That brings me to the fact that the Bloc Quebecois supports 
specific missions, like the one currently underway in Haiti. For 
instance, already more than 400 soldiers from CFB Valcartier, in 
the outer suburbs of Quebec City, are over there. The goal of the 
United Nations mission in Haiti is to consolidate the stability of 
this new democracy. These are the kinds of initiatives our party 
supports.
<P>
	However, Canada could do more to tie its assistance policy and 
trade measures to the issue of respect for human rights. I am 
thinking in particular about Mr. Tran Trieu Quan, unfairly 
incarcerated in Vietnam. Yet, Canada has provided Vietnam with 
more than $50 million in assistance and development programs 
since 1994. This large amount of money is granted unconditionally 
to a country that is unfairly detaining a Canadian citizen and is 
more or less asking for a $1 million ransom for his release.
<P>
	This budget is proof that this Liberal government has forsaken 
all decency when it comes to its relations with countries where 
human rights are violated.
<P>
	In any case, after two years when they had to really tighten their 
belts, Canadians were ready for a third austerity budget on the part 
of the Liberal government. The latter knew that for a fact and did 
nothing to dissipate that impression. In fact, it rather encouraged it,  

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1513"> 1513 </A></B>
<P>
knowing full well that the people would better accept its budget if 
they really felt they were spared.
<P>
	At first glance, the budget presented by the finance minister is so 
conceived as to give the impression that there is something in it for 
everybody. But if we look closer, we can see that it is in fact an 
insidious budget trying to hide the bad news or wrap them up with 
so-called good news.
<P>
	All the major decisions concerning cuts and tax increases were 
announced last year and the year before. But they will continue to 
apply this year and for the next two years, allowing the government 
to continue to reduce its spending without having to make more 
unpopular decisions in the second part of its mandate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member has stressed quite vividly the 
government's position in the budget regarding seniors pensions and 
benefits. As he has suggested, perhaps we are subsidizing the 
poorest of the poor seniors through the changes made in the budget.
<P>
	It comes across that the hon. member is quite opposed to the 
position the government is taking in benefiting Canadian seniors. 
We are giving them a long term plan whereby anyone 60 years of 
age as of January 1 this year can have the existing benefits of OAS 
and GIS and there will be no changes in that. We have given them 
the benefit of long term planning so that any of these new changes 
will only affect younger people. The hon. member seems to be 
quite opposed to this. I wonder what he and his party would suggest 
as an alternative for the people of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to thank the hon. 
member for her question. Contrary to what she has suggested, I 
want to point out that I am far from being opposed to the idea of the 
government supporting the poor in our society. That is not the 
issue.
<P>
	What I said in my speech is that we are creating two classes of 
senior citizens. I think this is what makes this new program totally 
unacceptable.
<P>
	Let me give you another example, that of a seniors couple with a 
family income of approximately $80,000 a year, currently entitled 
to benefits. Let us compare that couple to another with a family 
income of about $45,000, after the year 2001. The couple currently 
receiving pension benefits from the program would still enjoy 
these benefits after the year 2001, even with an income of $80,000 
a year, whereas the couple whose income would total $45,000 a 
year would not be entitled to these benefits under the new policy of 
this government.
<P>
	This is totally unacceptable, and this is what I condemned in my 
speech; it was not the support given to the poor in our society.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réjean Lefebvre (Champlain, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, our 
economy is faltering. The unemployment rate is still at harmful 
levels. The tax system must be reformed. Very few jobs are being 
created, and only by the private sector.
<P>
	In such a context, the government must show its leadership. 
Recently, Mr. Chrétien and his team missed a good opportunity to 
change our economic environment and adjust it to the realities of 
this century's end. The budget tabling process is a public 
management tool that must include adjustment and stimulation 
measures that will help us reach our collective goals.
<P>
	But Mr. Martin chose to bring down a budget which closely 
resembles an election budget containing watered down initiatives 
and lacking concrete job creation measures. The Liberals have soon 
forgotten the promise to create jobs they made during the last 
election campaign. In the past year, the unemployment rate went 
down by only 0.1 per cent. Concretely, this year's budget proposes 
a summer job creation program for students and a technological 
investment fund aimed at preserving jobs.
<P>
	But in order to do so, the government is reducing tax benefits for 
workers' investment funds, a favoured job creation tool. Moreover, 
the cuts in research and development announced last year are being 
implemented this year, which is slowing down all the more 
innovation and research in Quebec and in Canada.
<P>
	Indeed, job creation is not the Liberals' priority at the moment. 
Moreover, they are determined to go forward with their 
unemployment insurance reform, which they have the gall to call 
``employment insurance'' in spite of all the public opposition and 
demonstrations.
<P>
	With this bill the government should be able to give workers the 
tools they need to get the jobs available on the market. In fact, 
every year, 300,000 jobs remain unoccupied in Canada because of a 
persistent lack of consistency between the training given in our 
institutions and the needs of employers.
<P>
	The government's objective is clear: increase UI fund surpluses 
and take them over at the workers' expense. It is time those funds 
were administered by the people to whom they belong and served 
the purpose for which they were collected. Only then could we 
speak of a real employment insurance. Without changes in that 
direction, the government must withdraw its bill.
<P>
	The government continues to insist on making the poorest 
elements of our society finance its overspending and its inability to 
put public finances on a healthy footing. The reform, in its present 
form, in unfair because the conditions of eligibility are tightened 
and it creates two categories of unemployed: frequent users and  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1514"> 1514 </A></B>
<P>
the others. Moreover, by lowering the benefit rate, it will throw 
more and more seasonal workers into poverty.
<P>
	In an economy built on small enterprises, farms and small retail 
stores, like in my riding, there is a lot of seasonal work. The people 
occupying temporary jobs do not do so because they want to. Why 
then penalize them as if they had a choice?
<P>
	The proposed reform is eroding the buying power of our 
workers.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	During the 1993 election campaign, the Liberals talked about 
eliminating the GST. Now they are talking about replacing it, about 
harmonizing it with provincial taxes. They are slowly setting the 
stage for the introduction of a national sales tax.
<P>
	The federal government should transfer to the provinces the tax 
room occupied by the GST. The government is quick to forget its 
campaign promises, especially now that it seems more preoccupied 
with the next election. But Canadians have a good memory.
<P>
	Fortunately, the Martin budget contained no tax increases for 
individuals but, indirectly, consumers will have to absorb part of 
the cost of the dairy subsidy. This budget provides for the 
phasing-out of the dairy subsidy over a five-year period starting 
next year. This will result in a loss of $76 million for Quebec dairy 
producers, who produce 47 per cent of industrial milk in Canada.
<P>
	For farmers in my riding, this means an annual loss of about 
$1,500 each, or more than $7,500 between now and August 1, 
2001. Members will recall that the dairy subsidy was introduced in 
the early 1970s to lower the selling price of dairy products and 
make them accessible to the largest possible number of consumers 
because they are good for their health. Once again, in a roundabout 
way, the government is making our small businesses and 
consumers pay the bill.
<P>
	On another subject, the new seniors benefit, which will replace 
the old age security and guaranteed income supplement programs 
in the year 2001, will be based on the family income of pensioners. 
On the one hand, the government is encouraging people to invest in 
RRSPs and, on the other hand, it is saying that seniors whose 
family income exceeds $45,000 will be penalized.
<P>
	For a couple, this represents an annual income of $22,500 per 
person, a figure which is relatively easy to reach for individuals 
who contribute $2,000 a year to their RRSP for about thirty years.
<P>
	The Martin budget changed the situation for all those involved in 
the long term planning of their retirement. There will no longer be 
a universal old age security system. The minister just said that such 
a universal system will have disappeared by 2001.
<P>
	In conclusion, the government is restricting access to programs 
and is quietly passing on the bill to low-income  people. The noose 
is getting tighter and tighter. Enough is enough. We will not be 
fooled by this collective impoverishment strategy. The government 
must ensure a fair distribution of the present tax burden. The social 
and financial security of our children depends on it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened to 
the member talk about the redistribution of income. I think that was 
his last comment. I was surprised how he took exception to the 
proposals in the budget to restructure old age pensions. Basically 
the budget sought to define those people who are most in need in 
our democracy, those people who have less income in their 
retirement years. It sought to underpin their incomes in their 
retirement years. Indeed it actually increased their real disposable 
income. It made those payments non-taxable.
<P>
	I heard the member say at one point in his speech there was a 
need to redistribute income. At another time I heard him take some 
exception to the fact that we have spent a lot of time in designing 
this legislation to create that safety net for the elderly.
<P>
	I know as well that a committee is currently travelling 
throughout the country talking about the Canada pension plan. I am 
sure also that one of the parameters there is to ensure that those 
funds will be available for those people who are most in need.
<P>
	These are things which I think are courageous of the 
government. We could simply forget about the Canada pension 
plan and by the year 2015 the cheques would stop coming. That 
perhaps would not hurt people who have high incomes but of 
course for those people who had not anticipated that it would create 
undue hardship.
<P>
<B>(1100 )</B>
<P>
	Our government has taken the time and the energy to recognize 
there is a problem coming, maybe not tomorrow but by the year 
2015. We want to deal with problems today so a future generation 
of Canadians will have adequate means for retirement.
<P>
	I would like to know how the member can argue that we are not 
redistributing income while at the same time he argues we should 
not be underpinning the retirement incomes of seniors who have 
less income than others.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lefebvre: </B>Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member across the 
way for his comments and his question. In connection with 
redistribution of income or old age pensions, I must point out that 
the hon. member did not really listen to my speech, since I did also 
refer to the unemployment insurance fund, with its $5 billion 
surplus, which the government is using to attack the least well off 
in our society. There is also the whole question of milk subsidies, 
which our Quebec farmers will no longer be getting.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1515"> 1515 </A></B>
<P>
	What the province of Quebec wants is a fair redistribution of 
income, because that income affects people, the least advantaged 
segment of the population and the health of the people in our 
ridings,
<P>
	Then there is the disappearance of universality in 2001, which 
will penalize those who have contributed to the pension plan all 
their lives.
<P>
	In my opinion, the Martin budget makes a poor distribution of 
income.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, our next speaker 
has not yet arrived. If the Chair wishes to proceed with the next 
speaker from the Reform Party that would be quite acceptable to 
us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Penson:</B> Mr. Speaker, our next speaker is not prepared 
either.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I shall 
continue in the same vein as my hon. colleague from Rosemont, on 
just how seriously our colleagues over there and next to us here are 
taking this budget, whether they are showing any real interest in 
criticizing it. This is a very serious matter, since it is so insidious 
and involves long term measures that will commit future 
governments, while not dealing well with the short term.
<P>
	I shall continue, nevertheless, keeping those subtleties in mind.
<P>
	The angles of attack-That, Mr. Speaker, may be the reaction of 
a man of the people to the silence from government members and 
Reform members.
<P>
	It is certainly not for want of things to criticize about this budget. 
We could talk about old age pensions, as has already been done; 
about the government's intentions concerning the revenue 
commission-where not only is the federal government 
intervening in an area of jurisdiction which is provincial under the 
Constitution, but where it also wants to push aside the only 
province that stood its ground in this matter and respected the 
Constitution, namely Quebec. Now it wants to shove Quebec aside 
and take over everything in a Canadian context.
<P>
	We could also criticize the way this government is dealing with 
the deficit. It is doing so at the expense of the least well-off 
members of society, that is the unemployed, by blithely dipping 
into the unemployment insurance fund to the tune of $6 billion 
yearly, a fund financed by workers' contributions. This is 
something that must not be lost sight of, something that must be 
mentioned again and again. Contributions come from employers 
and from employees. The cuts are being made at the expense of the 
provinces. They are blithely cutting transfer payments which ought 
normally to go to the provinces.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	But my intervention will deal mainly with the systematic attacks 
against worker funds. Two important worker funds appealed 
directly to Quebec. The first one, the CSN fund, was created 
recently and has known an almost resounding success, if we 
consider that they had a rather short timeframe to set it up. The 
second one, the largest, is the Fonds de solidarité des travailleurs 
du Québec, the flag ship of Canadian worker funds. The latter 
represents a third of all worker fund assets in Canada.
<P>
	The federal government is going after those worker funds on two 
levels: first by reducing the tax credit granted to taxpayers and 
funds from 20 per cent to 15 per cent, and secondly by lowering the 
maximum contribution allowed from $5,000 to $3,500 per person.
<P>
	The Fonds de solidarité is a huge success on both the financial 
and business levels. Since it was established in 1983, it has 
succeeded in creating or preserving 38,000 jobs. This is not 
peanuts. The fund did much better than previous Canadian 
governments.
<P>
	It funds various projets. In the riding of Trois-Rivières, which I 
represent, the Tripap mill has closed its doors, the old CPFC, 
Canadian Pacific Forest Products Limited, had closed down. It was 
revived thanks to the energetic efforts of the Fonds de solidarité 
and provides 450 jobs today.
<P>
	The Fonds has taken action at Novabus; Biochem Pharma, a 
pharmaceutical company particularly active in AIDS research, and 
Shermag, in Sherbrooke. In the Laurentians, it has been involved 
with the Château Mont-Tremblant and its ski resort. In the 
Mauricie region, in the Prime Minister's riding of Saint-Maurice, 
the Fonds provided financial assistance last year to a factory known 
as Desavenn Sac Inc., which had taken over part of the market left 
by the former Twinpac factory, in Cap-de-la-Madeleine, which had 
manufactured industrial paper bags for sugar, flour and chemicals 
that were exported throughout North America.
<P>
	We can see how vital the Fonds de solidarité is for Quebec's 
economy. I am all the more pleased as the opposition critic to see 
that the Fonds has adapted over the years. It is now setting up 
regional development funds. Sixteen will be set up shortly. One in 
the Mauricie region was set up last fall. These 16 regional funds 
will complement the main fund of the Fonds de solidarité. Some of 
them are called SOLIDE, that is local job development investment 
corporations; thirty had already been set up by the end of 1995, 
with the co-operation of the Union des municipalités régionales de 
comté throughout Quebec.
<P>
	In addition, the Fonds de solidarité in fine tuning its activities set 
up specialty funds in the areas of health, biotechnology and high 
technology in order to meet borrowers' needs.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1516"> 1516 </A></B>
<P>
	It is all the more upsetting to see attempts being made to 
undermine the actions of the Fonds de solidarité instead of further 
supporting them. The value of this fund was demonstrated by a 
study undertaken by Carleton University for the Canadian Labour 
Market and Productivity Centre. It was not done in Quebec, but 
by Carleton University, not far from here.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	This study shows that the Canadian tax system recovers within 
three years its tax incentives for fund management. Therefore, 
there is no reason to try to undermine workers' funds, in particular 
the Fonds de solidarité. On the contrary there is every reason to 
encourage it. This is in contrast with the statements by our 
colleague, the member for Willowdale, and former chairman of the 
finance committee, as reported in an article published in the 
January 18 issue of the <I>Soleil</I>. It states that ``the chairman of the 
committee maintains that these funds are granted generous 
exemptions which warrant strict controls''.
<P>
	This same attitude is observed in the industry committee, where 
it is claimed that what the workers funds ``cost'' the Canadian tax 
system-some ten millions dollars-should be reduced further, 
when everyone knows that this is a direct incentive for the 
economy of both Canada and Quebec.
<P>
	It is also a direct social and economic commitment because we 
know their effect on job creation, tax revenues, unemployment 
insurance benefit reductions, as well as the importance of a job for 
a family in terms of consumption, quality of life, reduction of drug 
use, reduction of spousal abuse, and so on. We know what 
unemployment means, we know what a job means. People who are 
able to create or maintain jobs should be encouraged, not 
discouraged.
<P>
	These measures are all the more alarming in the context where 
this kind of federal government's intervention is taking place, since 
the government was elected with the slogan ``jobs, jobs, jobs''. We 
will keep on reminding the government of it, this government that 
created 65,000 part-time jobs-that is for 6 to 12 months-since 
coming to office. It is still boasting about its infrastructure 
program, and it was elected with such a slogan.
<P>
	In this budget there is no framework or incentive for private 
corporations to create jobs. It is a well-known fact that, these days, 
major corporations tend to make prohibitive, outrageous profits-it 
is particularly true for banks-while allowing mass layoffs. We 
must question the ethic of such a phenomenon.
<P>
	I worked for the Quebec government, dealing with businesses in 
financial difficulty and I know they must consider the possibility of 
eventual mass layoffs. This is certainly quite logic. When a 
business is having a hard time, it must rationalize its operations and 
one possible  solution is to layoff people. It is sad, but it is in the 
order of things.
<P>
	But when profits reach such levels as they have recently in areas 
like the oil, telephone and banking industries, to name just a few, 
and when these industries still downsize and lay off people in 
numbers such as we have seen, for example at Bell Canada which 
plans to lay off 10,000 employees in Quebec, no doubt for very 
logical and justifiable corporate reasons, we must question such 
operations just as we must question the attitude of banks which 
make five billion dollar profits but, at the same time, do not 
hesitate to launch massive layoff plans.
<P>
	In another context, while they say that solidarity funds and 
labour-sponsored funds are too expensive, they do tolerate unpaid 
income taxes amounting to $6 billion and seem to be totally 
insensitive to that. They should start with this type of operation, put 
investigators to the task if need be and collect all those unpaid taxes 
before they hit on good, competent people who are efficient at job 
creating, particularly those people from labour-sponsored funds 
such as the Fonds de solidarité des travailleurs du Québec.
<P>
	As far as efforts are concerned, they require efforts on the part of 
the labour-sponsored funds, but they ask banks for a 65 million 
dollar effort over two years when these banks are reaping profits of 
$5 billion. Furthermore, according to present trends, it seems that 
these profits will be even higher next year. This $65 million 
contribution is almost equal to the total cost of labour-sponsored 
funds across Canada.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	I must also add that this is happening in a context where the 
federal government's policies in the area of economic 
development, particularly regional economic development, are 
almost morally questionable. Consider the debate about the coast 
guard, the introduction of cost recovery measures in the coast 
guard without any impact studies. The government went ahead 
with only one thing in mind: to meet the goal it had set itself, that is 
to recover by March 31, 1997, the $20 million forecasted in its 
budget for aid to navigation.
<P>
	It wants to recover $20 million out of $160 million by the year 
2000, without considering the real profitability of it, the real 
impact on users of the St. Lawrence River, namely shipowners. 
What would happen if, after having done their calculations, they 
decided that, economically, the St. Lawrence River was no longer a 
good place to do business because costs outstripped profits? It 
would be catastrophic. This type of calculation should have been 
done by the federal government. Just imagine the impact on the 
ports of Montreal, of Quebec City and all the other harbours which 
I might call secondary along the St. Lawrence River, like those of 
Sorel, Trois-Rivières, Sept-Îles, Baie-Comeau and Chicoutimi on 
the Saguenay River.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1517"> 1517 </A></B>
<P>
	This type of measure impacting directly on labour sponsored 
funds is part of another scheme which is just as much a dodging 
of responsibilities as the user fees for the coast guard are.
<P>
	Personally, I am shocked by the government's attitude toward 
the Fonds de solidarité des travailleurs du Québec in particular 
because, for us, this fund demonstrates the ability of Quebecers to 
look after themselves, to be imaginative and capable of being 
creative. We will not let the federal government go in that direction 
for very long. And the Liberal Party of Canada will pay the price 
for it, especially in Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on March 
8, I took part in a television program called ``Droit de parole'' on 
the Radio-Québec network, along with representatives from 
various social and economic groups; employers, unions, women's 
groups, young people and chambers of commerce were 
represented.
<P>
	A SOM-Le Soleil poll released during this program shows that 
only 33 per cent of the population rely on the budget to promote job 
creation, while 53 per cent rely little or not at all on this same 
budget to reach this job creation objective.
<P>
	Also, when asked about the future of pensions, increasingly, 
fewer young people and members of the middle class say they rely 
on the federal government to ensure the future of the public 
pension system.
<P>
	In a period of accelerated technological and social change, where 
confidence in democratic institutions should be high, the 
government is showing no leadership whatsoever. The government 
has lost all credibility with a growing number of Canadians. This 
had led, spontaneously, to the founding in Canada of about twenty 
new groups, such as the group Conference Confederation 2000, 
which met at the Château Laurier in March, following last 
October's referendum campaign, to fill the political vacuum left by 
this government. The emergence of these groups shows that nature 
abhors a vacuum, and at present, the vacuum is the government that 
is in place here in Ottawa.
<P>
	What are the main causes of such a lack of credibility of the 
Canadian government with its citizens? Government rhetoric 
changes from month to month; federal ministers contradict each 
other, and policies put forward often cancel each other out.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	This lack of direction is reflected in the deficit reduction 
measures and some job creation measures which are supposed to be 
found in the federal budget.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance emphasizes in his budget that the deficit 
will be $24 billion next year and $17 billion in two years. The 
Minister speaks only of the future. But let us not forget that the 
deficit is now very close to $33  billion and that it was $37.5 billion 
last year. That is the reality. These are not projections.
<P>
	And if we add the $5 billion coming from the unemployment 
insurance account surplus, which in actual fact belongs to the 
employers and the workers and which the Minister has 
appropriated, the real deficit for this year remains close to $38 
billion, and the one for last year was $42.5 billion. This is the same 
deficit level that we saw during the last year of the mandate of the 
Conservative government. At that time, the Liberals condemned 
the deficit.
<P>
	To justify rolling the surplus of the unemployment insurance 
account into the consolidated revenue fund and reducing the deficit 
accordingly, the Minister says that if there is a shortfall in the 
unemployment insurance account during the next recession or 
during the next major the increase in the unemployment rate, the 
government will make up the shortfall in the account.
<P>
	Imagine the burden the minister is placing on the unemployment 
insurance account and future government deficits. What is even 
more disquieting about the minister's deficit projections is that we 
are currently in full economic upturn; recovery is under way. The 
U.S., for example, recorded over 700,000 new jobs in February, the 
highest since 1983.
<P>
	What will happen to the deficit in the next recession, which the 
economists are predicting for around the end of this decade? The 
Liberals place much emphasis on the last two Conservative 
deficits, which hovered around the $40 or $42 billion mark after the 
recession at the beginning of this decade.
<P>
	It must be kept in mind, however, that in 1990-91 and 1991-92 
the deficits inherited from the Conservatives were in fact $32 and 
$34 billion, the same as this year's deficit. In the good growth years 
from 1987 to 1990, this deficit was $28 or $29 billion, even less 
than the current figure.
<P>
	Even in the Conservatives' day, the deficit was under $30 billion 
in the growth years, and around $40 billion in the recession years. 
The Liberals have done no better, even after raising taxes and 
pillaging the unemployment insurance fund.
<P>
	The next recession is, therefore, liable to plunge us back into a 
vicious circle, into a deeper whirlpool than before. Debt servicing 
will be close to $50 billion next year, and a 1 per cent variation in 
interest rates adds $1.3 billion to the deficit. Worse, in the medium 
term, it has a $3 billion impact on the debt.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance has no room whatsoever to manoeuvre, 
given the size of the debt accumulated so far. The impact of any 
change in interest rates is far too great. There is but one solution: 
what should have been done was to clean up business taxation right 
away, instead of striking a committee of experts to examine the 
question. Clean up by fighting waste throughout  government 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1518"> 1518 </A></B>
<P>
machinery and by cutting the defence budget much more 
substantially.
<P>
	The deficit should have been reduced to $35 billion last year, $25 
billion this year, $15 billion next year and $5 billion two years 
hence so that there would be a surplus in 1999 of $5 billion that 
could be applied to the debt creating the financial manoeuvring 
room that is so lacking now.
<P>
	This is the only consistent program needed, and the government 
was incapable of instituting it.
<P>
	The Liberals created the debt in the 1970s and early 1980s. In the 
1990s, they are going at indebtedness with renewed vigour. They 
have no budget sense and will never be able to manage a budget.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	We have to get rid of this government before it becomes the 
cause of our demise. Ask our international creditors about the 
scope of the real political instability we all talk so much about. Ask 
them whether it comes really from popular consultation or the 
inability of our political leaders to balance the budget.
<P>
	In terms of jobs, the budget tabled by the Minister of Finance is 
just as pitiful as it is in terms of the deficit and the debt. There is no 
major job creation measure. The budget for student jobs is 
increasing we are told from $60 million to $120 million, although it 
was already at $84 million before the Liberals reduced it.
<P>
	So they double the budget for little summer jobs, but because the 
Liberals reduced transfer payments for post-secondary education 
by $450 million in two years, the provinces will have to double 
tuition fees. At this rate, many students will be unable to continue 
their studies and will have to keep for much of their life the little 
summer job created for them. This is what is commonly called 
dead end jobs.
<P>
	There is always a double standard. The government gives with 
one hand what it takes away with the other. In the budgetary 
reallocation game, the President of Treasury Board makes up in 
new expenditures all that was saved in government cuts. All the 
savings should have gone to balance the budget. The whole 
accounting exercise of cuts and reallocations translates this year 
into a real net increase in expenditures of $34 million and barely 
$200 million in savings next year.
<P>
	This government, therefore, is still far too interventionist, and 
the measures put forward in the Minister of Finance's budget fail 
utterly to resolve the problems of the deficit and employment.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International 
Cooperation and Minister responsible for Francophonie, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, this is the first time I rise in this House, and it is with 
great emotion that I speak today as a member of Parliament. I 
would first like to thank the people of Papineau-Saint-Michel for 
their confidence in  me and I want to tell them that I will always be 
proud and happy to represent them, to promote their interests and 
to defend their rights in this country.
<P>
	My first loyalty is to them, since my primary role in our 
wonderful parliamentary democracy is to speak on their behalf. I 
heard their concerns and their fears, as well as their hopes, their 
determination and their common sense. I invite the people of 
Papineau-Saint-Michel, whatever their allegiances, to continue to 
communicate with me and tell me what they think. I am here for 
them; I would not be here without them.
<P>
	In this era of upheaval resulting from the revolutionary force of 
globalization, liberal democracy faces its main challenge. We must 
say loud and clear that freedom is the goal pursued by human 
beings.
<P>
	The people of Papineau-Saint-Michel will always find in their 
member of Parliament a representative willing to spend all his 
energy on protecting the freedom we enjoy as individuals, as well 
as that enjoyed by our respective communities. And because the 
time has come to redefine the role of government, I am very proud 
to make my first speech in this House on the finance minister's 
budget.
<P>
	This budget meets the ambitious objectives set by the 
Government of Canada: to put the nation's finances in order to 
protect our financial future, while at the same time rethinking the 
role of government in the economy and in the lives of the people.
<P>
	The finance minister's budget stays the course set by the 
government at the beginning of its mandate, and rightly so. We are 
finally getting out of the deficit spiral. Our deficit will fall to 2 per 
cent of GDP by 1997-98, ahead of the commitments made in the 
last general election. And this with no increase in personal or 
corporate income tax, or even in excise taxes. There were no 
personal income tax hikes in the last three budgets.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	Putting the nation's finances in order will prepare the ground for 
a more vigorous, job creating economy. A lower deficit will help 
reduce interest rates, increase confidence and promote new 
investments leading to more jobs and stronger growth. The 
government's performance with respect to employment deserves to 
be acknowledged. The unemployment rate dropped from 11.2 per 
cent in 1993 to 9.6 per cent today. There is still much work to be 
done, but we are on the right track.
<P>
	This budget, presented in the middle of an election campaign, 
was very well received by the residents of 
Papineau-Saint-Michel, who voted in with a strong majority a 
member of the Liberal government.
<P>
	The people of Papineau-Saint-Michel accepted the necessary 
yet respectful decisions made regarding pension benefits. I could 
feel it in my riding: my constituents realize that this is the only 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1519"> 1519 </A></B>
<P>
budget approach  that can actually boost the economy and ensure 
that our social programs will be maintained in the future.
<P>
	As Minister for International Co-operation, I am responsible for 
projecting Canadian solidarity internationally. Canadians share a 
tremendous sense of solidarity in every respect and wealth is 
redistributed among the regions of Canada to ensure that all 
Canadians enjoy public services of a quality second to none in any 
federation on this planet. From this solidarity arose Canada's 
solidarity with less privileged countries. The Canadian 
International Development Agency is an institution that Canadians 
and Quebecers alike can be very proud of.
<P>
	We are investing in the future, in our youth and in technology. 
This budget promotes export development, since international 
trade was responsible for creating 80 per cent of jobs created over 
the past few years. The people of Papineau-Saint-Michel 
appreciated this budget, but they are nevertheless worried. They are 
worried about the future of Montreal, and the east end of Montreal 
in particular.
<P>
	Formerly the industrial and financial metropolis of Canada, 
Montreal is taking a radical shift toward the new economic order. 
While a part of Montreal, represented by high technology 
industries like aircraft manufacturing and computer science, 
consulting engineering and pharmaceutical products, is thriving, 
another part of Montreal cannot cope with such rapid and drastic 
changes in production modes and lags behind in the globalization 
movement. That is my part of Montreal, the one I represent in this 
place, the east end of Montreal, and this part of Montreal is choking 
to death.
<P>
	The people of Papineau-Saint-Michel appreciate this 
government's economic policies. They made this very clear in the 
last election, but they also came to me with their concerns about 
unemployment, by which they are hard hit. They told me they 
wanted to work.
<P>
	But my constituents realize that economic and monetary policies 
alone, however good they may be, are not enough to achieve the 
desired goal-and for us, Liberals, the goal remains employment. 
Even the best policies cannot help them achieve their goal if the 
political climate is not favourable. That is why every bone and 
sinew of Quebec must immediately come together to stop the brain 
drain and capital flight that have picked up since October 30.
<P>
	Montreal, this large North American city, cannot develop in the 
restrictive economic conditions created by sovereignist pressure in 
Quebec and associated climate of political instability. Quebecers 
energies should not be wasted in divisions and political jockeying, 
but rather focused on strengthening Quebec's civil society and 
paving the way for its integration into rapidly forming 
transnational networks, strategic alliances and cultural coalitions. 
The Quebec society will show much more convincingly that it is 
mature, distinctive and distinct by resolutely engaging in a 
successful integration process that is now much more important 
than the obsolete nation state model.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	Throughout the world, identities are becoming more complex 
and allegiances are multiplying. The French are becoming 
increasingly more European, and both the French and European 
identities reinforce each other.
<P>
	The Quebec identity is strengthened by the Canadian identity, 
particularly in light of the fact that the latter is strongly impressed 
in the head and heart of Quebecers, who greatly helped define that 
Canadian identity. Indeed, Quebecers greatly helped define the 
Canadian identity. That identity, which is more closely integrated 
to the North-American reality, helps many of our businesses and 
organizations by enabling them to be part of international networks 
and world alliances.
<P>
	To think that we would strengthen our identity by giving it only a 
Quebec dimension is to totally misunderstand what is going on in 
the world today. On the contrary, such a measure would deprive our 
identity of elements which ensure its richness, its vitality and its 
future. The strength of an identity lies in its ability to reflect the 
facts and realities of a society.
<P>
	To be sure, the solution of the sixties, namely a strong central 
state, allowed Quebec, which was lagging two or three generations 
behind Ontario and the rest of North America thanks to its elite, to 
make up the lost ground. All that took place within the Canadian 
federation. However, 1960 was also the golden age of 
decolonization; the welfare state was in its glory. That was 35 years 
ago. We are talking here about a Quebec nationalism-not 
sovereignism but nationalism-that is unifying and perfectly 
compatible with a modern Canadian federalism that is ready for 
globalization.
<P>
	The nation state is a political model that is now obsolete. 
Without excluding a feeling of belonging, the Quebec nationalism 
of the 21st century must be modern and fully affirm itself in the 
economic, technological, linguistic, cultural and financial sectors. 
Quebecers have a unique opportunity to show that a normal people, 
to use the expression coined by the Bloc Quebecois, chooses to 
express its distinctive features, its determination and its 
intelligence by redefining its needs and its priorities in a 
contemporary way.
<P>
	To be politically mature is to share its sovereignty with its 
neighbours. Are the French, the Germans and the Dutch any less 
sovereign? Are they less mature politically because they have 
transferred some powers to Brussels?
<P>
	Sovereignists insult Quebecers when they travel abroad and say 
that Quebecers will chose sovereignty once they are free. We are a 
free people. We have chosen Canada every time we were consulted 
in the last 200 years.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1520"> 1520 </A></B>
<P>
	The Quebec society should be well advised to focus its energy 
and nationalism on the new rising world rather than on yesterday's 
world. Any people in 1996 would prefer to be part of the G-7 
countries, that have a lot of influence over the evolution of our 
world and exercise real leadership over the rest of the world. Any 
people would obviously prefer that.
<P>
	By the way, during 18 of the 20 years the G-7 countries have 
existed, Quebecers have led the Canadian delegation. Last June, at 
the Halifax summit, Jean Chrétien, from Quebec, played host to 
heads of state; André Ouellet, who was the member for 
Papineau-Saint-Michel before me and who had a remarkable 
political career, welcomed the ministers of foreign affairs; and the 
Minister of Finance, another member of Parliament from Montreal, 
greeted his counterparts from the other G-7 countries.
<P>
	So, these three Quebecers have, in a sense, the opportunity to 
work closely with people in Washington, Tokyo, Bonn, London and 
Paris, and I am proud to be part of a nation that is carving out a 
place for itself in this world.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	Far from preventing the Quebec society from integrating into the 
world, Canada is letting Quebecers play a role in international 
relations which they could not have if Quebec and the rest of 
Canada did not maintain the remarkable international reputation 
they have built together.
<P>
	For instance, because of its dynamic presence within the 
French-Canadian community, Quebec can promote the growth of 
the French language both at the national and international levels. 
My role as Minister responsible for Francophonie helps me see 
Quebec's constant contribution to the French-speaking world. 
Nevertheless, the Canadian francophone community is not limited 
to Quebec, and it is our duty to also give this community a voice in 
the world.
<P>
	It is only because it is part of the Canadian federation that 
Quebec meets the geographic criteria of the Asian and Pacific 
Council, an organization that is crucial to our relations with several 
economies which, in these times, are experiencing the most 
remarkable economic growth. Included in the growing industrial 
sectors in that region are several sectors where Quebec has a major 
competitive advantage: telecommunications, transportation, 
energy and development infrastructure.
<P>
	Quebec must no longer exclude itself from Team Canada 
missions and from the economic and trade advantages that these 
missions bring to our businesses. Canada's reputation and the 
strength it gets from the association of the economic and political 
leaders of a great country, which is an influential player within the 
major and even the most exclusive centres of power,  open a lot of 
doors and create a lot of business opportunities.
<P>
	Quebec needs to be recognized by the rest of Canada. It needs 
the recognition of its unique mission in North America. This 
recognition must be reflected in the attitude of all Canadians and 
must find its place in the Canadian Constitution. But to fulfil its 
mission, Quebec needs all the advantages that come with being part 
of the Canadian federation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	To rejuvenate and revitalize Canada, that is our mission, my 
mission. We have to address the real underlying issues and not 
limit ourselves strictly to the legalistic formalities of constitutional 
process, however essential this process might be.
<P>
	We need a new language, a new master plan which begins with a 
solid understanding of our common interests. The new generation 
in all regions of Canada must express its determination to overhaul 
federalism by renewing it, not dismantling it.
<P>
	Obviously Quebec has a special contribution to make to that new 
Canada. Its distinctiveness in economic terms is certainly a worthy 
contribution. Obviously Quebec has a special contribution to make 
in cultural terms. Quebec is an asset in a world that is shrinking and 
the French language is an asset in many foreign markets in Europe, 
Africa and Asia.
<P>
	For decades our constitutional debates have been inward 
looking, this region against that one, this linguistic community 
against that other one, individual rights versus collective rights. We 
need to give much more attention to the opportunities and threats 
from the outside world.
<P>
	I remain convinced that when we re-establish dialogue among 
ourselves and look together at the outside world we will realize that 
we have more in common than we think, certainly enough to build 
solidarity, to maintain common institutions and a common country. 
We will certainly find we have enough to be generous toward 
Quebec and its special mission in this country and on this 
continent.
<P>
	If enough people in the new generation everywhere across 
Canada accept this formidable task their creativity, their tolerance 
for our differences will in the end reinvent federalism.
<P>
	The centralized nation state of the 19th century does not really 
excite Quebecers, and a majority of them will always choose an 
updated thoroughly rethought federalism over an ambiguous and 
doubtful sovereignty.
<P>
<B>(1145 )</B>
<P>
	The 21st century will be the century of integration of societies 
similar to what the Europeans are now building with some 
difficulty. Despite the hesitations, despite the lamentations, the 
European 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1521"> 1521 </A></B>
<P>
Union is the future of  Europe and Europe moves toward federalism 
as it approaches the next century. As Alain Minc, a respected 
French public figure told us last fall commenting on the European 
difficulties, le Canada c'est notre rêve, Canada is our dream.
<P>
	Canada has a long tradition and much valuable experience in the 
accommodation of integration with distinctiveness. It can make a 
remarkable contribution to the 21st century as an example of 
tolerance, justice and democracy. Canada could continue to play a 
role in world affairs which divided we cannot play. Let us 
modernize what we have. Let us adapt it to the challenges of the 
next century.
<P>
	If Canada did not exist today the chances are we would be 
working hard to create it. Let us work just as hard to reinvent it. 
Every generation of Canadians in a sense did so in the past. It is the 
task facing our generation and Canada deserves a victory.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Tremblay (Rosemont, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I must 
begin by congratulating my neighbour, the hon. member for 
Papineau-Saint-Michel on his election. If he has been elected, it 
must mean the campaigning is over now, something I think he has 
forgotten.
<P>
	During that entire campaign, the minister who was then a 
candidate refused to take part in an open debate. Now he is in the 
House, and here there has to be debate. He cannot make just any old 
statement without some reaction. Those are the rules here. When a 
person claims to be an expert in international affairs, he has to be 
able to prove it. I want to give him the opportunity to do so.
<P>
	The minister is dazzled by Canada's performance, with an 
unemployment rate that has gone from 11.2 per cent to 9.6 per cent 
since 1993. Could he explain to us how our American neighbours, 
with whom we do 80 per cent or more of our trade, have managed 
during that same time to have an unemployment rate of 5.5, 5.6 per 
cent? If this is lotus land, it must be an absolute paradise on the 
other side of the border.
<P>
	There are other things that more important, or equally important. 
We are told that people found this to be a wonderful budget. Does 
that go for the tens of thousands of people who moved from 
unemployment insurance to welfare while the federal government 
was cutting benefits and increasing contributions to such an extent 
that it created a $5 billion surplus in the unemployment insurance 
fund, shifting tens of thousands of people onto welfare rolls and 
then washing its hands of its responsibilities to the provinces? The 
federal government has traditionally paid 50 per cent of welfare 
costs. That is no longer the way things are, however. The federal 
government abandons the unemployed to the provinces, but no 
longer assumes part of the costs.
<P>
	As for political matters, I am obliged, unfortunately, to 
recognize that the member for Papineau-Saint-Michel  truly 
represents Liberal Party tradition in this House. Perhaps his speech 
was prepared before last weekend's meeting of the Liberal Party of 
Canada in Quebec, because they just buried the constitutional 
debate by a sort of unanimous motion, which was also approved 
unanimously by all the federalist allies of the Liberal Party of 
Canada.
<P>
	So we are in a position where a little knot of Quebec Liberal 
members-thanks to the Bloc now, we can show that it is a little 
knot of federal Liberal members-alone is right. This reminds us 
of something. They alone are right. They are open minded. They 
represent Quebec's identity.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	Well, I think the minister is going to have to take reality into 
account. The reality is that nearly 50 per cent of Quebecers voted 
for sovereignty. This is major progress. The minister adds 
``sovereignty-partnership''. Of course, of course, we are modern. 
We are modern my friend, and we know it.
<P>
	The minister should remember that it is thanks to Quebec that 
Canada adopted free trade. More than anywhere else in Canada, we 
are open to things modern and to international trade. It is very 
clear. It is also clear that we are open to partnership.
<P>
	I welcome him. It is a welcome that promises vigorous debates, 
because it is clear that, on this side of the House, we very definitely 
do not share the vision of the member for Papineau-Saint-Michel.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pettigrew:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague from the 
riding next to mine for this opportunity to participate in the debate. 
I would like to mention that I had the occasion to debate during the 
last campaign and everybody agreed that it was fortunate for my 
adversary that there was no other debate because the score would 
have been even worse.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pettigrew:</B> You asked about unemployment because I was 
applauding the fact that it has declined.
<P>
	In Lille recently, there was a conference of industry and labour 
ministers during which President Chirac asked a very interesting 
question. He said: ``Is there a third method, half way between the 
American way, where jobs are created very rapidly and social 
programs are almost nonexistent, and the European way, which is 
extremely rigid, where social programs are on a much larger scale, 
yet where job creation has been stagnant if not regressing for the 
last few years?''
<P>
	The answer is: Canada. We talked about that with President 
Chirac. Canada is the third way between European rigidity, which 
leans more toward socialism, and the American way, which leans 
more toward the free market but does not adequately protect its 
people.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1522"> 1522 </A></B>
<P>
	I am extremely proud to say this Canadian way, this third way 
in the world, is the method that the Liberal government has 
supported year after year for the last few generations.
<P>
	You say you are surprised that the electorate appreciated the 
budget. I was right there campaigning, my friend; I saw the 
constituents and I knew, the minute the budget was brought down, 
that the election was won because they were reassured about 
pensions. Let me remind you that we have brought the Liberal 
Party score from 52 to 60 per cent and that the Bloc Quebecois 
went from 39 to 34 per cent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Let us not forget Lac-Saint-Jean.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pettigrew:</B> The Liberal Party's performance also improved 
in Lac-Saint-Jean where it received 8 per cent more votes. We were 
very proud of that fact.
<P>
	I want to speak about what happened last weekend. It takes real 
intellectual dishonesty not to recognize, in the resolution adopted 
by the party at that meeting, that the objective of the Liberal Party 
of Canada is to have the resolution defining the principles of the 
distinct society enshrined in the Constitution. That is what the 
resolution that was voted on said.
<P>
	In fact, I cannot understand this sudden attachment to the words 
``distinct society'', which our friends across the way have always 
despised. As a Quebecer, I can tell you that I am perfectly prepared 
to work with you toward enshrining distinct society in the Canadian 
Constitution. But do you really believe that the words ``distinct 
society'' truly reflect the reality, when, just a while ago, you were 
telling me that it was an empty shell?
<P>
	Enough is enough; such hypocrisy has to stop. It is no use crying 
over something you have already rejected. Do not interfere with 
our work and, hopefully, we will find better words, if those ones do 
not adequately reflect what the rest of Canada thinks. What I want 
is for Quebec and the special, unique, particular and distinct role it 
plays in Canada and North America to be recognized by the rest of 
Canada and enshrined in the Constitution. I got into politics to see 
this Canada emerge in the next-
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I regret to interrupt you, and I would like 
to ask our new colleague to please address the Chair, and not his 
colleague opposite. The question and comment period will be 
shared by two speakers, starting with the hon. member for Calgary 
Centre.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I 
would like to compliment the new Minister for Intergovernmental 
Affairs on his maiden speech in the House of Commons.
<P>
	I found myself agreeing with a lot of what he said in the latter 
part of his speech. I do believe in Canada and I do believe in 
federalism. I would certainly hope that both  the Liberals and the 
Reform Party can work together to hold this country together 
because it is worth saving, unlike what the Bloc Quebecois would 
like to do with this country.
<P>
	Having given him high marks on that part of his speech, I feel 
now that I will hit a little bit around the belt. I have to give him an <I>F</I> 
on finance because he said two things in his speech which I take 
exception to and which I would like him to elaborate on.
<P>
	He said that the government has tackled the spiralling deficit and 
that solved the problem. I do not know how much the member 
understands about finance, but if he feels that by continually 
spending more money than is brought in and by continually adding 
to the debt that the problem will be solved, then I feel he had better 
revisit his math courses.
<P>
	While he brags about the deficit going down from $42 billion to 
$37 billion to $32 billion to $24 billion, he fails to say that the debt 
is going from $508 billion to $545 billion to $578 billion to $602 
billion. He may brag about a $24 billion deficit next year, but the 
debt will have increased to $578 billion. The year after where the 
projections are really fuzzy, he states a deficit of $17 billion and the 
debt will be $602 billion. The problem is the debt and the interest 
costs to service the debt. I would like his opinion on that fact.
<P>
	This second point surprises me. He said that in the last three 
budgets the government has not increased taxes. Well, he just got 
here yesterday and I have to tell him that the government has 
increased taxes. Before he replies to that, let me point out to him 
that when this government came in, the revenue was $116 billion 
and is projected to go to $141 billion.
<P>
	When he stands in the House of Commons and says that the 
government in its last three budgets has not raised taxes, he has 
been given false information. He has not researched the 
information. It is a disservice to the Canadian public to tell them 
that taxes have not been increased.
<P>
	In answer to me he will then have to say that all this extra 
revenue has come from a growth in the economy and that there has 
been nothing done in the income tax system. There have been no 
excise taxes introduced, no taxes on seniors, no taxes on anything.
<P>
	Before the member answers, he had better make sure he has the 
correct answer because the answer will stay with him for the rest of 
this Parliament.
<P>
	I would like the member to answer those two questions because 
the budget does show that there are taxes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pettigrew:</B> Mr. Speaker, first allow me to thank my 
colleague from the opposition for his offer of collaboration to 
recognize this great country we have and to do everything we can to 
accommodate every major  partner of it. It will be essential and 
important that we all work together.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1523"> 1523 </A></B>
<P>
	Members will know that there is an important majority of 
Quebecers who want us to adapt federalism to the new needs they 
have and to the needs of the 21st century. I can say that there is a 
great majority of Quebecers who would be very happy to see what 
develops in the next few months.
<P>
	It is true that all major partners of this federation need to feel 
more comfortable in this country. We have to respect each major 
party of the federation for the contributions each makes to the 
federation. That is true for the regions as well.
<P>
	Quebec has a special mission in the country. It contributes some 
elements that are unique to the personality of the country and to the 
identity of the country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Penson:</B> What area does not?
<P>
<B>(1200 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pettigrew:</B> That is true. However, I am talking about the 
linguistic distinction in Quebec which is a major asset. In business, 
when one deals with foreign markets, the fact that we have a 
bilingual country is an extraordinary asset. It gives us a special 
voice in world affairs. We are all very attached to it. We need to 
make sure we protect that voice in our country.
<P>
	I am delighted to now turn to finances. I come from the business 
community, which I do not miss, but I am delighted to talk to 
members about finances. I am extremely pleased to explain to my 
colleague that 6 per cent of the gross national product was the 
deficit when we arrived in 1993. We are moving to 2 per cent. We 
have gone from 6 per cent to 2 per cent for the first time in our 
history. This is extraordinary. We are now-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Unfortunately, the hon. member's time 
has run out.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the hon. member for 
Peace River.
<P>
	I rise on behalf of the people of 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt to respond to the annual budget 
proposed by the Liberal government. My constituents and I are 
very pleased and anxious to reply to what we have heard.
<P>
	The people in my area of the country want to hear something that 
would be of some use to them, for example, paying the mortgage 
on their homes, keeping them gainfully employed, contributing to 
their RRSPs, among other things. In fact, the people at our town 
hall meetings in Grand Forks, Merritt, Oliver and Penticton  cited 
unemployment, crime and taxes as their major concerns.
<P>
	I can hardly express the eagerness that the people of 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt feel in terms of their 
willingness to work toward getting the nation's financial house in 
order. In the smaller communities in my riding the people know 
that their financial security and that of their families can be 
realized in a healthy, prosperous national economy.
<P>
	The people who write to me or speak to me at town hall meetings 
and other events throughout the riding express a high measure of 
confidence in our ability to eliminate the federal government's 
annual budgetary deficit. This would create jobs for Canadians.
<P>
	A recent poll indicates that some Canadians feel that deficit 
elimination measures would increase unemployment levels. 
Nothing could be further from the truth. Interest rates would fall. 
More economic opportunities would result for small business. 
More job opportunities would be created. Tax relief would become 
a reality.
<P>
	The people in my riding have made it very clear that they support 
the Reform Party's plan to give economic stability and tax relief to 
Canadians. In turn, Canadians would be able to confidently plan 
their futures.
<P>
	Canadians want to be able to buy a new car or house or plan a 
vacation or contribute to their retirement funds. Too many 
Canadians are in the position of just making ends meet or trying to 
pay off what seems to be the never ending credit card balance.
<P>
	The Liberal Party of Canada should listen to this voice of 
confidence that is coming so loud and clear from western Canada.
<P>
	My constituents and I are concerned that Liberals are afraid to 
eliminate the deficit. Reform members, following what we have 
been told by Canadians, are prepared to eliminate the deficit. We 
know that the federal government must abandon the old tax and 
spend types budgets. We know that governments should make it 
possible for the private sector to create jobs.
<P>
	Canadians know that successive Liberal and Conservative 
governments over the past few decades have failed in this regard. 
They have failed to create jobs. It has been shown clearly that job 
creation must come from a healthy private sector.
<P>
<B>(1205 )</B>
<P>
	My constituents and I know that the Liberals have different 
ideas. The government's annual budget is supposed to flow from 
the people to the government. The Reform Party continually tries 
to drive home to the Liberals what Canadians are saying. The 
people in my area of Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt have been 
specific when they speak of what should be the economic agenda 
for our nation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1524"> 1524 </A></B>
<P>
	During the extended recess in this place for most of the winter 
months, when the Liberals decided there was no work to do 
probably because it was too cold, I met with many of the 
constituents from Okanagan in British Columbia. In fact, while 
the Liberals were sitting close to their wood stoves getting warm 
I managed to hold town hall meetings in my riding.
<P>
	The people told me that they are concerned about personal 
security. What they are talking about is first, good jobs; second, 
higher incomes resulting in lower taxes; third, safer streets; fourth, 
social security programs they can count on including health, 
education, pensions; fifth, political stability.
<P>
	Following the unveiling of the Liberal Party's budget we now 
have some measure of the great distance from these priorities the 
Liberals have placed themselves and the federal government. The 
list of priorities I have just read is far removed from the priorities 
the Liberals have established for the government to pursue.
<P>
	In the city of Penticton in my riding during the month of January 
1996, $4.48 million was paid out in unemployment insurance. In 
1995 about $34 million was paid out in UI; in 1994 $43 million; in 
1993, $45 million was paid out in UI.
<P>
	The Liberals are very proud of this type of reduction in UI 
payments. They try to cite their election platform of jobs, jobs, 
jobs, their infamous infrastructure program and their deficit 
reduction measures as being responsible for the drop in UI 
payments in my riding.
<P>
	The other side of the coin is the increase in the number of social 
assistance recipients in the same area in my riding. The provincial 
government has changed the criteria for receiving social assistance 
and the federal government has tightened the qualifications for 
receiving UI payments. The figures I received from my 
constituency, which are a matter of public record, show clearly that 
the people who were formerly unemployed are now receiving 
social assistance. The apparent drop in UI payments is not an 
increase in the employment level at all.
<P>
	In addition to what I have just said, there is a large opportunity to 
create jobs in the Okanagan valley. This is true of our nation as a 
whole. Deficit reduction will lead to higher employment levels and 
in the smaller communities such as in my riding in places like 
Princeton, Merritt, Okanagan Falls and Grand Forks.
<P>
	Deficit reduction will lead to higher investment. International 
investors will have confidence investing in the economy once our 
financial house is in order. Canadians will determine that 
investment at home is more attractive than investing abroad. The 
private sector will be able to expand along with higher investment 
levels. The private sector will be able to create long term, high 
quality, sustainable jobs. That is what we need in this country.
<P>
	For example, people speak to me about making contributions to 
their RRSPs. They note that only 20 per cent of their investment
<P>
can be placed in foreign investments. In the majority of cases, 
Canadians feel that foreign investments are most attractive. This 
situation should be reversed. Canadians should be expecting to get 
equal or better results, a better return on their money, by investing 
at home.
<P>
	What is worse is that affluent Canadians with a great deal of 
money to invest are investing in offshore ventures in order to 
escape the taxes they would be required to pay if they chose to 
invest in Canada. An example of that is the Liberal finance 
minister, a classic case of a Canadian evading taxes by registering 
his company's vessels offshore.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	Canadian Press reports the Liberal minister's steamship 
company, held in blind trust, has six ships registered in tax free 
havens. One of these ships was built in 1982 with the help of a 9 per 
cent federal government subsidy. The president of the B.C. 
Federation of Labour says that this is ``precisely what is wrong 
with the tax system. If the people started paying the taxes already 
in place, we would not have a deficit problem''.
<P>
	The Liberal finance minister, by registering his ships offshore, 
escapes paying Canadian taxes-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Arseneault:</B> Madam Speaker, a point of order. When 
members enter into debate they must remain on a subject. They 
must deal with the administration of government.
<P>
	The member has quite clearly pointed out in his speech that what 
he is discussing is in a blind trust. It has nothing to do with this 
government. He should get back on to the subject. His constituents 
would appreciate that. The Speaker has already ruled on that 
matter.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Resuming 
debate. The hon. member has one minute left.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hart:</B> Madam Speaker, I appreciate that. The point is that 
the finance minister's company made $10.2 million profit in 1989 
and $12 million in 1990. All Canadians would agree that there were 
millions of dollars in taxes that ought to have been paid here on a 
profit of over $20 million.
<P>
	With that, I will conclude because I want to be sure that today's 
time was spent on delivering the response of the people of 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt to the Liberal's budget without 
being overly critical of the Liberal Party of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I was 
very concerned about the attacks on the Minister of Finance. It is 
just more of the same from the Reform Party.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1525"> 1525 </A></B>
<P>
	As I understand it, the company of the Minister of Finance has 
17 out of 21 vessels registered under  Canadian ownership. The 
company pays taxes. The minister made that statement in the 
House. It is unfortunate that the Reform Party refuses to take that 
into consideration. The lack of acknowledgement of facts is not 
peculiar to this issue. It is common in the Reform Party.
<P>
	The member said that no jobs are being created in the country. It 
would appear that from the time Reform members were elected in 
1993, they stopped reading, they stopped understanding and they 
stopped looking at Statistics Canada.
<P>
	We know that over 500,000 new jobs have been created in 
Canada. Why speaker after speaker gets up and says: ``Jobs, jobs, 
jobs. You never create any jobs'' is beyond me. Can I send you 
some Statistics Canada productions? The last quarter has had a 
major net increase in job creation as well. This seems to be the 
rewriting of history which is common in the Reform Party.
<P>
	He also talked about when the House was down, he was out 
running around the country and how the rest of the members in this 
House were doing nothing. I find that an insult, quite frankly. I was 
conducting town hall meetings and talking about the Canada 
pension plan with my constituents. We were looking for real 
solutions to real problems.
<P>
	He talked about the concerns of people in his riding in paying 
their mortgages. He could have gone on to say that through the 
mandate of the government, real interest rates have declined 
significantly. Those mortgage payments are a lot easier to pay 
today than they were in 1993.
<P>
	I would like to mention two items that are of interest to me, 
credit cards and the RRSP component being 20 per cent foreign 
mandated and perhaps it should be more than that.
<P>
	Do members imagine that taxpayers should subsidize people to 
invest in other countries? I would have thought they would have 
been arguing the reverse, that we should reduce the 20 per cent 
foreign component of RRSPs to encourage more investment in 
Canada and to encourage small and medium business formation. 
However, not the Reform Party. The Reform Party seems to think it 
is quite fine to have that investment capital flow outside of our 
border to be invested in the United States. It would create jobs 
down there I suppose.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	The member mentioned credit cards. One thing that concerns me 
is the growth of consumer credit in Canada. We know that 93 per 
cent of disposable income is now paid toward debt repayments for 
the average individual, which does not include taxes. It is being 
paid to banks, to financial institutions, et cetera.
<P>
	Would members of the Reform Party agree that is an alarming 
level of credit, that we need to curtail credit spending by individu-
<P>
als and possibly the extent of credit financing by some of our 
financial institutions?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hart:</B> Madam Speaker, on the question on foreign 
investment, my point was quite clearly that this is what Canadians 
are saying. They are trying to find ways to get more than the 20 per 
cent. I am not suggesting they should. I am saying it is the 
government's responsibility to somehow turn that perception that 
the better investment is a foreign investment.
<P>
	I think Canadians want to feel the best investment is right here in 
Canada. The hon. member is trying to twist, as the Liberals in the 
House so many times do.
<P>
	I will answer the hon. member's many other questions. The 
answers are no, no, no, no and no.
<P>
	Let us consider some other issues such as what the Liberals 
could have done and what they did not do. The hon. member sits 
there smugly while in the budget the Liberal government has 
attacked the seniors in my riding and seniors across the country 
with a tax grab on seniors, while the members opposite sit there and 
smugly hold on to their own MP pension plans.
<P>
	Take a look at what the Liberals did promise. The Liberals made 
a promise during the Quebec referendum and into the run-up to the 
budget. The Prime Minister repeatedly assured Canadian seniors 
their retirement incomes were safe. In a supplementary document 
entitled ``The Seniors Benefit: Securing the Future'' the 
government restated these claims-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Sorry, your 
time has run out.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to address the House on the the 
1996-97 budget.
<P>
	The problems associated with federal overspending is what 
brought me and many of my Reform colleagues into politics in the 
first place. We recognized that the ballooning federal debt was to 
endanger the livelihood of most Canadians. If something was not 
done quickly it would endanger the programs delivered to 
Canadians who need them the most.
<P>
	Canadians threw out the Conservatives in the 1993 election 
because they were fed up with the high spending legacy of the 
Mulroney Progressive Conservatives and because they were deeply 
concerned about our debt problems.
<P>
	Imagine my surprise when travelling through Dallas last week. I 
picked up a copy of the Dallas-Fort Worth newspaper and I read 
that the Right Hon. Brian Mulroney was to be giving a keynote 
address in Fort Worth.
<P>
	The introduction in the newspaper suggested the Right Hon. 
Brian Mulroney, former Prime Minister of Canada, will present the 
keynote address to Tarrant Export 40 awards. It went on to say
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1526"> 1526 </A></B>
<P>
that Mulroney was a decisive Prime Minister credited with 
correcting his nation's disastrous economic course.
<P>
	Imagine taking credit for something, the exact opposite of which 
he did, when he had the chance as Prime Minister. It seems that is 
why there is so much disillusionment with politics in this country.
<P>
<B>(1220 )</B>
<P>
	Brian Mulroney and the Conservatives were elected in 1984 to 
clean up the mess that was left by the Liberals who had created 
some $200 billion of national debt. What did he do when he had his 
opportunity? He doubled that amount. Taxpayers were much worse 
off after the Mulroney legacy and not vice versa, as he would 
claim.
<P>
	I am convinced that if it had not been for the presence of a 
number of new members in the House, Reform members and some 
Liberal backbenchers who were elected in the 1993 election, the 
finances of the country would even be worse than they are today.
<P>
	We have had some cuts. I think we can take credit for that, those 
of us who came here in 1993. We were a breath of fresh air in 
Parliament.
<P>
	I know that cuts hurt. My riding of Peace River has made quite a 
few sacrifices in order to reduce federal government spending. 
However, as painful as these cuts have been, it is tragic that 
absolutely nothing has been accomplished through them. The cost 
of servicing the federal debt has grown. We have had a lot of pain 
but we have not had the gain to go along with it.
<P>
	As part of federal cost cutting measures in last year's budget 
there were a number of things cut back in the riding of Peace River. 
The weather service was cut. Twenty-one jobs at the Beaver Lodge 
agriculture research station were cut. Air traffic control jobs were 
lost in the city of Grande Prairie. We lost jobs and services. 
However, I think Canadians are prepared to make those sacrifices.
<P>
	There was a real human cost. Nothing can make up for those 
personal sacrifices made by the people in my riding, but it would 
have been nice to know that at least the cuts were worth it, that their 
loss and the loss of people like them had made a real difference in 
turning the country around. All that happened was the debt grew 
and the cost of servicing the debt also grew.
<P>
	Cuts in last year's budget amounted to $4 billion. That is exactly 
the amount the national interest on the debt increased by. It was all 
lost to increased interest on the debt.
<P>
	Not only is Canada threatened by members of the Bloc who want 
to take Quebec out of Canada, the country is also threatened by the 
Liberal government. It is not being responsible in getting our 
finances in order. It is putting the country at risk.
<P>
	If we look at a pie chart of the budget, the biggest part of the pie 
would go not to the poor, not to funding for our health care system, 
not to maintaining our educational institutions; it would go to the 
increasing cost of servicing our national debt. That is absolutely 
shameful.
<P>
	Before the government came into power we were spending $38 
billion a year on interest payments to service the debt. That has 
grown to $42 billion in the past year and under the 1996-97 budget 
it will rise to $48 billion. There has been a $10 billion increase in 
the interest on the debt during the three years the Liberal 
government has been in power. That is tragic.
<P>
	I believe the picture could have been entirely different. There is 
an awareness in the country that the deficit and the debt must be 
tackled. I think the public is far ahead of the government on this 
issue. The deficit and the debt must be tackled quickly and 
decisively. Half measures will not do because increasing debt 
servicing will simply eat up the cuts that are being made.
<P>
	Provincial governments have received the message. Provincial 
governments across the land have taken the fiscal problem 
seriously. They have set firm targets and dates for eliminating their 
deficits; not reducing them, eliminating them.
<P>
	The federal government is now the only government in the 
country which has not set deficit elimination targets. The 
government talks about rolling targets from year to year. What is 
the date the government will have a balanced budget?
<P>
	Without a goal and a target date the people of Canada who are 
bearing the brunt of the cuts cannot hope that the government will 
get to where it is supposed to be going.
<P>
	I would like to speak about my home province of Alberta. The 
government there is trying through a survey to decide what to do 
with this year's budget surplus. That is something we have not 
heard much of for a long time at the federal government level. The 
Government of Alberta is trying to decide whether to cut taxes or 
pay down the debt. Soon provincial governments all over Canada 
will be in the same position.
<P>
	Not the federal government. Instead it has offloaded its problems 
to the provinces by reducing block funding for health care, welfare 
and advanced education. In effect it is asking the provinces to do its 
dirty work for it.
<P>
	What is the situation in Alberta? As I said, this year we have a 
budget surplus. We have growth in the economy. We have the 
lowest unemployment rate than any other place in the country and 
we are starting to pay down our provincial debt. This province has 
made a difference. B.C. and Saskatchewan are currently on the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1527"> 1527 </A></B>
<P>
same track  and all provinces have recognized that is the road we 
have to take. Not only do we have to start reducing deficits and get 
to a balanced budget, we have to start paying down our national 
debt.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	This is not the first time Canada has found itself under a 
staggering debt. Right after the second world war Canada had a 
debt larger in relation to our GDP than we have now, but there were 
special circumstances. That debt had been incurred because of the 
great depression of the 1930s and to finance the war effort. It took 
the Canadian people with their shoulders to the wheel 25 years, a 
lot of hard work and a lot of will, to pay off that debt.
<P>
	We know this did not last very long, however, because the 
Liberals came to power and especially under Prime Minister 
Trudeau started another spending spree and the spiral started all 
over again. By the end of the Trudeau era we had built it up to $200 
billion again. Unfortunately the current Liberal government is still 
adding to our debt.
<P>
	On March 6 the finance minister tabled his third budget. Like his 
other budgets, it did nothing to address the problem of the debt 
which now stands at $578 billion. To service this debt Canadians 
will have to pay almost $40 billion in interest payments this fiscal 
year.
<P>
	That sounds like a big number but I would like to put it into 
perspective. Fifty billion dollars translates into $4.2 billion each 
month which translates to $137 million a day in interest payments. 
The average Canadian taxpayer pays $3,700 a year just to cover the 
interest on debts. Taken as an average of their monthly cheques, it 
amounts to $309 million a year.
<P>
	The third budget of the finance minister is no better than the 
others. It brings us the pain but no gain. We need balanced budget 
legislation. We need a firm date. It will happen only when in all 
corners of Canada where Canadians have made sacrifices they 
come to some kind of fruition through a government committed to 
a balanced budget and to pay down the national debt. It has to 
happen.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (St. Catharines, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened intently to the hon. member for Peace River and I 
appreciate some of his comments and the work he has done in his 
riding.
<P>
	On a number of the issues I am not sure it was very clear whether 
he understood that for every $7 of expenditure reduction there was 
only $1 of tax balancing out that went into the budget. I am not sure 
whether he appreciated that expenditures had been cut over time 
and that working on the deficit is a prime concern and then working 
on the debt.
<P>
	As he mentioned, a number of people were affected in his riding 
with the cuts. That is part of the expenditure cuts by the
<P>
government. Is it his view that the cuts should have been harder on 
the people or that we are going in the right direction and we have to 
take care of the deficit before there is any impact on the debt?
<P>
	By having this planned approach allows people to adjust. I am 
concerned by the hon. member's remarks of cutting more. Does 
that give people and businesses enough time to adjust?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Penson:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the member for St. 
Catharines. I think we agree on a number of areas. I give credit to 
the government and the finance minister for tackling the deficit 
problem.
<P>
	However, where I have difficulty is I do not believe they are 
going quickly enough to get to a balanced budget. That is the point 
I would have in debate with my hon. friend from St. Catharines.
<P>
	We have to look at two experiences of where governments 
actually moved to balanced budgets and see what the consequences 
of those were, in Alberta and in New Zealand.
<P>
	My home province of Alberta has tackled the balanced budget 
initiative in three years. In fact, it came out ahead of schedule and 
we are now starting to get the reward and the province of Alberta is 
beginning to pay down its provincial debt.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	What happened during that time? How tough was the hardship? 
We heard a lot of concerns. I know that Ontario has similar 
concerns right now. If we ask the average person on the street what 
difference they felt and how severe was it three years afterward in 
terms of the cutbacks to their personal lifestyle or their operation in 
business, with the exception of health care in Alberta, most people 
hardly noticed it was taking place. In fact, many people felt it was 
long overdue.
<P>
	There was a consolidation of school boards. For example, school 
boards which had been put in place in the 1930s during the horse 
and buggy era now were no longer needed with modern 
transportation and communication. One school board was 
consolidated from three or four and in fact was even more effective 
because it had a little more buying power.
<P>
	We need to work quickly. We need some reward at the end. There 
needs to be a light at the end of the tunnel. By continuing to drag 
our feet on this we are feeling the pain because we are making all of 
these sacrifices to increase debt servicing.
<P>
	The example I used was that $4 billion in spending cuts last year, 
which I compliment the government for but I believe should have 
been more drastic, were just eaten up by the increased interest on 
the debt.
<P>
	If anyone is under the illusion of how severe this is, think in 
terms of the size of the interest on the debt and how quickly it is 
growing as a proportion of our budget.  We should be alarmed by 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1528"> 1528 </A></B>
<P>
that increase because it is threatening very important social 
services such as health care and old age security.
<P>
	The hon. member has asked if we need more time to adjust. My 
assessment would be no. The Prime Minister of New Zealand 
during the time of the crash in 1982 advised to go as quickly as 
possible, because the faster we get there the quicker the rewards 
take place and then small business will be able to create jobs as 
confidence in the economy grows again.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guy H. Arseneault (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, please note that I intend to share my time with the 
hon. member for St. Catherines.
<P>
	I am very pleased to rise today to speak to the 1996 budget. I 
would first like to congratulate the Minister of Finance. This 
budget and those tabled by the minister in recent years have always 
met and often exceeded the government's financial objectives.
<P>
	The finance minister's budgets work together to help the people 
of Canada protect their future. To that end, the government has 
focused its efforts on four primary objectives: maintaining social 
programs for future generations, ensuring our financial future, 
rethinking the role of government, and investing in our future.
<P>
	Although numerous measures will be necessary in each of these 
areas, today I want to concentrate on those I see as the most 
important.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	One area I am concerned about in the federal government is in 
securing our social programs for the next century. I know this is a 
large area to look into in my short 10 minutes but I want to 
concentrate today on the employment insurance program and go 
back a bit to when it was first presented in December.
<P>
	At that time a number of problems were identified. Even before 
those problems were identified, the minister in his presentation of 
that proposed employment insurance bill indicated to the House 
that he was willing to make changes that would be equitable, 
changes that would be based on common sense. From that time on 
the Liberal caucus and members of the Atlantic caucus especially 
have indicated to the minister a number of changes which have to 
be made.
<P>
<B>(1235 )</B>
<P>
	There is no doubt that the status quo is unacceptable. In my 
riding constituents have come to see me over the years. They 
indicated that the unemployment insurance program was not 
adequate and it had to be updated and modernized. They indicated 
where the problems were.
<P>
	I know from personal experience when dealing with a layoff at 
the Atholville mill and the Dalhousie mill that every time we 
wanted to have some flexibility in the program we were told it was 
impossible because the Unemployment Insurance Act did not 
permit us to do this or that.
<P>
	I am very pleased to see the government has decided to 
modernize the UI program. I am also very pleased to see the 
government has agreed to make changes. The minister from 
Acadie-Bathurst has decided to listen to the committee. I hope the 
committee will come up with some good amendments.
<P>
	I congratulate the members for Fredericton-York-Sunbury, 
Halifax West, and Etobicoke-Lakeshore for the positive 
amendments they have put forth in that committee so far. Our 
commitment and amendments should help clarify the intensity rule 
by making it more equitable, especially for low income families, as 
you are so much in tune, Madam Speaker, with regard to alleviating 
their status at the present moment.
<P>
	I should also point out another amendment that will be made 
with regard to the divisor rule. The hon. member for Halifax West 
has already indicated that he is ready to look at the divisor rule and 
to link it to the UI rate rather than the flat 20 weeks. That should 
again alleviate some of the problems that have been put forth or 
identified in the present bill.
<P>
	The other thing that should be pointed out is the tremendous job 
the hon. member for Fredericton-York-Sunbury has done on this 
dossier altogether on his amendment with regard to the going back 
26 weeks for UI eligibility and the counting of hours.
<P>
	In all of this debate some of the positive things in the bill have 
been put aside and not emphasized enough. The area of counting of 
hours for qualifying rather than weeks is going to be positive. It 
will allow people to qualify sooner. It will allow them to qualify for 
longer periods. It would also be a way of guaranteeing that all 
hours count.
<P>
	The other thing that is important on the other side is the 
flexibility it will give to the programs. I should mention here the 
transition fund which will go to high unemployment areas. The 
government has identified $300 million which will go into that 
fund and the investment fund, the permanent programs, the $800 
million which will be put forth to help create more work.
<P>
	We realize that the changes are not perfect but what I want to 
emphasize again is that the government has always been listening 
and has reacted to the concerns that have been brought up by 
members of Parliament and especially members of Parliament 
from the Atlantic region.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1529"> 1529 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The 1994-95 budget measures will help us achieve our deficit 
reduction objectives for 1995-96 and 1996-97, namely 3 per cent of 
GDP. The 1996 budget guarantees that the government deficit will 
go down to 2 per cent of GDP in 1997-98. The deficit will have 
fallen from $42 billion in 1993-94 to $17 billion in 1997-98.
<P>
	There is no increase in personal or corporate income tax or 
excise taxes in this budget. Finally, there have been no personal 
income tax hikes in the last three budgets.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is very important to underline the fact of no new taxes because 
that is what the people have asked us to do. That is what we have 
heard in our ridings and in the meetings we have had with 
constituents, from letters and phone calls we have received. People 
did not want to have an increase in their taxes. The government has 
responded in a positive way.
<P>
	The priority area the government has seen fit to work on is 
getting government right. In this case the budget takes continuing 
action in reducing waste and inefficiency and in redefining and 
redesigning the government's programs and activities. Program 
review, phase one, phase two, it is ongoing. The government has 
indicated publicly that it will continue that program review to make 
government more efficient and to cut out a lot of the duplication 
that exists.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	Working at delivering better quality services at lower costs to the 
taxpayer is what we want. Government must not only spend less, it 
must spend more wisely. An example of that is in my own 
Department of Canadian Heritage where a Parks Canada agency 
will be set up as a form of alternate delivery of services. In that 
case the agency will continue to report to the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage but it will allow for the services and the flexibility to be 
provided in each individual park. It will allow local parks to adjust 
their mandate to the local situation and to do that in a fashion that is 
speedier and more efficient.
<P>
	Our government has been providing the economic and social 
environment that will encourage the economic growth that makes 
new jobs possible. The government has worked at keeping inflation 
down which results in lower interest rates.
<P>
	The government has also recognized that youth are our greatest 
natural resource and the key to our future. Since our election a 
number of programs for youth have been implemented, such as 
youth services Canada, youth internship Canada and the student 
summer job action program. In this budget the government 
continues to build upon the measures taken for youth in the 
previous budgets. We have provided for on the job training through 
the reallocation of $315 million over three years  to help create 
youth employment opportunities. The budget also doubles the 
government's commitment to the summer career placement 
program.
<P>
	With regard to Canadian heritage the minister has announced 
renewed funding for Radio-Canada International which was again a 
request from Canadians, again a sign that we have listened to 
Canadians. They told us that it was an important feature of our 
culture, that it was an important feature for Canadians. We have 
reinstituted that funding to allow it to continue for another year. 
The minister is now searching for new ways of funding that 
service.
<P>
	I should also point out that the minister has indicated to this 
House and publicly that a special culture fund is being set up to 
assist our cultural industries. That should be in place very shortly. 
The details will be announced publicly whenever they are ready.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I want to thank the Speaker for letting me speak this morning. I 
hope the hon. members opposite will applaud the Minister of 
Finance for bringing down a budget that will really benefit this 
country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
love to congratulate the Minister of Finance for his supposedly 
excellent budget, as claimed by the hon. member for 
Restigouche-Chaleur. However, I find it difficult to do so, 
because I did not see anything very original in this budget.
<P>
	Given that the tax burden continues to increase, that the deficit 
remains enormous, and that the debt continues to grow, does the 
hon. member agree that the government should go after the workers 
and the unemployed, particularly in New Brunswick, to collect 
more money? The budget provides that an extra $5 billion will be 
generated through higher contributions and fewer weeks of 
unemployment insurance benefit entitlement for the unemployed.
<P>
	At the same time, the government is reducing transfer payments 
to the provinces to the tune of $3.5 billion per year. The extra 
money collected from the unemployed and the reduced amounts 
paid to the provinces total about $8.5 billion per year. This is more 
or less the amount by which the deficit will decrease in the coming 
year. This budget is not about innovating.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	It makes the same old mistakes. Moreover, it increases the 
burden of the poor and of the most vulnerable members of our 
society, including the unemployed, while making them pay so 
much in unemployment insurance contributions, and making small 
and medium size businesses, particularly in Quebec and in New 
Brunswick, pay so much more.
<P>
	I really wonder how the hon. member can congratulate the 
Minister of Finance.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1530"> 1530 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Arseneault:</B> Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleague 
for his question. I would like to point out to him that the 
government has two priorities: to put our financial house in order 
and to create jobs.
<P>
	To answer the question put by my colleague about our financial 
future, I would say that if he had reviewed the figures in the budget, 
and I will repeat them because I mentioned them in my speech, he 
would have obviously noted that the deficit for 1995-96 will 
decrease to 3 per cent of the gross domestic product and that it will 
continue to fall. By 1997-98, the deficit will have dropped to 2 per 
cent and it will continue to diminish until it gets to 0 per cent.
<P>
	In 1993, the deficit reached $42 billion. By 1997-98, it will have 
come down to $17 billion. So, it is widely recognized throughout 
the country that the Minister of Finance is acting responsibly and 
putting our financial house in order. We are making progress. The 
figures we have here go to prove it.
<P>
	In terms of job creation, I think the minister has identified new 
initiatives with one priority in mind, our youth. It is one of our 
priorities, our future, the future of our country. In my view, this is 
our most important natural resource. It is very important that it be 
identified as one of our priorities. It is the first time that a federal 
government has made a priority of this very important issue.
<P>
	The hon. member made some comments about the 
unemployment insurance program, based, I think, on the act itself, 
which we are currently amending to help solve the problem he 
mentioned.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (St. Catharines, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to thank the member for Restigouche-Chaleur for 
splitting his time.
<P>
	Today we are debating the 1996-97 budget. I am pleased to have 
the opportunity to represent the city of St. Catharines in this debate. 
I want to focus my comments on creating jobs because that is what 
the budget is all about, creating the atmosphere and positive 
attitude for businesses to create jobs.
<P>
	During the election in 1993, unemployment in St. Catharines and 
Niagara was around 15 per cent. Last year, it was below the 
national average of 9.1 per cent, still too high but moving in a 
positive direction. It is not due to government handouts. It is due to 
the open process for budget review, cutting red tape, working with 
small businesses, working with people, working with communities. 
By working together we have obtained economic stability, growth 
and deficit reduction.
<P>
	The government ran on a platform of creating opportunity. 
Liberals believe that a federal government must work with 
Canadian business to provide the proper supports and to create a 
positive climate for economic  growth. That is what I endeavour to 
do in my riding. I meet with local business people in St. Catharines 
every week to try to find out how their businesses are doing, what 
they need to succeed and how government can work to help and not 
hinder business growth.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	I was telling the House a couple of weeks ago about a company 
in my riding, Lincoln Fabrics, which has the ISO 9002 standard. 
This company is the first fabric supplier of this type in North 
America to achieve this high level of quality manufacturing and 
management. I am going to make sure that people, governments 
and businesses know about this achievement because it is 
companies like Lincoln Fabrics that set the industry standard. It is 
companies like Lincoln Fabrics that create jobs.
<P>
	I met recently with two companies which make wood products. 
These companies are going to work with the EDC to sell 100 per 
cent of their manufactured wood products to Germany. This is a 
very important step for these companies and is an example of how 
governments can create the opportunity for jobs within businesses 
without throwing money at them, instead working with them. 
These businesses need information, they need contacts, they need 
people who can open doors. With this help they can expand and 
create jobs.
<P>
	I have worked with a business from the greater Toronto area. It 
was going to move to the United States because of the duty hit it 
was taking on imported goods and the requirement of up front 
money, excess paperwork and administration. The government 
passed Bill C-102 which provides for duty deferral and a free trade 
zone system. Now that business is staying in Canada, keeping 
Canadians employed.
<P>
	Bill C-102 is important for a lot of companies. In St. Catharines 
we compete directly with U.S. businesses across the border. They 
had a major advantage over Canadian companies because of their 
free trade zones. We have changed that. A group of St. Catharines' 
companies worked with me and with the finance department to 
make sure the new legislation was effective and useful for 
businesses.
<P>
	Local companies in St. Catharines are also looking forward to 
benefiting from the government's Canada community investment 
program or CCIP. Communities and businesses outside major 
urban areas like Toronto, Halifax, Montreal, Vancouver, Edmonton 
and Calgary need help. Areas like mine have smaller populations 
with fewer businesses but they have very active business potential 
which needs the assistance of the Canada community investment 
plan announced in the budget.
<P>
	I believe many local projects which could have created jobs have 
been lost because of lack of financing, venture capital and a 
co-ordinated community investment fund. For example, did 
members know that the inventor of the  plastic hockey stick is from 
my area? What they may not know is that he could not obtain 
funding in Canada so he had to go to the U.S., which meant jobs in 
the U.S. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1531"> 1531 </A></B>
<P>
How about the inventor of no-lead shotgun shells, John E. Brown, 
who was forced to go to the U.S. for funding, and we lost more 
jobs?
<P>
	We must continue to find solutions to help Canadian inventors 
and entrepreneurs find risk and venture capital from Canadian 
sources. New programs like CCIP can help to create jobs. I have 
just outlined how government policies and programs through 
finance and industry have already benefited and will continue to 
benefit businesses in my area and areas across Canada.
<P>
	The budget announced last month will continue to help business. 
It helps because it continues the path of fiscal accountability and 
stability. It helps because the bottom line is that the deficit must be 
brought under control in order to improve the Canadian economy 
and we are doing exactly that.
<P>
	Canadians will not see a drastic slash and burn approach by this 
government. They will see an aggressive loyalty to bringing our 
fiscal house back in order. It took many years to create the deficit 
and it will take a few years to get in line.
<P>
	In 1993 the deficit run up by the last government was $42 billion 
or 5.9 per cent of GDP. This year the target is $24 billion, which 
means the government will have met its target of 3 per cent of GDP. 
Meeting targets is very important. Next year with a deficit of $17 
billion for 1997, the debt to GDP ratio will be down to 2 per cent. 
This will put us in a position where the economy can finally grow 
faster than the debt.
<P>
<B>(1255 )</B>
<P>
	As the finance minister said on budget day, it sets the stage for 
the first meaningful decline in the debt to GDP ratio since 1974-75. 
It sets the direction for meeting targets, building confidence and 
allowing people and business to make their home and business 
plans and build a better future for Canada and Canadians.
<P>
	As I have just outlined, first and foremost government is putting 
its fiscal house in order. That is an important initiative the 
government can take to ensure the economic future of our country.
<P>
	Action is being taken to directly foster job creation and growth 
in several ways. This year's budget reallocates $270 million to 
encourage technology and innovation over the next three years. 
This includes programs like Technology Partnership Canada and 
expanding the SchoolNet program introduced in 1994. Every 
member in the House should be working with their schools to 
promote SchoolNet in their area. It is an investment in young 
people.
<P>
	When talking about unemployment, the focus must be on youth. 
Not just because they are the future of our  economic success, but 
because young people have a much higher rate of unemployment 
than the overall population. In many cases it is their first job and it 
is very important.
<P>
	The budget addresses the issues of education and improved job 
opportunities for youth. First, we have provided secure, long term 
funding for transfers to provinces which help to pay for 
post-secondary education. They asked for it and it has been given 
to them for five years, $25.1 billion. The student loan programs 
have been expanded to provide financial assistance.
<P>
	In this year's budget the government is providing an additional 
$80 million a year in tax assistance to help students and their 
families with the cost of tuition.
<P>
	Three hundred and fifty million dollars is being reallocated to 
help create jobs for young people over the next three years. This 
includes doubling the funding for student summer employment this 
year. The funds will also be used to help young people with the 
school to work transition. That can be a real barrier to getting a first 
job. This is in addition to the funding for the Youth Internship 
Canada and Youth Services Canada programs which have been 
very successful in my riding of St. Catharines.
<P>
	There are many other items I would like to touch on, including 
the information from the Canadian Export Association on what the 
government has done.
<P>
	In summary, I want to emphasize that the budget is about jobs. 
The government is working to create an economic and business 
climate so that jobs will be created, while at the same time being 
sensitive to the needs of our most important resource, people.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in this budget debate. Based on the budget 
speech, it is possible to make an overall assessment of government 
action.
<P>
	When we look at the action of this government, we are reminded 
of the old saying ``all talk, no action''. I will demonstrate this 
reality in two ways. I will compare the speech from the throne with 
the budget speech and I will also compare speeches that were made 
on Canada's foreign policy with the reality that this government is 
inflicting upon us.
<P>
	The speech from the throne tells us that the government intends 
to withdraw from a number of areas under provincial jurisdiction. 
Four or five areas are mentioned, and members will recall that, in 
Quebec alone, the cost of duplication and overlap has been 
estimated at $3 billion by the Bélanger-Campeau commission. So 
when we look at the speech from the throne, we have a tendency to 
think that the government is going in the right direction.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1532"> 1532 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	But, at the same time, what do we learn in the budget speech? 
That the government intends to establish a Canadian securities 
commission when such commissions already exist in the major 
provinces, including Quebec.
<P>
	The government says it will withdraw from the area of job 
training, but look at all the procrastination around this so-called 
withdrawal. We can see that it has really no intention of 
withdrawing from this area.
<P>
	The government is establishing a committee of tax experts, but 
the experts it appoints to this committee are all certified 
accountants that are experts in tax avoidance.
<P>
	So what are the government's real intentions when it says it 
wants to reform the Canadian tax system? We can have our doubts 
about that.
<P>
	The federal government is creating a health services research 
fund. We will now have a new area where there will be duplication 
and overlap.
<P>
	In the speech from the throne, the government says it wants to 
ensure the viability of social programs. Let us take a look now at 
what is happening in reality: $7 billion cuts in transfers to 
provinces, and let us not forget that these transfers are for major 
services such as health care, income security and post-secondary 
education, that is colleges and universities.
<P>
	It claims to be contributing to ensuring the viability of social 
programs by its unemployment insurance reform. Let us look at a 
few points here. With the UI reform, all workers start contributing 
with the first hour worked. So the little guy, the person who never 
contributed in the past, will be forced to pay into a fund, with no 
assurance at all of being able to draw anything out of it later on, of 
course.
<P>
	At the same time, maximum insurable earnings are being 
lowered. Again the little guy will be forced to contribute, while the 
ones contributing in the past on up to $42,000 will now contribute 
up to $39,000, and yet the speech still claims the intent is to ensure 
the viability of social programs.
<P>
	The government is more or less rifling $5 billion from the 
unemployment insurance fund, still for the purpose of ensuring the 
liability of social programs, of course.
<P>
	In the throne speech, the government claims to have finally 
controlled the deficit. Now, the 1996-97 increase in the debt is $24 
billion. Since this government came in, the debt has gone up by 
$110 billion and yet it is patting itself on the back, claiming to have 
gained the upper hand over the deficit.
<P>
	The government tells us in the throne speech ``we will be making 
changes to Canadian federation in order to bring it more in line 
with what Quebecers and Canadians want''. Their last invention, 
the principal homeland of French culture in North America, has 
made them the laughing stock of everyone. We have only to  look at 
the political cartoons and the newspaper editorials of the past two 
days. Everybody is making fun of it, and this is practically the only 
answer the government can come up with, since it is incapable of 
reaching a consensus within its own ranks on this question.
<P>
	The second main element I am going to address, Canada's 
foreign policy, I will look at from two points of view: aid to 
developing countries and human rights. When the Liberal Party 
was in opposition, it criticized the Conservatives for their foreign 
policy, but it is interesting to compare the priorities the 
Conservatives set for themselves in <I>Sharing Our Future</I> and the 
Liberals' in <I>Canada in the World</I>.
<P>
	The Conservatives set out their foreign policy under four 
headings: attacking poverty, helping people help themselves, 
promoting development and, finally, partnership in foreign policy, 
which was a key concept. What about the Liberal's famous foreign 
policy made public in 1995? When the document was tabled, of 
course, the Minister of Foreign Affairs spoke of the generosity and 
compassion of Canadians. While it is true of Canadians, it is not 
true of the government.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	Now let us look at the facts. The three pillars of Canadian 
foreign policy: prosperity and jobs through trade, security for 
Canadians in a stable world-God knows it is not stable-and, 
finally, exporting our cultural products and values. They even dare 
to add, ``to ensure our success in the world''.
<P>
	So the concept of generosity appears in speeches as does the 
concept of compassion, but when it comes down to really 
formulating a policy and stating it, it appears that everything is 
centred on trade relations.
<P>
	We have a very typical case to demonstrate the failure of 
Canadian foreign policy. It is the case of a resident of Sainte-Foy, 
Mr. Tran Trieu Quan, who has been a prisoner in Vietnam for over 
two years. He is a businessman who made a business transaction. 
He was simply the intermediary between an American company, 
which went through its Canadian subsidiary to deliver cotton to 
Vietnam. He was simply the go-between. There were fraudulent 
dealings in the transaction. The Government of Canada knows he is 
not responsible. Interpol in Ottawa has shown that Mr. Tran was 
himself a victim of this shady deal, the company's scapegoat, but 
the Canadian government says it cannot do a thing to help Tran 
Trieu Quan to return home.
<P>
	There are actions the government could take. Remember that the 
Prime Minister, in his first trip to the Asian Pacific, signed, among 
other things, an agreement for a co-operation project with Vietnam 
worth $36 million. Just as the Prime Minister of Canada was about 
to sign, he could have set his pen on the table and told his 
Vietnamese counterpart: ``I would be very happy to sign this 
co-operation agreement but there is a little problem. A Canadian 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1533"> 1533 </A></B>
<P>
citizen has been a prisoner in your country for a number of months. 
Until Mr. Tran Trieu Quan is released, no trade agreement can be 
signed''.
<P>
	As you may also recall, the Canadian government helped 
Vietnam eliminate its debt to the International Monetary Fund. The 
IDRC has projects in Vietnam. The former Minister of Foreign 
Affairs increased financial aid to Vietnam by $20 million.
<P>
	The April 13 edition of <I>Le Journal des affaires</I> reports that CIDA 
has just awarded a $7 million contract to Stikeman Elliott and 
Experco Limited, companies based in Montreal and 
Drummondville. Although this government continues to give 
millions of dollars to Vietnam, it is unable to take whatever actions 
are necessary to ensure Mr. Tran Trieu Quan's release.
<P>
	This shows the very wide gap between what the government says 
and what it can or cannot do.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for his presentation here today. 
By and large as we are both members of the opposition, our job is 
to keep the government's feet to the fire.
<P>
	I have travelled a fair amount in Quebec in recent days and I 
think that we have a particularly serious problem in our country. As 
the economy of Ontario or Quebec deteriorates it pulls everybody 
else down because they are so dominant in the country. Even with 
the most cursory glance we can see the dynamism that has existed 
in Toronto and we can compare that to Montreal which at one time 
was Canada's premier city, the premier city in North America.
<P>
<B>(1310 )</B>
<P>
	When we go to Montreal today, it is with the feeling of unease 
when we see what has happened in Montreal over the last few 
years. An illustration of this is taken from the magazine <I>L'Actualité</I> 
in November 1995. In 1980 before the separatists really started to 
ruin the economy in Quebec and hurt the economy in the rest of the 
country, the residential vacancy rate in Montreal was 3.4 per cent. 
It is now 6.8 per cent. The business vacancy rate was 3.3 per cent 
and it is now 19.7 per cent. The public debt in Quebec in 1980 was 
20.3 per cent of gross provincial product. Today it is 40.9 per cent.
<P>
	To put this into context, the cost of servicing the debt that the 
country has is $47 billion, more than all of the social spending put 
together. Many Canadians define themselves by our social 
spending and perhaps even more so in the province of Quebec. Yet 
the ability to continue to spend on the very programs by which 
Canadians define themselves is threatened by the enormity of the 
debt and the cost of servicing the debt, which this year is $47 
billion.
<P>
	It is interesting to note that the former leader of the opposition 
on becoming the premier of Quebec has changed his spots once 
again. He has now put fiscal responsibility as the number one 
priority of Quebec rather than separation.
<P>
	There are examples, evidence and proof that this incessant drive 
for the separation of Quebec is costing all of Canada, but by far it is 
costing Quebec and the citizens of Quebec far more than it is 
costing the rest of the country. It is very hurtful to the economy and 
to the people of Quebec. Would the member consider that perhaps 
this is an appropriate time to continue to work within the federation 
to evolve a new relationship for all provinces and particularly the 
province of Quebec but to do so within Confederation where we 
will all end up being winners rather than trying to make winners 
and losers?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paré:</B> Madam Speaker, if we could erase the last 130 years 
and if the hon. member for Edmonton Southwest were to ask his 
question, we would probably say: ``Yes, he is probably right''. We 
could experiment and try to see if Canada, with its 
English-speaking majority, and Quebec, with its French-speaking 
majority, can live in harmony at the economic, social and other 
levels.
<P>
	The reality is that history cannot be erased. For a great many 
years, Quebecers have felt constrained in this country. Their 
English-Canadian partners have never been as open to them as they 
would have liked. So much so that Canada is even unable to accept 
the concept of distinct society, to recognize that Quebec and 
Quebecers are different. They tried to sell this reality by using 
another phrase: ``principal homeland''.
<P>
	If Canada cannot accept Quebec as a distinct society, how can 
Quebecers trust the federal government to ensure their survival, 
their social, economic and cultural development?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am very 
pleased to rise in this House today to share some information for 
the benefit of the people of Quebec and the rest of Canada.
<P>
	I would like to take a brief look back to find where the problems 
we are currently experiencing stem from. Where do our financial, 
social and economic development problems come from?
<P>
	First of all, let me say that these problems can be traced back to 
the early 1970s and the Liberal federal government we had then. 
Let me explain.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	In 1970, the Liberal government, here, in Ottawa, was running 
budget surpluses of approximately $247 million. Between 1970 
and 1984, the average annual deficit was $17 billion. Starting in 
1970, 1972, 1973, the federal  government decided to centralize 
more powers here, in Ottawa, and to develop national standards for 
health and education in particular, business subsidy programs and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1534"> 1534 </A></B>
<P>
loosely regulated procurement policies. The federal government 
was determined to become the grand centralizing master of 
Canada. That is where the problem stems from.
<P>
	I am for free health care, for free education as much as possible, 
and for research and development subsidization. But at the same 
time, we must be honest and warn the public that all this will cost, 
that it has a price tag, that they will have to pay for all this.
<P>
	That, however, is not the course the federal government took at 
the time, choosing to make the whole range of services available 
without increasing taxes. What duplicity. That is when they started 
running progressively higher deficits-$2 billion, $5 billion, $10 
billion, $15 billion-up until 1984, when the deficit quoted in the 
last budget tabled by the then finance minister, Marc Lalonde, had 
reached $40 billion, while revenues were approximately $60 
billion at the time. You can imagine just how huge a deficit that 
was.
<P>
	All this because the federal government wanted to show the 
people of Canada, and Quebec in particular, that it was the 
almighty boss on whom depended the achievement of the quality of 
life we had to have and deserved as a have country.
<P>
	All these commitments have cost us a fortune. In fact, between 
1970 and 1980, so much money was injected by the government in 
the economy that it caused it to overheat, creating artificial 
economic conditions, which made the inflation rate climb by up to 
12 per cent per year. The best solution the government could find to 
curb this inflation was to let interest rates rise as high as 21 per 
cent. This caused a terrible and savage recession. That is what the 
federal government, and the Liberal government in particular, did 
between 1970 and 1984.
<P>
	Between 1984 and 1993, the Conservatives were in power. I was 
a member of that government from 1984 to 1990. Between the 
years 1970 and 1984, the Liberal government made many long 
term commitments, including long term bonds and mortgages. 
Consequently, when the Conservatives took office in 1984, it was 
very difficult for them to reduce the deficit, in spite of their 
extraordinary efforts.
<P>
	There was also a lack of political courage. The Conservatives 
continued to spend too much. During those years, there was an 
average shortfall of $4 billion per year in government programs 
and services. In other words, each year people paid $4 billion more 
than they received in services and programs. That was already an 
enormous amount.
<P>
	Yet, the debt increased by an average of $30 billion per year. 
This means that between 1984 and 1994, the deficit reached $30 
billion per year. The federal  government was still spending too 
much. It kept this overheating of the economy.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	Once again, the solution found by the government-the only one 
that it could find-was to ask the Governor of the Bank of Canada 
to increase interest rates in 1990. Of course, that was an easy 
solution which required little courage on the part of the 
government.
<P>
	Increasing interest rates results in lower growth, which in turn 
means lower inflation. However, it also triggers a recession. We 
had a terrible recession in 1981 and people had not forgotten about 
it in 1990. That recession not only reduced inflation but actually 
triggered a deflation. That has been going on since then, which 
means almost six years now. This is nonsense, really a lack of 
courage for a government to act in this way.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance has not been very inventive in his 
1996-97 budget, nor very courageous. All that he has done is to 
decide to add $5 billion a year to his revenues from the 
unemployment insurance contributions made by employees and 
employers. Five billion of the employees' and employers' money. 
This is scandalous.
<P>
	At the same time he has decided to transfer $3.5 billion less to 
the provinces. Calculating the receipts from the unemployment 
insurance fund, $5 billion, and the $3,5 billion less to the 
provinces, that gives $8.5 billion more to the government. This is 
the equivalent of what the Minister of Finance proposes in his 
budget, which is to reduce borrowing requirement from $26 billion 
to $16.8 billion.
<P>
	The amount is almost the same. Make the unemployed pay more, 
transfer less to the provinces, that makes up the difference. Not a 
very imaginative solution. Scandalous in fact.
<P>
	If the Minister of Finance had decided to transfer $3.5 billion 
less to the provinces, and at the same time had decreased the taxes 
collected from those same provinces, there would perhaps have 
been some grounds for saying that at least there was some spirit of 
decentralization, that the minister wanted to give more 
responsibility to the provinces, But no, that is not what he is doing. 
He will keep on taxing the people in the provinces in the same way, 
while at the same time cutting back on expenditures by $3.5 billion.
<P>
	In conclusion, the cause of our current difficulties is the present 
federal regime.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, as always, the hon. member delivers a reasoned and 
thoughtful paper to the Chamber.
<P>
	I would like to follow up on a question and comment to the 
earlier Bloc speaker. I suggested that regardless of our biases, 
whether we think funding for social programs should be 100 per 
cent government funded or 0 per cent government funded, the
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1535"> 1535 </A></B>
<P>
quest for the separation of Quebec has cost the country dearly over 
the last 15 years.
<P>
	Is our responsibility to the past or to the future? Is our 
responsibility to our grandparents or to our grandchildren? For 
whom should we be toiling in the Chamber?
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> Madam Speaker, on the subject of 
the cost of sovereignty, I have just mentioned that it cost the federal 
government hugely to retain its authority and to increase its powers 
in order to further centralize the government here in Ottawa. I 
explained this in my speech. I think the member for Edmonton 
Southwest failed to grasp the message I was trying to get across, 
despite its simplicity, in my view.
<P>
	In other words, huge sums were spent all over the place without 
any thought to medium and long term benefits. Accordingly, the 
federal government spent huge sums to show people, and 
particularly Quebecers, its authority and to demonstrate how they 
could not live without it.
<P>
	On the subject of the future, we are well aware that, as was 
explained during the referendum, it currently costs between $2.5 
billion and $3 billion to manage duplication. These costs were 
calculated by experts and not by the Parti Quebecois or the Bloc 
Quebecois.
<P>
	The experts are not calculating the value of the shortfall or 
inefficiency. However, it could be said that the inefficiency of this 
duplication, which is creating a lot of inconsistency in our 
programs and funding, might mean we are talking about a shortfall 
of $10 billion.
<P>
	So if everyone looked after their own business, the provinces 
would have their full responsibilities in many areas, and the federal 
government would be a sort of overseer, as was intended in 
confederation. Initially, the federal government served simply as a 
sort of co-ordinator, and the provinces were autonomous. If we 
follow this management style, we might well survive. At the 
moment, however, the government does not appear to want to 
decentralize. It is just the opposite. Each time new rules are set or 
legislation is passed or amended in this House, the aim is always to 
give more power to the federal government and less to the 
provinces.
<P>
	Clearly, it is not going to happen in a hurry, unless Quebecers 
decide once and for all to take over their responsibilities so that 
they can get out of the current economic slump.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is 
a pleasure to speak for the first time in the House. I hope I will have 
a chance next week to speak at length.
<P>
	Working in business in Canada we hear interest rates have been 
reduced to a level at which the spread between interest rates in 
Canada and in the United States has moved to a favourable 
position. Interest rates in Canada are now lower than in the United 
States, which is creating a huge potential for investment in Canada 
and in the province of Quebec.
<P>
	I will echo to some extent the comments of the member for 
Edmonton Southwest. The difficulty we have is that investment 
capital is coming into Canada but with the instability of Quebec we 
see businesses leaving Montreal, we see more people leaving 
Quebec. As a person born and raised in Montreal, I think that is 
tragic.
<P>
	We have an opportunity to attract capital into Canada for the 
well-being of Quebecers and Canadians.
<P>
	Contrary to what the member for Longueuil said, the budget 
dealt with innovation in a very large way. I will try to capitalize on 
that opportunity in my riding which has a large innovative sector. I 
know we can produce some good results. I ask the hon. member to 
consider that for the province of Quebec and his riding as well.
<P>
	The member talked about transfer payments. In this budget the 
transfer payments were reduced but the provinces were warned 
many years ago. The transfer payments were reduced in the order 
of 3 per cent to 4 per cent at a time when we were cutting the 
machinery of government by 8 per cent or 9 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	When is the member's party going to recognize that the 
prosperity of Quebecers is tied to keeping Quebec in Canada and 
getting investment in the country?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> First of all, Madam Speaker, I 
must congratulate the new member on his election to this House.
<P>
	Now, to answer his question, I should say that, as far as we are 
concerned, the political context does not really hinder economic 
development all that much. We sincerely believe that it is the poor 
management of the federal system and the enormous debt that the 
federalists have accumulated that hurt the economy.
<P>
	As for interest rates, they are quite low these days, but they are 
still too high when considered in relation to inflation. The 
difference between the rate of inflation and interest rates is still 
well over three percentage points.
<P>
	At present, interest rates should be around 5 per cent. The 
difference should never exceed 3 per cent. It is a yardstick that 
must be applied. If we compare interest rates to the rate of 
inflation, it is clear that interest rates are still higher than they 
should be in relation to inflation.
<P>

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex-Windsor, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
will be sharing my time today with the member for 
Brome-Missisquoi. I rise today to speak in the 1996 budget 
debate.
<P>
	The Canadian dream that built Canada on principles of sharing, 
caring, fairness and compassion is alive in this budget. The course 
charted by the Minister of Finance and the Prime Minister is the 
correct one for Canada, for us, for now and for the future. This 
budget sets the stage to lead Canada throughout the 21st century.
<P>
	We as Canadians must remind ourselves of the greatness of the 
Canadian experiment and return our energies to the endeavours 
which reflect our collective values. The foundation on which we 
achieved success in the past and will continue to succeed in the 
future is our ability to understand, to compromise and to change. 
As a government and as a country we must rethink the role of 
government.
<P>
	From this budget we will guarantee the future of our social 
programs, restore the trust in the old age security system by 
providing long term sustainability and guarantee the security and 
stability of federal support for health care, post-secondary 
education and welfare. We will also invest in the future by 
reallocating funds to make new investments, provide help for 
young people and support technology and international trade. 
These are the essential areas for job creation and future growth. We 
will take the necessary measures to redefine the role of government 
in the context of a modern federation economy.
<P>
	My riding, the ethnically diverse riding of Essex-Windsor, 
consists of more than 70 different groups and reflects the shared 
values of Canadians. Pluralism and multiculturalism, the fact that 
we can be different and yet all be Canadians, these are the 
fundamental characteristics of my riding of Essex-Windsor and 
of Canada.
<P>
	My constituents have participated actively in prebudget 
consultations for the past two years. I am pleased to say the 
Minister of Finance has listened once again. My constituents asked 
for no new taxes and there are none. As well, the warden for the 
county of Essex for 1995, Mr. Lyle Miller, expressed his concern 
over the replacement of the Canada assistance plan. This budget 
alleviates that concern.
<P>
	The federal government's objectives of the Canada health and 
social transfer are to safeguard medicare and social programs, to 
return to growth in transfers, to guarantee the cash floor component 
and to restore stability and predictability by five year funding 
arrangements.
<P>
	It was also raised by one of my constituents, Mr. Andre 
Marentette, a member of the group Canadians for Constitutional 
Money, that our foreign borrowing is too  high. Not only is he 
correct but this budget will for the first time in years make us less 
dependent on foreign loans. How? As we reach our objectives of 
deficit reduction, we decrease our need for foreign borrowing.
<P>
	Not only are my constituents concerned about our investment in 
the future, it is one of the very reasons I sought public office. I 
assured my constituents at my nomination that ``a new Liberal 
government will invest in Canada's greatest asset, our people. And 
by investing in them, we invest in our future''.
<P>
	This budget does just that. It invests in our future to ensure not 
only our future but to restore the confidence of Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1335 )</B>
<P>
	This government has allocated resources to new investments in 
three main areas: youth, technology and external trade. Action in 
these fields is not an increase in expenditure but is financed by 
budget savings through reallocations from lower priorities.
<P>
	Government cannot solve Canada's problems by simply 
throwing massive sums of money at different areas. This is what 
has created our difficulties in the past. Instead we must create an 
environment that encourages economic growth and make 
sustainable new jobs possible.
<P>
	We need low inflation, low interest rates and declining deficits to 
build a growth environment. These are all critical to the future of 
our nation, to the future of Canada.
<P>
	To talk about the future of Canada, let me speak for a moment 
about youth. Most of us will know that the unemployment of youth, 
those under 25, is very high. It is in the neighbourhood of 16 per 
cent. This needs to be addressed and it was in this budget. We must 
help our young people to take the first step to get their first job. In 
that objective I applaud the government for asking possible 
businesses to reach out and do exactly that.
<P>
	There is $315 million allocated for new employment 
opportunities. There is $700 million already provided through 
programs such as youth internship Canada, youth service Canada 
and summer job programs. In this budget we will double the 
government commitment to summer job programs from $60 
million to $120 million. With the $60 million last year, we created 
30,000 jobs. We hope to double that number.
<P>
	The remaining funds will be used to improve job possibilities for 
young people in innovative sectors: information technology, 
environmental technology, tourism, culture, trade and international 
development. These investments will build on a new domestic 
Team Canada style partnership between businesses and 
government to create entry level jobs for youth. With these new 
funds, $315 million reallocated and $165 million in tax 
expenditures, the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1537"> 1537 </A></B>
<P>
budget brings total  expenditures for youth specific programs over 
a three year period from $700 million to $1.2 billion.
<P>
	As well let us talk about the learning package. There is an 
additional $165 million in tax assistance to students and their 
families over three years. There is a 25 per cent increase in 
educational tax credits and tuition fee limits. As well the ceiling on 
annual contributions to an education savings plan has been raised.
<P>
	Canada must also invest in science and technology to increase 
productivity and competitiveness which fuel export growth and 
ensure job creation at home. Encouraging export growth is a 
priority for this Liberal government. One billion dollars in exports 
represents about 11,000 jobs for Canadians.
<P>
	In 1995 the value of Canadian exports exceeded that of imports 
by $28 billion. Along with the budget this Liberal government 
unveiled a new science and technology strategy which will target 
promising sectors. Technology Partnerships Canada will support 
the development of advanced manufacturing and materials, 
aerospace, environmental technologies and biotechnology. 
Funding will increase from $150 million in 1996-97 to $250 
million in 1998-99.
<P>
	Access to the information highway will also be increased by the 
SchoolNet program. By 1998 all of Canada's educational 
institutions and libraries will be connected. As part of SchoolNet, 
2,000 computer students will connect 50,000 small businesses to 
the Internet.
<P>
	To further encourage trading growth, the Business Development 
Bank will receive $50 million in additional capital allowing the 
bank to lend up to $350 million more to growth, knowledge based 
and exporting businesses. The Export Development Corporation 
will receive $50 million in new equity for innovative export 
financing.
<P>
	We have talked and talked about the red book but by today I 
think we can come to this House with a remarkable balance sheet 
showing real achievements, particularly on the fiscal front. The 
Prime Minister recently noted we have finally turned the corner on 
deficit reduction. This has been done without raising personal 
income taxes in any of our three budgets. Turning the corner 
allowed the government to move forward on other fronts. The 
government is reallocating funding to provide increased support 
for job creation in three vital and key areas: youth, technology and 
trade.
<P>
	It will be remembered that we talked about a deficit of 3 per cent 
of the GDP. It is now a reality. Now we are looking forward to and 
talking about a deficit of 2 per cent for 1997-98.
<P>
<B>(1340 )</B>
<P>
	With regard to social programs, the Liberal Party is the political 
party which provided Canada with a social  system, a social safety 
net which is the envy of the rest of the world. Once again, I am 
proud to say in this House that the Liberal Party is the party which 
is able to meet the true challenges of this country. This government 
has met that challenge by rethinking the social safety net for the 
long term in order to provide security to those who will grow up in 
this country, to offer people in the 1990s a safety net meeting their 
expectations and to ensure that our country is ready for the next 
century.
<P>
	This government is prepared to put people first.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it was with great interest that I listened to the rhetoric 
from the member opposite.
<P>
	April is tax month, the month when most Canadians fill out their 
annual tax forms. Madam Speaker, how many Canadians do you 
think would be willing to walk into a department store at the end of 
every month, slap down a cheque for $500 and then let the clerk 
decide what to bring them for their money? How many people 
would let that clerk go to the shelves and decide what the customer 
will get for their hard earned wages? Would people be willing to 
tolerate being forced to go to the store every month and lay down a 
huge sum of money to buy things they do not necessarily want or 
need? What I am trying to say is we need to change the system and 
bring back democracy to the way our government spends our 
money.
<P>
	The member opposite talked about how the government is not 
increasing taxes. Nothing could be further from the truth. Since this 
government has taken over, personal income taxes have risen over 
$1,000 per person and the hon. member says they are not raising 
taxes. What a bunch of you know what I am talking about, Madam 
Speaker. I am fed up with the Liberals misleading the public.
<P>
	We need a tax system that does not just focus on collecting more 
money, but allows people to determine how it is spent. We would 
never go to a store and allow them to simply tell us what we are 
going to get for our money but the government tells the people of 
this country what they are going to get for their money.
<P>
	The member said the government is going to put in place all of 
these new programs. She talks about reducing government 
spending and then goes on to list all these new programs. Do people 
have people a choice? How about a tax form that tells the 
government what the priorities of the people are. We have real 
problems with the way government when elected does not carry out 
the wishes of the people.
<P>
	The hon. member went on to talk about how health care is a 
priority. Is it when we reduce funding for health care and increase it 
in other areas? She talked about multiculturalism in her riding. I 
have multiculturalism in my riding as well. In fact English and 
French are not the dominant features there.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1538"> 1538 </A></B>
<P>
	I took a survey as to how my people want their money spent 
and multiculturalism was almost at the bottom of the list, yet this 
government emphasizes that kind of thing. People want to look 
after those programs themselves.
<P>
	The system is rewarding lobbyists, special interest groups and 
corporations. What about the tax concessions and grants to the 
corporations, the very corporations that pay the bills for this 
Liberal government to get elected? Then when it gets elected it 
turns around and rewards those corporations with tax concessions 
and grants.
<P>
	How about asking the taxpayers if that is how they want their 
money spent? I think the member gets the message. It is about time 
the Liberals started listening to the people and stopped misleading 
the people about how great it is to have all these new programs and 
to spend all this extra money when in fact they have increased taxes 
drastically but they try to portray the image that they have not.
<P>
	I wonder if the member would like to go to a department store 
and slap down a huge sum of money every month and have them 
determine what she is going to get for it. Taxpayers deserve to have 
more input into how government spends their money.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Whelan:</B> Madam Speaker, I am quite surprised by the hon. 
member's comments. As he knows, for the first time in history the 
government has held prebudget consultations for two years in a 
row. What better opportunity for Canadians to have their say and to 
have their input into what the budget says?
<P>
	My constituents participated. I do not know if his constituents 
did. They came and said what they wanted. The majority of the 
things that were heard at the meetings of the past two years in my 
riding and in other ridings were reflected in the budget.
<P>
	We have met deficit reduction targets. How many governments 
in the past, including the Tory cousins of the party opposite, have 
done that? They could not meet those targets in the last 10 years. I 
would like to think that we did exactly what we said we were going 
to do in the election campaign. We kept our promise. We said 3 per 
cent of GDP and we have gone beyond that.
<P>
	Liberalism and multiculturalism make this country great. They 
make it what it is. I am glad to be Canadian. I am glad to be part of 
this party.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Denis Paradis (Brome-Missisquoi, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak to the budget. The 
theme of this year's budget is ``securing the future''. I think that 
securing the future is exactly what is needed in these difficult 
times.
<P>
	In the last few weeks, I had the opportunity to tour my riding of 
Brome-Missisquoi, to visit every town and  village and talk with 
the people. I can tell you that the main concerns or needs of the 
people of Brome-Missisquoi-which are probably similar to 
those of other Canadians-are as follows. I will try to list them in 
order of frequency.
<P>
	Their first concern is taxes. I will get back to this in a minute to 
compare public expectations with what is in the budget. Second, 
bureaucrats and their red tape. Third, duplication between the 
federal government and the provinces and how it can be eliminated 
as quickly as possible. Fourth, how to decentralize the management 
of certain programs. Fifth, how to achieve recognition of Quebec's 
distinctiveness.
<P>
	I will now go back to the people's first four concerns in light of 
the finance minister's last budget. The budget starts out by stating 
that we must secure our financial future.
<P>
	One year before the Liberal Party came to office, budget figures 
pegged the deficit at $42 billion. The deficit fell to $37.5 billion 
one year later and to $32.7 billion two years later. The new deficit 
forecast is $24.3 billion, then $17 billion for next year.
<P>
	I mentioned earlier that political choices have to be made, and 
political choices are important. We could have cut the deficit down 
to zero tomorrow morning. But what about social programs? What 
about the most vulnerable in our society? I think we must go ahead 
without forgetting the needs of the most vulnerable in our society.
<P>
	We will eventually eliminate the deficit, but the new Canada 
social transfer will help the most vulnerable in our society make it 
through. I think that this is important, in the choices the 
government made.
<P>
	The second point is rethinking the role of government. I was 
telling you earlier about the concerns of the people of 
Brome-Missisquoi, about the need to reduce duplication.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	Let me give you an example. The speech from the throne 
provides for the establishment of a national food inspection agency. 
Now, this is a measure that will help eliminate duplication. 
Currently, when it comes to food inspection, we have inspectors 
from Agriculture Canada and Health Canada at the federal level. At 
the provincial level, we have inspectors from the Régie des 
marchés agricoles du Québec, as well as from the Fédération des 
producteurs, which administers the joint program for that sector. 
Then, if we are talking about restaurants in Montreal, there are city 
inspectors who make regular visits to these establishments. That 
makes a lot of inspectors in the food inspection sector.
<P>
	An agency like that will allow us to offer a partnership to all the 
other levels of government, because it is in the best interests of the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="1539"> 1539 </A></B>
<P>
citizen. The citizen at the end of the  process will not get the visit of 
five inspectors dealing with five different issues during the same 
week. This is an example of how to streamline operations and help 
eliminate duplication between the federal and provincial 
governments.
<P>
	A similar example is the proposed revenue commission. Again, 
and this is particularly true in Quebec, the GST and the TVQ are 
harmonized. Agreements were signed by the federal and Quebec 
governments and things are going well. However, if we can 
increase the number of such agreements between Ottawa and the 
provinces, so much the better. Again, this will benefit citizens and 
taxpayers. In that sense, I believe the Canadian government is 
making great efforts to eliminate or reduce duplication.
<P>
	A budget is about the moneys to be allocated or to be spent in a 
given year. Earlier, I stressed the importance of protecting seniors, 
as well as those who need to get an education and those who need 
health care services. As I said before in this House, thanks to the 
new Canada social transfer, the federal government will no longer 
send three cheques to the provinces, that is one for education, one 
for health and one for social security. It will be a single cheque. 
Provinces will be able to take that single cheque and spend it 
according to their own priorities.
<P>
	Last year, when this was announced, the big cheque which 
combined the previous three cheques was cut about 4 per cent. But 
we should look at the facts. The federal government cut its program 
spending by 7 per cent, but transfer payments to the provinces by 4 
per cent only. Better than that, the Minister of Finance announced 
in his last budget that the federal government had agreed to a new 
five year funding framework for the Canada social transfer, starting 
in 1998-99.
<P>
	The first two years, the federal contribution will be kept as its 
current level. Then, in the following years, the transfers will 
increase at a rate linked to economic growth. What this means is 
that the federal government will not, as other governments are 
doing, transfer its deficit to the next level of government. The 
federal government will continue to assume its responsibilities, 
under the Canada social transfer, for health, education and social 
security. This is important.
<P>
	I have the privilege of sitting on the public accounts committee 
of this House, where we can examine the way senior officials and 
deputy ministers manage, one after the other. This allows the 
Canadian government to be managed as well as can be, to cut 
spending and streamline operations to stay within budget, to see 
where we are going with our budgets from the inside, and to 
monitor those who spend money week after week and month after 
month. This allows us to save. These savings do not penalize the 
citizens who, I repeat, are the reason we are here in this House.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	In conclusion, I want to speak about the best part of this budget. 
The best part is the job creation program for our youth. We have
<P>
increased the resources allocated to the youth summer employment 
creation program from $60 million last year to $120 million this 
summer, for all of Canada. This is a real investment in the future, it 
is a measure that will help young people across the country who 
represent our future; therefore it will foster our progress as a 
society.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, 
BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I listened carefully to my colleague from 
Brome-Missisquoi, who sits with me on the Standing Committee 
on Public Accounts. I have one brief question to ask him.
<P>
	He has talked a lot about duplication and overlap. Does he not 
agree that one of the best means to eliminate duplication and 
overlap would be to take away one level of government, that is the 
federal government, and to make Quebec sovereign?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paradis: </B>Madam Speaker, at what price? I think two or 
three levels of government can very well co-operate together. My 
colleague from Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans knows full 
well that there is a program that worked very well last year and the 
year before, and that is the infrastructure program.
<P>
	It is not a program from one government, it is a program that 
called for the co-operation of the federal, provincial and municipal 
levels and it was set up quickly. It has worked properly, and I am 
even sure that his riding must have benefited from this 
infrastructure program. I think the solution for the future-I was 
talking about young people earlier-lies in young people, but also 
in co-operation and joint action. I appeal to all my colleagues of the 
Bloc Quebecois to show willingness to co-operate and to take joint 
action, so that we can now revitalize the economy and ensure that 
we live in a province and a country that are even more prosperous.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It being 2 p.m., we will now proceed to 
statements by members.

Stanley Knowles, whom I have known since long before I became a

<P>
	In my teaching days I brought 35 students to visit Parliament 
Hill and as we stood outside the doors of the Chamber, looking at 
all the seats inside, there was only one person sitting in the House 
of Commons, Stanley Knowles.
<P>
	The constable explained to me that Mr. Knowles quite often did 
his office work in his seat in the Chamber because at that time 
individual members did not have an office of their own. Members 
had to share offices and staff and it was not a very peaceful 
exercise.
<P>
	Stanley Knowles has always championed the cause of war 
veterans, senior citizens and medicare. I remember the teasing he 
got about his own pension on the day he became a senior citizen.
<P>
	The Right Hon. Pierre Elliott Trudeau appointed him to a place 
of honour at the table in the Chamber.
<P>
	It is fitting that this man be recognized by the academic 
community and remembered as a champion of social justice in 
Canada.

Lebanon since the Sabra and Shatilla massacre of 1983, and it is 
with great sadness and distress that we are following the situation.
<P>
	Throughout their history, the people of Lebanon have never 
resorted to violence against others, and they have welcomed a large 
number of refugees. Lebanon has always been generous, and the 
deep values that guide it have made it a country of refuge.
<P>
	Why is Lebanon suffering today? That country has often been 
used as a battle ground to settle conflicts in the Middle East. As a 
result of the attacks against Lebanese civilians and the destruction 
of electric facilities and public services, the people of Lebanon are 
still being made to suffer miserably.
<P>
	The military attacks are so brutal that the peace process will be 
definitively diverted to animosity and violence. Israel has opted for 
the use of force and brutality-

majority of automobile dealers.
<P>

<P>
	Bank entry into this market could therefore jeopardize the 
viability of the whole industry which could also adversely affect 
thousands of Canadian jobs. In particular, where banks are the main 
provider of credit to automobile dealers, the government must 
avoid creating an unfair marketplace and an environment in which 
credit deprivation by the banks would be possible.

<P>
	A delegation from Cape Breton has come to Ottawa in a last bid 
effort to stop the Liberals from adopting a plan that would see the 
Cape Breton Development Corporation, DEVCO, turn its back on 
growing export markets for coal, resulting in the privatization of 
DEVCO and the loss of 800 jobs. More labour management 
conflict will put at risk the long term future of the Cape Breton

	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, without any debate, the Quebec wing of the Liberal 
Party of Canada replaced the notion of distinct society by the 
diluted phrase ``principal homeland of the French language, culture 
and legal tradition in North America'' to describe Quebec.
<P>
	Painted into a corner by the rank-and-file of his own party, in the 
final days of the referendum campaign, the Prime Minister made 
one commitment after another to recognize Quebec as a distinct 
society. Now, he is only asking for the recognition of the French 
fact in Quebec.
<P>
	What the Prime Minister and the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs are seeking above all is to increase the level of satisfaction 
in the rest of Canada at the expense of interests which are specific 
to Quebec. It would seem that the Prime Minister has not yet

	He has put a gun to their heads, announcing an $80 million 
licence buy back program which fishermen must opt for prior to the 
end of June 1996.
<P>
	What the minister has failed to do is set allocations guaranteeing 
salmon fishermen a set share of the resource. Fishermen are 
expected to make lifelong decisions with virtually no notice and no 
knowledge of what future allocations will be. The minister 
continues to reallocate the resource through aboriginal treaties 
without being forthright and admitting as much.
<P>
	It is small wonder commercial fishermen in British Columbia 
are telling the minister his plan is totally unacceptable. The

after the fact.

<P>
	Mr. Knowles, who takes his place in front of you, Mr. Speaker,

in a byelection in 1942, Mr. Knowles quickly demonstrated his 
extraordinary knowledge of and exceptional devotion to the rules

recognizing his commitment to his faith, his party and his country.

Knowles Chair of Canadian Studies at St. Paul's College at the 
University of Waterloo, a college affiliated with the United Church, 
a church in which Mr. Knowles was an ordained minister.
<P>
	At a time when university chairs tend to honour those who have 
large stock portfolios, it is so refreshing that St. Paul's College has 
chosen to create a chair in honour of Stanley Knowles, a man of 
most modest material means but one who has contributed so much 
to the richness of Canadian public and political life.

	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to inform the House that today on Parliament Hill is the 
official launch of the campaign to establish the Stanley Knowles 
Visiting Professorship in Canadian Studies at the University of 
Waterloo.
<P>
	Stanley Knowles is a living legend. He served continuously in 
the House from 1942 until his retirement in 1983. Over those 41 
years he established an esteemed reputation among all political 
parties within the labour  movement and in an ever widening 
constituency which ultimately extended to the international 
community.
<P>
	One of the many honours Stanley Knowles has received was the 
appointment to honorary officer of the House by former Prime 
Minister Pierre Elliot Trudeau.
<P>
	By establishing the Stanley Knowles Visiting Professorship in 
Canadian Studies, the University of Waterloo is pleased to provide 
recognition of this Canadian's efforts to create a better society.
<P>
	It is my pleasure to invite members of the House to join in 
celebrating the launch to take place today at 200 West Block at5.30 p.m.

once again we see the ill conceived, grossly mismanaged TAGS

<P>
	The latest example is the admission by the Liberals that they 
have no money left for the latest round of licence buy backs. This 
means that at the end of the program all the same problems will 
still exist for Atlantic Canadians. There will still be 50 per cent

an empty promise. The TAGS program has failed them miserably.

Canadians are once again being gouged by the major oil companies 
as prices in metro Toronto rose from 54.5 cents to 59 cents per litre

on high crude oil prices while others blame a shortage of gasoline 
supplies for putting more upward pressure on prices.

	Oil companies always seem to have an excuse for holding 
Canadians at ransom. If we do not pay their inflated prices we can 
walk. They have to be held accountable for the blatant and 
shameful practices they use on honest hardworking Canadians. The 
federal government must enact legislation to control price fixing 
within the gasoline industry.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="DISTINCTSOCIETY">DISTINCT SOCIETY</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, now there is no doubt about it. Editorial writers, political 
cartoonists, commentators, federalist and sovereignist politicians, 
everyone is totally opposed to the Liberal Party of Canada's new 
constitutional position.
<P>
	While the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs is currently on a 
big cross-country tour seeking a solution to Canada's constitutional 
impasse and finds that all of Quebec has joined forces within 24 
hours to tell him no, does he intend to work toward getting the 
government to  backtrack from this dead end path on which it has 
embarked?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, what is this backtracking the Leader of the Opposition 
is referring to? It is very clear that Quebec is a distinct society 
within Canada. It is very clear that the Government of Canada 
intends to recognize that reality by all necessary means.
<P>
	The Government of Canada will make every effort to convince 
Canadians to reconcile, for there is indeed an element in this 
English speaking North America, in this bilingual Canada, that is 
called Quebec, an admirable society which is able to affirm itself as 
a great reality, a reality which Canadians wish to keep as part of 
their country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, we are well aware of the Prime Minister of Canada's 
strategy, which has always involved dumping on Quebec to gain 
votes in the rest of Canada. At the time of the Liberal Party 
leadership convention, he trampled roughshod over the Meech 
Lake accord in order to gain votes in the rest of Canada. During the 
1993 elections, he presented himself as the man who could put 
Quebec in its place, in order to gain votes in the rest of Canada.
<P>
	Is the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs not in the process of 
adopting his leader's strategy as his own, that is to say bringing 
together all of Canada against Quebec, with this proposition he is 
defending?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, to take more of an overview, for 30 years now Canada 
has been trying to survive the threat of secession. We are the only 
democracy that has been faced with this problem for 30 years, yet 
the same values are shared by Canadians in all provinces and in 
Quebec; they share a desire to live together. Those in Quebec do 
not want to have to choose between their Quebec identity and their 
Canadian identity. They want to remain both Quebecers and 
Canadians, and that is what they will do.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, is the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs not 
embarrassed to associate his name with a proposal that is already 
doomed to failure, and which is most certainly the biggest piece of 
meaningless nonsense concocted by a federal government in the 
past 30 years in the area of federal-provincial relations?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, what is this I hear? Acknowledging Quebec's 
difference would be meaningless? What the opposition fears is that 
we might manage to reconcile Quebecers and Canadians so that  
they 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1544"> 1544 </A></B>
<P>
may join together in the same country to face the formidable 
challenges of the 21st century.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs.
<P>
	As reported by the media, it is obvious that the new 
intergovernmental affairs minister was not consulted before the 
Quebec wing of the Liberal Party of Canada passed its new 
resolution replacing the notion of distinct society with a narrower 
concept which only recognizes Quebec as the principal homeland 
of French language, culture and legal tradition in North America.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs have any 
credibility during his Canada-wide tour, given that, at the first 
opportunity, the Prime Minister leaves him out of the discussions 
on the new constitutional resolution?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have been wondering since yesterday whether or not 
the hon. member can read or hear. It is stated in the resolution-and 
I want to put it on the record, because the Prime Minister himself 
pointed it out yesterday-that the Liberal Party of Canada supports 
the enshrinement in the Constitution of the principles recognized in 
the parliamentary resolution passed in December 1995 defining the 
distinct society.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the comment made by the minister applies to himself 
because he never answers the questions put to him, even though he 
is only starting his political career.
<P>
	Does the minister realize that, by supporting the 1982 patriation 
of the Constitution and giving his unconditional support to this 
resolution, he is totally isolated in Quebec, since both the Quebec 
federalists and sovereignists are opposed to it?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have little to say on that, except perhaps that this is 
wishful thinking on the part of the hon. member.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SOMALIAINQUIRY">SOMALIA INQUIRY</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is now reported that the Somalia inquiry has new 
memos that cast doubts on the military police investigation and the 
information commissioner's report on an attempted cover-up.
<P>
	According to the commissioner, these investigations have not 
had all the relevant documents necessary to reach sound 
conclusions. The defence minister was very quick to trumpet the 
information commissioner's report  when it appeared to clear 
General Boyle of any direct involvement in the Somalia cover-up 
but now the information commissioner has expressed concern that 
all the facts were not on the table.
<P>
	Can the defence minister categorically state that General Boyle 
played no role whatsoever in DND's efforts to cover up Somalia 
documents?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member does not need me to state that. The general stated it 
himself last week very clearly. I can assure the hon. member that 
what the general said last week was absolutely correct and 
absolutely true.
<P>
	I was somewhat concerned yesterday with what the counsel for 
the commission said with respect to documents. It gives us some 
concern. However, I think we should keep this in perspective 
because the department has provided about a half million pages 
worth of documents. Further documents were requested and those 
have been turned over.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	Last week the chief of defence staff initiated a search 
unparalleled in national defence history. It bore great fruit because 
many documents did surface and were given to the inquiry.
<P>
	If by Thursday the inquiry is still dissatisfied with the question 
of documentation and what it has available then it is within its 
mandate and its power to get to the bottom of what happened to the 
rest of the documents.
<P>
	I would ask that after the inquiry sees the results of the further 
search by the department that it continues with its hearings and get 
to the bottom of things because that is what Canadians want. They 
want the truth to come out and only the inquiry will get to the 
bottom of it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister moved very quickly from the discussion of 
General Boyle on to other subjects and yet General Boyle is at the 
heart of this controversy.
<P>
	The public affairs branch of DND hatched an elaborate scheme 
to rename, hide and even destroy Somalia documents. General 
Boyle was the head of public affairs. The Somalia Inquiry Liaison 
Team, SILT, is accused of deliberate foot dragging and misleading 
commissioners. General Boyle was involved in SILT. The military 
wants to court martial Colonel Geoff Haswell who says that top 
soldiers knew of the cover-up. General Boyle is part of that military 
justice system. The defence minister's hand-picked chief of 
defence is up to his eyeballs in the Somalia affair.
<P>
	Given all of this, will the defence minister ask his appointee, 
General Boyle, to step aside until the inquiry determines his role in 
the Somalia affair?
<P>

<HR>
<B><A NAME="1545"> 1545 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr.  Speaker, what is at the 
heart of this matter is justice and fairness for everybody in the 
Canadian Armed Forces and the Department of National Defence.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Althouse:</B> What about honesty?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Collenette:</B> The leader of the Reform Party obviously does 
not know what justice and fairness means in Canada.
<P>
	Justice and fairness means that everyone gets a chance to give 
his or her point of view in a setting that is impartial. The 
commission has decided to look at the documentation issue, 
including the public affairs issue, which will start next week.
<P>
	Only then, after the chief of defence staff and everyone else has 
the ability to put the facts on the table, will Canadians be able to 
judge. We should not prejudge the matter on the floor of the House 
of Commons.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister talks a lot about justice and fairness and yet 
by siding with General Boyle he could very well be aiding and 
abetting a cover-up that prevents justice and fairness from being 
done. His hand-picked chief of defence is not an innocent 
bystander. He headed up public affairs at DND. He had a hand in 
the operations of SILT and he is the head of the military justice 
system. General Boyle cannot be impartial in a case in which he is 
both a witness and a suspect.
<P>
	If the minister is committed to justice and impartiality, even the 
appearance of justice and impartiality, will he ask General Boyle, 
his hand-picked chief of defence staff, to step aside until the 
Somalia inquiry finishes its work?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if I heard the 
hon. member correctly, he made a blatant accusation against me 
that I am a party to a cover-up. Does he have evidence of that fact? 
If he has evidence of that fact then he should submit it to the 
inquiry.
<P>
	This is what is wrong with the Reform Party and the approach 
that it is taking. It is slandering and libelling people here in the 
House of Commons under parliamentary immunity and not 
allowing the commission process to get at the heart of the matter. 
That is not what Canadians expect.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a question for the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	We heard yesterday that, in spite of the search within the 
defence, department, 20 per cent of all documents relating to the 
Canadian mission in Somalia are still missing.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	While records of daily activities of the first commando were 
allegedly too damaged by sea water, key records of the second and 
third commandos are still missing.
<P>
	After the wide search which cost taxpayers several million 
dollars and where some 100,000 employees of the defence 
department were mobilized to go through all their files with a 
fine-tooth comb, can the minister tell us what he intends to do to 
locate the files that are still missing?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I answered this 
question a little earlier. There has been an unprecedented search of 
DND files.
<P>
	Half a million pages of documents have been sent to the 
commission. If, by Thursday, the commission is still dissatisfied, it 
is the commission's job and within its mandate to find out why the 
rest of those documents are not available.
<P>
	The commission has to do its job. It has to analyse all the data 
and then come forward with recommendations, which the 
government will consider.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
beyond the cover-up operation, which is becoming increasingly 
obvious, and regardless of all the muddle and the incompetence 
surrounding the management of the Somalia issue, how can the 
minister justify to the population that such important documents 
have disappeared and are still nowhere to be found? Are we to 
expect another search?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member is basically repeating the earlier question. The 
commission will get to the bottom of the document issue. Let us 
wait to see what happens on Thursday. Let the commission do its 
job.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	The minister has allowed cover-up to become a standard 
operating procedure at the Department of National Defence. 
Military police investigations have been compromised. Access to 
information documents have been consistently violated.
<P>
	General Boyle, who is at the centre of the Somalia scandal, has 
been put in charge of the entire department. DND has been totally 
unco-operative with the inquiry.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1546"> 1546 </A></B>
<P>
	The media knew there was a cover-up in the minister's 
department. The inquiry knew there was a cover-up in the 
minister's department. The Canadian public knew there was a 
cover-up in the minister's department.
<P>
	How is it that the minister was not aware of the cover-up in the 
Department of National Defence?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Canadians want 
everyone in this Chamber to work together to find out the truth and 
not play partisan politics with this very difficult issue.
<P>
	It is very difficult to take the member for 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt seriously in his guise as the 
defence critic when he has been all over the map on this inquiry.
<P>
	In October of last year he said that the commission is headed by 
top notch people and will come to conclusions. On April 2 he said 
that the inquiry should be shut down, that it had outlived its 
usefulness. This morning, he said that the commission is doing a 
fabulous job.
<P>
	If the commission is doing a fabulous job, then let the 
commission ask all these questions of the relevant witnesses. Do 
not ask them every day in the House of Commons.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Somalia commission is fed up with the cover-up 
by this minister's officials. The minister is no better.
<P>
	According to commission counsel, the minister knew last 
October that key evidence was missing. He did not inform the 
inquiry until just recently. The minister deemed it unnecessary to 
proceed with that information.
<P>
	Will the minister of defence acknowledge his responsibility for 
this cover-up, do the honourable thing and resign?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not need 
the hon. member to tell me about my responsibilities.
<P>
	Once again, the hon. member has blatantly distorted the facts 
from yesterday's submission by the counsel for the Somalia 
inquiry. This is a pattern that this member follows for his own 
partisan ends.
<P>
	This morning on ``Canada A.M.'' he said, contrary to the facts, 
that the commission had asked the RCMP to look at the computer 
disk. I said yesterday that it was the department that brought in the 
RCMP to look at the computer disk.
<P>
	Do not believe me because he does not believe me. Believe 
commission counsel, Simon Noël. When he was asked yesterday 
about who requested the RCMP to come in, it was the military 
police. This member is distorting  the facts every day and that 
undermines the integrity of his questions.
<P>
<B>(1435)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Somalia affair is turning into an endless saga. First, we 
learned that documents had been tampered with or destroyed. 
Then, there was the great cover-up, which may have been 
masterminded by the chief of the defence staff himself. And then 
the whole army was mobilized and sent scrambling for lost 
documents. It has been the army's version of a treasure hunt. 
Twenty per cent of the documents are still missing, though. 
Nothing could be more ludicrous.
<P>
	The minister of defence says that even worse could be expected. 
Does the minister have information or documents he has not 
handed over to the inquiry commission, for him to be saying that 
the worst is still to come?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, these are just 
variations of earlier questions. I do not want to take the time of the 
House to repeat the answer at any great length.
<P>
	The department has handed over thousands of pages of evidence 
that were required by the commission and were further requested. I 
am very concerned that the commission has said it is still 
dissatisfied. The department has been requested to make a 
statement on Thursday. It will make the statement. If the 
commission is still dissatisfied then it has the full power to find out 
what actually happened.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are making some progress. We now know the minister 
has not found anything because he has not concealed anything.
<P>
	Since the minister is telling us that he has not concealed anything 
from the commission, let met ask him once more how he can tell us 
that the worst is still to come? What could be worse than what is 
already known?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is a difficult 
problem for all Canadians. It is difficult for the Canadian Armed 
Forces. It is creating a considerable pall over the operations of the 
forces, over men and women who are serving with distinction 
every single day, whether at home or abroad. Because of certain 
incidents which occurred three years ago everybody has been 
smeared and tarnished.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1547"> 1547 </A></B>
<P>
	To get at the truth, the government discharged the commitment 
made by my colleague the minister of fisheries when in opposition 
to put an inquiry in place.
<P>
	I would ask in the spirit of fairness for the opposition to allow 
the commission to do its job.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the pride and 
confidence of our military has been shaken, not only inside Canada 
but it is now being questioned internationally.
<P>
	Colonel Geof Haswell has accused Canada's UN ambassador, 
among others, of instigating a cover-up, and I say a cover-up, in the 
Somali affair.
<P>
	It is critical that those who were at the top in DND at the time 
these events occurred be brought back to Ottawa until these 
allegations are resolved.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Foreign Affairs agree to recall Mr. Bob 
Fowler until all his testimony before the inquiry is complete and he 
has been cleared of these serious allegations?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, a few days ago I had the opportunity to be in Bosnia where 
our military is conducting, in a the most exemplary way, a security 
operation designed to help that country achieve a system of 
democracy and the protection of rights that we enjoy here in 
Canada.
<P>
	One of those fundamental rights is the right to be presumed 
innocent until proven guilty. Therefore, I totally deny the 
suggestion of the hon. member that all of a sudden we charge the 
ambassador to the UN with some kind of allegation until the 
commission of inquiry has had a chance to look into those areas. 
That is what the military is defending in Bosnia and we will defend 
it here.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are not talking 
about charges. We are talking about questions that were asked two 
years ago before the appointment of this ambassador.
<P>
<B>(1440 )</B>
<P>
	This systematic denial of reality is really where the whole 
problem started. Not only must there be a full investigation into 
these charges, but until it is complete it will be impossible for us to 
maintain our position in the UN with this tainted ambassador at the 
helm.
<P>
	Why will the minister not spare Canada more embarrassment 
from future revelations of the Somalia inquiry and immediately 
reassign Mr. Fowler to Ottawa until all of the allegations against 
him are cleared?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the only embarrassment this country is facing is the 
constant disregard for fundamental rights and liberties expressed 
daily by members of the Reform Party.
<P>
	The Minister of National Defence has clearly pointed out that an 
inquiry was established to get at the truth of  what happened in 
Somalia. The evidence has been presented. Mr. Fowler will appear 
under oath before the inquiry to give all the information he knows, 
as will others.
<P>
	It seems to me that the hon. member is incapable of 
understanding the basic rights of decency and justice, that a person 
is not charged or tainted until they have had a chance to defend 
themselves.

	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Health.
<P>
	With their draft regulation on banning raw milk cheese, federal 
officials are interfering against everybody's wishes and threatening 
the future of a flourishing industry.
<P>
	How can the minister accept that an official can refuse to make 
available studies on raw milk that were carried out by the health 
department at public expense and thus belong to the public and not 
the public service?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
with respect to the official not making information available, I have 
instructed the deputy minister to make all information in the 
department, all of the scientific evidence, available. Of course 
there is information which cannot be released because of 
commercial confidentiality.
<P>
	I want to share the words of my colleague in the province of 
Quebec, the minister responsible for agriculture and fisheries, who 
said that he believes it is essential to protect the health of 
consumers. Since there are some client sectors at risk, such as 
pregnant women, the committee he is going to strike in his 
province will have to make the necessary recommendations in 
order that the production, transformation and sale of milk products 
made from non-pasteurized milk will be monitored well. The 
Quebec health and social service ministry will sit on that 
committee. I welcome the support and the confidence of the 
minister in Quebec.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I invite 
you and the minister to come tomorrow to a raw milk cheese 
tasting right here in Parliament.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.

creates many jobs in Canada, mainly in Quebec?

<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I have two responses to the question.
<P>
	The first response is that I would be delighted to join with my 
colleague in having a taste of good cheese from the province of 
Quebec.
<P>
	The House should understand very clearly that on May 30, 1995 
individuals under the national liaison group of milk products 
quality reviewed this particular issue and found no difficulties with 
the proposal that was being made. The officials who formed that 
group were from Ontario, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, the 
province of Quebec, and other representatives from the province of 
Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1445 )</B>
<P>
	As of March 30 we have gazetted a regulation thereby giving 
everyone in Quebec and across the country the opportunity to make 
representations, to make sure that our regulation which may be out 
of date addresses the concerns of all Canadians and protects the 
health of all Canadians.
<P>
	The hon. member does not have to believe me, she can believe 
the big cheese in the province of Quebec.

	<B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. Clair, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the parliamentary secretary to the 
solicitor general.
<P>
	Canadians want the various levels of government to simplify, 
co-ordinate and avoid overlap. In Windsor and Essex county we see 
through our American neighbours what violent crime can do to a 
society.
<P>
	Is the government taking any steps to clear up jurisdictional 
overlaps in the criminal justice system to make it more efficient 
and to ensure that nobody falls through the cracks?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, upon the initiative of the 
solicitor general's office as well as the office of the Minister of 
Justice, this Sunday and Monday a workshop was organized in 
Ottawa on the delivery of information on the justice system and the 
application of new technology. This workshop was attended by 
senior federal and provincial leaders. They are meeting in Ottawa 
to discuss the application of new technology which has been 
accepted by all jurisdictions as important to the delivery of the 
information system.
<P>
	A concrete example of an initiative the solicitor general recently 
announced is the flagging of high risk offender systems. This is an 
initiative by the federal government as well as the provincial and 
territorial leaders. It is being administered through the police 
information office.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, with the inadequate answers which we have received 
today on the Somalia inquiry the government has raised the bigger 
issue of ministerial accountability.
<P>
	We have a serious dereliction of duty with respect to the 
Canadian Armed Forces in the case of the cover-up of the Somalia 
affair. Instead of the senior minister accepting responsibility for 
that dereliction of duty, he tries to pass it on either to an inquiry or 
to senior officials who then pass it on to the lower ranks.
<P>
	Will the minister explain to the House exactly what his concept 
of ministerial responsibility is? Does he accept responsibility in the 
case of the Somalia cover-up?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is not a 
political science class at a Canadian university. If the hon. leader of 
the Reform Party does not know what ministerial responsibility is, 
he obviously does not know much about the Canadian 
parliamentary system and far be it for me to educate him.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in 1978 a Liberal Speaker of this House who is now an 
associate to the chief justice of the Federal Court of Appeal made a 
ruling on what ministerial responsibility is. I would like to read it 
to the minister: ``It is the responsibility that when serious 
dereliction of duty by an official of a minister takes place, the 
minister is expected either to assume responsibility for that in the 
House or alternatively to advise the House of the appropriate 
disciplinary measures which have been taken''.
<P>
	Can the minister understand that? Does he assume responsibility 
for the Somalia cover-up, yes or no? If no, will he advise the House 
what disciplinary measures have been taken against those whom he 
does hold responsible?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, once a day the 
leader of the Reform Party has made accusations. He has not 
bothered to get the facts. He has drawn conclusions and he wants to 
mete out punishment.
<P>
<B>(1450 )</B>
<P>
	We established an inquiry to look at this matter, to decide if there 
was wrongdoing. If wrongdoing is identified, the civilian or the 
military police authorities can take action and bring the discipline 
the hon. member wants.
<P>
	I do not believe the hon. member after allegedly agreeing with 
the government that we did the right thing in establishing the 
inquiry really believes the inquiry can do its job. His very
<P>

<P>
	This morning, we learned that some postmen from Longueuil 
photocopied envelopes sent to clients by private courier services 
and sent those names and addresses to Canada Post, so that it could 
approach those very same clients.
<P>
	Does the minister think it is acceptable for Canada Post to resort 
to photocopying names and addresses in order to gain unfair 
advantage over the competition?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Public Works and

unacceptable. I have contacted Mr. Clermont, the president and 
chief executive officer of the Canada Post Corporation. I have 
asked him to look into this situation right away, to see that such 
practices stop immediately and to undertake investigations 
throughout Canada to ensure that these tactics are not used 
elsewhere.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, can 
the minister assure the House that she will ask the president and 
chief executive officer of the Canada Post Corporation, her former 
colleague André Ouellet, not only to put a stop to this practice, but 
also to stop anything that can jeopardize the confidentiality of the 
mail?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Public Works and

	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Canada pension plan is going bankrupt quickly. This 
government has a decision to make. In the seniors benefit it has 
guaranteed seniors the right to ``continue in their retirement secure 
the change will not affect them; that is guaranteed''. However, the 
government's own ministers have warned that changes must be 
made: ``You have got to take a look both at premiums and at 
benefits''.
<P>
	My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. What is the 
government's position on protecting pensions to seniors?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member opposite is 
confusing two principal components of the pension system in this 
country.
<P>
	With respect to the Canada pension plan, as the member well 
knows, consultations are under way across Canada and she is 
welcome to participate if she has any creative suggestions on how 
to improve that system. With respect to the seniors benefit she 
spoke about, today's seniors are protected. The new seniors benefit 
will be of great advantage to seniors in the future. We are taking 
steps to ensure the sustainability of both aspects of seniors benefits, 
the seniors benefit and the pension plan in the long term.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the member appears to me to be waffling.
<P>
	In essence we have been waiting now for almost three years for 
direction. Could he please be specific on just what is the 
government's position?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I first want to underscore 
the work that has been done by the member for 
Mission-Coquitlam in terms of her defence of seniors and her 
defence of grandparents, which is certainly very well known. It is 
unfortunate that her position is not reflected by that of her party.
<P>
	She asked in her previous question about the status of the Canada 
pension plan. I can assure the hon. member that unlike the Reform 
Party which has a policy to abolish the Canada pension plan, it is 
the policy of the Liberal Government of Canada to protect the 
Canada pension plan for seniors and its viability in the long term.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="FINANCIALSTATEMENTOFMINISTEROFFINANCE">FINANCIAL STATEMENT OF MINISTER OF FINANCE</A></H4>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that this House 
approves in general the budgetary policy of the government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
be splitting my time with the member for Calgary Centre.
<P>
	I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the budget on 
behalf of my constituents in Comox-Alberni. Canadians have 
listened for years to promises to bring spending under control and 
they are fed up with governments who are more concerned with 
re-elections than with the fiscal health and economic well-being of 
the country.
<P>
	The last federal budget surplus was in 1970 when the 
government took in $139 million more than it spent. That was 
1970. Since then, former Prime Minister Trudeau increased 
Canada's debt and it has been spiralling out of control ever since. It 
is not surprising that our present Prime Minister was finance 
minister during that period.
<P>
	The deficit for this fiscal year was down to $33 billion and the 
Liberals have been doing a smart job in dropping the deficit down, 
but it has not been going down fast enough. That is only part of the 
problem. With a national debt of $580 billion and growing every 
second, Canada is in serious financial trouble. There is little in this 
budget to deal with this problem.
<P>
	By not aggressively attacking the debt, the government is giving 
billions of dollars to the banks instead of spending it on Canadians 
in need. It is true that the Liberals have made modest cuts in 
programs, however, by not aggressively attacking the debt, any 
savings in spending are simply eaten up by payment on the debt.
<P>
	Canadians are now paying 35 cents of every dollar simply to 
service the debt. Twenty years ago this figure was 11 cents. It has 
shot up by a factor of three times. Rather than serving Canadians, 
this government chooses to send that money off to the big banks.
<P>
	In addition, this budget not only fails to make the necessary 
changes required to balance the budget, it makes its cuts by 
offloading the debt on to the backs of the provinces. For example, 
73 per cent of Ottawa's spending cuts in the next year are in federal 
transfer payments for health, education and social programs.
<P>
	Last year transfers were cut by $2.5 billion for the next fiscal 
year and by $4.5 billion for the 1997 fiscal year. This budget cuts 
transfer payments by another $1.4 billion over and above the $6.8 
billion announced last year.
<P>
	On April 1, provinces will be dealing with $8 billion in reduced 
transfer payments. By 1998 total transfers to provinces will be 
reduced by 24 per cent from 1994 levels, a 24 per cent drop in four 
years.
<P>
	In terms of attacking the deficit, most provinces are well ahead 
of Ottawa in deficit reduction. Rather than following the lead of the 
provinces, this government is taking advantage of their political 
resolve and is down loading the federal debt on to the provinces.
<P>
	Without a doubt this government's cuts to federal transfer 
payments is a feeble attempt to simply make the provinces, which 
already have balanced budgets, pay the federal debt. At the same 
time, and this is what infuriates Canadians, this government 
continues to make very little effort to cut back on government 
waste.
<P>
	For example, despite the fact that civil service jobs are being cut, 
the budget for executive training has been increased by $6 million. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1552"> 1552 </A></B>
<P>
Statistics Canada's budget  increased by 47 per cent and Treasury 
Board had a 12 per cent increase. The list goes on.
<P>
	While the provinces are being hit hard with transfer payment 
cuts, this government is still on a spending spree. Provinces such as 
British Columbia have had it up to here, especially when they are 
being unfairly targeted by this and previous governments.
<P>
	British Columbians are forced to cough up more than their fair 
share of funding and in return what do they get? Less and less. To 
illustrate, the level of funding under the Canada assistance plan to 
British Columbia, not to mention Alberta and Ontario, has been 
frozen since 1990. The Liberals promised to lift this cap, but like 
many of their promises, they have broken this one as well.
<P>
	British Columbia, like Alberta and Ontario, continues to be a 
cash cow for the rest of Canada. In return British Columbians are 
being deliberately overlooked by this government which is more 
interested in serving the needs of central Canadians than the 
so-called rest of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1510 )</B>
<P>
	British Columbia has received less than its fair share of transfer 
payments for years. For example, B.C. receives 30 cents on the 
dollar for its social assistance funding from Ottawa, while most 
other provinces receive 50 cents on the dollar toward their social 
assistance programs. Does that sound fair? Well, it is not.
<P>
	There is another glaring inequity. This coming fiscal year 
Quebec will receive $11 billion in transfer payments. Ontario will 
receive $10 billion in transfer payments. What does B.C. receive? 
Three billion dollars in transfer payments. That is unequal and it is 
obscene.
<P>
	Federal cuts to social program funding since 1990 have already 
cost B.C. taxpayers $1.7 billion. Over the next two years B.C. loses 
an additional $1.2 billion in federal funds for health, social services 
and post-secondary education. With all the cuts in transfer 
payments, British Columbians are fed up watching their taxpayers' 
dollars go to Ottawa with very little coming back the other way.
<P>
	The level of cash transfers to the provinces is rapidly 
approaching the point at which Ottawa will lose any influence in 
setting health care and welfare standards. If this situation 
continues, why should B.C. be forced to follow Ottawa's standards 
for welfare when it is simply not coming through with the 
transfers? The answer is very simple. Ottawa will cease to be a 
player.
<P>
	Over the past 30 years, federal spending in B.C. has been 
significantly lower than any other province or region in Canada. 
For example, B.C. receives a measly 5 per cent of major crown 
projects valued at over $100 million despite being the third most 
populated province in Canada. This is discrimination of major 
proportions.
<P>
	The government has not only failed to represent B.C.'s interests 
in Canada, but it has also failed to represent  B.C.'s interests on the 
international front. For example, the United States is challenging 
Canada's sovereignty over the inside passage between Vancouver 
Island and the mainland and is demanding the return of $300,000 in 
fees collected from U.S. fishermen in 1994.
<P>
	Last November the American Congress passed a bill declaring 
the right of free passage to U.S. vessels through B.C.'s inside 
passage. Clearly this American bill undermines B.C.'s and 
Canada's sovereignty over its internal waters guaranteed under the 
Oregon Treaty of 1846. B.C.'s sovereignty over its own territory 
must be protected, yet the foreign affairs minister views this 
situation, and I quote his words, ``as an annoyance''. It is no 
wonder that British Columbians are worried about their federal 
representation regarding this issue and other issues such as the 
ongoing dispute regarding softwood lumber and the treaty 
regarding salmon.
<P>
	I am forced to ask the question: Who in this government is 
looking out for B.C.? The answer: There is not one member of 
Parliament in the entire Liberal caucus, let alone in cabinet, who is 
willing to stand up for British Columbia. It is long overdue for this 
government to recognize the west and its vital contribution to 
Canada.
<P>
	British Columbia expects more from the federal government. 
B.C. expects federal representation and recognition that B.C. 
makes a major contribution to the country. It is long past time for 
the Liberals to recognize that B.C. is more than a cash cow for 
Canada.
<P>
	British Columbians are not prepared to sit in the back seat any 
longer. British Columbians are asking themselves what value they 
are getting for their dollar. When the net costs seem to far outweigh 
any benefits, it begs the question: Why should B.C. remain in the 
game?
<P>
	In conclusion, British Columbians will simply not tolerate these 
injustices any longer. They are demanding equal treatment and it is 
becoming very apparent that only a change in government will 
bring that about. Come the next election, British Columbians will 
vote for change. They will turf out the Liberals in B.C. who are not 
representing their interests and will send a complete slate of 32 
Reformers to clean up the mess created by the old line parties.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with interest and incredulity. I cannot believe some of the 
things I heard from the member.
<P>
	Sometimes when I think about what happens in this place, I 
wonder if members forget the old cliché that if you are not part of 
the solution, you must be part of the problem.
<P>
<B>(1515 )</B>
<P>
	I want to remind the member of comments made recently by 
Premier Mike Harris of Ontario after his election and after looking 
at the finances. He publicly announced, after knowing for two years 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1553"> 1553 </A></B>
<P>
exactly what the  adjustments in transfer payments to the provinces 
would be, that 95 per cent of the fiscal problems of the provincial 
government had nothing to do with the federal government. They 
were problems in the financial management of the province.
<P>
	I spent a number of years working on a volunteer basis on the 
board of the Mississauga hospital. Over those nine years there were 
tremendous changes in the health care system. There was a 
significant change in the average length of stay from 
approximately 7.2 days to approximately 4.9 days. There was a 
tremendous shift in technology. There was a tremendous shift in 
medical knowledge and chemistry. There were significant savings. 
That hospital reduced from 600 beds to 500 beds and served more 
patients because of the improvement in technology.
<P>
	Of all of the savings that were achieved by the Mississauga 
hospital and by every other hospital across Canada, not one penny 
was transferred back to the federal government. The federal 
government has continued to fund at the same level and has 
received no credit for health care improvements over the decades.
<P>
	Does the member not believe that we have to look for ways to 
improve the productivity of all operations, including health care, 
that we have to look for ways to ensure funding is satisfactory for 
the provision of good service, not the same level of dollar service, 
but improved productivity and a better value for the dollar being 
spent?
<P>
	Changes are being made. The federal government is only getting 
its share of the savings. It is simply one example which shows this 
member has not carefully thought out the reasons the federal 
government should share in the savings that have been achieved 
across Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilmour:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member clearly illustrates what 
I have just been saying. Instead of commenting on the problems or 
solutions in British Columbia, he tells us what is going on in 
Ontario. That has been the problem for the last 30 years. We have 
been hearing about central Canada to the exclusion of British 
Columbia.
<P>
	The member also misses the point that Canadians clearly want to 
see the best uses made of their tax dollars which in many cases are 
wasted by government. The government is in areas where it should 
not be and it should get out. That is where the government should 
cut. It should not cut transfer payments to the provinces in health, 
welfare and education. The government wants to cut $4.5 billion 
which is obscene.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to address the budget of the federal government. I will do a couple 
of things. First, I intend to compare a good budget with this Liberal 
government's bad budget. I want to make a few points before I 
start.
<P>
	The job of a finance minister and the purpose of a budget is to 
represent fairly and accurately the balance sheet of a nation. Let us 
examine the record.
<P>
	On page five of the budget speech the minister of myth-sorry 
the Minister of Finance-claims, brags and asserts: ``In this budget 
we are not raising personal taxes. We are not raising corporate 
taxes. We are not raising excise taxes. In fact, we are not raising 
taxes''. All the backbenchers rose and applauded. All those good 
members of Parliament rose to applaud.
<P>
	However, on Table 3, at page 19 of the ``Budget in Brief'' 
entitled ``Summary of tax measures,'' we clearly see that he has 
raised taxes this year by $100 million. Next year he projects to 
raise taxes by $245 million and the year after that by $390 million. 
Is that a deliberate misrepresentation or was it simply an oversight 
on his part when he chose to use such inflammatory rhetoric?
<P>
<B>(1520 )</B>
<P>
	The finance minister-sorry, the minister of myth-also brags 
and claims that he has broken the back of the deficit, as if that was 
the problem. He has identified the wrong problem. The problem is 
the debt and the interest cost to service that debt.
<P>
	He tells us half of the equation. In algebra we all know that two 
sides of an equation must balance or there is something wrong with 
the equation. All he talks about is one side. He talks about cutting 
the deficit and getting it down to five or six. He always starts at six. 
I forgot about the part where he inflated the Conservative 
government's miscalculations: six, five, four, three, two, but he 
never tells us when we get to zero. At the same time, he does not 
tell us the other side of the equation.
<P>
	The real problem is that while the deficit is going down it is not 
going down fast enough. He was too chicken and too slow to make 
the cuts in the first year of his operation when he should have. He 
waited over two years. The debt is going up. It is rising by $40 
billion, $30 billion, $25 billion, $30 billion. He came in at $508 
billion. He is going to exit at $608 billion by his own projections. 
He does not talk about that. All he talks about is half of the story.
<P>
	We also know the GST is a great contributor to the underground 
economy. He promised in opposition to get rid of it and/or replace 
it which has not been done. Now the finance minister, the minister 
of myth, is saying that harmonization is the answer. He is saying 
this is how it will be replaced.
<P>
	However, in opposition that man stood here in defiance of the 
finance minister at the time and said: ``Harmonization is no answer. 
If you harmonize with the provinces and their provincial sales taxes 
all you accomplish is that you never get rid of the GST. We would 
get rid of it. We would not harmonize''. That was basically what he 
said.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1554"> 1554 </A></B>
<P>
	Now that he is the finance minister he is harmonizing the GST 
which will increase costs for the provinces. He has a non-starter 
there and he knows it. He is trying to bribe the Atlantic region. 
That is how he is trying to solve his problems.
<P>
	This budget is targeted at the financial markets. He did a good 
job there. He was smart. It helps monetary policy and helps to bring 
stability at a time when we are very concerned about the poor job 
the Conservatives did. I will give him credit for that, it did help. He 
set a target for a deficit and he met it. He kept setting targets which 
he met.
<P>
	However, those targets were so soft that it was like saying let me 
on the ice, coach. I will skate up and down that ice once without 
falling. Do you think you could do that, Mr. Speaker? I think so. I 
think most Canadians could do that even if they were out of shape 
like I am.
<P>
	My point is this budget has appealed to the analysts because of 
what the finance minister has done, which is what one generally 
does. A person sets a target and if his corporation meets it he is 
looked on favourably. However, this budget should be about 
people, the taxpayers, our children and our grandchildren, the 
shareholders in this country. He has let them down tremendously.
<P>
	Every baby who is born in this country has the obligation of a 
$20,000 debt right off the bat. That is the baby's share in helping to 
pay off and service Canada's debt and deficit. Every taxpayer owes 
about $40,000, federally speaking only. This budget is not for our 
children and grandchildren. They will pay dearly for this ever 
increasing debt.
<P>
	By making the four points as I have made them and by pointing 
out from the start that the finance minister's obligation is to present 
a budget that fairly and accurately represents the finances of the 
country, do you, Mr. Speaker, feel that he has represented the 
financial picture fairly and accurately? Regardless of your opinion, 
Mr. Speaker, I submit that he has not. However, we both know that 
the ultimate decision on this budget will be made by the taxpayers 
of this country.
<P>
	I would like to get to the comparison of a good budget and a bad 
budget. The good budget I refer to has been put together by the 
minister of finance of the province of Manitoba. This budget has a 
number of tremendous features which this finance minister could 
learn from and could actually adopt.
<P>
	The Manitoba government has introduced an act, the balanced 
budget, debt repayment and taxpayer protection legislation for 
which it has received nothing but compliments and praise from all 
groups across the country, both business and taxpayers. This 
budget clearly shows it has a surplus. There is an operating budget 
of $385 million and a surplus of $48 million. Does the federal 
government have that kind of a budget? No.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	The provincial government can offer an increase of $70 million 
to local governments because it has a surplus budget. Rather than 
offering more to the provinces, the federal government has to offer 
less. It makes its spending cuts on the backs of the provinces by 
transferring $7 billion of the Canada health and social transfer to 
the provinces. It is a wonder rocks are not thrown at the House of 
Commons but instead are thrown at buildings like Queen's Park.
<P>
	The Manitoba budget has a tax rate reduction. There is tax relief 
for the provincial taxpayers of Manitoba. Does the federal 
government have a tax reduction for the Canadian taxpayer? No.
<P>
	The major difference between the budgets of the Manitoba 
government and the federal government is in the definition of an 
operating balance. The Government of Manitoba takes its revenues 
and expenses and then under expenditures it includes the public 
debt costs. It shows operating revenue which is made up of 
expenses and the interest costs to service its debt. That is what it 
calls operating revenue.
<P>
	In the federal government's presentation of operating revenue or 
balance, the government takes its revenues, subtracts program 
spending and defines operating balance to create the illusion, the 
misconception, that it has an operating surplus. Then it subtracts 
the interest costs to service the debt.
<P>
	It is an accounting difference of opinion. Both are legal and both 
are acceptable but one is deceiving. One view tries to show the 
federal government is doing a better job than it is. Saying that it has 
an operating surplus without including the interest costs to service 
the debt does not fairly and accurately represent the financial status 
of the federal government.
<P>
	It is a small difference in accounting procedure but it is a huge 
difference in the psychology and perception of the Canadian 
taxpayer. We have to stop this game of smoke and mirrors. I do not 
want to call the finance minister the minister of myth. I want to 
give the finance minister a compliment for recognizing the needs 
and the problems of this country.
<P>
	Half the solution to a problem is identifying the problem. The 
problem, I will repeat, is the debt. The Liberals can brag all they 
want about how the deficit is coming down, but tell me why the 
debt is going up. They can brag all they want about the spending 
cuts they are making, which they never promised to do but thanks 
to us they are. However, why is the interest cost going up? The cuts 
are equal to the increase in costs. Where are we? We are treading 
water. The time bomb is ticking and might burst one day.
<P>
	We all talked a few years ago about hitting the wall. That wall is 
when nobody who gets elected to this Chamber has the courage to 
do what is right. To do what  is right is to be fiscally responsible, to 
present a balanced budget and to have a social conscience, to 
properly define legitimate government programs, not the give-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1555"> 1555 </A></B>
<P>
aways the government continues to support. It is not to reduce 
transfers to provinces and transfer the problem.
<P>
	We have to reduce transfers to individuals because some are too 
generous. A lot of them are too generous. But no, this government 
will not do that. It wants to continue the game of getting elected the 
old way.
<P>
	This is what the province of Manitoba thinks about the great 
social values of this wonderful Liberal government. This year, the 
Liberal government reduced federal funding to health, education 
and family services by $24 million. Next year it will reduce it by 
$147 million and the year after by $220 million. The province has 
to handle it.
<P>
	The finance minister from Manitoba said: ``We had hoped that in 
setting its priorities the federal government would recognize the 
importance Canadians attach to health, education and family 
services. The federal budget proves little evidence of any priority 
emphasis on these vital services''.
<P>
	Our zero in three budget cuts to these three programs of health 
care, education and welfare were only $3.3 billion. The 
government's cuts were $6.6 billion while ours were $3.3 billion 
less. Talk about slash and burn.
<P>
<B>(1530 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Minister for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities 
Agency and Minister of Western Economic Diversification, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has been comparing the 
federal budget to the Manitoba budget and for some reason 
overlooks the Reform Party's budgets.
<P>
	The Reform Party budget makes certain suggestions for cuts, for 
example, cuts to seniors' benefits, 15 per cent; unemployment 
insurance, 22 per cent; aboriginal peoples, 24 per cent; 
post-secondary education, 9 per cent; health, 11 per cent; the 
Canada assistance plan, 34 per cent; equalization, 35 per cent; other 
transfers that are not caught in that web by another 6 per cent; total 
cash transfers over and above all of that by another cut of 24 per 
cent to provinces; other social spending that is not caught by this, 
another 15 per cent; a total cut on average of 20 per cent in social 
spending.
<P>
	Is the hon. in favour of these types of cuts in light of the speech 
he has made?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> He has you there.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I hear another comment in the 
hinterland of backbenchers whose voice sometimes sounds like a 
trained seal.
<P>
	However, we are not supposed to really answer questions in the 
Chamber. We are supposed to avoid them. I will do the unusual. I 
will answer this gentleman's question.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you bet in our zero in three budget we had cuts and 
you bet we had the cuts he is talking about. To talk percentages is 
one thing. To talk numbers is another.
<P>
	We proposed $25 billion worth of cuts over a three year period, 
an average of $8 billion a year. We would have found that area 
where we are wasting the most money.
<P>
	I find it ridiculous and ludicrous that we have an initiative called 
eliminate child poverty by the year 2000, while a million children 
are starving in this country and we spend through our taxation 
system currently $9 billion through five different programs. Why 
can we not take the first billion dollars we take in and find those 
million children and give them the money they need so they do not 
have to be put up for adoption, so they have food, shelter and 
clothing? That is the waste that we are talking about. That is the 
kind of program we would like to see.
<P>
	Another difference is, unlike the politically sensitive and 
politically nervous Liberals who are afraid, who do not have the 
political courage to do what needs to be done, we would have made 
the cuts in the first year. We would have started the cuts and in the 
first year the cuts would have been in the neighbourhood of $8 
billion, or $9 billion, or $10 billion. The government has now made 
$7 billion in cuts two years later.
<P>
	The difference is that by the end of this mandate the government 
will exit adding over $100 billion to the debt, whereas our program 
if adopted would have added only $50 billion. What this is all about 
is having the political will to do what is right for the Canadian 
taxpayer.
<P>
	By not acting when they should have the Liberals have just 
deferred the problem, delayed the problem, run up the costs. The 
politicians who will follow this bunch, who will follow us, will 
have a greater problem because the interest costs are rising.
<P>
	We had a balanced budget and that is what the government 
should have done. If a government is ever elected that has the 
political will to present a balanced budget and to do it and create a 
surplus budget like Manitoba, it should follow that model. That 
model is good. It should get some advice from people who finally 
can create surpluses. That is what we need.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise in this debate on the budget. I will 
address one small aspect but one which is very important to me.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1556"> 1556 </A></B>
<P>
	During his budget speech the finance minister suggested there 
would be increased opportunities for Canadians to donate to 
charities and he proposed raising the annual limit on charitable 
donations from 20 per cent to 50 per cent and that the limit would 
be increased to 100 per cent for gifts willed to charities.
<P>
	The rationale behind this, as it emerged from the minister's 
remarks, was that as government gets more and more out of 
services to Canadians it is hoped charities in Canada will take up 
the slack, as it were.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	I applaud the minister's intention in giving greater opportunities 
for charities to have a larger role in bringing services to Canadians 
and giving Canadians, in turn, an opportunity to donate more 
effectively to charities.
<P>
	In one sense the finance minister's move is premature. 
Unfortunately the charitable industry in Canada, which consists of 
some 73,000 charities with about $86 billion in revenue, is an 
industry which is essentially unregulated.
<P>
	It is controlled almost solely by certain amendments to the 
Income Tax Act, 1976, which pertain basically to a few rules about 
how charities should spend their money and provide for an annual 
information return that charities have to fill out.
<P>
	Beyond that there is little regulation of this huge industry. This is 
exceptional. In Britain, the United States and in France the 
charitable is very closely controlled under a great number of 
regulations.
<P>
	The problem is that with the lack of government regulation 
comes lack of accountability. Over the past two months I have 
undertaken a rather elaborate study of charities by looking at their 
T3010 forms. This is an annual financial reporting instrument they 
have to fill out. This form is very inadequate for getting a grip on 
what they are doing but it is the only tool the public has.
<P>
	In reviewing these forms and in examining quite a spectrum of 
charities, perhaps 500, all kinds of problems come to the surface. 
There are charities engaged in actual political activity, supporting 
or opposing political candidates. There are companies giving funds 
to foundations and then borrowing back the money, which is not 
something we want to see. We see excessively disproportionate 
fundraising costs versus the amount of funds raised.
<P>
	There are marketing firms that actually set up charities in order 
to give themselves an income. There are charities that do not fit 
definitions of charities. The definition of charity is so loose that 
virtually anyone can apply to set up a charity and be successful and 
get the tax breaks associated with it.
<P>
	Some charities are engaged in all manner of special interest 
group campaigns that have little or nothing to do  with helping the 
general public. It goes on and on. There are offshore charities that 
raise money in Canada that are controlled entirely offshore. There 
is no accountability even there.
<P>
	Perhaps the most salient point, there are charities that have huge 
finance and management costs quite disproportionate to the 
amount of money they spend on the charitable activities.
<P>
	When the finance minister proposes getting the charitable sector 
more actively involved in serving Canadians, we have to consider 
whether the charitable sector is at present able to fulfil the function 
adequately and effectively.
<P>
	The ultimate problem is that for years Revenue Canada has 
resisted suggestions, including suggestions coming from the 
auditor general, that charities be subject to penalty when they fail 
to comply with existing rules and regulations.
<P>
	Unfortunately there is no penalty to discipline charities that are 
abusing their responsibility other than revocation of charitable 
status. This is a lengthy and difficult process which usually does 
not occur except in very small numbers.
<P>
	We have the fundamental problem associated. Where it has 
enormous meaning to what the finance minister has proposed with 
respect to encouraging Canadians to participate in charities is 
something called the 80 per cent rule.
<P>
	In 1976 an amendment to the Income Tax Act required that 
charities spend 80 per cent of their tax receiptable donations on 
charitable services. That left 20 per cent for management, 
administration and salaries.
<P>
	Unfortunately the authors of that amendment confined it purely 
to tax receiptable donations when charitable income is mainly and 
ultimately, believe it or not, from government. Most governments 
at every level support charities which may be universities, 
hospitals or CIDA charities associated with foreign affairs or 
charities associated with Heritage Canada or Health Canada.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	Unfortunately because the 80 per cent rule applies only to tax 
receiptable donations, it does not apply to grants from government 
or funds raised by other means, for instance, bingos. It does not 
apply to bequests left by people in their wills. If we examine a 
couple of hundred T3010 forms we would find that the vast 
majority of charities are nowhere near the 80 per cent rule with 
regard to their total revenues.
<P>
	Charities are by a large not very well managed. Some charities 
are spending perhaps 30, 40 or 50 per cent of their total revenue on 
actual charitable activities. This is quite an enormous inefficiency 
which Canadians would be very concerned about when they put up 
their charitable dollars.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1557"> 1557 </A></B>
<P>
	The problem is we have no way of controlling that with charities 
as the legislation now stands. The revenue minister cannot dictate 
to a charity to improve its management. There is the possibility 
of an audit of a charity but an audit looks only at fraudulent use 
or improprieties by a charity. It does not look at the ethics of 
spending by a charity. Consequently a charity could be very small 
and could choose to pay $180,000 to its executive director or, as 
was recently in the news, the case of the Red Cross deciding to 
pay $1,000 a day to a former principal officer so he could testify 
before the Krever commission.
<P>
	There are all kinds of ethical problems within charities because 
there is no mechanism for an ethical audit. One reason there is no 
mechanism is that there is not the level of disclosure or regulation 
existing either within the law or any other means which pertain to 
charities. We have no decent control on how well charities do their 
business. Therefore the finance minister proposes involving 
charities more and more with helping Canadians and taking over 
where government leaves off in providing services to Canadians.
<P>
	We are sure the level of management of these charities is 
actually below that of our own bureaucracy. We must ask ourselves 
if the finance minister's move is wise. The finance minister is 
aiming in the right direction. Before we can involve charities in the 
way proposed in the budget speech we must have legislation which 
will set the house of charities in order.
<P>
	We need new legislation similar to what has been put forward in 
the United Kingdom where charities have been completely 
overhauled. We need to do this in Canada and then the finance 
minister's proposal to tap the generosity of Canadians to support 
charities, bring new services to people and to encourage the very 
good charities and get rid of the ones that are poorly managed. 
Then it will be a very fine move.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it was interesting to listen to the remarks the hon. member 
made with regard to charities.
<P>
	It reminds me of the illustration of somebody trying to pick a 
tiny sliver out of somebody else's eye but cannot do it because of 
the log in his own eye.
<P>
	He says charities are not well managed. Before he criticizes 
charities for not being well managed or having high administration 
costs, why does he not look at his own government? If he is to 
correct something and complain about high administration costs, 
why not first of all look in his own back yard and see the huge 
bureaucracy which has been created here in Ottawa?
<P>
	If we are to create another bureaucracy to regulate charities, it 
will not solve the problem. It will only compound it. On his 
statement that charities are not well managed, I suspect that a lot of 
them are a lot better managed than the government is.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	He also said charities are allowed to lobby government. The 
government funds special interest groups that turn around and 
lobby the government for more money. If he sees a problem with 
charities' being concerned about some of the moves of 
government, those charities have values and they would like to see 
the government translate some of those values.
<P>
	The problem I have with that approach is how can we complain 
about charities when we have special interest groups receiving 
huge sums of money directly from the government to lobby the 
government? If that is not unconscionable, if that is not a huge 
problem, I do not know what is. We must look in our own back 
yards before we start trying to find more ways to collect tax.
<P>
	A typical Liberal Party move is when it does not have enough 
money it tries to figure out another way of collecting the money 
without giving the impression it is actually increasing taxes. It does 
this all the time and now it will go after charities.
<P>
	There may be a need to tighten it up but we must first of all fix 
the big problems in the country. We must reduce government 
spending. The Liberals should look at the bureaucracy they have 
created before they start going after charities.
<P>
	The hon. member is trying to find fault in areas in which I think 
there may be some small problems. However, let us fix the big 
things instead of picking away at some of these little things.
<P>
	How can we get involved in the regulation of charities if we do 
not share their goals? Government typically gets involved in all of 
these things and tells others how to do it when it will destroy a lot 
of the things these charities are aiming to do in society. Charities 
play an important role in our society. If the government is to start 
undermining what they do I have grave concerns about that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am mystified by the member's 
challenge about the simple premise that charities be more 
accountable. There is a major revenue issue here in the sense that 
there is $86 billion in revenue going through charities without 
proper monitoring or decent monitoring by Revenue Canada. 
Therefore if we have only 10 per cent abuse in that sector we have 
$8.6 billion that has been lost to the economy.
<P>
	As to the issue of special interest groups, many of the special 
interest groups funded by government are charities, which is 
precisely the problem. I do not believe they should be charities. I 
do not believe they should have charitable status, particularly if 
they are advocacy groups.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1558"> 1558 </A></B>
<P>
	This is an area in which I am merely calling for legislation to 
bring a greater degree of accountability to public organizations. 
The member does surprise me by finding this unacceptable.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Marlene Cowling (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
participate in the budget debate, bringing a rural Manitoba 
perspective to the discussions.
<P>
	The budget brought forward by the finance minister is yet 
another reason why the approval rating of the government by the 
Canadian people continues at unprecedented heights. We are 
providing the kind of government Canadians want. We are tackling 
the deficit while protecting social programs. We are governing with 
integrity. We are listening to what Canadians are saying and 
responding.
<P>
	This is definitely a good news budget. It is good news for rural 
Canada. It is good news for the resource sectors, agriculture, 
mining, forestry and energy. It is good news for our greatest 
resource, our people. It is good news for jobs and economic 
growth. It is good news for all Canadians.
<P>
	There is more optimism in the agriculture sector than I have seen 
in all of my years as a farmer. Farmers are receiving their WGTA 
payments right now. They are using this money to diversify their 
operations and bring in new efficiencies. Farmers are at the cutting 
edge and must be to compete in today's competitive world market.
<P>
	The elimination of the WGTA is encouraging a boom of value 
added processing in Manitoba. This is crucial for job creation and 
economic growth. Increasingly we are adding value to the 
commodities we produce in our home communities instead of 
sending these raw resources east, west or south.
<P>
<B>(1550 )</B>
<P>
	Since the 1995 budget the following projects have been 
announced in rural Manitoba: a $55 million investment in a canola 
crushing plant in Ste. Agathe; a $40 million hog processing plant 
announced by Schneiders meats; a $200 million expansion of the 
Simplot fertilizer company in Brandon; a $5 million pasta 
processing plant in Altona; an $8.9 million investment by Canmera 
Foods in its Altona canola crushing plant; an $18 million 
investment by Carnation Foods in Carberry's potato processing 
plant; an expansion of the Canoat plant in Portage.
<P>
	In my riding of Dauphin-Swan River a very industrious group 
from Russell is putting together an ethanol and cattle finishing 
plant that will be a windfall for many surrounding local 
communities. We also have a group of farmers wanting to set up an 
inland terminal in the area. If this is not a demonstration of 
optimism in the future of farming, I do not know what is.
<P>
	All of these examples clearly show the confidence farmers and 
agri-food companies have in the future of agriculture and in the 
future of rural Manitoba. It shows the confidence they have in the 
Liberal government.
<P>
	It is because the Liberal government and the Minister of Finance 
are creating a climate of opportunity that these crucial projects are 
a reality. These are the types of projects which will continue to 
encourage job creation in rural Canada.
<P>
	Dollars are tight. We all realize that. The challenge becomes 
setting priorities and doing what is best for the agriculture sector in 
the long term.
<P>
	What are we doing to keep farmers on the land and to create jobs 
for our children so they can remain in their home communities? We 
are investing our limited financial resources in infrastructure, in 
research, in adaptation measures and in international trade to help 
the agriculture and agri-food industries expand for the food 
production sector.
<P>
	We are already well on our way to exceeding our goal of $20 
billion in agriculture exports by the year 2000. Our exports have 
risen by about 30 per cent over the last two years alone.
<P>
	This is good news for the farmers in my riding of 
Dauphin-Swan River. It means strong, long term markets which 
will keep and help farmers. It will also keep the prices up as well as 
the demand.
<P>
	A good example of how we are responding to the farm 
community is the decision to accelerate the payment of the $300 
million adjustment fund to compensate for changes to the pooling 
of the seaway costs. Instead of spreading the payments over six 
years, the money will flow within three years, putting money in 
farmers' pockets faster and making improvements to local 
infrastructure.
<P>
	The Canadian agriculture and agri-food sector has a proven 
record of successfully adapting to the constant changes facing the 
industry. In the years to come new trade agreements, new markets 
and new technologies must and will be met with the same 
determination.
<P>
	Similarly, the measures we have taken in the area of natural 
resources also further the government's commitment to rural 
Canada and to sustainable development and to jobs and growth in 
the forestry, mining, energy and earth science sectors.
<P>
	Our focus on renewable energy and energy efficiency will 
contribute to growth and jobs at home and abroad. The renewable 
energy sector offers significant potential to help Canada move 
toward our international climate change and the commitment to 
stabilize greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1559"> 1559 </A></B>
<P>
	Through changes to legislation and regulations we are creating 
an environment that encourages growth in the energy and mining 
sectors to create jobs and fuel the economy.
<P>
	Our financial constraints have meant that we have had to make 
some tough decisions.
<P>
	We are streamlining our involvement in nuclear energy and we 
are working with AECL to find alternative sources of funding and 
other agreements.
<P>
	These efforts are progressing very well and the Minister of 
Natural Resources is to be commended for her commitment in this 
regard. I also commend the minister for her commitment to 
building partnerships with stakeholders in the natural resources 
sectors. She has worked tirelessly with industry and the provinces 
to ensure that Canada will continue to reap the economic benefits 
the resource sectors bring.
<P>
	The minister is following through on the Liberal government's 
commitment to work with Canadians for the good of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1555 )</B>
<P>
	There was a great deal of rejoicing in Dauphin-Swan River that 
the budget contained no new taxes and no tax increases. Canadians 
told us to tackle the deficit through spending cuts rather than tax 
increases. We are listening to Canadians. We are surpassing our 
deficit targets without raising taxes. Deficit cutting is very 
important but most important are our people, the greatest resource 
Canada has.
<P>
	Liberal governments in Canada have a long history of helping 
people at home and abroad. I am proud to be part of this 
government, which is continuing this proud tradition. In the budget 
we have provided the balance Canadians want between the 
economy and social programs. We are meeting our tough deficit 
targets while making strong financial commitments to medicare 
and pensions. This is good for Canada and good for 
Dauphin-Swan River.
<P>
	We are establishing a stable, secure and growing financial 
commitment to medicare, post-secondary education and social 
assistance. After a two year levelling off period we will be 
increasing transfers to the provinces in each of the next three years. 
It will be up to the provinces to spend those dollars smarter, to 
ensure the people of Canada continue to have access to quality 
health care and education. We are continuing our commitment to 
older Canadians.
<P>
	While other parties want to let seniors fend for themselves the 
Liberal government recognizes the contribution seniors have made 
and will continue to make to Canadian society. The budget 
announced a new seniors benefit designed to help those who need 
financial assistance the most. The new program will protect current 
seniors, improve benefits for low income seniors  and guarantee 
that future generations will be able to count on benefits when they 
retire.
<P>
	Although we have cut our federal spending significantly we 
recognize that in today's economy we need to better target 
resources to benefit families. We are helping families through 
changes to child care expense deductions and increases in the 
working income supplement and through improving the 
employment insurance program for low income parents.
<P>
	Like all budgets, this is a budget for the present and for the 
future. It is providing Canadians with a growing economy while 
reducing the deficit and it makes a strong commitment to the 
well-being of our greatest resource, our people.
<P>
	I applaud the Minister of Finance for this budget and his 
commitment to all Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened very 
carefully to the remarks made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Natural Resources, and there is something I do not 
understand in her remarks. She seems not to be telling the whole 
truth.
<P>
	For example, she said this was an extraordinary budget for the 
agricultural sector. She may be right if she is talking about the 
agricultural sector in western Canada, but she forgot to say that the 
agricultural sector in Quebec is really penalized by the rules put in 
place by the present federal government. Here is an example. The 
transportation of wheat used to be subsidized, which allowed all 
Canadians and people all over the world to buy wheat at a lower 
price. It also allowed Quebec producers to buy wheat for the 
production of poultry, pork, eggs and so on.
<P>
	So what did the government do? It decided to subsidize western 
wheat producers directly and, at the same time, to eliminate the 
dairy subsidy that was paid to Quebec dairy producers. Is it not 
gross injustice? Maybe the member should say that clearly to this 
House and to the people of Quebec who are watching.
<P>
	I remember working very hard to prevent subsidies from being 
paid directly to wheat producers. It was a lot more equitable to all 
Canadian producers when the government subsidized the 
transportation of wheat instead of subsidizing wheat producers, and 
I say it again, to the detriment of Quebec and Ontario agricultural 
producers.
<P>
	I would like the member to give me a clear explanation and to 
tell us the whole truth on that subject.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Cowling:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased the member asked that 
question. It allows me on behalf of the government to set the record 
straight. Quebec does get its fair share from this Liberal 
government.
<P>
	When we talk about subsidizing and tariffication I know there is 
fairness. I am a farmer myself. The minister of agriculture has 
worked very hard with groups within Quebec to ensure Quebec 
continues to get its fair share.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> There are approximately two 
minutes remaining. I would like to split it evenly between the 
question and the answer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I see we are going in the right direction by stressing the 
importance of value added industries.
<P>
	Would the hon. member for Dauphin-Swan River comment on 
why we have lost value added industries like milling plants, pasta 
plants and slaughtering plants? Why has it come to the point where 
we are more or less exporting our raw resources instead of adding 
value to them?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Cowling:</B> Mr. Speaker, clearly the member of the third 
party is out of touch with what is happening. I mentioned in my 
speech that the government is bringing forward opportunities for 
diversification and value added enterprises.
<P>
	I gave examples that happened in the hon. member's home 
province of Manitoba. There is more optimism in the agri-food and 
agriculture sector than I can ever remember. The government is 
doing very good things for the agriculture sector and for farmers 
right across the country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to take part to this debate, 
following the speech on the budget. I would like to take a few 
minutes to talk about the comments made by the member for 
Dauphin-Swan River and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister 
of Natural Resources. As a matter of fact, the speech she has just 
given was somewhat out of touch with reality, to say the least, in 
terms of the repercussions that the budget already has and will 
continue to have on Canadians.
<P>
	She talked in particular about agriculture. As my colleague from 
Longueuil has so well explained, Quebec farmers will lose a good 
part of the advantages that federal subsidies gave them. In order to 
show how reality is completely different-otherwise the hon. 
member must be living a an environment totally different from 
ours-she said that the budgetary decisions made by the Liberal 
government have made farmers in her area very happy indeed, that 
everyone is happy, that every farmer  she meets is smiling since the 
government decided to do away with the grain transportation 
subsidies.
<P>
	I can understand why farmers in the West are smiling. If I were 
one of them I would be grinning from ear to ear. Over two billion 
dollars in subsidies were given last year, in the 1995-96 budget, to 
compensate for the reduction of grain transportation subsidies.
<P>
	The non taxable part of the support was assessed. Western 
farmers received cash outs to compensate for the decrease in the 
value of their properties and they were given direct subsidies to 
facilitate the transition to other types of agriculture. The subsidies 
given to western farmers to compensate, as I said, for the loss of 
wheat transportation subsidies, are estimated at $3 billion.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	Meanwhile, what is happening in the east? As my hon. colleague 
indicated, our farmers are required to pay more for their grain but 
when the time comes to apply similar measures to them-I am 
referring to milk subsidies cuts-there is a double standard.
<P>
	Last year, the government reduced milk subsidies paid to 
producers by 15 per cent. This year, producers are told that the 
subsidies will be completely eliminated over a five-year period, 
without any form of compensation. And the hon. member is telling 
us that all is well and everyone is happy with the decisions made by 
the federal government?
<P>
	Our colleague, the Secretary of State for Agriculture and 
Agri-Food and for Fisheries and Oceans, and member for 
Beauséjour also stated, in response to a question from our critic for 
agriculture, and repeated in this House that, following the decision 
made last year to cut the subsidies paid to producers, 
consultations-to which both the Secretary of State and the 
Minister of Agriculture participated-would be carried out to 
sound out the opinion of the industry. Now the Secretary of State 
rises in his place and formally declares in this House: ``We have the 
support of milk producer associations to use this approach''. He 
said so and repeated it with a straight face, without flinching.
<P>
	As the Secretary of State for Agriculture and Agri-Food and for 
Fisheries and Oceans, and member for Beauséjour was making this 
statement about milk producer representatives being in agreement, 
I was reading, in my hometown newspaper, <I>La Tribune</I>, what the 
president of the milk producers association had said. This is not a 
member of the Bloc Quebecois. Perhaps he is a separatist at heart, 
but it is not obvious from the article.
<P>
	What does he have to say this dairy producer representing his 
union in our region, in the Eastern Townships? ``Ottawa is on the 
backs of the farmers''. He criticizes the elimination of the subsidy 
over a five-year period. He proves beyond a doubt that the federal 
government acted unilaterally. So if the minister  and the Secretary 
of State did in fact consult anyone, it certainly was not these 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1561"> 1561 </A></B>
<P>
people. Representatives of the UPA in the Eastern Townships and 
throughout Quebec never at any time agreed to such a measure.
<P>
	The head of the UPA in the Eastern Townships, Jacques Dion, 
added that other demonstrations will be needed. It is time to bring 
out the tractors. This is the only way, it appears, the government 
understands.
<P>
	I do not think my colleague for Dauphin-Swan River met with 
the same representations, needless to say, and I understand. I have 
just explained that the decisions affecting the west do not have the 
same scope as those affecting the east-and it is not just Quebec, 
we are talking about Ontario too. So, to say that the agricultural 
measures in the government's budget were positive is, to say the 
least, going too far.
<P>
	I would also like to talk about cuts in the area of unemployment 
insurance. In fact, the main measures, the primary effects of the 
budget we are seeing this year are not to be found in the 1996-97 
budget, but in the 1995-96 one, since the cuts to transfers to the 
provinces announced last year took effect last year and this year. As 
far as unemployment insurance is concerned, it is the same thing. 
The Minister of Finance added to his revenues to reduce the federal 
government's deficit. He dipped into the unemployment insurance 
fund and took nearly $5 billion.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	The cuts that will result from the changes made to the UI 
legislation will make the surplus in the UI fund grow bigger, which 
means that the government will be able to draw even more money 
from the fund to reduce its deficit at the expense of the 
unemployed. Everyone in Canada knows that, because of federal 
government policies, the unemployment rate in Quebec is much 
higher than the Canadian average.
<P>
	In that sense, Quebec can be said to be principal homeland of 
unemployment in Canada. The motion passed by the Liberal Party 
on the weekend could have said, in addition, that Quebec is not 
only predominantly French speaking, but also one of the places 
where the unemployment rate is the highest. As I said, we have the 
federal government's long-standing policies to thank for that.
<P>
	Let me give you just one example. The oil refining industry in 
Montreal has completely disappeared as a result of decisions made 
by the federal government. There is a long list of this kind of 
decisions.
<P>
	I will conclude on this because you are signalling that I have 
only one minute left. We have the feeling of living in two 
completely different worlds when we meet in this House. When I 
hear government members praise this budget, I catch myself 
thinking about the poor, the unemployed and the people on welfare 
who are listening to such remarks. They must be telling 
themselves:  ``What country is this? Is this the right place? Perhaps 
I should have my head examined. My perception of reality must we 
skewed, because that sure is not how things are for me. I keep 
growing poorer and poorer, while being given less and less 
opportunities to break out of poverty''.
<P>
	That is the reality. That is the kind of effect the budget before us 
is having on people.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was very 
interested in the member's comments about his constituency in the 
area of the eastern townships. I had the pleasure of having him visit 
my constituency of Kootenay East about a year and a half ago when 
we were doing some work on the European Union meeting. He will 
be familiar with my constituency which is probably not too 
dissimilar to his.
<P>
	I would like to advise him that it is not just a case of British 
Columbia, Quebec, Prince Edward Island or Manitoba. There is no 
selection on the part of the central government to bring in hostile 
action or activity toward Quebec.
<P>
	I would suggest that he consider what he learned while he was in 
my constituency about the kinds of primary activities many 
businesses in my riding are in, which he has indicated are common 
to his constituency. Many practices of the central government that 
are construed as being aimed at or against Quebec are not aimed at 
or against Quebec. They come from an ignorance based on the 
central myopic, closed mindedness which exists in Ottawa and is 
exhibited by the Liberal government time and time again.
<P>
	It is not a question of picking on Quebec. We only need to take a 
look at the way the Liberal government of another time brought 
forward the national energy plan which created a full depression in 
the province of Alberta. It is just ignorance on the part of people at 
the centre. It is not aimed at the people of Quebec.
<P>
	While I recognize the hon. member is here as a member of Bloc 
Quebecois with the objective that Quebec should become a 
sovereign nation, he nonetheless should open his mind to this fact: 
more often than not the problem has absolutely nothing to do with 
the central government trying to persecute his province or any 
other area. The persecution is just out of straight ignorance on the 
government's part.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I had indeed the opportunity in the past to visit the riding of my 
colleague from Kootenay East at his invitation. It was a very 
rewarding experience for me, and it was greatly appreciated. I met 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1562"> 1562 </A></B>
<P>
some very nice people,  and I would like to publicly thank my 
colleague for his invitation.
<P>
	That said, when he accuses me of being ignorant or of 
misinterpreting the facts by suggesting that the federal government 
is discriminating against Quebec compared to western Canada, I 
simply want to remind him that, in my remarks regarding 
agriculture, I insisted that this would affect milk producers in both 
Quebec and Ontario, where this industry is concentrated. I never 
said that Quebec was being singled out.
<P>
	I said and I continue to say-my colleague can interpret this as 
an argument in favour of our sovereignty objective, but the facts 
are there-that the federal government's decisions concerning 
Quebec's economic development have had a disastrous impact in 
several sectors, including oil refining. This is a fact, and I invite my 
colleague to come and visit Montreal's east end. Some of my 
colleagues will be pleased to show him the disastrous impact of 
these policies. He will see that this is not an opinion, but a very 
concrete reality.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to take part in the debate on the budget, 
which is now coming to an end. For years we have been told about 
the need to control the federal debt, about the fact that this huge 
debt would require a decentralizing process, about the fact that 
while federal politicians did not have the political will to do it they 
would have no choice because of budget constraints. Yet, this is not 
happening.
<P>
	Why? First, because the federal government has found another 
scheme to continue to get involved in fields of provincial 
jurisdiction and to spend like it did before. I am referring to the UI 
fund. The government has made hostages of employers and 
workers. First, it makes them contribute to the fund and then it uses 
the UI surplus to continue to get involved in manpower training and 
to set up programs in various social areas which come under 
provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	In a way, this is a variation of what the Trudeau government did 
for years, when it borrowed on foreign markets to preserve its 
artificial Canadian dream. Now that it can no longer rely on 
international lenders because our indebtedness has reached an 
unacceptable level, the government has found another way of doing 
the same thing by using the UI fund.
<P>
	The current situation is highly unusual in that there is a big 
surplus in the UI fund, but the government will still target seasonal 
workers, those who rely on UI benefits every year, not because they 
are bad workers, but simply because they work in industries which 
cannot operate throughout the year and because there are no other 
jobs available for them during the winter months. These people are 
like hostages. Moreover, they are low and middle-income workers 
who will still have to do more to help reduce the deficit, since the 
government decided to  lower the level of UI contributions of 
high-income earners.
<P>
	This is very surprising on the part of a Liberal government. It 
seems as though the Liberals have given up their social democratic 
principles of the seventies in favour of the ideas of the 
Conservatives and the Reformers, something they should not be 
proud of.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	There are also some fairly amazing examples of federal 
intervention. While claiming there is no money the government 
created a health research fund with tens of millions of dollars 
available in a sector that comes under provincial jurisdiction. That 
is set out clearly in the Constitution. The provinces have developed 
expertise in this field, and the federal government takes it upon 
itself to create a health research fund, after having created the 
national forum on health, which will be providing us with findings 
that are out of step with the every day reality, with what is 
experienced every week by the bodies responsible for health 
services in each of the provinces, where concrete front line 
solutions must be found.
<P>
	When all is said and done, it is always the same taxpayer who 
will pay for the national forum on health, who will pay for the 
health research fund, the same one who will pay for health services 
in Quebec and in the other provinces. The taxpayer may well ask 
why duplicate administrations are necessary. Can we still afford 
such a thing?
<P>
	Another example is the desire to create a federal securities 
commission. Here again, there are provincial securities 
commissions in place. They have proven themselves and all that is 
needed is for them to be linked up, but a superstructure such as the 
federal government wishes to put into place is not necessary on top 
of that. It just means more administrative costs.
<P>
	The government would have shown good will if it had said ``In 
this area at least we have not been involved in the past, so we will 
not go putting our big feet into it, adding to the debt and the tax 
burden of Quebecers and Canadians''.
<P>
	In this budget, there is no desire on the part of the federal 
government to cut back on its lifestyle. The key point I feel must be 
made is that this budget contains no initiative for solving the main 
problem of Quebec and Canada. If you survey people today and ask 
what the main problem in our economy is, they will answer 
``employment''.
<P>
	Employment, and the fact that the full potential of our people, in 
Quebec and in Canada, their potential and abilities, are not being 
made use of. We have to keep doing so. Fantastic technologies have 
been put in place, which cast aside people who had the skills and 
the ability to do things.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1563"> 1563 </A></B>
<P>
	There are people who were working in forest management, who, 
in the past, would cut timber. What are we doing with them? Are 
we casting them aside? With the increased productivity machinery 
affords us, we decided to forget about these people all over the 
place and not make proper use of them.
<P>
	This is what is happening with young people as well. The budget 
contains rather distressing measures, such as the reduction in the 
amount people can contribute to labour sponsored venture capital 
corporations or to the new CSN fund. These programs were put in 
place a few years ago, a decade ago. They created jobs; they 
maintained some; they allowed unions to put money into 
businesses, to better understand how the business worked and 
therefore to more easily help with management and avoid 
confrontational labour relations.
<P>
	The government has decided to reduce the amount people can 
contribute to these funds. At the same time the surplus in the 
unemployment insurance fund is being increased. In other words, 
money is being taken from productive funds and put into more 
bureaucratic funds, which are not very effective. There is still time 
for the government to act to avoid such a mistake, which will have 
a disastrous effect on employment.
<P>
	The budget contains another disappointment in the area of 
employment and that is, as regards a review of taxation, the only 
thing this government has chosen to do is set up a technical 
committee. They decided to put off by at least one year the 
decisions that will have to be made, when it has been already two 
years since they came to power and when people from all levels of 
society have clearly expressed their concerns in this regard. We 
must find ways to use the human potential available to us.
<P>
	We have nothing against businesses making big profits, but we 
must ensure that the productivity gain serves not only to 
accumulate money but also to use people's potential. The 
government must ensure that, when compared to other societies in 
North America, in Europe or elsewhere in the world, Quebec and 
Canada are seen as really using the potential of their people. We did 
not only give a chance to the stronger ones to make money and to 
succeed. We managed to put everyone's potential to good use.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	The handicapped must be able to maximize their capacity to 
work. Young people entering the labour force for the first time 
must have had a chance to maximize their potential, in order to 
avoid the present situation, where a lot of people with technical and 
professional training and even people with university degrees just 
waste their potential over years. At some point, it is as if they were 
no longer in the labour force. Then, it is much harder to have them 
re-enter the labour force.
<P>
	I think the government should have made a special effort on that 
front, but it did not do so.
<P>
	We are often told that the opposition does not suggest any 
solutions. On that matter, there were some. The government ought 
to have mentioned a specific goal in the speech from the throne or 
in the budget. Just like it did in matters of deficit control, it should 
have set a job creation goal by stating: ``The goal is such and such a 
level. In one year or two we will have reached that goal and, thanks 
to our political commitment, we will have chosen to really develop 
people's potential''.
<P>
	It could be done also through specific tax measures that would 
benefit employment. A business cutting jobs because of new 
technologies should not only reap advantages in terms of tax 
exemptions but should also be made to bear some costs because it 
is sending to the unemployment lines employees who previously 
had a job. We must find ways to do that. These are not things that 
will come about by the interactions of various market forces. The 
government has a regulatory role to play, and I think it resides in 
actions of this type.
<P>
	We could also have implemented an action plan for all 
departments. Imagine if the Prime Minister had said: ``For 
1996-97, the goal is to reduce the unemployment rate. Each 
department will have its own objective in that area and will have to 
report on its performance one year from now, just as we did for the 
deficit''. The public would have been happier at the end of the year. 
We would have put to good use the potential of a whole generation 
and kindled hope in young people who would have been 
encouraged to start a family, have children and perpetuate our 
society.
<P>
	The 1996 budget could have been the means to such an end. But 
that is not the case and that is why we will vote against it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to thank my colleague. He has put his finger right on the 
problem, and it is an even larger problem in rural areas and in the 
regions.
<P>
	This budget affects farmers. We talked about that earlier. My 
colleague opposite seemed to say that everything is going as it 
should, while in the east things are desperate.
<P>
	For the unemployed this budget is a disaster. In my area, in 
Amqui, a small town of 6,000 inhabitants, 4,500 to 5,000 people 
demonstrated to protest against the employment insurance plan, 
and they did not do so for the fun of it.
<P>
	I remember very well that 20 years ago the same people or their 
fathers or mothers demonstrated in the streets because 
unemployment was at an unacceptable level. This year, their 
children have taken to the street, because the unemployment rate in 
my region is even higher.
<P>
	This means that this budget is not a source of hope but of 
hopelessness.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1564"> 1564 </A></B>
<P>
	Another thing I have just found out is that, as in the case of 
the royal military college in Saint-Jean, the Maurice-Lamontagne 
Institute, a research and development centre in my riding, that is 
wellknown at the local, national and international levels, because 
its researchers come from all over the world, is facing drastic 
budget cuts that will force several of its staff to go find work 
elsewhere.
<P>
	When I asked the Minister if this was true, he told me about the 
need to streamline, that it was Mr. Martin's fault. In my region, it is 
very difficult to accept. They are going to cut funding to Quebec's 
only fisheries research and development school. What tells me that 
the amounts will not be increased in Ontario or elsewhere?
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	This is really very hard to take in Quebec. I referred earlier to the 
Collège militaire royal in Saint-Jean, where our officers used to 
receive superb training in French. That is gone. Now funding for 
the Lamontagne institute will gradually dry up. This was a venture 
with a future, with plans to increase the number of researchers over 
the next five or ten years, until drastic cuts were announced.
<P>
	If that is what my hon. friends opposite call a good budget, I 
suggest that they go and tell that to the regions. As far as producers 
from my region are concerned, the president of the Dairy Farmers 
of Canada lives in my riding, I could almost say in my parish. He 
told me: ``René, it will have a terrible effect''. It is terrible, 
although most producers in our region get by. In terms of climate, 
when I travel to Gatineau, I notice that farmers there can sow one 
month sooner. In our region, farmers have to wait one month, 
sometimes six weeks more before they can do so. Such are the laws 
of nature and there is nothing we can do about it. As a result, 
farmers in the east are penalized. And so are fishermen, with their 
quotas being cut.
<P>
	My hon. colleague from Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup has 
painted a very accurate picture of the situation. I have a simple 
question for him. What future will our young people have after this 
budget is implemented? Will there be incentives to remain in the 
region longer? The university is 120 kilometres away. Up til last 
year, the only cégep was located in Matane, and there was none in 
the Matapedia Valley. This meant that, just to attend college upon 
graduating from high school, our young people had to go to 
Rimouski, Matane or Quebec City. That is totally unacceptable.
<P>
	I will put my question again to my hon. colleague: Does he 
foresee a better future for our young people? Will they be able to 
remain in our regions longer?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, to respond briefly, I would say that 
hope must be kept alive. It is not true that there can be no future; we 
must take the future into our own hands and do something with it.
<P>
	I think that if the government was really serious about 
developing the regions of Quebec and Canada while reforming 
unemployment insurance, it would have implemented economic 
diversification policies so that we do not end up in the same 
situation as the Institut Maurice-Lamontagne in Sainte-Flavie, 
which is cutting jobs in research and development as UI standards 
are being tightened. This is an unacceptable contradiction. This is a 
message of hopelessness for young people.
<P>
	A message of hope would be to tell everyone they are 
committed, to share their hopes for the future with their political 
representatives, and to elect governments that will make choices 
and give priority to job creation so that they can be proud of their 
future professional achievements.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charles Hubbard (Miramichi, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
share my time with the hon. member for Carleton-Charlotte.
<P>
	The budget debate over the last several days clearly indicates the 
dilemma the people of this country must perceive as they watch it 
on television. The Bloc criticizes the government for reducing 
spending and cutting back on programs. Reform, although 
somewhat inconsistent in its dissertations, generally condemns the 
government for not balancing the budget by reducing expenditures 
and eliminating programs.
<P>
	As the only national party in the House, we the Liberals must 
reflect the concerns of all Canadians. We must have a program and 
a plan to direct our economy and create a climate that will 
stimulate growth, encourage investment, enhance consumer 
confidence and create jobs for the Canadian people.
<P>
<B>(1635 )</B>
<P>
	The budget as presented by the Minister of Finance on March 6 
has been well received across the country. It is the continuation of a 
long term plan with specific short term objectives. The finance 
department, like the Department of National Defence, has always 
been a very difficult portfolio for Canadian politicians. The tenure 
of many of them has been very short. The minister has done an 
excellent job. His vision, determination and perseverance are 
appreciated by most Canadians.
<P>
	Canada's debt was and is a major problem. Nine years of 
Conservative mismanagement saw our national debt increase from 
approximately $168 billion to more than $500 billion during that 
period. Annual deficits were often in excess of $40 billion. With 
interest rates of nearly 8 per cent to 10 per cent, 25 per cent of 
government revenues are and have been directed toward interest 
payments to lenders both in Canada and abroad.
<P>
	It is not easy to bring our financial house into order. Abruptly 
reducing spending within a budgetary framework where interest 
payments and legislated  spending accounted for approximately
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1565"> 1565 </A></B>
<P>
75 per cent of revenues would have created hardships for many 
Canadians and possibly bring havoc to the Canadian economy.
<P>
	The prescribed cutbacks in the three budgets in 1994, 1995 and 
1996 are a determined effort to gradually reduce government 
spending. The annual deficit as a percentage of gross domestic 
product will move from 6 per cent to 3 per cent to 2 per cent, and 
hopefully by the turn of the century we will have a balanced 
budget.
<P>
	The 1996 budget proposes some very reassuring commitments to 
Canadians. Seniors, through benefits for those of age 60 and older, 
will have a definite plan for their retirement.
<P>
	The Canada health and social transfer program will be 
guaranteed a five year commitment which will encourage the 
provinces to do their own budgeting.
<P>
	There is a program of jobs and growth, especially for our youth, 
with emphasis on education, technology and international trade; a 
school network program for more than 1,000 rural communities; a 
partnership with provinces for food inspection and other 
government agencies; a concern for child support and programs to 
assist families with educational credits, child care expenses, credits 
for infirm dependents and a doubling of the working income 
supplement; all of these without any increase in taxation.
<P>
	It is surprising that as I listen to the opposition we are not 
hearing a great number of positive comments and suggestions that 
could be brought to future budgets. The budget, for example, 
encourages the Department of Revenue to attack the underground 
economy. We also must continue to be concerned with loopholes 
and policies. They are unfair to many Canadians as they approach 
the taxation system.
<P>
	We might ask, for example, if we can continue to permit large 
corporations that are concerned only with maximizing profits to 
avoid what might be a fair amount of taxation.
<P>
	Can we look at bank machines that have replaced tellers, closed 
rural banks and eliminated thousands of jobs? Can we watch big 
companies such as General Motors lay off employees through 
outsourcing of work while making profits of more than $1 billion? 
Can we watch these large corporations pay their executives more 
than 50 times the salary of some of their yearly workers? Can we 
continue to permit those earning $1 million a year to pay the same 
tax rate as those who have taxable incomes of $60,000? These are 
some of the questions the opposition might be asking.
<P>
	This to me is a good budget in terms of the financial problems 
the country has faced. We must not forget we have nearly a 10 per 
cent unemployment problem. It is especially a problem for our 
youth. All of us in the House must strive to make Canada a better 
place for  young people as they seek to find gainful and meaningful 
work.
<P>
	We must insist that employers be fair, compassionate and 
considerate. Business has a role to play. We are hopeful it will 
participate in programs that will assist our youth, our greatest 
resource, in promoting the future of the country.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	The budget outlines the government's plans for revenues and 
spending. Its success depends to a large extent on the ability and 
willingness of our people and businesses to pay their fair share for 
the support of government programs.
<P>
	I call today for all civil servants to watch their spending, to avoid 
spending if it is only to consume the allocations for their 
department, for their agency. Canadians must be assured of true 
value for their hard earned tax dollars. They have always been 
supportive and generous. We as politicians must encourage strong 
controls and insist that specific spending be justified.
<P>
	We must not overlook the fact that many Canadians are hurting. 
Too many cutbacks by both business and government attack those 
in our society who are least able to defend themselves. We must 
ensure that downsizing of governments does not place the entire 
burden on those of low income or who are in difficult economic 
circumstances.
<P>
	Atlantic Canada and many areas of other provinces are 
concerned with UI reforms and the concentration of activities in 
larger centres. As parliamentarians we must work to ensure 
compassion, fairness and understanding. In our committee work 
and in reviewing estimates especially we must be very diligent.
<P>
	The budget reflects our Liberal principles and I am happy to 
support it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I heard the 
hon. member talk about a reassuring budget. I would rather call it 
distressing.
<P>
	For example, the Budget in Brief provides that the shortfall 
between the government revenues in 1996-1997 and its program 
and service spending will be $26 billion, which means that 
Canadians will pay $26 billion more than they will receive. In my 
opinion, this is very distressing.
<P>
	We are going bankrupt, there are no two ways about it. In 
1997-98, the governement will provide $35 billion less for 
programs and services than its tax revenues. These figures are 
distressing.
<P>
	It is also distressing to think about the national SchoolNet 
program mentioned by the hon. member, given that education 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1566"> 1566 </A></B>
<P>
comes under the exclusive  jurisdiction of the provinces, 
particularly Quebec. Indeed, it is distressing to hear that as well.
<P>
	It is distressing to hear that the federal government will look 
after families, since social welfare also comes under the 
jurisdiction of the provinces. It is distressing to hear that from the 
government in office.
<P>
	It is distressing to see that next year the debt service will amount 
to 50 per cent of all the money that taxpayers will give to the 
government.
<P>
	It is distressing to hear that the unemployment rate is only 10 per 
cent, given that the government has reduced the number of weeks 
during which UI benefits can be collected, even though that rate is 
not really going down. By contrast, the number of welfare 
recipients is increasing, particularly in Quebec.
<P>
	This is a simple case of transfer. People go from unemployment 
insurance to welfare. Moreover, the federal government is forcing 
the Quebec government, among others, to pick up the slack since it 
reduced the number of weeks during which UI benefits can be 
collected.
<P>
	All this is truly distressing. And we are told that this is a 
reassuring budget. I realize that the hon. member represents the 
government, but still. Maybe he can explain all this to me. I doubt 
he can, but I will listen.
<P>
	The little chart here refers to the financial needs of central 
organizations, expressed as a percentage of the gross domestic 
product. It puts Canada in first place. However, that does not take 
into account the deficit of the provinces. We are told that the public 
debt represents 74.8 per cent of the GDP. However, if you include 
the deficits of the provinces, the ratio is 105 per cent. We are the 
nation in the worst financial shape among all industrialized 
countries. I would appreciate it if the hon. member could make all 
this more clear to me.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hubbard:</B> Mr. Speaker, all Canadians realize that we have 
to have a balance. We cannot continue to spend just because we 
have a certain figure today. The message which Canadians gave us 
in the last election, which they are still giving us on the streets 
today, is that somehow we have to bring our financial house in 
order. If we continue, as the hon. member says, to build programs 
and to spend more money, I do not think that is what Canada wants.
<P>
	In reply of his comments on the UI program, the House of 
Commons committee has been reviewing the proposals. The 
minister, who comes from my province, will work with that 
committee to ensure that Canadians who are most in need will have 
programs which will enable them to continue to live in an 
economically healthy family unit.
<P>
	I certainly appreciated his comments. I also appreciated the 
comments which were made by the hon. member from 
Rivière-du-Loup. However, we have to appreciate the fact that 
there are Canadians who are in need and as a government, we will 
continue to help those Canadians who are most in need.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak during this 
portion of the 1996 budget debate.
<P>
	I would like to begin with a brief overview of where the nation 
stands financially, where it has been and what the goals are as 
Canadians for a common future.
<P>
	When assuming office in the late fall of 1993 this government 
was soon to comprehend the realities associated with an immense 
$42 billion deficit for the 1993-94 year, a $500 billion plus debt, a 
$6 billion deficit in the unemployment insurance fund, and overall 
what had progressively become an uncontrollable financial 
catastrophe which was headed for disaster.
<P>
	Should the government have been a business at that time, the 
creditors would have been looking to place the locks on the doors.
<P>
	Canadians from across the nation voiced their concern and their 
demand for change to be focused on deficit reduction and debt 
control. Canadians demanded that the government begin a process 
which would initiate the stabilization of our economy.
<P>
	The proud citizens of this great nation grew tired of the 
threatened economy. Canadians desired financial stability so they 
could hold their heads high in the face of world economies, proud 
and united under a strong financial force, a country that could very 
efficiently manage its finances.
<P>
	Canadian citizens deserve the assurance of knowing that our 
children and our grandchildren will have future opportunities. That 
can only result from a well-managed country.
<P>
	The Liberal government accepted the challenge, fully aware of 
the difficulties and the obstructions which might lie ahead. It began 
a process known as program review, which would review every line 
of expenditure of every department, not excluding government 
operations, in order to ensure that the necessary expenditure 
reductions would be established.
<P>
	Establishing goals that were challenging and far-reaching, the 
government has now begun to see the gradual reduction of the 
deficit, while at the same time protecting and supporting the valued 
Canadian social programs.
<P>
	Not only did it meet its established goal of reducing the deficit to 
$39.7 billion, it exceeded that goal by an additional $2.2 billion, for 
an overall reduction to $37.5 billion in 1994-95. The goal for the 
1995-96 fiscal year, which just ended this past March, was to reach 
a further  reduction to the $32.7 billion mark. I am optimistic that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1567"> 1567 </A></B>
<P>
once the auditors complete their work we will once again exceed 
the established goal.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	The new fiscal year of 1996-97 which began April 1 calls for the 
government to meet a further reduction goal toward a new deficit 
level of $24.3 billion or 3 per cent of gross domestic product.
<P>
	What could this figure mean to Canadians other than it is a 
yardstick or a metre stick used by many countries as a 
measurement of sound economic management? This measurement 
represents the future success and prosperity of Canada and the 
probability of job creation and economic stability both for our 
generation and generations to come in the future.
<P>
	Many Canadians ask: ``What has the Minister of Finance done in 
the 1996 budget to further meet his original goals and 
obligations?'' The Minister of Finance has introduced another new 
goal, another new challenge for the 1997-98 fiscal year. That 
challenge is to continue the downward trend to a new and lower 
level of deficit, to 2 per cent of gross domestic product or 
approximately $17 billion.
<P>
	Interestingly enough, the goals we have accomplished and 
continue to accomplish are somewhat similar to the goals that were 
brought forward by the previous administration. However, the 
goals set previously were never met in whole or even in part. This 
government will not follow the example of the previous 
administration. It will continue to meet and exceed our goals for 
deficit reduction and our commitment to Canadians to balance our 
budget.
<P>
	I believe these thoughts are best summarized by the remarks 
made in the 1996 budget by the Minister of Finance: ``In the budget 
we are keeping the course, we are maintaining our pace, we are not 
letting up. Indeed, this government will never let up. The attack on 
the deficit is irrevocable and irreversible. Let there be no doubt 
about that. We will balance the books''.
<P>
	Such a statement, sincere and based on facts, demonstrate that 
our recent success in reaching our goals is quite irrefutable. Mr. 
Speaker, would you not agree?
<P>
	What could be the result of the minister's actions? Confidence. 
Confidence in the Canadian economy. Confidence that has allowed 
financial institutions to lower interests. Mortgage rates are lower 
today than they were when I bought my house some 28 years ago. 
Interest rates in Canada are lower by 2 to 3 per cent than they are in 
the United States. When was the last time that happened? Certainly 
not in more recent years.
<P>
	Although many accomplishments have been achieved, there is 
still a lot of work to be done. This work will be continued in the 
same balanced fashion to ensure that spending reductions do not 
come at the expense of the  poor. The 1996 budget actually targeted 
increased resources to youth, to low income seniors and to the 
working poor. All of the government's accomplishments have been 
made in light of other priorities, namely economic growth and job 
creation.
<P>
	Canadians have voiced their demand. Citizens want increased 
employment opportunities. In order to satisfy this objective 
indirectly, in the long term, the government continues to support 
economic growth through deficit reduction strategies. More 
directly, government is pleased to announce the creation of over 
500,000 new full time jobs since assuming power. Canadians have 
asked for more economic growth and additional jobs. The 
government is responding each day by creating more new jobs and 
promoting economic growth. The task at hand is a difficult one, 
particularly since we have partly alleviated decades of deficit and 
debt in a few short months.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	This past Friday I had the opportunity to be part of the 
announcement of a new plant that when completed this fall will 
create 25 new jobs. This number does not include the spin-off jobs 
in transportation or in construction of the plant. Once again, 
congratulations to CANUSA Foods Limited, of Centreville, New 
Brunswick.
<P>
	Further expansion and job creation in Carleton-Charlotte was 
recently announced by McCain Foods a few weeks ago, detailing 
the upcoming expansion of their data processing centre. The 
facility will double in size, creating 30 or more new jobs in 
Florenceville, New Brunswick.
<P>
	Sabian Cymbals has recently moved to its newly constructed 
larger and more modern facility in Meductic, New Brunswick with 
the expansion encompassing an additional 12 to 15 persons.
<P>
	In York Mills, Briggs &amp; Little Woollen Mills have recently 
constructed a new facility after surviving a severe fire in the fall of 
1994. It will soon be reopening with employment once again 
available for many area residents.
<P>
	In addition to the many industries in Carleton-Charlotte that 
are expanding, congratulations are also extended to the many 
industries that continue to maintain numerous stable, full time jobs. 
Our sincere congratulations are extended to all those industries. I 
am delighted to support the 1996 budget. I am very proud of its 
accomplishments today and for the future.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my hon. colleague talked about job creation. He said that jobs are 
created every day. He said that 500,000 jobs have been created 
since his government came into office. However, how many jobs 
have been lost during the same time?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1568"> 1568 </A></B>
<P>
	Of course, we are all morally responsible. Those who should 
bear the most responsibility are those who have created the deficit, 
the debt. When Mr. Trudeau came into office in 1970, he began 
to get the country deep into debt. And this went on. When the 
Conservatives came to power, they did not do any better.
<P>
	It is true that we have a responsibility, and I think that everybody 
here has benefited from that in some way. Some a lot, some less. 
However, those who benefited the least are the poor, and more 
particularly maybe the people living in rural areas like mine and in 
isolated areas. Now, today, we are asked to show restraint, to 
tighten our belts, and very often those who have benefited the most 
are asking those who have benefited the least to suffer the 
consequences. That is unfair.
<P>
	Yes, I recognize that we all have some responsibility. Yes, I 
recognize that I myself have benefited somewhat from it. But at 
least let us not ask those who hardly benefited at all from it to 
tighten their belts even more today.
<P>
	Someone said earlier that we have to find money somewhere. 
The question is where do we look for that money. We proposed and 
we are still asking that we look for it in the family trusts and the 
banks, because they definitely benefited a lot from it. Therefore, 
they should at least pay a fair share of the bill. I have here a long 
list of duplications that everybody can see. The Minister of Finance 
has seen it himself.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	I will repeat just part of what he said. Just about every small 
business has had a federal tax auditor drop in, followed by a federal 
sales tax auditor, a provincial corporate tax auditor, and a 
provincial retail sales tax auditor. All these people wanted to get 
the same figures. And they all came at about the same time and on 
the same day.
<P>
	The government has just realized that, but we have been pointing 
out this problem for years. I could give many more examples of 
duplication, but my question for my colleague is this: Instead of 
targeting those who did not gain any advantage from this collective 
debt build-up, should we not be going after those who did mightily, 
and have them foot part of the bill?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Culbert:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for the 
question. I too represent a riding that is very rural. It is over 200 
miles long and has varied economies including agriculture, 
forestry, fisheries, manufacturing and processing. We try to be very 
diversified.
<P>
	There is no doubt that we are part of a changing global economy. 
If we are going to keep up we have to progressively move forward 
to ensure that our people have the best training possible. The 
government is  attempting to put in place tools that will allow our 
communities and our citizens to take advantage of opportunities.
<P>
	I agree with the member that there is hurt. I am sure there is hurt 
in each and every constituency across Canada. We must offer a 
helping hand. Controlling the deficit, getting it on a downward 
trend as this budget has accomplished, certainly promotes 
confidence. It sets the tone which allows us to continue to help.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
will be splitting my time with the hon. member for Elk Island.
<P>
	It is a pleasure to address the House on the budget once again. I 
will start by putting things in context. Many speakers have stood up 
today and pointed to the size of the debt. It is critical that we put 
this whole debate back in context.
<P>
	We have huge debt in this country. It is unparalleled in the world 
for the size of the country. Our debt today stands at $578 billion. 
We are paying somewhere in the range of $47 billion a year in 
interest payments on that debt which will rise to almost $50 billion 
before the end of the government's mandate. The issue is important 
considering the context.
<P>
	The GST was not in the budget but the Liberals have frequently 
promised to discuss it, even as late as last summer. During the 
election campaign hon. members across the way campaigned door 
to door saying that the GST would be history if the Liberals were 
elected. I do not have to tell Canadians that is not the case today. 
The GST is still with us despite what the Deputy Prime Minister 
said on national television 10 days before the last election. She 
said: ``I will resign if the GST is not abolished.''
<P>
	The Prime Minister and the finance minister said similar things. 
They said that it would be gone, that it would be scrapped. ``I hate 
it. I will kill it.'' Those are the sorts of things that they said during 
the election campaign.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harvard:</B> Find something original.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> I see the hon. member from Winnipeg. He was out 
campaigning against the GST. Now he is mouthing off across the 
way but all those words do not eliminate the GST. It is still there.
<P>
	We hear that the Liberals are working to harmonize the GST. 
Why are they working so hard to put another form of the GST in 
place? Why do they not do what we have recommended? Why do 
they not balance the budget and get rid of the GST? Why not 
eliminate it in stages? Surely, after putting up with all this fiscal 
restraint, Canadians deserve a reward. Why not grant them that 
reward in the form of a GST that ultimately disappears? That would 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1569"> 1569 </A></B>
<P>
be a wonderful reward. People do not need  that tax burden. They 
have paid a heavy price over the years and it is time they were 
given that reward.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	I will talk about the government's approach to deficit reduction. 
The finance minister in his budget speech talked about the 
importance of being fair. I could not agree more. One of the fairest 
approaches is to make the cuts in a timely fashion. If spending 
reductions are made in a timely fashion that means we do not pay 
the price of delay. Canadians really are paying the cost of delay in 
spades because the government has delayed so in long making its 
cuts.
<P>
	In the 1994-95 budget the government cut virtually nothing. It 
had a golden opportunity to put in place spending reductions that 
would have put us further ahead than we are today. During the 
election campaign my party campaigned on a zero in three deficit 
elimination plan. If that plan had been implemented when the 
government came to power, today we would be debating what to do 
with the surpluses. We would not be talking about another $24 
billion deficit which is what we are facing.
<P>
	Over the course of the government's mandate it is going to add 
$117 billion to the overall debt. That is unbelievable. The Liberals 
are crowing about the good job they have done. However, let us 
remember Canadians are paying a heavy burden.
<P>
	The finance minister talked about fairness which I will also talk 
about. Is it fair to take $8 billion out of social programs and give it 
to money traders around the world? I do not think it is. In effect that 
is what the government has done by waiting as long as it has and by 
being so timid in the cuts it has made over the course of the last 
couple of years. It has waited that long. The interest has built up 
and money is going out of the country never to be seen again.
<P>
	Who pays the price? The most vulnerable in society pay the 
price. That is why the Reform Party advocated cuts right away. We 
also advocated setting priorities and getting those priorities right. 
We said let us cut at the top. Let us cut MP pensions, for crying out 
loud. What did the government do? It made sure it welded them 
into place so members would have their pensions, while it talked 
about cutting benefits for everybody else. That is bizarre and 
ridiculous. That should not happen but that is exactly what 
happened under this government.
<P>
	We say let us get rid of all of the perks. Let us get rid of all the 
extra expense around this place. Let us make some economies at 
the very top. If we do that then we can talk with some authority 
about the cuts that need to be made throughout government. 
Unfortunately, they do have to be made throughout government.
<P>
	In anticipation of questions from hon. members across the way, 
they are going to make reference to the approach of the Reform 
Party. We presented a very  extensive budget preceding last year's 
budget which laid out all kinds of initiatives for the government to 
follow. What did the government members do? They sat there and 
mocked us. They have said they want to see it again this year. Well 
we have laid it out for them. The approach is there.
<P>
	For instance in the area of health care we would have cut about 
$800 million. What did the government say? It said that was too 
deep, that we should not cut that deeply. What did the government 
do? It cut $3.2 billion in health care. It closed more hospital beds 
across this country than any provincial government, probably more 
than all of them combined. I think it is time Canadians knew about 
that.
<P>
	We would have cut $200 million out of higher education. What 
did the government do? It cut $1.2 billion out of higher education. 
That is the cost of delay. What did the government do when we said 
we would cut $200 million? It said we were slash and burn. The 
government is cutting $1.2 billion which is unbelievable. Again, 
this is the cost of delay.
<P>
	The deficit is not all due to the cost of delay. The Liberals also 
decided they were going to continue to fund their friends in big 
business which is why we have all kinds of money going to all 
kinds of unbelievable places in Canada today. Why do the Sears 
department stores have to get money from the federal government? 
Why does Eaton's need to get money from the federal government? 
Why does American Express get $17,000 from the Canadian 
government?
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	There is also $121,000 going to Abitibi-Price. Mark's Work 
Wearhouse gets $99,000, the Hudson's Bay Company gets $5,000; 
on and on it goes.
<P>
	Here is an interesting case which I would like my friend across 
the way to justify. Why are we sending $105,000 to the Canadian 
Bankers Association? Banks earned $5 billion in profits last year 
and the Canadian government is giving the bankers association 
$105,000. That is unbelievable. It says here that the grant was from 
the Department of Human Resources Development for training, 
which is unbelievable.
<P>
	Members across the way should be ashamed. They should stand 
in their places and chastise their government. I hope they have the 
intestinal fortitude to stand at the budget vote tonight, as the hon. 
member for York South-Weston says he will do, and vote against 
the government for that kind of hypocritical spending. It is 
absolutely ridiculous.
<P>
	I encourage Canadians who are watching the debate to take 
everything the government has said with respect to the progress it 
has made with a grain of salt. I ask them to look at where it is 
cutting.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1570"> 1570 </A></B>
<P>
	This is not the beginning of the end of the deficit problem in 
the country, it is the end of the beginning. The government has 
barely scratched the surface. Let us hope that it sets its priorities 
in a way that is mindful of the needs of ordinary Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (St. Boniface, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I listened to what my colleague had to say. I will make a few 
comments and perhaps raise a few questions.
<P>
	He indicated that his party did not advocate any perks. I have 
been told-I believe he has read the same documentation-that 
there are some members of his party who fly executive class. 
Perhaps he would like to comment on that.
<P>
	At one time it was said that members of the Reform Party would 
not go to the parliamentary restaurant and some do not; some 
Liberals do not either. That is supposedly a perk yet he has said no 
perks.
<P>
	It was not long ago that the leader of his party returned a used 
vehicle he was entitled to after which he received many photo ops. 
It was discovered shortly thereafter that on the side he was getting 
approximately $30,000 from his party in order to help buy his suits, 
shirts, ties and whatever else he needed. I am told he did not pay 
taxes on it either. It may have been for some other purpose, but it 
was over $30,000. I do not get it. I would not take it. I am surprised 
with his kind of rhetoric that he would have.
<P>
	I have been told about something which I find to be a perk. 
During the election someone on a disability pension ran for 
political office. Well, I do not know if that is contradictory or not.
<P>
	I recall during the MP pension debate there was some discussion 
which made all the national news. A very prominent Reform 
member indicated that the salaries of MPs should be doubled. If we 
add up the costs I can assure the House it would cost a lot more than 
what is in place right now. I know I am telling the truth because I 
can see their blood pressures rising. One member is about to fall 
out of his chair.
<P>
	With respect to the budget that was touted before, I recall the 
Reform Party numbers did not add up. I looked through all the 
newspapers in Canada to see if one single, influential, credible 
person would say anything positive about that budget. I did not see 
one single line, not one single word.
<P>
	If we look at the polls today, of course they change. They go up 
and down.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> Do you know what dogs do to poles?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Yes and I know what the Reform Party members 
do to polls. They look at them very carefully. It is an indication of 
what kind of credibility the party has.
<P>
	Look at the polls since the 1993 election. They are at about 12 
per cent across the country which is roughly what the Bloc 
Quebecois gets in Quebec only.
<P>
<B>(1715 )</B>
<P>
	All that is being said today I understand and some of the people 
have said it with a great deal of passion. Some may even believe it, 
although some say it and do not believe it. Clearly there is no 
evidence that message is catching on. Why is it not catching on? It 
is exaggerated. It has no credibility. It has no basis. It does not 
make sense. It is just not hitting the target.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Madam Speaker, I smell the distinct odour of 
Liberal arrogance across the way when the hon. member mentions 
polls.
<P>
	I remind the hon. member to look at the recent byelections where 
we had his own party running scared in places where we had not 
even run candidates before. Let us get the record straight. That is 
truly the poll that really matters.
<P>
	I want to touch on the issue of perks. The hon. member has 
touched on a bunch of trivial issues but I want to point out one 
thing. His pension alone would pay for all of those trips to the 
parliamentary dining room where four, five or six of our members 
may go from time to time to get a subsidized meal for a couple of 
dollars off. His pension would pay for any first class air fare that 
our members take. His pension alone would pay for any of the 
perks he referred to 10 times over.
<P>
	I remind the member to put this into context. It is very important 
that Canadians understand to what lengths the government 
members went to protect themselves from all the cuts they were to 
make to everybody else well ahead of the day the budget came 
down. That is absolutely unbelievable but they did it and they will 
pay a price for it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I have a 
considerable challenge to change the minds of hon. members in the 
House who have the real power in this place.
<P>
	I am very annoyed on behalf of my constituents and on behalf of 
all Canadians that we do not in this boardroom on behalf of the 
country have the mechanism to defeat a budget which is bad. This 
is even before I am talking about this particular budget.
<P>
	Let us say a party brought in a really bad budget. We will not say 
the Liberals did that this time, that is self-evident. Let us say it was 
some hypothetical party some time in the future. The thing that is 
wrong with this place is there is no mechanism which permits the 
members of Parliament as representatives of their constituents 
back home to actually defeat that budget.
<P>
	I believe that is deplorable. It is deplorable that the member for 
Saskatoon-Dundurn cannot stand up here and vote against this 
budget if he felt he should without the fear of being disciplined and 
without the fear of losing that treasured privilege of being able to 
run a second term in order to get his high priced pension plan.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1571"> 1571 </A></B>
<P>
	A lot of people are aware of this MP pension plan. They are 
also aware that the Liberals have only tinkered with it. They did 
nothing tangible really. Changing the age to 55 is commendable. 
For most Canadians there is no pension until they are 65. 
Furthermore, they do this at a time when they are talking about 
reducing the number of years ordinary Canadians can pay into 
their RRSPs. They are talking about it at the same time they are 
talking about increasing the age when Canadians will become 
eligible for the Canada pension plan. Yet for themselves they bring 
it down to age 55.
<P>
	We have this new member from the Bloc here who is now 22 
years old. Theoretically before this little change he could have 
picked up his pension at age 28 for the rest of his life. The 
wonderful Liberals said: ``You cannot have that. You now have to 
wait until you are 55'', while other Canadians have to wait until 
they are 65.
<P>
	Canadians ought to know one important fact. There is a much 
greater price to pay for that MP pension plan than what is evident. 
As members probably know, I am a mathematician of sorts, 
although not a very high powered one. I taught high school math 
for four years and I taught at a technical institute for 27 years 
teaching mathematics and computing.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	I know a little math of finance. I did some calculations. If I 
wanted to provide for myself the same pension I would be eligible 
for if I were in the MP pension plan, and I am proud to say I opted 
out, the cost to me at my age would be around $4,000 per month.
<P>
	I am already over 55. I would be eligible right now if I had six 
years of service here. That is incredible, approximately $4,000 to 
provide me with a lifetime pension if I live to be the same age as 
my grandfather did. He had the same shape I do and he lived to be 
almost 90. Obviously I am taking that into account.
<P>
	That is incredible. It means the members here who say how 
terrible of our member from Calgary who said we should increase 
the salary of the MPs are the same Liberal members who are taking 
the money. They are taking that money but they want to keep it a 
secret from the Canadian people. That is-I cannot use bad words. 
I do not want to get into any unparliamentary language, therefore I 
will stop there.
<P>
	There is a lot of resistance on the governing side to actually fix 
the budget and to reduce government spending. It does not have to 
be done in social programs only. Certainly there are areas in our 
social spending that should be done more efficiently. There are 
many areas of government spending where we waste an incredible 
amount of money. We use around $5 billion a year to subsidize 
business. That is obscene when there are hundreds of people 
struggling to make ends meet and to pay their annual tax bills.
<P>
	The government is eager to get re-elected. It is doing that by 
making sure the people of Canada do not have the bare facts on 
what it is actually doing.
<P>
	I will give members opposite a little insight into what it means 
when one allows the debt to grow. I preface this by saying I would 
like to commend the Liberals. They will take this out of context. 
They will say the member for Elk Island said he wanted to 
commend the Liberals. Please listen to the end of the sentence. I 
want to commend them for borrowing less than probably the 
Conservatives would have done if we would have left them in. It is 
really incredible since the people chose Reform and put a lot of 
influence through Reform, through their own members to cut 
spending somewhat.
<P>
	This has been done. Canadians ought to know that in the last 
three years of the government there has been a reduction of 
government spending on operations. In 1993 when we came here it 
cost around $120 billion a year to operate the government. That 
was reduced the next year to about $119 billion and the next year to 
about $116 billion.
<P>
	We have a reduction. With the projected budget in 1996-97 there 
is a reduction in government spending of around $8.8 billion. If we 
are spending $8.8 billion less, we would expect that either we are 
paying down our debt because we are spending less or there should 
be a tax cut.
<P>
	Has there been a tax cut? No. We hear a lot about no changes in 
tax rates. That is not entirely true. We experienced last year the 
increase in gas prices. There have been other changes as well.
<P>
	While government operations have decreased by about 7 per 
cent, interest payments have gone up in that same period by almost 
30 per cent. That is something Canadians ought to know. Members 
on the government side ought to know that.
<P>
	When they see that, there should be a greater sense of urgency on 
balancing the budget and getting the deficit not to 3 per cent or 2 
per cent of gross domestic product, not continuously adding to the 
debt, but getting the deficit to zero, getting the Government of 
Canada to spend no more in total than it is taking in. The reason is 
that interest is eating this up because in the same time interval total 
government revenues have increased by approximately 17 per cent. 
That means the government has taken that money out of the 
economy and spent 7 per cent less, but interest has increased by 
approximately 30 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	Those are the facts. I have taken them right out of the budget 
book which the minister presented in the House. I have done a bit 
of work with my calculator on those numbers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1572"> 1572 </A></B>
<P>
	That should cause these members to ask whether they are really 
representing their constituents, their children, their grandchildren 
and future generations by loading on to them an additional debt.
<P>
	As I approach the end of my time I would like to talk a bit about 
amortization. Again I have made a few computations based on 
paying off a mortgage.
<P>
	Canada has a huge mortgage. In 1993 when the Liberals took 
over the mortgage was around $508 billion. If at that time we had 
had a balanced budget what kind of a surplus would we have 
needed to pay off the debt in 25 years? We would have needed an 
annual surplus of some $48 billion if we ever hoped to pay off the 
debt.
<P>
	Some people say it does not matter if we pay it off. I am sorry, 
but every individual who has bought Canada savings bonds, 
government T-bills or any of the other items wants to get their 
money back. That debt has to be paid, whether it is to foreign 
lenders or to Canadians. We have to pay it back. Every year we 
delay the price goes up.
<P>
	After we reach $603 billion, which will happen after this budget 
year, the annual budget surplus required to pay off the debt in 25 
years will have grown to $56.5 billion annually, an increase of 
some $8.8 billion per year for 25 years. All we have done is waited 
for three years.
<P>
	I am with these members. I look at the people of Canada who 
have needs. We are a country rich in resources. We are friendly and 
compassionate. No one in Canada will starve to death, not if I can 
help it. However, I am not sure the way to arrange our affairs is to 
sink our children into an enormous debt. Anyone who knows 
anything about the magic of compound interest will realize we are 
getting into an increasingly difficult debt hole.
<P>
	I am not content to be in a Parliament which, in this term of 
office, has increased the debt of Canadians by approximately $8 
billion annually. That is not acceptable; $100 billion dollars more 
debt.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Minister for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities 
Agency and Minister of Western Economic Diversification, 
Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I heard the figures being thrown around by 
a person who professes to have some knowledge of mathematics. I 
am surprised by the document the Reform Party put out, the 
taxpayers budget.
<P>
	I simply refer to the last page of that document, the summary. It 
shows total program spending cuts of $25 billion. With a deficit of 
$42 billion created by the Conservative government, Reform would 
cut $25 billion over a three year period, $8 billion per year. Cuts of 
$8 billion per year would put it in a worse position than the present 
targets of the finance minister.
<P>
	This is nothing but a document of deception put out by the 
Reform Party. Twenty-five billion over three years is $8 billion per 
year. Eight billion from forty-two means it would be running a 
deficit of $34 billion a year and it would be happy with it. It is not 
happy with what the government is doing but it is happy with $34 
billion a year.
<P>
	Reform is critical of what the finance minister is doing. Perhaps 
it should get a calculator that works. It should be a Liberal 
calculator because it is obvious the Reform calculator does not 
have any batteries.
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> Madam Speaker, this reminds me of a number of 
occasions in my professional career when I was asked to help 
explain math and finance to lawyers. It would not be the first time 
in my life that I have done that.
<P>
	We are talking about three different things here. There is the rate 
of reduction in expenditures per year. For the Reform Party budget 
we were talking of a total reduction in costs or in government 
overspending, in other words a reduction of government 
expenditures over a three year period. Just as the Liberals 
projected, so did we project a-and I hesitate to use the 
word-conservative growth rate in the economy.
<P>
	Our plan did in fact work over a three year period. It does not 
work if we compare the three year number with the one year 
number which we are talking about when we deal with the budget 
every year here. The member and I will have to get together 
afterward to look at the actual numbers.
<P>
	The fact is when we did that budget originally when we did our 
planning during the campaign, the assumptions then were that the 
deficit was around $35 billion. It only came in over $40 billion 
after the accounting was in from the previous government. 
Obviously in our budget plan last year we took the new figure 
which I think was around $37 billion. If we take that number away, 
add the amount of economic growth, in fact in three years we did 
have a plan for a balanced budget. There is just no other way of 
saying it. I do not know how to explain it without the use of an 
overhead projector which I am accustomed to using.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, since being elected to the House of Commons in 
1993 I have never forgotten that a nation is not made up of mere 
facts and figures but of real people, both young and old. So it 
follows that one key to a healthy country is to create opportunities 
for a group like Canada's youth. In fact, in terms of jobs and 
growth, the government's budget appears focused on youth.
<P>
	It was announced for instance that federal funding for student 
summer jobs would be doubled and that the new Canada 
technology partnerships program would boost key sectors. It was 
also announced that jobs for youth  would be a high priority and 
aimed 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1573"> 1573 </A></B>
<P>
at doubling the number of federal summer jobs for students. 
Furthermore the government challenged other levels of 
government and the private sector to do likewise. As well, it was 
announced that this government will work with the provinces and 
the private sector to enhance youth job opportunities and help 
create new approaches for first jobs.
<P>
	My own recognition of the need to create lasting jobs for young 
Canadians as opposed to only so-called ``Mc jobs'' can be seen by a 
petition I have sponsored in support of better working conditions 
for temporary workers.
<P>
	It goes without saying that all job seekers are looking for 
employment that offers an income sufficient to live in a dignified 
fashion. Unfortunately many of them have grown discouraged by 
the shortage of jobs currently posted in Canada employment 
centres and are turning to temporary employment agencies for 
short term contract work.
<P>
	Obviously these temporary help agencies are providing a much 
needed service by supplying employers with workers, but such 
so-called private temporary help services do not come cheap. By 
insisting on a portion of each worker's hourly wage and demanding 
compensation from employers as well, these agencies illustrate the 
need for government to encourage the growth of more enduring 
jobs.
<P>
	That is why I hope to encourage a growing number of employers, 
including the various levels of government, to post their job 
openings, be they temporary or permanent, free of cost in Canada 
employment centres. I am inviting all businesses in my riding to let 
me know why some of them currently prefer to satisfy their 
manpower needs through costly private temporary help agencies as 
opposed to Canada employment centres.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	If our current centres are failing to satisfy the requirements of 
employers, then it stands to reason they will prove unable to meet 
the needs of our unemployed. If so, let us learn to offer the kind of 
services both require. Unless we do, we might just as well close 
down all federal centres and turn the entire industry over to the 
private sector.
<P>
	The throne speech also recognized that young Canadians should 
have the opportunity to fulfil their potential. To help them cope 
with the rising cost of post-secondary education, the government 
announced it would increase education credits for tax purposes and 
raise limits on the transfers to parents for education and tuition 
credits.
<P>
	On top of current funding for programs such as youth internship 
Canada and youth services Canada, the Liberal government 
announced it would reallocate $315 million to create new jobs for 
youth. Of this funding, $120  million is slated to go toward student 
summer jobs in 1996-97, doubling last year's federal contribution. 
Some of the $315 million will go to help find work for youth who 
have left school.
<P>
	For my part, this spring I followed the lead of the government 
and devoted a full page of my latest householder to promoting the 
student summer job action program. A key ingredient of this 
innovative program is the many Canada employment centres for 
students located on various academic campuses across the country.
<P>
	These offices help thousands of Canadian employers each spring 
to hire students talented in every type of job imaginable. Whether 
your business or home needs full time, part time or odd help, 
Canada employment centres for students are the place to turn to. 
Anyone interested in using the student summer job action program 
can call the new youth action line at 1-800-935-5555.
<P>
	What about the young people for whom these programs are 
designed to help, the real people behind the facts and figures? As 
they shield their eyes with Ray-Ban sun-glasses and their ears with 
Sony walkmen, many youth across Canada are busy working as 
bicycle messengers, pizza drivers, yard workers, Wal-Mart 
employees and Mc-jobbers in today's low wage, low benefit 
service economy. They are the wandering nomads of the temporary 
employment world. In school they are a group of staggering 
diversity, not just in ethnicity but also in attitude, performance and 
rewards. After graduation they dream of graduating into jobs and 
moving out of their parents' house.
<P>
	Many youths realize that some members of their generation may 
be the first to do less well than their parents. Fortunately they are 
also better equipped than my generation was to deal with the kinds 
of rapid change society is now facing. After all, from the 1950s to 
the 1990s, Canada's children went from a family culture of ``My 
Three Sons'' to one of ``My Two Dads''. Yet we often see these 
same young men and women at the mall buying groceries for busy 
moms and dads. If anything, they are survivors.
<P>
	I myself am the father of two fine young people, a 20-year old 
son and a 15-year old daughter. It is on behalf of them and their 
generation that I dedicate this government's efforts at debt 
reduction and job creation. In last month's budget this government 
has shown its unwavering commitment to securing Canada's future 
by creating opportunities for a group that at times has felt 
disenfranchised: our youth.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
honoured today to have the opportunity to address the 
government's 1996 federal budget which when combined with the 
initiatives of our previous budgets continues to move this country 
forward.

<P>
	There are many wonderful, well considered and effective 
features of this legislation. Unfortunately time does not permit me 
to comment on them all. I would however like to comment in a 
little more detail on several points which are of significant 
importance to my constituents in Erie riding.
<P>
	The seniors benefit is one of these. One legislative foundation of 
the Liberal government in Canada was the introduction of a 
national program of retirement support for seniors. With this 
budget our government is adding a vital new page to that history. 
We are taking the action necessary to safeguard the public pension 
system for all Canadians, in particular the young.
<P>
	This is an issue that has concerned my Erie riding constituents 
for some time. The system faces a real challenge from the aging of 
our population. Canadians are living longer, healthier lives and as a 
result pension benefits are now paid out over a much longer time.
<P>
	The post-war baby boom is having an even bigger impact. This 
generation will start to retire in large numbers around 2011. Over 
the next 30 years the number of seniors will more than double. The 
difficulty is that there will be fewer working Canadians to support 
the escalating pension bill. Over the next decade we will see a ratio 
of about five working age Canadians to help support each person 
over 65, but by 2030 there will only be three working Canadians for 
every Canadian of retirement age.
<P>
	Finally we must take into account that growth in wage and 
productivity levels has been lower than anticipated when the 
foundations of the public pension were put in place in the 1960s. 
This pressure will force the capacity of working age Canadians to 
finance growing public pension costs. Taken together, these factors 
will increase the cost of our public pension programs faster than 
our capacity to pay for them unless we act.
<P>
	This government is acting. Our government in partnership with 
the provinces and territories has already launched a major public 
consultation program on changes needed to the Canada pension 
plan. With this budget we are taking action on the second pillar of 
the retirement income system, the old age security and guaranteed 
income supplement.
<P>
	It is startling when we consider that these programs by 
themselves account for one-fifth of federal program spending. This 
share is projected to grow rapidly over the next 35 years putting 
further strain on the system itself. It is time we put public concerns 
about the future of OAS and GIS to rest.
<P>
	The new seniors benefit to take effect in 2001 helps fulfil our 
commitment to Canadians to ensure that they have a secure and 
sustainable pension system into the future. The Prime Minister and 
this government made a commitment that the OAS and GIS 
payments for today's  seniors will be fully protected and this 
promise has been kept.
<P>
	The pension of every Canadian who is 60 and over as of 
December 31, 1995 and their spouses regardless of age will be fully 
protected. When the new benefit is implemented in the year 2001, 
these seniors may choose whichever system is most advantageous 
to them, either moving to the new seniors benefit or maintaining 
the OAS-GIS payments.
<P>
	I would like to review the seniors benefit in a little more detail. 
As I indicated it will replace the old age security and guaranteed 
income supplement. The new benefits will be completely tax free 
and will incorporate the existing age and pension income tax 
credits. Under the new approach, benefits will be delivered in a 
single monthly payment.
<P>
	The seniors benefit will treat couples equally. Payments to 
couples will be made in separate and equal cheques to each spouse. 
For couples the amount of the payment will be determined on the 
basis of the combined income of the spouses as it is now and 
always has been in the case of GIS. We feel that since the income of 
low income couples are currently combined to calculate eligibility 
for additional help, it is appropriate to combine the incomes of 
wealthier couples to determine their level of government 
assistance.
<P>
	The seniors benefit will be fully indexed to inflation. That 
includes both the benefit levels and the threshold at which benefits 
begin to be reduced. Seniors will only have to apply for the benefit 
once, when they turn 65. The level of benefits will be automatically 
recalculated each year based on the previous year's return.
<P>
	Because the seniors benefit will begin in the year 2001, everyone 
under the age of 60 today will have at least five years to prepare. 
The new seniors benefit will help those who need it most. 
Recipients of GIS will get $120 more per year. The majority of 
seniors will be better off. Fully 75 per cent of single seniors and 
couples will receive the same or higher benefits and 9 out of 10 
single senior women will be better off.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	The very highest income seniors who already have secure 
pensions and other incomes will receive no government assistance. 
For single seniors with incomes over $52,000 and couples with 
incomes above $78,000 benefits will be eliminated.
<P>
	It should be emphasized that the savings will come from slowing 
the rate of growth in program costs, not at the expense of those in 
need. While the savings at first will be small, they will build year 
by year to about 11 per cent of the program by 2030.
<P>
	The seniors benefit is a positive initiative which meets key 
public goals. That is reducing the long term cost. It will make the 
public pension system more sustainable.  Targeting help to those 
who need it most is the fairest way to reduce costs. More important, 
with the new seniors benefit all Canadians, particularly the young, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1575"> 1575 </A></B>
<P>
can be assured that the public pension system will be there for them 
now and in the future.
<P>
	I now wish to address the child support reforms of this 
legislation. The 1996 budget is about the future, about securing a 
prosperous future for all Canadians. If any group represents the 
future it is our young people. That is why the government's 
commitment to fair, sustainable and secure social programs would 
be incomplete if it did not include action to assist children. That is 
why a new strategy has been introduced to strengthen protection for 
children buffeted by separation or divorce and who are often the 
most vulnerable and in the greatest need.
<P>
	As the Minister of Finance told Parliament: ``The current child 
support system has added to the uncertainty and anxiety many 
Canadians feel. Our view is that children should be first in line. 
Child support is the first obligation of parents. It is not 
discretionary''.
<P>
	The budget acted on this principle. It announced a child support 
reform which takes wide ranging action to ensure that the system is 
based on what is best for children. To start, the government is 
changing the way child support payments are taxed. Until now 
these payments have been tax deductible for the paying parent and 
taxable income for the parent receiving the payments.
<P>
	The budget proposes moving to a system known as a no 
deduction, no inclusion. That means custodial parents would not be 
required to include child support payments in their taxable income 
and support paying parents would not deduct these payments from 
their taxable income.
<P>
	These new tax rules will apply to court orders or agreements 
made on or after May 1, 1997. Child support paid under a court 
order made before May 1, 1997 will continue to be deductible by 
the payer and included as taxable income by the recipient until one 
of these eventualities happen. This could happen if a support 
payment is changed by a court ruling or the parties add a clause to 
their agreement providing that the new tax system will apply, or the 
payer and recipient will file a joint election with Revenue Canada.
<P>
	As a second major child support reform, the government is 
introducing child support guidelines to make support awards fairer 
and more consistent and to reduce the degree of conflict between 
separating parents. These guidelines will be used across Canada by 
the courts, lawyers and parents to establish appropriate support 
payments. They include payment schedule tables that show the 
basic amount of support to be paid according to the number of 
children and the income of the supporting parent.
<P>
	Next, the schedule amounts can be adjusted to recognize 
individual family circumstances. Special  expenses for the child are 
health care, education or extra curricular activities and can be 
added to the schedule amount, provided that these expenses are 
reasonable and necessary in light of the needs of the children and 
the means of the parents.
<P>
	Last, the guidelines will allow the court to alter the award in 
exceptional circumstances that would cause undue hardship to 
either parent or the child.
<P>
	The third aspect of the child support reform strategy will be the 
enhancement of federal and provincial enforcement initiatives to 
ensure that benefit from fairer child support awards are paid in full 
and on time.
<P>
	We must remember that child support is mainly a provincial and 
territorial responsibility. Consequently the measures being 
proposed complement the enforcement efforts and strategies at that 
level. It should be emphasized that we are targeting parents who are 
persistent defaulters on their support payments. These strategies 
include a national public awareness campaign aimed at changing 
public attitudes toward support obligations.
<P>
	Provincial enforcement programs will be provided with a new 
enforcement mechanism. Legislation will be enacted that will 
authorize the suspension of federal licences, privileges and 
certificates, such as passports, when someone has demonstrated 
persistent default.
<P>
	The federal government will provide up to $13.7 million over 
five years to help the provinces expand their use of more 
aggressive enforcement measures and streamline the collection of 
out of province orders. Improvements to the federal tracing service 
will allow the release of certain information from designated 
federal information banks to help locate defaulting debtors.
<P>
	This will include adding Revenue Canada to the list of 
departments whose data bases can be searched at the request of 
provincial enforcement agencies.
<P>
<B>(1750 )</B>
<P>
	We will improve federal pension diversions to ensure that this 
measure can be applied to persistent defaulters. This can be done 
even if the defaulter refuses to apply for pension benefits, ensuring 
that the maximum amount of benefits go to the child.
<P>
	Finally, improvements to computer systems will allow for the 
on-line computer access between federal-provincial and territorial 
enforcement services. This will enhance the efficiency of the 
garnishment and tracing service and greatly facilitate the exchange 
of information.
<P>
	When a persistent defaulter realizes that this is concrete and 
substantial action, that they can run but cannot hide, they will have 
no alternative but to comply. The winner will be the children.
<P>
	In conclusion, good government today must be fiscally 
responsible as well as socially responsible. We must  create the 
conditions for job creation and economic growth. We must secure 
the future of our social programs. We must invest in the future, 
provide new 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1576"> 1576 </A></B>
<P>
opportunities for Canada and for Canadians. The creativity of this 
budget propels us forward to meet these objectives.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I listened carefully to the speech my hon. 
colleague just made. He concluded by saying:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Our government must be fiscally responsible-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would just like to ask my hon. colleague a question. We know 
that the government has planned everything needed to undertake, 
during the summer or at the end of it, a review of the Canadian tax 
system. And to do so, the government has designated the best tax 
experts in Canada. These people will have to review tax havens, 
among other things. We have clearly demonstrated in this House 
that these tax experts are the biggest users of tax havens in Canada. 
They are the ones who advise corporations on how to use tax 
havens and to take tax avoidance to extremes.
<P>
	Our hon. colleague says:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Our government must be fiscally responsible-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
Can he tell us why the people who benefit the most from our tax 
system are asked to review the whole system? And what does he 
have to say about the members of this House being excluded from 
this review?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maloney:</B> Madam Speaker, there is an old adage that it takes 
a thief to catch a thief. Certainly the accountants have a job to do. 
They are familiar with the tax system. It is their right and 
obligation on behalf of their clients to see where a creative 
approach to the tax laws can provide a benefit to their clients.
<P>
	Consequently, the same accountants can know where these 
loopholes are and can plug them. It is a good step to use them. I 
would agree with my friend that having members of Parliament 
also on the review is certainly an issue that should be addressed and 
would be beneficial.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
hon. member spoke a lot about old age security and the need to 
sustain different types of benefits for seniors. That is laudable.
<P>
	What does he have to say about the government spending all 
kinds of money in areas that actually jeopardize that kind of 
funding for seniors. I referred in  my speech a few moments ago to 
a $105,000 subsidy that was sent to the Canadian Bankers 
Association.
<P>
	The one I did not mention, and my hon. friend opposite will 
appreciate this, is that for some reason the Canadian Bar 
Association received $277,000 from the Canadian government as a 
subsidy.
<P>
	What does my friend opposite think of those subsidies? Will he 
be encouraging the government to start cutting back in those areas 
so that we can preserve social spending for seniors?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maloney:</B> Madam Speaker, there is no question that my 
friend makes some startling revelations with those figures. I would 
be interested to know what those amounts were used for, and 
whether in fact they were subsidies. If they were, I would agree 
with him that unless expenditures of that nature can be justified, 
they should be cut out.
<P>
	There is no question that there are certain priorities in our 
spending situations that we have to look at very carefully and 
address. We have to set our priorities straight and follow them. 
Certainly seniors are a priority for this government and for this 
member.
<P>
<B>(1755 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough West, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
it is a privilege for me to have an opportunity to say a few words 
about the 1996 budget. The hour is late and we will soon be voting 
on the budget. Being the last speaker or very likely close to the last 
speaker, pretty well everything that could be said about this budget, 
pro and con, has likely been said.
<P>
	What I want to do is concentrate on four areas which I feel are of 
some note. I also want to speak to my constituents about some of 
the concerns I heard in some of the public forums which I convened 
in my riding concerning the budget.
<P>
	If I have a little more time I will talk about a couple of other 
things, but the four items I want to talk about now are: no new taxes 
in this budget; reducing the deficit; the goods and services tax and 
what is going to be done about it; and the excellent credibility of 
the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	The first thing I want to point out, as no doubt many others have, 
is that this is a budget which has no new taxes. It has no personal 
tax increases, no corporate tax increases and no excise tax 
increases. This is the third budget in a row in which there have been 
no personal tax increases.
<P>
	What that means to me as a taxpayer is very simple. If I spend 
more money than I earn and put it on credit cards, get a loan, 
borrow from Peter to pay Paul, et cetera, there are only two ways 
that I can end up paying back the money that I owe. Hopefully I can 
either get an increase in pay from my employer and assign that 
increase to paying off the money that I owe, or I can cut  back on 
my expenditures, or I can do both if I am lucky enough to get an 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1577"> 1577 </A></B>
<P>
increase in the salary that I earn from my employer and I can cut 
back on expenditures.
<P>
	What the budget states is very simple. There is going to be no 
increase in my pay because the only way that the government can 
increase my pay is to increase taxes. Therefore, if there is no 
increase in my pay and I sit down and look at my family budget and 
see that I am spending more than I earn and I owe more than I have 
the capability of paying based on my salary, then I have to tell 
myself to cut back on something. I have to stop spending some of 
that money because I am not going to be earning any more money. 
That is what this budget has stated. The government is not 
increasing any taxes, therefore it is like not getting a raise in pay.
<P>
	Consequently, if we are going to reduce the deficit, which we 
must do of course, then we have to do it in another way. The other 
way is cutting back on expenditures, spending wisely. This is very 
important because it dovetails into the second point I want to talk 
about which is reducing the deficit.
<P>
	When people spend more than they collect they run a deficit. 
Debt itself is not a bad thing. For example, very few people in this 
country would ever be able to own a home if they were not able to 
go into debt to the bank for a mortgage. Just because they have a 
mortgage does not make it bad that they have debt, otherwise they 
would not be able to own a home.
<P>
	The problem is when one's debt load becomes greater than one's 
ability to pay back the interest and hopefully some payment of 
principal on a monthly basis.
<P>
	What has happened with the Government of Canada over a 
protracted period of time is that more money has been spent than is 
coming in for a host of reasons. When the present government took 
over in 1993, by almost all accounts it took over a deficit of $42 
billion or something to that effect. When we talk in that magnitude 
of numbers it is almost impossible to comprehend what we are 
talking about in terms of billions of dollars. Whether it is $40 
billion or $42 billion, it is still an awful lot of money to owe.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	What did we say we were going to do to deal with that problem? 
I have the red book here and I have read it carefully. I have read it 
again. I have listened to some of the speeches from the members 
opposite. A lot of people say they have read this book. A lot of 
people say they have read it again but I do not believe them. They 
may have read a press account of what the press says is in the book, 
but I do not think they have read the book.
<P>
	For those people, let me quote from page 20: ``Any responsible 
government-and this is any responsible government be it Liberal, 
Conservative, NDP or Reform-``must have as a goal the 
elimination of the deficit''. That is obvious. That is our goal. This 
was the  Liberal Party speaking when we were running for election 
as the government of this country. Our goal is the elimination of the 
deficit. Let there be no doubt about it, it was plainly stated. Of 
course there are many ways to get to the same goal.
<P>
	I am absolutely delighted that as we approach the end of this 
debate there is some activity on the benches opposite. I can actually 
hear some people listening. It means somebody is listening to what 
I am saying.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> I tell you, there hasn't been very much on that side, 
Tom.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> We listen to everything you have to say.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wappel:</B> Now that I have the attention of my hon. friends, 
perhaps they can listen to this lecture. I am quoting again from the 
red book:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Given the current state of the economy, a realistic interim target for a Liberal 
government is to seek to reduce the federal deficit to 3 per cent of gross 
domestic product by the end of its third year in office.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is the goal we set ourselves. We said this is what we would 
do. Let us put that into some kind of a context. Let us put that into 
the context of my home.
<P>
	Let us say that I am running a debt and I am running a deficit 
with my credit cards. I can say to my family: ``Look. We owe a few 
thousand dollars. We are going to have to cut back a little bit so you 
will not be able to take all of the lessons you want to take. I will not 
be able to go out as often as I want. Even though I might like to go 
to the concert, I will not be able to pay $100 for a Julio Iglesias 
ticket because we cannot afford it. Yes, we will be able to go to 
something else. Maybe we will be able to go to a free concert 
offered by somebody on July 1''. I will cut back here and there. I 
will still buy groceries of course. I will still buy clothing. I will still 
put gas in the car. I will still have a car that I can drive so I can take 
the children to and from their various activities. I will still do those 
things but I will cut back.
<P>
	What will this mean? Yes it will be a little tough but over a 
period of time, over two or three years, we will pay off that $2,000 
or $3,000. Once we have that $2,000 or $3,000 paid off then I will 
be able to handle the debt load.
<P>
	That is one approach and it is the approach I think the Liberal 
Party is taking. It is the reasoned responsible approach to reducing 
the deficit.
<P>
	There are others who might approach their family and say: 
``Listen. We are $2,000 in debt so we are not going to buy any 
groceries this week. We are not going to go anywhere. We are not 
going to go to any lessons. We are going to get rid of the car, we are 
going to get rid of the house, we are going to get rid of everything. 
By golly we are going to pay that $2,000 back''. I am not going to 
have a family left if I take that approach.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1578"> 1578 </A></B>
<P>
	That is not the Liberal approach. The Liberal approach is a 
reasoned, carefully considered slow approach to deficit reduction, 
to running a deficit of zero. Once we get to zero then we get to 
positive numbers and we can start paying off some of that debt, 
remembering that not all debt is bad. Otherwise we cannot have 
some of the things that all of us have taken for granted.
<P>
	What target did the Liberals set? We set ourselves a realistic 
target for three years. Guess what? We are going to meet that target. 
Not only are we going to meet that target, we are going to drop 
from over $40 billion to about $17 billion in 1997-98.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	Compare that to the bombast and the sad predictions made by the 
Conservative government over a period of nine years. That 
government also came into office promising that it would get rid of 
the horrendous debt which the Liberals had run up in the profligacy 
of their time. They had run up a debt. There is no question. Over the 
whole course of Confederation from 1867 until 1984, a debt of 
approximately $250 billion had been run up. Remember, it took our 
entire history to get to that point and in nine years the Conservative 
government doubled it. That was from a government which 
promised to reduce the debt.
<P>
	What have we done? We have kept our promises. We have 
reduced the deficit from the $42.5 billion when we took office and 
we will keep our promise by bringing it down to $17 billion. What 
does that mean? It means it is decreasing. In the next mandate we 
will still be decreasing the deficit and we will reach zero on a 
rolling target basis, as our finance minister says.
<P>
	The proof is in the pudding. The deficit has decreased. Hon. 
members opposite can heckle all they want but the deficit is 
decreasing. That is a fact and they cannot argue with fact. They can 
be rhetorical, they can make all kinds of comments, but one thing is 
certain: the deficit is going down. It is going down under a Liberal 
government. It was going up under the previous Conservative 
government. It will continue to go down under this government. 
That is the key promise of this budget. It is one of the reasons I 
support it.
<P>
	Now I will turn to the GST. What did the red book that 
everybody professes to have read say? It is interesting. It is right in 
there.
<P>
	I remember when I was campaigning. My campaign office was 
open to everyone. There were copies of the red book. There were 
copies of summaries of the red book. I had campaign literature 
which I distributed to the people in the riding. In fact, I told the 
people in the riding what we were going to do before the election 
was called. Nobody in Scarborough West can say they did not know 
what our promise was. What was our promise? It is on page 22:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In the first session of a new Parliament, a Liberal government will give the 
all-party Finance Committee of the House of Commons a 12-month mandate to 
consult fully with Canadians and provincial governments and to report on ways 
to achieve tax fairness, simplicity, and harmonization.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Did I see the word harmonization? There it is, right in the red 
book.
<P>
	Did we deliver on that? Yes, we did. That is exactly what the 
House of Commons committee did. It continued: ``In particular the 
committee will be mandated to report on all options for alternatives 
to the current GST'', and it did. It continued: ``A Liberal 
government will replace the GST''-there is the word 
replace-``with a system that generates equivalent revenues, is 
fairer to consumers and to small business, minimizes disruption to 
small business, and promotes federal-provincial fiscal co-operation 
and harmonization''. There is the word again, twice in the same 
paragraph, in advance of anybody casting a vote.
<P>
	In 1993 prior to the election, I issued a communique to the 
people of my riding. It was four pages long and it talked about the 
goods and services tax, what was wrong with it and why there were 
problems with it. Among other things this is what I said: ``If we are 
given the privilege of governing, a Liberal government will, as a 
first priority, mandate an all-party Commons finance committee to 
consult Canadians and various levels of government on options to 
the current GST. Our objective will be to replace the GST with a 
system that, while generating the same revenues, will be fairer to 
consumers, easier to administer and will promote 
federal-provincial co-operation rather than tax competition''.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	That sounds very similar to what is in the red book, but it was 
issued before the red book. Why? Because it had been widely 
discussed and it was known when we were criticizing the 
Conservative government that this was going to be our approach. 
So even if somebody says that they did not see the red book, if they 
had been following the debate since the introduction of the GST, 
they would know that this was not some rabbit being plucked out of 
a hat, it was a longstanding policy of the Liberal Party. I say 
longstanding in the context of when the GST was brought in.
<P>
	I want to talk a bit about the history of the GST because it is 
important to recognize the context. The Conservative government 
brought in the GST as a replacement for the manufacturers sales 
tax. It was not supposed to get the government more money. It was 
supposed to be revenue neutral. This was the big promise.
<P>
	When the government found out it was going to collect billions 
upon billions of dollars more than expected, it decided to come up 
with the GST rebate. That is why people get cheques today for the 
GST. That is why they  apply for GST credits on their tax returns. It 
is because the tax takes in more money than was expected when it 
replaced the manufacturers sales tax. People forget that because 
<P>

<B><A NAME="1579"> 1579 </A></B>
<P>
now they get their nice GST rebate cheques and they want to 
continue receiving them.
<P>
	The point of the tax was not to pay down the deficit and the debt. 
The point of the tax was to collect the same amount as the 
manufacturers sales tax but in a fairer and more open way because 
the manufacturers sales tax was a hidden tax. That was the whole 
point of the GST and it failed miserably. That was one reason we 
opposed it. It was not going to do the job and it was going to cost 
too much to administer.
<P>
	That is why we are continuing to do what we can to meet our 
promise. We have until the end of our mandate to meet the promise. 
We on this side of the House are going to do the best we can to meet 
that promise. We have done that with the rest of the promises we 
set forth in the red book. I do not want people to forget the 
historical context of that.
<P>
	Finally, I want to talk about the credibility of the finance 
minister. In my view, his credibility is impeccable. I was in the last 
Parliament and those who were here will remember that year after 
year Michael Wilson stood and delivered his budget address and 
made predictions. Year after year we could bet the mortgages on 
our homes that his predictions would fail, and they did.
<P>
	When he moved over to international trade and Don 
Mazankowski became finance minister, he made predictions that 
failed. The finance minister was never right. For the opposition it 
was like shooting fish in a barrel. All the finance minister had to do 
was predict something would happen and we knew right away it 
would not happen based on his track record. We had ample time to 
set up our artillery and take our shots at him. It was not even a 
challenge for us.
<P>
	We now have a finance minister who has laid out certain goals 
and has met them. He did not go off on some tangent and promise 
the undeliverable. He has said: ``Here is what we are going to do in 
the first two years. Here is what we will do in the next two years''. 
And guess what? He did it. Who can argue with that? It is almost 
inconceivable.
<P>
	One can see the frustration of the opposition parties. How can 
they argue with success? How can they argue with a finance 
minister who says he will do something and then he does it? They 
cannot argue with that. But oh, no. The opposition parties have to 
say that he did not promise enough and that they wanted more 
promises.
<P>
	Well, our finance minister is a man of cool head and reflection. 
He knows how to bring the deficit down to zero. The way to do that 
is by rolling targets, exactly as he has said.
<P>
	In my view there is no question of the credibility of the finance 
minister, of his judgment, of his commitment to  the principles in 
the red book. There is no question at all we will meet the 
commitments we made. There is no question at all that the 
government and the people on this side will keep their promises.
<P>
	That is why today at 6.30 p.m. I will be voting in favour of the 
budget.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> It being6.30 p.m., it is my duty to interrupt the proceedings and put 
forthwith every question necessary to dispose of Ways and Means 
Motion No. 1.
<P>
	Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> All those in 
favour of the motion will please say yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> All those 
opposed will please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> In my opinion 
the yeas have it.
<P>
	<I>And more than five members having risen:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Call in the 
members.
