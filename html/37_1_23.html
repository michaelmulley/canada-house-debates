to inform the House of the death of Senator Gil Molgat of 
Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Molgat, who just last month completed a rare two terms as 
Senate Speaker, died this morning at the Ottawa General Hospital 
after suffering a massive cerebral hemorrhage Monday evening 
while on a flight from Winnipeg to Ottawa.  He was 74. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Molgat was elected five times to the Manitoba legislature, 
where he served as opposition leader from 1961 to 1969.  He was 
called to the Senate in 1970 and was Speaker there from 1994 to 
January of this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Senator Molgat was a great parliamentarian who was driven by the 
call to public duty.  Above all, he was a gentleman and a true 
friend whom we loved deeply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have lost a great Canadian and an extraordinary public 
servant.  He will be missed and long remembered.  On behalf of 
the House and the thousands whose lives he touched, I extend 
condolences to Mrs. Molgat and the family.

from two teachers expressing concern over the situation on 
Canadians farms: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have travelled in Canada from coast to coast and I have pride 
in this beautiful country.  I have been humbled and grateful to 
be part of such a vast land filled with generous and friendly 
people.  I've agonized with the people in Quebec and Ontario 
during the ice storm that was so devastating.  I've watched in 
horror the flooding in Quebec and Manitoba.  And in each instance 
I've sent a cheque because this is my country and my country 
needed help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can't understand why the rest of Canada does not realize that 
the prairies are now facing the same kind of economic crisis—a 
crisis not of their making. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am adding my voice to the rest, imploring those in power to 
seek justice and economic fairness for those employed in perhaps 
the noblest of professions—growing food for a hungry world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yours Sincerely, 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mike and Elaine Kowpak. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the government to heed these words and take immediate 
action to deal with the crisis facing farm families.

<P><A NAME="LINK7"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Gildas Molgat was first elected to the legislature of Manitoba in 
1953 when I was five years old.  I became aware of him early on 
in my life as his work as the Liberal leader and leader of the 
opposition in the Manitoba legislature was often the focus of 
some very heated discussion between my very Conservative parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Later when I, having joined the Liberal Party, finally met this 
often demonized man, I was delighted to find a proud Manitoban, a 
proud francophone and a committed Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Elevated to the Senate by Prime Minister Trudeau, Gil Molgat was 
a formidable ally in the dark days when there was only one 
elected Liberal, federally or provincially, west of the 
Ontario-Manitoba border.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was tireless.  When the troops were frustrated and 
dispirited, Gil and his lifelong partner Allison were there, 
working with us, leading us, teaching us, chairing campaigns, 
recruiting candidates, and always advocating for his province and 
his people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since my arrival here in 1993 it has been an honour and a rare 
privilege to serve in the same caucus with him.  He served for 
six years in one of the highest offices in this country and yet 
he never forgot what it was to be the MLA for Ste. Rose du Lac. 
We will miss him.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stephen Owen (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am very pleased to inform the House of the appointment of a 
constituent from Vancouver Quadra, Dr. Patricia Baird, as an 
officer of the Order of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dr. Baird first came to the attention of Canadians across the 
country when she produced her groundbreaking report on new 
reproductive technologies in 1993.  This report quickly became 
the touchstone for this controversial area of genetics and public 
policy, and Dr. Baird became a key contact when these issues 
arose across the country as well as around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She began her illustrious career at the faculty of medicine at 
the University of British Columbia, the key institutional 
constituent of Vancouver Quadra, where she was head of medical 
genetics and took that department to fame across the country in 
terms of research and clinical care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In her personal capacity she has published over 350 papers. She 
has been a member of the Medical Research Council of Canada and a 
member of the Prime Minister's National Advisory Board on Science 
and Technology.  Dr. Baird is a most worthy officer of the Order 
of Canada.

currently four remote Nunavut communities are hosting youth 
HIV-AIDS fairs in association with Health Canada and Pauktuutit 
Inuit Women's Association. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much like a science fair, projects and posters on HIV-AIDS were 
created and will be the basis of future community based HIV-AIDS 
education initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>HIV positive youth will bravely share their stories with Inuit 
youth and reinforce the message that it is so important to 
prevent the spread of HIV-AIDS. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The youth of Arctic Bay, Taloyoak, Pangnirtung and Iqaluit took 
on this project with enthusiasm and I know the important message 
will be heard through Nunavut because of their courageous 
efforts.

their lives and their health in the service of our country since 
Confederation.  How well we attend to the concerns of our 
veterans is a matter of our national conscience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we mark the 10th anniversary of the end of the gulf war. 
With us today in the gallery are three retired gulf war veterans 
of Canada's peacekeeping mission.  They are Captain Louise 
Richard, Petty Officer First Class Robert Clarke, and Captain 
Sean Bruyea.  Each bears deep scars to health and soul brought on 
through their service to our country.  Each wants respect and 
recognition as a war veteran. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I call on the government to do right by these peacekeeping 
veterans and to accord them the recognition and status that their 
sacrifices so clearly merit.  I ask my colleagues to join me in 
welcoming our peacekeeping veterans.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Carmen Provenzano (Sault Ste. Marie, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to share with the House a heartwarming 
story that bridges the gap between generations and nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have in Ottawa this week a very special visitor from France, 
Guillaume Faure, a grandson of André Faure, who put himself at 
risk to help a Canadian airman reach freedom during the second 
world war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During his 32nd bombing mission, Canadian airman Thomas Lynch, 
who served in the Royal Air Force, was shot down over occupied 
France some 50 kilometres northwest of Paris.  Thanks to Madam 
Faure and her teenage children who hid him from the Gestapo, Mr. 
Lynch was able to contact the French underground and escape 
safely to England. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More than 50 years later, Mr. Lynch and his grandson are meeting 
in person for the first time with the grandson of the family who 
saved his life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a story that Canadians will be happy to hear.  Through 
Mr. Lynch, these two young men of a new generation are sharing 
the experience that entwined their families.

Speaker, our farmers have already told us and now a report on 
agricultural policy by the OECD is telling us that Canada's 
support for agriculture is much lower than that of most other 
OECD nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I applaud the Liberal government's commitment to a level playing 
field to ensure that our agriculture and agrifood industry can 
compete at the international level.  Canada has taken great 
strides toward this goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time, however, I would encourage the government to look 
within Canada and provide our agricultural producers with the 
tools they need to compete, including effective policies and 
programs and more financial support.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, two weeks ago, 
the China World Best Group officially signed a $45 million 
investment agreement for the construction of a dye-works in 
Drummondville.  The plant will create 380 jobs in its first year 
of operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Group president Zhou Yu Chen made the following statement “By 
establishing ourselves here, we are going to be able to benefit 
from Quebec's comparative advantages as far as the costs of 
construction, energy and shipping, and particularly the quality 
of its workers, are concerned”.  He went on to say that he had 
absolutely no concerns about Quebec sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This, the first Chinese manufacturing plant to locate in Quebec, 
chose to do so in the riding of Drummond, where companies from 
over ten countries have already invested their foreign capital 
in more than thirty properties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that nearly all the elected representatives in Quebec are 
sovereignists, it must be admitted that Quebec sovereignty no 
longer frightens anyone.

in the province of Saskatchewan with the resignation of Eric 
Berntson.  This represents a wonderful opportunity for the 
government to reach out to western Canada and show that it is 
committed to meaningful parliamentary reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate was created to provide the checks and balances 
necessary for a democracy to work effectively.  Areas of high 
population should not run roughshod over less populated regions, 
and for the Senate to be properly accountable it must be elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The separation movement in my riding would likely not have 
started if the government had not neglected the agricultural 
areas of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our next senator in Saskatchewan should be selected by the 
people of Saskatchewan.  The problem is not Canada.  It is the 
federal government and the fact that we no longer have an 
effective democracy.  It is more like an elected dictatorship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Prime Minister, who claims to represent the interests 
of all Canadians, allow this seat to be held in trust until the 
provincial government passes legislation to elect its federal 
representatives in the Senate?

Mr. Speaker, our GDP growth for the last quarter slowed to 0.6%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the lowest it has been in three years, but the Minister 
of Finance continues to assure us that things are just fine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the minister refusing to bring down a new budget to

know that the Leader of the Opposition is always on the lookout 
for bad news. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I must say that the last quarter was the 22nd consecutive 
one of growth.  This has not been seen since the 1960s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I am at it, I also want to tell him that our rate of 
growth in the previous quarter was twice that of the United

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian

States, so let us do that for 22 seconds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consumer confidence index in the U.S. dropped 8.9 points in 
February.  That is a drop that economists are telling us could 
signal a recession.  Just this morning U.S. federal reserve 
chairman Alan Greenspan says the U.S. slowdown has not run its 
course yet.  That was just this morning and he loves to talk 
about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of this continuing economic weakness in Canada's large 
export market, to which he constantly refers, why is he not 
adjusting our financial plan by bringing in a new budget of tax 
and debt reductions?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

six times greater in the first year, the year the member is 
referring to, than that being projected in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would simply ask a question of the hon. member.  Given the

are not working a tag team here but I am glad he asked.  I have 
already sent him some recommendations which he has not followed 
up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bush administration in the United States is talking about a 
$1.6 trillion tax cut and significant debt reduction.  That will 
create economic advantage over Canada.  It will lure investment 
and human resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His own former assistant deputy minister says we need further 
tax cuts to remain competitive.  What he is preparing us for is a 
launching of more of the approach of failed government programs 
and massive Liberal intervention into the economy, the type of 
thing the auditor general has been criticizing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why will he not instead bring in a new budget with a significant 
move toward tax and debt reduction? 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is because President Bush's plan is over 10 years. 
Ours is over five.  President Bush's is back end loaded.  Ours is 
front end loaded.  Ours is already in place.  They are still 
talking about it in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at the results:  fourth quarter growth twice 
that of the United States and 22 consecutive quarters of growth. 
In case I forget, let me also say that in the numbers that came 
out this morning Canada's current account surplus is at an all 
time high.

happening.

the country by people who watch what economies are doing.  It is 
his own former assistant deputy minister who said that the tax 
cuts up to October closed the gap but the gap was still there.

what Mr. Drummond actually said?  Why does he not take a look at 
the reality? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess I will remind him.  As a result of our budget, our 
corporate taxes will be lower than those of the United States 
after the Bush plan.  As a result of what we have done, our 
capital gains taxes will be lower than those of the United States 
after the Bush plan.  As a result of what we did, our treatment 
of stock options will be more generous after Mr. Bush's plan 
comes in.  That is what we have done. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian

own numbers who is saying that they have created the advantage. 
Most other economists are saying it is absolutely not true. Since 
I cannot address and engage the minister in this discussion, I 
will ask a question of the Deputy Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1991, only three months after a budget was overtaken by a 
worsening economy, the now Deputy Prime Minister was in the 
opposition at the time. He asked the finance minister at the time 
to produce immediately a new economic recovery budget.  Then he 
asked, if not, would he and other ministers produce their 
resignations.  We are not asking for resignations.  We are just—

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Leader of the Opposition is now standing and attempting to 
fearmonger, attempting basically to say that things are very 
gloomy.  The fact is that we are not immune to what is happening 
in the United States.

</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in the case of the other governments not wanting to

am talking about making public the texts serving as the basis of 
negotiations at each of the tables. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The American representatives have access to these texts.  Quebec 
MNAs will too.  The Minister for International Trade says he 
wants to make all of these texts public and to persuade the 
other countries to do so as well.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to debating and reviewing treaties signed by their 
governments, British and Australian parliaments have the power 
to approve or reject these treaties, which is far from being the 
case in Canada. The government underlined that by rejecting the 
motion by the Bloc Quebecois.

the Prime Minister's position on this.  He must realize that, 
the way things are at the moment, it is as if a big family

being asked to stay out on the porch, not to speak to the 
guests, and wait quietly until they have all left before being 
allowed back in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we not to conclude from the words of the Prime Minister

schools are closing and one school recently had to get a loan 
from its parents to buy the paper needed for report cards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, when the minister rejigged equalization yesterday, Nova 
Scotia received one measly million dollars out of an additional

dominates.  What has happened is that the Nova Scotian economy 
has shown greater growth than many of the other receiving 
provinces.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Saskatoon—Wanuskewin, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, yesterday the auditor general tabled 
his report in which he stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our audits of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada have identified 
a wide variety of problems, including poor accountability and 
unacceptable results in Aboriginal programs. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians on and off reserves are disappointed that their tax 
dollars are not going to the people who need the help.  Why is 
the minister dragging his feet on demanding proper accountability 
so that we can get some acceptable results? 
<P><A NAME="LINK113"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Finlay (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Mr. Desautels is quite right in saying that the mandate of the 
department of Indian affairs poses a highly complex and sensitive 
challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We understand that improved government to government 
relationships will help the first nations in solving some of 
these social problems on their reserves and in making them more 
able to deal with the problems in the future.  That is the way we 
are working. 
<P><A NAME="LINK114"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Saskatoon—Wanuskewin, Canadian 
Alliance):</B> Mr. Speaker, the auditor general states very 
clearly that the minister and his department must be accountable 
for the way funds are managed and that program results must be 
acceptable.  He insisted that management must be transparent and 
responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the minister acknowledge that the lack of accountability 
threatens public support for these programs and at the same time 
leaves aboriginal women and children out in the cold? 
<P><A NAME="LINK115"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Finlay (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the department is working on this problem constantly.  There were 
900 audits last year.  There were only 15 that were not accepted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These problems require governance on the part of the first 
nations, help from this ministry and some time and understanding 
in order that aboriginal people can solve some of these problems 
themselves.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in the last throne speech the government promised to 
double research and development as part of its innovation agenda. 
We on this side of the House have every confidence that the 
government will honour this promise, as do Canadians, after all 
they increased our majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the Minister of Industry would like to explain to the 
other side of the House how the government will honour its 
promise.

<P><A NAME="LINK120"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the government is currently negotiating a trade deal 
with Costa Rica on sugar.  Canada already has the most open sugar 
market in the world.  Any change to the present rules will be 
disastrous to Canada's sugar cane refineries, sugar beet 
processors and sugar beet producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the government so hell bent on systematically destroying 
our agriculture industries one at a time by poorly placed trade 
policies? 
<P><A NAME="LINK121"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Government of 
Canada is very interested in a free trade arrangement or free 
trade agreement with Costa Rica.  Discussions are ongoing to 
achieve that type of arrangement.  We feel that progress is being 
made. 
<P><A NAME="LINK122"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, any agreement with Costa Rica will lay the foundation 
for future negotiations with other Central American countries and 
eventually the FTAA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the government live up to a commitment it made to western 
Canadian beet producers when it was in western Canada last year 
that it will do nothing to destroy their industry?  Will he stand 
here today and say that the government will not hurt the sugar 
industry in Canada? 
<P><A NAME="LINK123"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think it is quite 
self-evident that by pursuing a free trade agreement with Costa 
Rica the only interest the government has is in improving the 
trade relations of all parts of the economy of Canada with the 
country of Costa Rica.

the transfer, in June, of the Canada jobs fund to 
Canada Economic Development, Quebec employers are still waiting 
to find out what amount of money will be allocated and what the 
criteria for government assistance will be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been almost one year since the fund was transferred to 
Canada Economic Development. I am asking the secretary of state 
responsible for economic development to tell us where the money 
from that program is. What did he do with that money? When will 
he set the criteria?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (Minister of National Revenue and Secretary 
of State (Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions 
of Quebec), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the answer to the first part of 
the question is that the funds have not yet been transferred to 
Canada Economic Development. They will be as of April. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada Economic Development takes initiatives to support the 
development of all regions of Quebec, under certain criteria 
that are closely monitored by Treasury Board. We work under a 
system of refundable contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The funds that will be added to base A, that is the regular 
budget of Canada Economic Development, will be managed by the 
government so as to maximize regional development and job

<P><A NAME="LINK128"></A></P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>ORAL QUESTION PERIOD 
</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> The Chair has received notice of a question of 
privilege from the hon. leader of the Bloc Quebecois.  I wonder 
whether it arises out of today's question period. 
<P><A NAME="LINK129"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> It does, 
Mr. Speaker.  During Oral Question Period, we occasionally 
exchange remarks with members on the opposite side of the House. 
I know you do not like our doing so, but we do talk directly to 
each other on occasion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commented to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, during the 
debate on the free trade area of the Americas, that in Canada 
there were two nations, the Canadian nation and the Quebec 
nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His reply: “There is but one country, one nation. 
The Quebec nation does not exist”.  To this he added “You're 
crazy”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unusual for the Minister of Foreign Affairs to adopt such 
an attitude toward members on this side of the House, and even 
some within his own party, I imagine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call upon him to withdraw his words.  This is unacceptable 
language in parliament.  I believe he should act as a respectful 
parliamentarian and withdraw what he said to me. 
<P><A NAME="LINK130"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Foreign Affairs is 
unable to respond at this time—although I cannot remark on the 
presence or absence of a member—to the point raised by the leader 
of the Bloc Quebecois in the House of Commons. I promise that I 
will raise this with him.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced that the leader of the Bloc Quebecois will also 
wish to discuss with the hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe<B>—</B>Bagot the 
frequent comments he makes in similar circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would ask the House leader to 
limit himself to what I asked.  If accusations are to be made 
against the member on this side, let him make them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than spread innuendo, let him make specific charges and 
act rather than try to say “We will answer your question, but, 
as you know, it seems normal to say this sort of thing”.  This 
is his attitude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not easy, because a spirit of competition and invective 
prevails, but I think we must limit unacceptable excesses.  I 
ask the House leader to stick to this case, to behave as a 
respectful parliamentarian and to not make insinuations without 
proof.

moved for leave to introduce Bill C-286, an act to amend the 
Official Languages Act (provision of bilingual services). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, the purpose of the enactment is to 
redefine the criteria set out in the Official Languages Act so as 
to avoid unnecessary expense.  In setting criteria for 
significant demand, the act states that 25% of the population of 
an area must speak an official language in order to warrant 
service in the language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out that in addition to restoring sanity to the 
language debate and to the language laws of our country, the 
amendment would end the current effort by the federal government 
to force the newly amalgamated city of Ottawa to be officially 
bilingual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment would result in a rational approach to 
bilingualism in which regions whose numbers did not warrant it 
would not incur unnecessary expense and unilingual Canadians 
would not be denied fair access to jobs in the public service.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the name of public safety, the bill allows for the publishing 
of all names of young violent offenders.  It also seeks to change

protection does not extend to the habitat for the entire 30 
months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A prominent environmentalist has been quoted as describing this 
as protecting a bedroom while allowing for the destruction of the 
house and the bulldozing of the neighbourhood.  It is a very 
accurate portrayal of one of the weaknesses in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will be our argument at committee where we will seek 
amendments that to be effective the legislation must make habitat 
protection mandatory, not discretionary, and that the exercise of 
that discretion be over a much shorter period of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our second major concern with the bill is the methodology by 
which an endangered species is listed.  COSEWIC, the committee on 
the status of endangered wildlife in Canada, has been tracking 
endangered species and placing them on a list for several decades 
now.  The committee would continue to exist under the new 
legislation, but even though its decision is based on purely 
scientific methodology it would not be the final determinant of 
whether an endangered species is listed under the legislation and 
receives protection.  That decision would only lie in the hands 
of the minister and may be based on any number of other 
considerations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our concern with this process is that it is subject to wide 
discretion.  In spite of the fact that the bill has a number of 
provisions about community participation, making information 
available and claiming to protect vulnerable wildlife, everything 
hinges on the minister's discretion.  There is no provision for 
how that discretion would be exercised.  It does not have to be 
based on science.  It may be based on the COSEWIC list, and then 
again it may not.  There are no provisions for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw the attention of the House to the fact that there are 354 
species on that list.  Would they be protected after the bill is 
passed, assuming it gets passed?  The answer is that they would 
not.  There is no provision in the bill to make that already 
existing list a part of the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again this is an item that must be addressed.  We will be 
arguing strenuously both in committee and in the House that the 
legislation should incorporate that list by grandfathering it in 
so that species already at risk in the country would become 
protected immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One other major issue is that the bill contains no provision, no 
detail or fleshing out around what compensation would be provided 
to people who are financially disadvantaged once the bill is 
passed and put into place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is indicating that perhaps there would be some 
provision in the regulations, but he is reserving the discretion 
to himself as to when it would be used.  We would argue that we 
do not have a lot of confidence. A number of other existing 
pieces of legislation have been in place for 20 to 30 years where 
at various times it could have taken steps as a government to 
protect endangered species.  It has never done so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the NDP I indicate that we do not believe people 
should be financially impacted negatively without compensation. 
Landowners must be assured that they are not facing personal 
losses if a species is designated on their property.  Similarly 
it is our position that workers in various industries and 
communities that could be impacted by the legislation should be 
compensated.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe the guiding principle in this regard must be that the 
cost of protecting endangered species should be shared by all of 
us, not just the people on whose land endangered species happen 
to live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One final major concern we have is with regard to the extent, 
geographically and jurisdictionally, that the legislation would 
cover.  Let me throw out this one statistic.  It will only cover 
five per cent of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recognizing that I am almost out of time, I will make one final 
point.  The legislation is extremely weak with regard to 
protecting our migratory birds and animals.  If they cross the 
border they will probably be protected in the United States but 
they will not be protected here.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, thank 
you for giving me this honour to participate in this debate. As 
the Progressive Conservative Party, and as a recognized party in 
the House, we have a prearranged order for speaking.  I would 
request from the Chair that attention be paid to that particular 
issue because on other occasions previous members have been 
missed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now begin my 20 minute speech by saying that it is a 
pleasure to have a chance to participate in this particular 
debate.  As members know, this will be the first piece of 
environmental legislation that we have seen before the House in 
this particular parliament.  Members will also know quite clearly 
that this will be the government's first attempt to pass its 
first piece of environmental legislation since taking office on 
October 25, 1993.  It is the government's first bill of its own 
initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you may recall, being the learned individual that 
you are on legislation, that the previous Conservative government 
was very proactive with respect to environmental legislation.  We 
delivered to the country an acid rain protocol with the 
Americans, a packaging protocol that we did in conjunction with 
industry to reduce waste in our landfills.  The Conservative 
government also pioneered a bill known as the Canadian 
environmental protection act which was first tabled in 1988. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada was a world leader on environmental protection by 
bringing the international community together in eliminating and 
reducing the consumption of ozone depleting gases with the 
Montreal protocol of 1987.  The hon. Jean J. Charest was a very 
proactive environment minister who brought forth legislation with 
respect to new inroads in reducing pulp and paper effluent.  One 
of the other hallmarks, in addition to the acid rain protocol 
brought forth with the Americans, was the $3 billion green plan 
which had an infinite affect on pollution prevention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, this is the government's third attempt to 
bring forth a piece of legislation to protect species at risk or 
endangered species.  Bill C-65 died on the order paper leading up 
to the 1997 election.  The hon. member for Saint John was active 
in the debate at that time.  We also know that Bill C-33 died on 
the order paper as the Prime Minister chose to call his vanity 
election three years and four months into his mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The position of the Progressive Conservative Party will largely 
follow the positions developed by the species at risk working 
group, which is composed of the Canadian Pulp and Paper 
Association, the Mining Association of Canada, the Canadian 
Nature Federation, Sierra Club of Canada and the Sierra Legal 
Defence Fund.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are individuals who are normally at each other's throats 
when it comes to developing legislation of this sort, but they 
have been able to build an unprecedented consensus, which I 
believe the government should be utilizing far more than it 
currently is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In December 1999, a few weeks after the Progressive Conservative 
Party tabled its position paper, the government tabled a brown 
paper, which actually described essentially what its legislation 
would be composed of.  Our position paper was graded A by the 
environmental community and received accolades from industry 
groups as well, while the government's position paper received a 
mere D. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to compliment not only the consensus that was built 
with respect to SARWG, the species at risk working group, but 
also the consensus that was built with the Progressive 
Conservative caucus on this file.  It is a unified position built 
in conjunction with our natural resources critic, the member for 
South Shore, with our agricultural critic, the member for 
Brandon—Souris, and with the leadership that we received from 
the right hon. member for Calgary Centre in ensuring that we had 
a very comprehensive and team approach to this particular piece 
of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all well aware that Canada has over 300 species that are 
at risk or endangered.  I believe endangered species are what we 
could call our canaries in the coal mine.  When we continue to 
lose species from our environment, from the various habitats, it 
is an indication that our overall environment is starting to 
decline.  That will have a negative effect on the air we breathe 
and the water we drink. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are eight years after the government has taken office 
and this is its third kick at the can in trying to deliver a 
piece of environmental legislation.  After all the consultations, 
after all the homework, one would think we would essentially be 
reviewing a piece of legislation that would be nearly perfect. 
As the critic from the NDP pointed out in his remarks a few 
moments ago, we are far from there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a couple of particular issues I wanted to speak about 
with respect to the legislation.  Clearly, habitat loss is the 
single largest cause of why species become at risk, become 
endangered and ultimately become extinct.  Habitat loss is 
responsible for over 80% of species decline in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-5 and its predecessor, Bill C-33, are in fact weaker than 
the first attempt at species at risk legislation that was brought 
forth, which was known as Bill C-65.  Bill C-65 had significant 
problems, but it did contain stronger provisions for habitat 
protection, especially on federal lands.  This was largely the 
result of the work of the environment committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-5 does not require protection of critical habitat for 
endangered species.  It merely states that cabinet may protect 
it.  This is a significant shortcoming, especially when critical 
habitat protection is crucial to survival of a species.  Some of 
Canada's best loved species could potentially become at risk, 
whether it is the beluga whale, the woodland caribou or even the 
grizzly bear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By making habitat protection discretionary, the federal 
government is abdicating responsibility for major areas within 
its own jurisdiction, and I will repeat that:  within its own 
jurisdiction.  We are not asking the federal government to 
actually sidestep or make a foray into jurisdictions where it 
does not have the responsibility.  The federal government can and 
must protect habitat of all species within federal jurisdiction. 
This is absolutely critical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Upon review of Bill C-5, members of the House will recognize the 
fact that there are provisions for the federal government to 
intervene in provincial jurisdictions to protect species at risk. 
There are provisions whereby the federal government can intervene 
on private lands to protect species at risk.  However, it is not 
mandatory under this legislation to protect species at risk 
within federal jurisdiction, or within federal lands, for that 
matter.

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is indeed ironic given the response from the environment 
minister to the last speech from the throne.   He said “Any 
species protection legislation must include provisions for the 
protection of critical habitat of endangered species.  This is 
fundamental.  No habitat, no species”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like to have a piece of legislation that would reflect 
the minister's own words as spoken in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Building successful legislation requires input and support from 
affected stakeholders.  The Progressive Conservative plan calls 
for carrots before sticks, for incentives to reward stewardship. 
We believe it is imperative to encourage, recognize and reward 
stewardship by offering more carrots and resorting to fewer 
sticks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe this can be accomplished by listening to the concerns 
of stakeholders and by working in co-operation with them to build 
a consensus on an effective legislative design and, most 
important, engaging stakeholders in the recovery process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finding an endangered species on one's land should not mean that 
all development stops.  The key is to manage the land to ensure 
that a species can continue to survive.  We have to do away with 
the myths that have been spoken about.  I am talking about the 
myth that finding a species on one's property will result in an 
immediate economic loss.  We can reward stewardship.  There are 
many ways to address this particular issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that if a species at risk is found on a woodlot 
owner's lot, chances are the owner is working under responsible 
forestry management regimes that actually encourage an 
environment for the species.  If the species did not like it 
there, it would not be there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party believes that without the 
support of the provinces, private landowners, resource users and 
communities the endangered species bill will be impossible to 
institute.  Moreover, it will be ineffective.  It will breed the 
“shoot, shovel and shut up” response, which will result in more 
species at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party believes that when designing 
a recovery plan, with stakeholders of course, social and economic 
considerations must be accounted for.  Both objectives can be 
achieved, both to encourage stewardship and save endangered 
species.  These objectives are not mutually exclusive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another glaring weakness, which I would say is the most obvious 
and which the member for Windsor—St. Clair touched on, is that 
in Bill C-5 the cabinet rather than scientists will decide 
whether a species is at risk.  The committee on the status of 
endangered wildlife in Canada, the scientific body that has been 
in place for decades, will not have the call on determining 
whether a species is endangered.  This puts at risk the 
extinction of any species that cabinet opts not to protect and 
makes the decision a political one rather than one based on 
scientific fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an enormous flip-flop from the Canadian Alliance on 
this particular issue.  I am not talking about pensions or 
Stornoway or anything like that.  What I am referring to in this 
particular circumstance is that we can give solid credit to the 
member for Red Deer and what he now believes.  Although the 
member for Edmonton—Strathcona who was the previous critic said 
that it should be a political determination as to whether a 
species is at risk, I interpreted from the speech of the member 
for Red Deer in the House on February 21 that he believed 
scientists, not politicians, should determine whether a species 
is at risk or not.  I find it shameful that the Liberal Party of 
Canada would be the only party in the House of Commons that would 
rather resort to a political listing perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that my friend who will be speaking shortly on behalf of 
the Liberal Party was a member of the environment committee that 
studied this particular issue.  An all party consensus was built 
that the scientific list of COSEWIC should be adopted and that 
COSEWIC should determine whether a species is at risk or not. 
Now the Liberal Party of Canada is reneging on its promise on 
that particular issue.  I find that very shameful indeed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Liberals may argue that they do not want the 
scientists to be lobbied as to whether a species is at risk or 
not— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  And the minister won't be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  And the minister won't be. First, today 
scientists can be lobbied.  That is a case in point.  Second, 
those provinces that have permitted a political listing regime as 
opposed to a scientific listing regime just do not add new 
species to their endangered species lists.  Species do not get 
listed.  That has been the practice.  That is what the witnesses 
have actually told us before a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The categorical issue is that we believe in order for the 
Progressive Conservative Party to support this bill we must have 
mandatory protection of critical habitat on all federal lands 
and, I might add, within federal jurisdiction, we believe, and we 
must have scientific listing, not political listing, in order for 
us to be able to support the bill.  That is why we will be voting 
against the bill at second reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the committee may have its chance to be able to address 
these particular concerns, and I will comment that the Minister 
of the Environment, since the election, has had a far more 
co-operative approach to this particular issue and to the 
committee's work than he had exhibited beforehand.  So we will 
take the minister at his word that the committee, in conjunction 
with all the critics and all members of the House, will have a 
chance to ensure that we have better legislation which will 
protect species at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other aspect I would like to be able to touch upon with 
respect to this bill is to challenge the Government of Canada to 
take a harder look at the SARWG position.  That particular 
committee, consisting of the Mining Association of Canada, the 
Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, the Canadian Nature 
Federation, the Sierra Club of Canada and the Canadian Wildlife 
Federation, has built a coalition that we should be celebrating 
and utilizing to a larger degree than we currently are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The protection of species at risk is a fundamental issue of 
public policy that all Canadians want addressed.  A government 
commissioned Pollara poll indicated quite clearly that over 94% 
of Canadians want strong species at risk legislation to protect 
our endangered species.  Those findings were from all regions, 
including those regions in rural Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen the provinces take a lead in at least tabling 
species at risk legislation over the last number of years since 
the Rio earth summit of 1992, when the Government of Canada at 
that time really cared about the environment and was a 
fundamental leader on environmental issues.  We have not seen 
this federal government following suit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote the executive director of the Sierra Club 
of Canada.  She said that if this bill is passed in its current 
form it would be the weakest endangered species legislation in 
the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a framework here that could be augmented and could 
actually produce a very relevant bill, a very good bill, that 
would protect our natural heritage in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is where we are right now.  We are speaking from a position 
of currency at the moment.  During the election campaign it was 
the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada and, I might add, 
the NDP, that actually received accolades on their positions on 
protecting species at risk in their platforms of the election of 
November 27, 2000.  The Government of Canada neglected to put it 
this its platform.  It was added to its website later on.  The 
government said it had forgotten about it.  We are here to remind 
the government that this is a very important issue of public 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have laid out our position.  We look forward to working 
co-operatively with the minister and the chair of the environment 
committee and to trying to work diligently at the clause by 
clause stage in order to produce a sound piece of legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gar Knutson (Elgin—Middlesex—London, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, let me begin by saying I intend to split my time with 
the member for Yukon.  Other than a few comments I made in last 
evening's debate, this is really my maiden speech.  As such, I 
would like to begin by thanking the constituents of 
Elgin—Middlesex—London for honouring me as their third term MP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know hon. members will agree that obviously the highest 
professional honour anyone could ever have is to be elected to 
parliament.  It is simply a tremendous overwhelming honour that 
they have elected me three times and I am very grateful for that 
privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to thank my family for their support and in 
particular, my wife. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  What is her name? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gar Knutson:</B>  Her name is Christine.  She has had to 
deal with the challenges of being married to a member of 
parliament over the last seven years and I appreciate her 
support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last, if I may be allowed to stay with the personal issues for a 
minute, I would also like to thank my parents for their support 
and, in particular, my father for his guidance.  Unfortunately, 
he passed away just after the election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I turn now to the issues of today's debate, we should ask 
ourselves the question, why should we care?  Does it matter in 
effect that the loggerhead shrike is on the verge of extinction? 
Does it matter that the passenger pigeon has become extinct?  We 
all know that extinction exists in nature.  The dinosaurs have 
become extinct.  In effect, why is this an issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of extinction is not the natural rate of extinction, 
but we should concern ourselves when species, whether they are 
plants or animals, are becoming extinct at a rate far faster than 
they would under normal evolutionary circumstances.  We should 
care at a most basic level because extinction of plants and 
animals may be an early warning of our extinction, that is the 
extinction of the human race.  If not of our extinction, it 
should at least be an early warning of threats to our well-being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Endangered species can play the role of a canary in the mine 
shaft.  If all of a sudden our frog population is declining 
because of changes in the atmosphere which can be a signal that 
we need to change our ways.  It can be a signal that there is 
tremendous damage being done to the environment, to the 
ecosystems, to the plants, to the animals and to human beings, 
which depend on those ecosystems.  It is important that we pay 
attention to these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should also care because of the importance of biodiversity. 
By that I mean, having the widest possible variety of plants and 
animals on the planet earth.  We should care for medical reasons. 
Oftentimes, unthought of medical solutions, whether they are 
pharmaceuticals or whatever, come from plants that probably have 
not even yet been discovered or categorized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not only care for practical reasons in terms of our 
own self-interest, but I believe that we should also care for 
more basic spiritual or religious reasons.  While I do not share 
an animal rights point of view of the world, I believe our 
natural world deserves our respect.  The unnecessary extinction 
of plant or animal species is akin to a crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to suggest that Canada has a particular 
responsibility to deal with this issue.  With so much of our 
population concentrated in a relatively small part of our land 
mass, habitat protection, which is fundamental to species 
protection, is relatively easy for us when compared to other 
countries with larger populations or perhaps fewer resources.  If 
Canadians cannot protect habitat and the species that depend on 
them, how can we expect other countries to do it?  I think it is 
our responsibility to take a lead on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Talking about habitat protection and more specifically, 
protecting wilderness, His Royal Highness, Prince Philip, stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sorry story of the almost absent-minded degradation and 
destruction of so much of the world's biosphere is becoming only 
too well known to millions of people.  Every other day there are 
disturbing stories about the burning of tropical forests, 
reclaimed wetlands, polluted rivers, lakes and oceans and the 
growing list of species of animals and plants becoming extinct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has an almost unique opportunity to ensure that future 
generations will be able to see examples of the state their land 
was in before the rush for development and exploitation began. 
The task is to conserve a whole range of viable ecosystems and 
habitats covering all the country's natural regions.  It is also 
necessary to ensure that those human activities that impinge 
directly on the natural environment, such as forestry, farming 
and commercial fishing, adopt sound conservation practices.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the same book, William Francis Butler is quoted upon visiting 
the western plains shortly after confederation.  As he stood in 
an ocean of grass and solitude he said “One sees here the world 
as it has taken shape and form from the hands of the creator”. 
He had a profound respect for the land in its natural state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I turn to the details of the bill, let me also just say 
that a concern for extinction is part and parcel of a more 
general concern about the environment.  It would make no sense at 
all to concern ourselves with endangered species while not 
concerning ourselves with, for example, climate change.  Any work 
we do on habitat protection can be wiped out in a matter of 
months, if not days, by damage from our weather systems. 
Fundamental to any activity is an appropriate humbleness as we 
look out upon the world and respect for nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that same theme, again taking a particularly Canadian view, 
writing in 1944 on a wilderness canoe voyage, Pierre Trudeau 
said,“I know a man whose school could never teach him the 
patriotism but who acquired that virtue when he felt in his bones 
the vastness of his land and the greatness of those who founded 
it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have it from the great Prime Minister Trudeau himself about 
respect for nature and respect for the Canadian wilderness.  It 
is part and parcel of respect for habitat which is fundamental to 
protecting endangered species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my remaining time let me comment directly on the bill that is 
in front of us.  The government should be applauded for making 
some improvements on its previous legislation.  Specifically, the 
compensation part of the bill is going to be essential for having 
the bill accepted in various parts of the country.  It is clear 
that the cost of changing behaviour should not be borne simply by 
the landowners.  There is a public good at large.  Consequently, 
the public should be prepared to pay for land conservation or 
habitat protection.  I do not foresee this being a tremendous 
amount of money.  It would be money well spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I share with some of my colleagues in the opposition and 
my Liberal colleagues concerns about the bill.  The legislation 
needs to go further in terms of protecting habitat, particularly 
in the area of federal jurisdiction.  I have concerns about who 
actually does the listing.  I look forward to exploring that 
issue further in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also have concerns about the rollover of the list.  Currently 
we have identified some 300 plus plants and animals that are on 
the verge of extension or are threatened.   Most, if not all of 
the scientific work, has been done.  We can make this list part 
of the legislation itself rather than making it the subject of 
cabinet regulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are my initial concerns.  I look forward to working with 
the opposition on this very critical issue.  It is part of a 
broader issue of concern for the environment.  As we look 
forward, the environment will be the issue of the next period of 
time.  This is only one small part of proper environmental 
stewardship and I am happy to play a role in it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I was very pleased to hear the hon. member indicate his concern 
that this legislation, as it is currently drafted, does not go 
far enough in a couple of critical respects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could he elaborate on the two most critical areas in particular 
that have been raised by my colleague, the member for 
Windsor—St. Clair?  The first is the question of habitat 
protection.  The second is who will ultimately have the 
responsibility for designating which are the endangered species? 
Will it ultimately be politicians or scientists?  Could he 
comment on those two issues and his intention to seek the 
strengthening of the bill in those two very important areas? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gar Knutson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will deal with the 
simpler question first which is the issue of federal 
jurisdiction.  I have been quite clear that we should have a 
section in the bill that says that the government or the minister 
is required to pass regulations that the protect habitat within 
areas of federal jurisdiction.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, when the Fathers of Confederation wrote the 
constitution in 1867, environmental concerns were not part of the 
decisions on which level of government, federal or provincial, 
had jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is some debate in the country, on a legal level in the 
courts and on political levels in Ottawa and provincial capitals, 
as to who actually has jurisdiction.  That is something the 
committee needs to turn its mind to before making a final 
decision on this.  It is something I have an opinion on but it is 
not a universal opinion.  The committee needs to look at where 
federal jurisdiction ends and provincial jurisdiction begins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the other issue of who makes the final decision, the 
question is not as simple as it may seem at first.  If we are 
going to give blank cheques to scientists and ask them to tell us 
what is on the verge of extinction, which on a certain level 
sounds quite attractive, and if politicians are not part of that 
decision, they need to follow a close second behind that and 
question the consequences of the listing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, what recovery plans or socioeconomic costs are we 
prepared to endure in order that a species might be protected? Is 
it practical that a particular species be protected?  Those are 
questions that need to be answered as part of a recovery plan or 
part of a process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly scientists should be given the opportunity to tell us, 
from a scientific basis, what should be listed.  There is a 
proposal floating around calling for a reverse onus.  Species 
would be listed and the government would have 90 days, or a 
similar time period, to take them off the list with an 
explanation as to why.  Perhaps that is a better way to go at it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, this is one of the things the committee needs to turn its 
mind to, listen to the debate and the various views from the 
government and others, and make a recommendation either by 
passing an amendment at committee stage or some other form, 
depending on what the committee's views are. 
<P><A NAME="LINK166"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
question I have for the hon. member is quite simple.  I believe 
he was a member of the standing committee that actually studied 
this particular issue.  It produced a report leading up to Bill 
C-65.  The all party report recommended adopting the COSEWIC 
list, in particular grandfathering the COSEWIC list, as well as 
using it as the starting point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had previous conversations with the member on this issue. 
Does he maintain that same position on the listing process or has 
there been some 11th hour revision? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gar Knutson:</B>  Madam Speaker, my colleague's facts are 
a little off.  What was part and parcel of Bill C-65 was a 
referral to committee before second reading.  This was toward the 
end of the 1993 parliament.  From my memory, automatic listing 
was never agreed on or never passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK167"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry Bagnell (Yukon, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
happy to help introduce Bill C-5, an act respecting the 
protection of wildlife species at risk in Canada because during 
the election I was asked if our government was going to 
reintroduce the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I will make only introductory remarks because there will 
be much feedback and suggested improvements from constituents to 
input later when it will be reviewed in committee.  For instance, 
I met with an official of the Sierra Legal Defence Fund.  He 
assures me that he will present its detailed input to the 
committee.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have also received a letter from Juri Peepre, executive 
director of CPAWS Yukon, which highlights three key areas: strong 
mandatory habitat protection, public accountability, and a very 
creative compromise ensuring science based lists and the ultimate 
role of cabinet.  I forwarded the letter to the minister and to 
the committee chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Senator Ione Christensen, the other half of the Yukon caucus, 
and I often work together on initiatives and this is no 
exception.  Senator Christensen has distributed Bill C-5 to such 
Yukon organizations as the Yukon Outfitters Association, the 
Yukon Chamber of Mines, Minister Dale Eftoda, Grand Chief Ed 
Schultz, the Yukon Conservation Society, the Yukon Chamber of 
Commerce and the Whitehorse Chamber of Commerce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Notwithstanding the fact that parliament has been receiving and 
incorporating input on the main elements of the bill for seven 
years, I will forward any feedback I receive from those other 
organizations to the minister and the committee chair just as I 
have with the CPAWS letter.  It is very exciting to be part of an 
effort to help preserve some of the species we share the earth 
with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members who were here through the first two iterations know it 
is not easy to come up with common ground for such a huge variety 
of stakeholders, some of whom want weaker legislation than that 
presented today and some of whom want stronger legislation. 
Because there are species that inhabit virtually every metre of 
our nation, there are obviously a myriad of stakeholders and 
interests with whom to try to build common ground. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my constituency in Yukon there are first nations governments, 
territorial governments, municipal governments, land use planning 
bodies, farmers, miners, loggers, trappers, sports and 
subsistence fishermen, big game outfitters, tourists, wilderness 
adventurers and campers, boaters, naturalists and snowmobilers, 
et cetera.  Our challenge as a parliament is to come up with a 
bill that protects species and is as acceptable as possible to 
the many elements of our diverse society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-5 incorporates a number of new suggestions from 
individuals and groups as refinements to previous drafts.  The 
following are some highlights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It prohibits the killing, harming, harassing, capturing or 
taking of species officially listed as threatened, endangered or 
extirpated, and the destruction of their residences.  It includes 
a public registry and a scientific assessment of species at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be mandatory action plans and recovery strategies, 
including the ability to enforce critical habitat protection.  It 
provides the authority to prohibit the killing of endangered or 
threatened species and the destruction of their critical habitat 
on all lands in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It provides emergency authority to protect species in imminent 
danger.  It uses three mechanisms: positive incentives, which we 
hope will be used in most cases; strong legal protections; and, 
if absolutely necessary, the Government of Canada can act alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It complements and works together with first nation, provincial 
and territorial governments.  It involves landowners and land 
users.  It uses traditional aboriginal knowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It complements the stewardship program in which Canadians can 
take voluntary actions to protect habitat.  It fulfils Canada's 
obligations to the court for protection of species at risk.  It 
unifies the efforts of the provinces and territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be some compensation which will act as a positive 
incentive to assist in implementation.  Budget 2000 provided $90 
million over three years and another $45 million thereafter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some work has already been done.  Under the new habitat 
stewardship program the Government of Canada has contributed $5 
million toward 60 partnership projects with communities and 
regional organizations.  In the government implemented ecological 
gift program Canadians can use capital gains for ecologically 
sensitive lands and easements for the protection of habitat, a 
measure I support because habitat is a concern in my riding.  It 
recognizes the role of boards established under land claims 
agreements such as the UFA in Yukon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will also use the debate to highlight a relatively new process 
in the federal government, the rural lens.  It is one of the 
initiatives of the Secretary of State for Rural Development. Any 
new initiative by the federal government should be examined 
through the rural lens to see how it affects rural Canadians in 
ridings such as mine in Yukon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-5 has been carefully vetted through the lens in its 
development.  I would encourage all members of the House to 
support the use of the rural lens for all programs, services and 
legislation.  It is very helpful to Yukon residents and to rural 
Canadians in all ridings to have new initiatives viewed through 
their eyes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope the bill will bring stakeholders together in support of 
the common goal of saving species.  The bill shows respect for 
property owners by having many co-operative and voluntary 
recovery possibilities and compensation if need be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will, however, fight to ensure that the rights of rural 
Canadians and Yukoners are reflected in this and other 
legislation.  Yukoners often live on the land with these species, 
sometimes at -50°C, and all have learned to survive together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proof is that at the present moment, according to the Sierra 
Legal Defence Fund, of the 364 COSEWIC listed species there are 
no species in the endangered category in Yukon.

support the legislation and help Canada live up to its 
international obligations. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nine provinces and territories, including Quebec, have laws to 
protect species at risk.  Bill C-5 is structured in such a way as 
to complement these laws and not to create overlap. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of provinces and territories do not have comprehensive 
legislation and, in the long run, the bill is a safeguard to 
filling those gaps.  Any time two governments work toward the 
same noble cause, in this case preserving species, they may on 
occasion run into overlap.  However, if it came, for instance, to 
saving a species of whale, I would rather have overlap than a gap 
because failure is irreversible. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Failure is irreversible.  We respect the agreement on 
harmonization, because the intent of this legislation is to 
complement the efforts made by the provinces and territories. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a province has a combination of its species at risk and other 
complementary legislation in place so that everything is 
protected, then this or other complementary federal legislation 
will not have to kick in. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that Bill C-5 is effective and in keeping with the 
Constitution of Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of the 
Environment said the last time around on May 11, 2000 “We have 
examined and benefited from the experience of other 
jurisdictions, other provinces, other nations”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a short note on the compensation percentage under the 
legislation.  The deal will be covered in regulations.  It will 
be thought out and studied carefully over the next several months 
and will be ready in time for the bill to be passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time to act is now.  As the NDP member for 
Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar said on May 29, 2000, in the previous 
debate, “Worldwide we are experiencing the largest extinction 
since the time of the dinosaurs.  Historically on average about 
two to three species a year went extinct due to natural causes 
but currently two to three species go extinct every hour”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Bloc member for Jonquière stated on May 15, 2000 “I 
would like to state the position of the Bloc Quebecois since 
species are disappearing more rapidly, the problem is serious and 
we must take effective action”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Alliance member for Edmonton—Strathcona said, on the same 
day, “I am confident there is nothing partisan about endangered 
species and nothing partisan about protecting endangered 
species”. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, I hope we will be work together to pass this bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1623 a British parliamentarian said that if a clod of earth 
washed away from Europe then Europe would be less.  It would be 
fitting, in that context, to say that if a species dies out then 
we are diminished because we are involved with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this House of great bells, a parliament I respect, the bells 
will soon be calling us to vote.  If we do not enact legislation 
to protect species at risk, then heed the words John Donne wrote 
in 1623: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less, as well 
as if a promontory were...any man's death diminishes me, because I

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
congratulate the member for Yukon who just spoke.  However I 
could not help but notice a contrast between what the member for 
Yukon said, which sounded like he was very supportive of the 
bill, and what the member with whom he was sharing time said, 
which was that he had concerns with the bill and was looking to 
make some changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a specific question for the member for Yukon.  In reading 
the bill our concern is that it does not cover the federal 
government's core jurisdiction, especially north of 60, with 
which the member for Yukon will be a lot more familiar than me. 
It does not cover the habitat of migratory species and does not 
apply on federally owned lands north of 60, which incidentally 
make up about 95% of federal lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member for Yukon comment on what I perceive to be a 
deficiency in the bill?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry Bagnell:</B>  Madam Speaker, with regard to the 
member's initial comment, I too mentioned the same concerns as 
the previous member but I mentioned them in the context of those 
who have more information than I do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Sierra Legal Defence Fund will comment on those very issues 
at the committee meeting.  The CPAWS Yukon branch, and Juri 
Peepre's letter, which mentioned the issues of habitat protection 
and scientific listing, will be at the committee meeting.  I look 
forward to those issues and concerns being brought to the 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a province or territory does not act, even if it is not in a 
federal jurisdiction, there is provision for the federal 
government to act to save a species.  The member raised a very 
important point relating to federal lands in Yukon.  There was a 
deficiency in that area in the last round, but I have been told 
it has been changed in this round. 
<P><A NAME="LINK169"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I listened with great interest to the 
speech made by the member for Yukon.  I am still an active 
farmer.  What happens if farmers do find an endangered species on 
their farm?  What type of compensation will be in place for them 
so they will not have to resort to what I refer to as the three 
<I>s</I>'s: shoot, shovel and shut up? Could the member tell us 
what type of compensation package would be available? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry Bagnell:</B>  Madam Speaker, the federal government 
is emphasizing conservation actions before compensation.  I 
listed a number of available programs and projects in which 
Canadians have voluntarily and through community projects 
protected a number of habitat.  I also mentioned the amounts of 
money, $90 million and $45 million, that were available for those 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The destruction of critical habitat, especially on private land, 
is a last resort and hopefully in most cases it will not come to 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Pearse report had some very detailed direction on 
compensation.  It will be studied by the department and the 
compensation will come out in the regulations.  That is why we 
have made no comment on the exact percentage.  The Pearse report 
had recommended 50%, but we still need to study in detail the 
ramifications and what would be the best compensation framework. 
It is a very complex issue and the exact details will be handled 
in the regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to allay some fears that members on the other side 
might have, I would like to say that expropriation is not 
envisaged.  The minister has been on record as saying that he 
does not think it would ever come to that and that other methods 
would be used to ensure habitat protection.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby,

am pleased to address the topic of endangered species again in 
the House of Commons.  My party supports the government bringing 
in this bill early in the legislative calendar.  Our party 
members from coast to coast have repeatedly voted at national 
assemblies for the creation of such legislation if it works in a 
pragmatic way to find the balances needed to be a viable law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The specific purposes of the enactment are to prevent Canadian 
indigenous species, sub-species and distinct populations of 
wildlife from becoming extirpated or extinct, to provide for the 
recovery of endangered or threatened species and to encourage the

risk.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee on the status of endangered wildlife in Canada, 
commonly known as COSEWIC, is an independent body of experts 
responsible for assessing and identifying species at risk. 
COSEWIC's assessments are to be reported to the Minister of the 
Environment and to the Canadian Endangered Species Conservation 
Council.  It authorizes the governor in council to establish by 
regulation the official list of species as risk based on that 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation requires that the best available knowledge be 
used to define long and short term objectives in a recovery 
strategy for endangered and threatened species.  It provides for 
action plans to identify specific actions.  It creates 
prohibitions to protect listed, threatened or endangered species 
and their critical habitats.  It recognizes that compensation may 
be needed to ensure fairness following the imposition of the 
critical habitat prohibitions.  It creates a public registry to 
assist in making documents under the act more accessible to the 
public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government claims it is consistent with the aboriginal and 
treaty rights and that it respects the authority of other federal 
ministers and provincial governments, as the legislation has a 
shared federal-provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party has a principled approach to the bill.  The written 
constitution of the Canadian Alliance, under point no. 10 in the 
addendum under statement of principles, states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that government must act for the benefit of future 
generations as much as for the present, maintaining policies that 
will nurture and develop the people's knowledge and skills, 
preserve a stable, healthy and productive society, and ensure the 
responsible development and conservation of our environment and 
natural heritage. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further in the party's published declaration of policy about the 
balance between environmental protection and economic and social 
development, paragraph 44 states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are committed to protecting and preserving Canada's natural 
environment and endangered species, and to sustainable 
development of our abundant natural resources for the use of 
current and future generations.  Therefore we will strike a 
balance between environmental preservation and economic 
development.  This includes creating partnerships with provincial 
governments, private industry, educational institutions, and the 
public, to promote meaningful progress in the area of 
environmental protection. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Paragraph 45 states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe responsible exploration, development, conservation 
and renewal of our environment is vital to our continued 
well-being as a nation and as individuals.  We will establish a 
unified and timely “single-window” approval process, and will 
vigorously enforce environmental regulations with meaningful 
penalties. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Paragraph 46 states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's water is an especially precious resource over which we 
must maintain complete sovereignty.  Any federal legislation 
dealing with this resource will respect that jurisdiction is 
shared with the provinces. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My assertion is that the Canadian Alliance is a lot greener in 
character than portrayed in the media. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Significantly, we temper our environmentalism with responsible 
attention for the pragmatic.  We will not be tempted to propose 
things that cannot be realistically delivered, unlike what all 
the other parties have done from time to time.  The government 
talks a great line but has done little in substance on the 
environmental front since 1993.  Certainly its accomplishments do 
not match up to its overreaching rhetoric. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A sticking point with the bill will be cost.  When action is 
taken to change human behaviour for the national and 
international good, we must organize ourselves so these broad 
objectives are indeed broadly shared in cost.  We can probably 
look to the case law around expropriations for guidance rather 
than the current suggested formulas.  Certainly the mechanics 
must be placed in the bill rather than left to uncertainties and 
the changeableness of regulation.  In my view, it is the major 
shortcoming of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is to be commended for again attempting the bill. 
However if there is no receptivity to amendments at the upcoming 
committee and report stage, then the whole world will know that 
what is important to Liberals is the name of the bill.  They can 
then say that they actually have a bill, rather than putting in 
place a workable set of rules that will actually save species. I 
do not think the current form of the bill will do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a huge body of additional expertise available to 
find a better balance which must be incorporated if we as a 
society are going to save anything.

While being a leader, we would work most diligently at the 
international level to bring our neighbour states along because 
in many respects protecting endangered species knows no borders.

ramifications of the Kyoto agreement.  Therefore I am not so sure 
that it is entirely sincere with its endangered species bill 
either.  That remains to be seen.

for the earth is our home for now and we have stewardship 
responsibilities for all it contains.  The public will is there 
to do good things.  Let us hope that the government will also 
find it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I listened intently to my colleague talk about judicious 
stewardship of endangered species and pragmatism.  I am a farmer. 
We have some land in Alberta with a creek running through about 
80 acres.  When my wife and I bought the land we also bought the 
land adjacent to the creek and we pay taxes on it.  It is not 
excluded from our title. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now there may or may not be some endangered species of wildlife 
or flora on that land.  I know there are a few bush partridges. I 
fret about their existence and wonder if they are endangered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would my colleague like to speak to the effectiveness of the 
bill?  If someone finds that I have an endangered species on that 
land, will I have to forfeit the use of the land?  As it is, our 
cattle go down to the creek to drink.  Are there provisions in 
the bill that would compensate me if I had to set land aside for 
some endangered species to flourish?  Does the bill provide for 
that?  If not, what would my colleague suggest to improve that 
situation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth:</B>  Madam Speaker, the problem with 
endangered species legislation, and it was certainly the problem 
in the American experience which was litigated through the 
courts, is that the good intentions of a law can wind up having a 
perverse purpose or a perverse consequence.  We have heard of the 
tendency of the three esses from a previous speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main problem is that in order to further a protection regime 
some intended use of someone's land could be prohibited, or 
perhaps the land currently in fallow may require a future plan 
for planting crop.  Landowners, especially in rural Canada, are 
already doing myriad things to preserve endangered species and 
the characters of wildness and habitat.  The bill must recognize 
the wonderful things that are ongoing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the example cited, maybe some limits would have to be placed 
on the watering of cattle.  Maybe there would have to be some 
mitigation factors such as a small amount of fencing to keep the 
cattle from destroying the shoreline of the stream or ensuring 
they only have access to the stream at a specific spot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps there are other fields where the cattle would not be 
allowed during the early part of the year or they would be not 
allowed to go into a section until later in the year, after 
nesting has been completed.  There are some costs involved. 
Perhaps the cattle would have to be trucked to another field or 
fed in a feedlot. 
The principle of that is that if there is a national or 
international objective there must be fair compensation for the 
willing landowner who wants to co-operate but does not want to 
pay the total social or environmental cost specifically by 
himself when the nation wants this objective accomplished.  The 
problem is that in the bill there is no formula.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Professor Pearse was asked to do a consultation paper for the 
government but rumour has it that the minister is not predisposed 
to accept that formula. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will have to look at regulation in the future.  I suggested 
in my speech that perhaps we could look to the body of law and 
jurisprudence that is already there and learn from the 
expropriation principles.  However we are not talking about 
expropriation.  The cost could mean a limit on use at a 
particular time of the year or maybe putting up a new kind of 
fence in an area to protect some nests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with the bill is always cost.  The administration 
has difficulty putting in legislation something that has open 
ended cost into the future.  I can understand the government 
being very careful to stay away from that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK172"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise and speak to this bill today. 
The idea of a bill to protect endangered species has been kicked 
around Parliament Hill for a long time.  It has gone through 
numerous ministers.  The only continuous factor has been the 
chairman of the environment committee, the member for Davenport, 
who has been through all of it and is certainly an advocate for 
strong environmental laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the protection of endangered species.  My colleague 
from Red Deer said the other day that polls have indicated that 
95% of Canadians support some kind of legislation to protect 
endangered species.  He wondered why it was not 100% and why 
anybody would not want to do that?   We agree that it needs to be 
done, but it needs to be done in a way that is fair and that 
deals with some issues that we feel are not being dealt with in 
this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will support the bill but we will put forth some amendments. 
We are hopeful that the government will, at some point in time 
during the bill's process through the House to become law, look 
at those amendments.  We are also hopeful that the government 
will listen to the people of Canada and make the changes needed 
to make the bill work properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot have the three <I>s'</I>s, shoot, shovel and shut-up, in 
Canada.   It happened when some strong handed legislation was 
introduced in the United States and it did not work.  We need to 
deal with co-operation, compensation, partnerships and working 
with stewardship initiatives in the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Compensation and scientific integrity are two issues in the bill 
for which we will have a lot of input.  Scientists should decide 
what species are at risk.  They should create the list and that 
is it.  There should be no political interference in who decides 
what an endangered species is.  It should be done scientifically 
and then presented to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I feel, and I am sure this has been stated by others, 
that if any action is taken on that list it will require dollars 
and the intervention of some body with authority, which should be 
the duty of the elected politicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to be very careful that the co-operative efforts put 
forward already and the stewardship initiatives that we see 
across Canada are supported, enhanced and rewarded.  We have a 
huge concern with that issue.  We have to ensure that the people 
who are working so hard on their own to create habitat for 
endangered species and to preserve habitat that exists are 
recognized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a great opportunity the summer before last to go up to the 
eastern irrigation district around Brooks.  I was invited up 
there by a fellow named Tom Livingstone.  There is a huge tract 
of pure virgin prairie grass that is being used for grazing.  It 
is managed very well.  There are oil and gas wells on this land. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1630"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among all of this is the burrowing owl habitat.  I was able to 
actually see a number of owls living there and raising their 
young right in among the cattle and the other development.  The 
people there do things very carefully.  They make sure that when 
the species need to be left alone, they are left alone.  There is 
a huge tract of water that is used for wildlife and fowl.  It was 
incredible.  There were antelope and all kinds of ducks and geese 
there.  It was quite a thing to see.  These people have done that 
as an irrigation district to preserve what was on the prairies 
when we first came. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So in regard to this idea that we need to have heavy-handed 
legislation to bring our ranchers, our oil and gas exploration 
companies and our farmers into line, I do not think it needs to 
be done.  If we work co-operatively with them and show them some 
support for their initiatives, we can go a long way to really 
doing this thing in a proper manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to make sure of something:  people have told me that 
they want to have input into the bill.  They want the committee 
to sit.  After the committee gets Bill C-5, people want it to 
hear witnesses from all sectors of society.  They want the 
committee to travel, to get out to parts of Canada, to get into 
the north. The member from the Yukon has issues in his area. 
People on the east and west coasts have issues.  All across 
Canada people should have the ability to come to the committee to 
present their ideas to help make a bill that will work well.  I 
encourage the members of our caucus on that committee and the 
others to work that way, to get out and go across this country to 
get that input that is so rightfully needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party feels the compensation issue has to be in the 
legislation.  To say that it will be worked out in regulation 
afterward is not something that we can live with.  We certainly 
do not support the position presented by the Pearse report that 
one does not receive compensation until over 10% of one's 
livelihood has been affected and then one is only compensated for 
50%.  We would like to see full compensation.  If we do it that 
way, we will encourage landowners and others to really take an 
active part in this.  That has to be in the legislation.  It has 
to spelled out very clearly that compensation will be given and 
that it will be given to the full extent that the landowner is 
affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea that all Canadians feel something needs to be done for 
the protection of endangered species brings us to the fact that 
all Canadians should be part of the cost of any mitigation 
implemented to preserve habitat.  If it is a cost to society in 
general, then let us put it into the legislation and let all 
Canadians have a look at what that means.  Certainly the elected 
officials have to be the people who are responsible for any 
spending of dollars that go into the protection of endangered 
species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was on the environment committee we talked at length 
about residual powers, as we have here, about who should have 
effect over whom or which level of government and provinces 
should.  A lot of the provinces have strong endangered species 
legislation.  We have to work hand in hand.  We have to receive 
the input from the provinces.  We must make sure they understand 
that this is going to be a co-operative effort and that the end 
result will be to the benefit of the endangered species in the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw some really unusual coalitions formed when the bill was 
introduced last time in the House.  We saw environmental groups 
get together with industry.  We saw the mining industry come 
forward with the pulp and paper people, the Sierra Legal Defence 
Fund and the Canadian Wildlife Federation.  Seeing all these 
people getting together to work together for the common good of 
endangered species was very encouraging.  That is something that 
we as a country have to build on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to encourage these types of partnerships and coalitions 
to get together to come up with the right plan that will work. If 
we have them all involved, if we have input from everybody and if 
we come up with the proper balance, there is no reason why we 
cannot have a law in place that will do the job but will allow us 
to go on with our lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members know that we need to preserve what is here.  I have 
children and grandchildren and I certainly want them to have the 
ability to see the things that I have seen in my life.  We need 
to do this as a country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In regard to the whole idea that it will not work, the idea that 
one part of society will go against the other and it will not 
come to be because we cannot come to an agreement, I do not buy 
into that. 
I think there are ways we can do it.  If we have the compensation 
in the bill, if we work hard at the co-operative level to reward 
stewardship and reward the programs in place today—and enhance 
them if need be—if we show that we are willing as a government, 
as a body of elected officials, to receive input from Canadians 
in all parts of society, we will have support.  We will have a 
bill that we can work with.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things I experienced in the environment committee 
when we went through some other legislation was the wish of some 
to take out any reference to the word economics.  If we were 
looking at social and economic reasons for doing something, 
people said let us not worry about the economics.  However, I 
think we need to.  When we are talking about the livelihood of 
people on the land and on the waters of the country, we need to 
bring that into the mix, into the formula. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us put the compensation aspect into the bill, let us work 
co-operatively, let us listen to all Canadians and let us come up 
with a bill we can all be proud of. 
<P><A NAME="LINK173"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the comments of the member in 
reference to those who work our land, our farmers, ranchers and 
any others who are using the land as their living, because they 
have been there a long time.  I can remember as a youngster the 
care taken by farmers and ranchers in the area where I grew up to 
make sure there was a sort of habitat for some of the birds and 
some of the ground animals.  That seemed to be the order of the 
day.  That seemed to be the norm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we have a very highly mechanized farming community and 
that concern is still out there, because it is something, it 
seems, that is passed on from one generation to another.  I can 
recall farmers leaving wide tracts of grassy plain spotted with 
trees to allow the birds and ground animals to flourish there. 
They deliberately set that land aside so that they too could 
enjoy seeing those creatures around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think a great deal has changed in our farming 
community.  I will ask the member to tell us if he sees that kind 
of change taking place since he is from that same background. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also have another question.  I was in California three years 
ago, in the Fresno valley, where there is a very strong 
environmental law.  I must say that I find it almost unsettling 
to think of the reaction that would take place if that kind of 
law were to come up here in regard to those who are protecting 
certain species at risk and how the state handles it.  I will 
relate to members the situation that I learned about down there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A farmer ploughing his land in the Fresno valley happened to run 
over a nest of kangaroo rats and kill them all.  The 
environmentalists had been monitoring this.  They swooped down on 
the poor farmer and seized his equipment.  Here was a man who was 
trying to make a living in a very competitive world.  They held 
his equipment, almost like they had the evidence and they were 
going to keep it, much to the detriment of his business.  He is 
subject to court appearances and court action at great cost, 
which he has to bear, because he happened to run over some 
endangered kangaroo rats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something out of balance there.  I would like the 
member for Lethbridge to comment on that and tell us if he 
actually envisions something like that happening here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson:</B>  Madam Speaker, that is exactly what I 
was referring to.  If we have a heavy-handed command and control 
approach to protecting endangered species, we will not have any 
co-operation.  We need to do it in a co-operative way, recognize 
that landowners are faced with some of these situations and help 
them get by.

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing in the bill is penalties.  There are penalties of a 
million or half a million dollars for this or that.  If that is 
to be in the bill, why can we not have the compensation factor in 
the bill as well?  We have to let people know there is some 
mechanism in place that will allow them to carry on with their 
way of life or their processes without giving them the heavy end 
of the stick all the time.  We must have some method of keeping 
people working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly I was raised in an agricultural community and I too 
have some farmland.  When I drive through the rural parts of this 
country, I am encouraged to see the things that people are doing 
on their own accord.  Some of the practices we have today do take 
out some of the protective hedgerows and things.  I will not deny 
that.  However, in other areas people are still volunteering to 
put some land aside to create habitat and we really need to 
encourage that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing the member mentioned too was this whole idea of people 
being able to point a finger at a person who is on the land, say 
that the person has just disturbed some critical habitat and 
bring a suit to bear against that person.  We have a little bit 
of a problem with that as well.  We think there should be a way 
to do this without having everybody who is going for a long walk 
in the country being able to point, say that something is wrong 
and get some action started. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Co-operation and the balance are the things we are getting at. 
We need to see that.  If those things are not there, the bill 
will not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  It is my duty 
pursuant to Standing Order 38 to inform the House that the 
questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as 
follows:  the hon. member for Cumberland—Colchester, Foreign 
Affairs; the hon. member for Nanaimo—Alberni, Coast Guard; and 
the hon. member for Saskatoon—Humboldt, Employment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK174"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the 
Minister of the Environment is to be congratulated for 
reintroducing the bill.  It is urgently needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we all know, Canadians care about endangered species, as 
proven by the many conservation projects across Canada, and the 
minister has provided funding to support current and future 
initiatives in this respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His promotion of stewardship is a major improvement over 
previous bills.  In addition, the measure to provide a safety 
net, should the provinces fail to enact similar provisions, is 
also a fine improvement on the 1996 version, namely Bill C-65. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister should also be commended for some changes to Bill 
C-33.  His changes include definitions in the bill, so amended to 
be consistent with those used by the committee on the status of 
endangered wildlife in Canada, a scientific committee.  His 
changes also include the publication of specific documents in the 
public registry set up under the act, to provide greater 
openness, transparency and accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me now describe some of the shortcomings of the bill, which 
could be corrected in committee.  As regards the initial list of 
species, cabinet may, on the recommendation of the minister, 
establish the list of wildlife species at risk, but it may not. 
The bill does not even guarantee that there will be an initial 
list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Scientists have appeared before the Standing Committee on 
Environment and Sustainable Development.  They expressed a 
serious concern.  There are currently approximately 185 species 
that have been reassessed by scientists.  As I recall the 
discussion, we were asked that the reassessed scientific list, 
currently at 185 species, come into force at the moment the 
legislation is proclaimed so as to make it the starting list.  I 
support that proposal.  Earlier this afternoon, the member for 
Elgin—Middlesex—London put forward another proposal which I 
think has a great potential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to future changes by scientists to the list of species at 
risk, it is important to note that the provincial record, because 
of reliance on political listing, is very weak.  Only 12% of 
endangered species have made it onto the legal list in Quebec; 
only 23% in Ontario; and only 32% in Saskatchewan.  The abysmal 
provincial record shows how little protection may be given to 
species when politicians decide about listing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The poor provincial record also underlines how crucial it is for 
Bill C-5 to ensure that the federal safety net will apply should 
a province fail to protect a species identified at risk by 
scientists.  I commend the minister for having included this net. 
It is worth noting by contrast that in Nova Scotia the scientific 
list automatically becomes the legal list under the legislation. 
We should follow the Nova Scotia example.

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another weakness with the bill is that it contains too much 
discretion.  In too many instances the minister may make a 
recommendation to cabinet, but he or she may not.  Then there is 
the hurdle posed by the fact that cabinet may decide to enact 
crucial provisions of Bill C-5, but it may not.  This means there 
is uncertainty in the implementation of the act affecting those 
who use the land.  Landowners and other interested parties would 
not be given a clear indication of how they are to improve their 
practices to protect endangered species because of the 
uncertainty surrounding the implementation of key provisions of 
the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next, as we all know, the primary cause of the loss of species 
in this country is the loss of habitat, therefore, the importance 
of critical habitat.  There is very strong public support for 
mandatory habitat protection.  I received over 1,500 postcards 
and letters urging the government to provide mandatory habitat 
protection and I am sure my colleagues have too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the bill there is no mandatory habitat protection to species 
even within federal jurisdiction.  Provisions against destroying 
the critical habitat of an endangered species would apply only 
where specified by cabinet even on federal lands.  Similarly, 
regulations to implement necessary measures to protect critical 
habitats on federal lands are left to the discretion of cabinet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By contrast, in the earlier bill, Bill C-65 which died in the 
35th parliament, the responsible minister had the authority to 
regulate or prohibit activities that would adversely affect the 
species or its critical habitat.  Why should cabinet be required 
to determine every component of the critical habitat to be 
protected for every species?  Why not give the authority to the 
Minister of the Environment alone? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we come to the protection of the critical habitat of 
species within federal jurisdiction.  That includes species on 
federal lands, migratory birds, aquatic species and cross border 
species.  Here again the critical habitat of species at risk 
within federal jurisdiction may or may not be protected, 
depending on the will of cabinet, not of the responsible minister 
alone.  Why leave such a key decision, clearly within the federal 
government's jurisdiction, to the entire cabinet and not to the 
Minister of the Environment alone as is very often the case with 
other important key legislation in other sectors? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, prohibitions against destroying critical habitats may 
apply to species on federal lands in the exclusive economic zone 
of Canada or in the continental shelf of Canada.  Cabinet may 
make regulations to protect critical habitats only on federal 
land.  These sections of the bill need to be strengthened to 
include all federal jurisdictions, namely all federal lands, 
migratory birds, cross border species and aquatic species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of the Environment made a strong commitment when he 
said in the House on February 19: “These species, the species at 
risk, and their critical habitat will be protected whether they 
are on federal, provincial or territorial or privately owned 
land”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However there are too many layers of discretion in the bill to 
facilitate the implementation of the minister's commitment. There 
are two other ministers whose approval is also needed. Then there 
is the whole cabinet that needs to be persuaded to act.  The 
likelihood that the federal government will apply habitat 
protection even on federal lands is slim as the bill is written 
at the present time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to chances that the federal government will provide a safety 
net are even smaller.  Where the minister finds that the province 
or territory is not protecting the critical habitat, the minister 
must make the recommendation to cabinet after consulting with the 
territorial or provincial minister.  There is no time limit on 
these consultations.  They could go on for a long time.  Added to 
this is cabinet discretion.  Conditions make it unlikely that 
habitat protection provisions will be put in place in the 
provinces or territories when needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same can be said about the general prohibitions against 
killing a species or destroying its residence.  Such provisions 
would apply on lands of a province or territory only to the 
extent that the federal government may specify after the minister 
has consulted with the province or territory. 
Obviously Bill C-5 would be more effective with a time limit for 
consultations and a time limit for the minister to make his or 
her recommendation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strongly urge the government to make the necessary amendments, 
so as to give the Minister of the Environment the tools he, or 
she, may need in the future to do what he said he would do, when 
he said in the House: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Make no mistake, where voluntary measures do not work, or other 
governments are unwilling or unable to act, the federal safety 
net will apply. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to the discretionary federal powers, make no mistake.  We all 
know these powers, which address cross border or 
federal-provincial environmental problems, have existed for many 
years.  They are included in the Canada Wildlife Act, the 
Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, the Canada Water Act, et 
cetera.  However, federal discretionary powers have not been 
used.  Why rely on their use for providing effective protection 
of endangered species if in reality there is no record of the use 
of such powers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am splitting my time, Madam Speaker, with the member for North 
York.  Canadians place high expectations on this government for 
protecting endangered species.  The legislation offers great 
potential for co-operative management and stewardship of our land 
and wildlife but amendments are needed.  Hopefully, after hearing 
witnesses the committee the government will decide to make the 
necessary changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by saying that we need strong legislation to 
halt the continued slide toward extinction of endangered species 
before it is too late. 
<P><A NAME="LINK175"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York North, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise and speak to Bill C-5.  My sentiments on the 
various incarnations of endangered species bills have been aired 
many times in this House.  I will address a few particulars of 
this legislation, but as one who has followed this issue closely 
for many years, I would like to begin with some broader thought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To set a context for my comments, I will borrow a few words from 
Wendell Berry, the noted farmer, poet and writer.  In an essay 
entitled “The Conservation of Nature and the Preservation of 
Humanity” he tells us: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we include ourselves as parts of belongings of the world we 
are trying to preserve, then obviously we can no longer think of 
the world as “the environment”—something out there around us. 
We can see that our relation to the world surpasses mere 
connection and verges on identity.  And we can see that our right 
to live in this world, whose parts we are, is a right that is 
strictly conditioned.  There is simply nothing in Creation that 
does not matter.  Our tradition instructs us that this is so, and 
it is being proved to be so, every day, by our experience.  We 
cannot be improved—in fact, we cannot help but be damaged—by 
our useless or greedy or merely ignorant destruction of anything. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This small quotation touches upon a number of important themes 
in the debate around the protection of endangered species. First, 
it emphasizes that we all too often and conveniently view 
ourselves as disparate from the natural world.  What possible 
relationship can we have with nature, one might ask, as we hurtle 
along a superhighway wrapped in an SUV with our ear pressed to a 
cellphone?  If we cannot see nature and we cannot hear it and we 
cannot feel it, then it becomes easy to believe that it is 
something that is not us, something that we engage in on our 
terms perhaps when driving through a national park gate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that intrinsically most of us know that this is not 
so.  We are not so far removed from an age when we were more 
aware of being of nature.  This awareness has been buried deep 
within us by the mechanism of modernity.  The challenge therefore 
becomes one of how can we reanimate this? 
How can we bring ourselves to a place where the world ceases to 
be defined in our minds as that which we have created, to a place 
where the term environment is no longer a category, a 
compartment, a file but instead includes us as part of this 
broader natural world?  Such a reanimation would help us to 
abandon the current focus on, as Berry put it, our connection 
with the world and lead us to an emphasis on our identical 
identity.  Were we to identify with nature rather than objectify 
it, who knows what wonders we might achieve. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1655"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, Berry wisely asserts that because we are of this world 
there are conditions to our participation in it.  The conditions 
of every other species' participation are determined by the laws 
of nature.  We alone among species get to set many of our own 
rules.  For example, we can kill any species, anywhere at any 
time.  We can kill for fun.  We can kill deliberately or we can 
kill accidentally.  We can kill quickly and efficiently through 
direct action or we can kill a species over a long timeframe by 
altering the conditions that it requires for survival.  We can 
even kill from great distances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely some responsibilities come with such apparent exceptions 
to the rule of nature.  Most fundamentally, if we are in nature 
and nature is in us, then the unconditional application of our 
authority is nothing less than its unconditional application 
against ourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That brings me to Berry's third point, that our destruction of 
anything in nature, whether intentional or through ignorance, 
damages us.  Actually, he puts it better: “We cannot be 
improved” through such behaviour.  The superficial and immediate 
rewards of destruction may tempt but by other measurements we are 
poisoning our own larder.  By way of example, let me ask the 
human focused critics; which of our present species of plants 
would prove to contain ingredients essential to future medicines, 
vaccines and cures?  We cannot know this now, hence we must 
accept as a condition of our participation in the world that we 
not eradicate them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I spoke on the previous version of this bill last June, I 
noted that on an issue of such fundamental importance to 
Canadians as the environment, when those concerned with its 
preservation and restoration rise to speak, few are really ready 
to listen.  Many in this place say they care and many make fine 
speeches themselves, but words are a poor substitute for action. 
All of the rhetoric in the world will not save a river, a fish, a 
forest, nor will it protect a child from a hazardous contaminant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our words will not protect species at risk; only our actions 
can.  Discretionary authorities to act may be political deal 
makers but they risk becoming convenient barriers to action in 
the hands of those who do not recognize a duty to protect the 
common.  When we respect nature we can begin to understand the 
incredible services it provides.  For those who must, putting a 
monetary value on nature's services is difficult for many 
reasons.  What price can be assigned to the last drop of water or 
the last gasp of air? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the task at hand, Bill C-5, let me first commend the Minister 
of the Environment for implementing several changes to the bill 
since its last appearance as Bill C-33.  Most notably, the 
decision to recognize the current COSEWIC list as a scientific 
list of species at risk in Canada is laudable.  However, in order 
to trigger action, the species must be legally listed.  Currently 
the decision for legal listing resides solely with governor in 
council.  Canadians from all walks of life, including industries, 
scientists, conservationists and environmentalists are concerned 
that this will therefore be a political and not a scientific 
decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The political listing approach has proven to be ineffective in 
other jurisdictions.  The proposed round table meetings every two 
years to discuss species at risk are a welcome addition to the 
bill, as are changes to what will placed in the public registry.

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The safety net provisions in Bill C-5 allow the federal 
government to step in if a province fails to protect species. 
However, the safety net is also subject to cabinet discretion. 
In other words, even if a province fails to protect species there 
is no duty for the federal government to act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the scope of the safety net provisions in a former 
endangered species legislation, Bill C-65, were more narrow than 
in Bill C-5, they contained a mandatory requirement for the 
federal government to act to protect species if provinces failed 
to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that makes the public debate around the bill 
vastly different from those around other so called environmental 
bills is that a coalition of industry, environment and 
conservation groups have come together and worked for years on 
the legislation.  I cannot tell the House how unusual this is. I 
congratulate them for their efforts in this area.  The group is 
known as the species at risk working group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along with many other Canadians, the working group has raised 
concerns that the bill does not go far enough to protect species. 
It will be the role of the House of Commons Standing Committee on 
Environment and Sustainable Development to hear from this group 
and from a wide range of Canadians on how we can improve the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will do nothing to protect species at risk unless the bill 
leaves committee as a good, effective piece of legislation.  The 
House must support legislation that is strong, fair, effective 
and makes biological sense.  It must be enforceable and it must 
be enforced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me close with a few more words from Wendell Berry: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In taking care of fellow creatures, we acknowledge that they are 
not ours; we acknowledge that they belong to an order and a 
harmony of which we ourselves are parts.  To answer to the 
perpetual crisis of our presence in this abounding and dangerous 
world, we have only the perpetual obligation of care. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on all members of the House to care about species at 
risk. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK176"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened carefully to the speeches of my colleagues from the 
Liberal Party and the Canadian Alliance on Bill C-5. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin by quoting a successor of the former Quebec 
minister of the environment, Mr. Bégin, who said this about Bill 
C-5 introduced by the Liberal Party: “Another example of useless 
duplication for Quebec”. These words are from 
the Quebec minister of the environment, who is also the minister 
of revenue and the minister responsible for the national capital 
region, namely, as members know, Paul Bégin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what he said when he looked at the federal government's 
proposal to pass this legislation on wildlife species at risk in 
Canada and to create a safety net for the protection of 
threatened species and their habitat, not only on federal sites, 
which would be acceptable to Quebec since it would only be 
normal, but also on the whole Quebec territory, which is much 
less acceptable. In fact, Mr. Bégin added: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec has always behaved in a responsible and appropriate 
manner regarding the protection of the most threatened fauna and 
flora species and intends to keep on exercising its authority in 
this matter. We will never accept an umbrella piece of 
legislation covering all the initiatives in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is out of the question for Quebec to accept federal intrusion 
on its jurisdiction. This bill must exclude all species, sites or 
habitats under Quebec's jurisdiction and must only be implemented 
at the request of the provinces or territories. Quebec has always 
taken good care of its species at risk and it will not need to 
use this legislation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec passed an act respecting threatened or vulnerable species 
in 1989. It has its own act respecting the conservation and 
development of wildlife as well as fishery regulations to protect 
species at risk in their habitat. If I am not mistaken, these two 
bills were passed under a Liberal government in Quebec. It is the 
hon. member for Lachine—Lac-Saint-Louis who deserves credit for 
these two initiatives.

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I will explain later, we can see that these two pieces of 
legislation have allowed Quebec to address the situation of 
threatened species very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec's minister of the environment reassured us in these 
terms: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These measures have given Quebec the full range of tools needed 
to identify species at risk, legally designate them as threatened 
or vulnerable, protect their habitats, and develop and implement 
recovery plans. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk about how Quebec has been looking after its 
endangered flora and fauna for the past almost 12 years since the 
introduction of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I will give an overview of this, to say the least, 
worrisome problem of the disappearance of species, this symptom 
of a worldwide problem.  It is not just a problem in Quebec or in 
the national capital region or in Canada; it is a problem the 
world over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The acceleration in demographic grow, the unrestrained 
consumption of the planet's resources, coupled with the 
occupation of land by human beings, has resulted in pollution, 
the destruction of natural habitats, and the disappearance of 
many living species throughout the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec has not been spared.  The great auk, the Labrador duck, 
and the passenger pigeon are some of the recent victims of this 
worldwide problem.  These birds have not just disappeared from 
our region; they have been exterminated from the face of the 
earth in a few short years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certain more fortunate species, such as the elk and the 
trumpeter swan have disappeared from our region, but still exist 
in small numbers elsewhere on the planet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nowadays, several hundreds of plants and dozens of animals are 
on the list of threatened species in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to stem this alarming phenomenon, many measures have 
been taken since 1978.  The Association des biologistes du Québec 
created a committee for the preservation of endangered species 
and, in 1984 or 1985, published the initial reports on the status 
of endangered plant and animal species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1983 the Montreal botanical garden and institute were 
already publishing a list of 408 rare plants in Quebec.  I will 
not give their names, but I think that the member for 
Berthier—Montcalm is now consulting the list of these 408 plants 
at the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members can see, the concern for endangered species is 
nothing new.  Back in 1974 Quebec passed its ecological reserves 
act, one of its objectives being to protect endangered species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Réserve écologique du pin rigide was created in 1978 to 
protect the pitch pine.  It was the first ecological reserve to 
protect a rare tree.  In 1981 came the Parc de conservation de la 
Gaspésie, created to save a distinct caribou population and its 
habitat.  Thus, parks and reserves are created in order to 
protect certain exceptional elements of our natural heritage, the 
heritage of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, and this one a major event, the government of Quebec 
passed, as I have already said, its act respecting threatened or 
vulnerable species in 1989, as a reaction to the increasing 
threat to the integrity of the biodiversity of Quebec and in 
response to the urgent and legitimate demands of the 
environmentalists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the enactment of this 
legislation, the government of Quebec proposed a brief overview 
of its major environmental accomplishments and those of its 
partners in connection with endangered species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some high points in the implementation of the Quebec 
legislation on endangered or vulnerable species that merit 
attention.  I will list them if I may. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In November 1988, the Centre des données sur le patrimoine 
naturel au Québec was established. In July 1992, the government 
adopted the first component of the endangered or vulnerable 
species policy.  This policy sets out the process to be followed 
for designation of a species of flora or fauna that is at risk of 
becoming endangered or vulnerable.  In June 1993, the <I>Gazette 
officielle du Québec</I>, by ministerial order, published the list 
of species of endangered or vulnerable vascular flora and 
vertebrate fauna liable to be so designated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This list, which dates back to 1993, comprises 374 species of 
vascular flora and 76 species of vertebrate fauna of Quebec.  It 
is the outcome of an analysis of the available knowledge and of 
consultations with a large number of specialists and 
environmentalists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec we have made protection a real issue.  Species 
designated or likely to become designated have been the object of 
many actions aimed at ensuring their protection and 
re-establishment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the years, thanks to numerous studies and inventories 
carried out throughout Quebec, we have acquired more knowledge of 
our endangered heritage and its status.

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This information permitted the production of reports describing 
the status of species, that is, their geographic distribution, 
their habitat, their characteristics, the state and trends of 
their populations and threats to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec the management of most biological resources is a 
matter of provincial or territorial jurisdiction, with the 
exception of migratory birds—we acknowledge and accept that—and 
marine organisms, which are federal responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even before the passage of Quebec legislation on threatened or 
vulnerable species, all threatened vertebrates were protected by 
certain measures under the Quebec laws on the environment and 
respecting the conservation and development of wildlife and 
regulations on fishing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, 76 species or animal populations are considered to be 
in difficulty, over 10% of vertebrate fauna.  Most of them are 
birds or mammals.  However, amphibians and reptiles form the 
category most affected with more than half of their species 
recorded on the list of species likely to be designated 
threatened or vulnerable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of the 76 species and populations in difficulty, 34 have been 
studied or specifically inventoried; 19 have been the subject of 
a status report; 14 have been the subject of a specific plan of 
action, in co-operation in certain instances with the 
co-operation of the federal government, bordering provinces and 
non-governmental partners; 13 are covered by specific measures to 
protect their habitat; and 10 are in the designation process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec's flora has not been left out either.  All plant species, 
except for marine plants set out in the Fisheries Act, come under 
provincial jurisdiction, need I mention.  At the moment, there 
are, as in the case of the animals, no plants either threatened 
or at risk under federal jurisdiction.  The Quebec ecological 
reserves act and the act respecting threatened or vulnerable 
species are unique in the area of plant protection in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Out of the 374 plant species that are threatened or vulnerable, 
178 have been the subject of inventories or specific studies, 41 
have been the subject of a status report and an assessment by the 
advisory committee, 19 were designated as threatened or 
vulnerable species, and 14 others are in the process of getting 
designated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Special measures to protect habitat or stocks were implemented 
for 55 of these species, including the arisema dracontium, the 
American water willow and the giant holly fern. Wild leek has 
also been designated as a vulnerable species, while American 
ginseng may soon be designated as a threatened species. In the 
case of these last two plants, it is now prohibited to sell 
specimens that were taken from their natural habitat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for flora, efforts have been made in co-operation with 
various organizations to inform the public and develop greater 
awareness. Botanists from the Quebec ministry of the environment 
and their associates took part in numerous seminars and various 
botanical inventories and activities to promote awareness. 
Information and educational documents were published, and many 
articles and specialized inserts were included in Quebec's major 
natural science magazines and in some dailies. In the past few 
months, the Internet site of the Quebec ministry of the 
environment has been providing information sheets on certain 
species that are at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec can also count on numerous allies. The study and the 
protection of threatened or vulnerable species is first and 
foremost based on co-operation between many government and 
non-government partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regional county municipalities play an essential role in the 
protection of threatened species. In recent years, RCMs, as they 
are called in Quebec, have been asked to take into account the 
presence of threatened or vulnerable species when they draw up 
their land use plans, so as to protect critical sites for these 
species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 the Pabok RCM even adopted the Aster anticostensis as 
its floral emblem. The world's largest population of that species 
is found on the territory of the Pabok RCM. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Commission de la protection du territoire agricole and the 
regional agencies promoting the development of private forests 
have recently been made aware of the importance of protecting 
threatened or vulnerable species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ad hoc joint initiatives have also been taken by Quebec and 
Canada, in a positive atmosphere. For example, the Canadian 
Wildlife Service and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans are 
the main players in the efforts to protect wildlife species that 
come under federal jurisdiction, that is migratory birds, mammals 
and marine fish, while Quebec's Société de la faune et des parcs 
and the Quebec Department of the Environment are responsible for 
all other wildlife and plant species.

de Granby and the Jardin zoologique de Saint-Félicien, and the

and the Union québécoise pour la conservation de la nature have 
all contributed actively to these efforts, along with countless 
scientists, students, university researchers and amateurs from a 
wide range of backgrounds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much of the funding for studies and activities to protect 
endangered or vulnerable species is provided by the departments 
responsible and by their partners.  The Endangered Species 
Recovery Fund of the World Wildlife Fund Canada and the partners 
for biodiversity program of the Fondation de la faune du Québec 
have made many initiatives possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal-provincial co-operation, with respect for respective 
jurisdictions, is possible.  As proof, many projects have been 
carried out under the  St. Lawrence Vision 2000 agreement, a 
federal-provincial program involving several partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More recently, an administrative agreement between the 
Department of Natural Resources, the Department of the 
Environment and the Société de la faune et des parcs du Québec 
resulted in join initiatives for the protection of forest species 
at risk.  The contribution of the private and parapublic sectors 
is also important.  Some examples are:  Ducks Unlimited, 
Hydro-Québec, Alcan, and the Montreal microbrewery, Le Cheval 
Blanc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec's accomplishments in the area of endangered or vulnerable 
species are so numerous as to be hard to count.  One of the 
finest of many fine examples is the Centre de données sur les 
espèces menacées ou vulnérables. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The conservation of endangered or vulnerable species is based on 
the available scientific data.  The Centre de données sur le 
patrimoine naturel du Québec, created by the Quebec ministry of 
the environment in 1988, the Nature Conservancy of Canada, and 
the Natural Conservancy in the United States all make active 
contributions to the gathering and distribution of information on 
these species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, the centre is administered by the Quebec ministry of the 
environment and the Société de la faune et des parcs du Québec. 
It is far more than merely a focal point for collecting and 
analyzing data.  The information it contains is necessary for 
setting priorities for the conservation of various species that 
are in precarious situations. It makes it possible to determine 
the phenological distribution and the population of these species 
in a given area.  It carries out species censuses of protected 
areas, natural sites of interest for conservation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The centre's creation has made it possible to take vulnerable 
species into consideration within the process of preparing 
development projects, environmental impact studies and various 
research projects.  Each year, close to 400 inquiries are handled 
by the centre's specialists and the regional offices of the 
ministry of the environment and the Société de la faune et des 
parcs du Québec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So much for the past.  Now for the future.  There have been a 
lot of changes in the past 12 years for certain threatened or 
vulnerable species.  The objective of reintroducing the peregrine 
falcon has been attained: new nesting sites are being 
established, which holds promise for the future of this species. 
Once gone from the St. Lawrence valley, hawks have now reached 
their previous population levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The copper redhorse and its habitat are now protected.  Specific 
protection programs and the application of current standards will 
make it possible to limit the negative impact of human activities 
on the populations, migration and spawning grounds of this fish 
unique to Quebec.  The intervention plan for the survival of the 
copper redhorse is aimed at promoting the reproduction of this 
fish.  Fishways and a wildlife refuge are needed for the 
Richelieu River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After a brush with extinction, the St. Lawrence belugas are 
increasing in number.  However, their disturbance, water 
pollution and sediment continue to cause concern among 
scientists. Draconian protection measures and the recent creation 
of the Saguenay—Saint-Laurent marine park permit a more hopeful 
outlook for the future of this species.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Ginseng is about to come under the protection of the act 
respecting threatened or vulnerable species.  The fact of its 
being grown agriculturally may soon mean the demand for this 
plant with its desirable medicinal properties will be met, while 
the natural forest populations remain protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the wild species and their habitats remain under 
pressure.  Much remains to be done to conserve biodiversity. 
The growing demand for the use of domestic plants for 
horticultural purposes puts pressure on wild plants in natural 
settings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, the marketing of wild mushrooms is increasing and the 
loss and alteration of habitats associated with human activities 
is still the main factor explaining the drop in numbers for 
certain species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Forestry and farm operations affect habitats, and so does the 
constant expansion of highways and cities. Acid rain, 
contamination caused by the emissions produced by industries and 
motor vehicles still play a major role in the acidification of 
soils and waterways, thus threatening plants and wildlife. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even climatic change force plants and animals to make 
adjustments that must be carefully examined. In this context, it 
is appropriate to speed up the review of the situation of 
endangered species, their legal designation and the 
implementation of protective measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must also continue the work undertaken and widen the scope of 
our studies. There are too few studies on invertebrates, 
molluscs, insects and spiders or non ligneous plants, including 
mushrooms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From a legislative point of view, greater complementarity 
between federal and Quebec laws would be beneficial. I insist on 
the notion of complementarity, which is more conducive to success 
than intrusion and duplication. The recent agreement on 
endangered species helps promote greater federal-provincial 
co-operation in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, as I tried to show, Quebec is doing very well 
with threatened species. The member for Lachine—Lac-Saint-Louis, 
when he was the minister, gave us an act that is effective in 
this respect, and we must think in terms of complementarity 
instead of duplication and intrusion when it comes to these 
threatened species.

kind of future we build for our children and grandchildren. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Intertwined with the treatment of nature and its biodiversity is

respect for nature around us and respect for the ecosystems that

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why the bill is so important, even essential, as a tool 
to protect the environment and nature. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rejoice that Bill C-5 was reintroduced after two of the 
previous bills died on the order paper.  I also rejoice that the 
minister brought in several changes to promote transparency and 
make the bill a better one than Bill C-33. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there are still fundamental amendments that need to be 
made.  In presenting the bill the minister said “All reasonable 
suggestions to further improve Bill C-5 will be considered 
carefully as the bill progresses through parliament”.  I am very 
glad that the minister is open to amendments being made and I 
hope several amendments will be made in committee. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I happy to say that there is almost unanimous consent amongst 
Canadians for this bill. In a Pollara poll done only a very short 
while ago, over 90 % of the Canadians living in urban or rural 
areas said they supported a strong and proactive bill on 
endangered species.

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some time ago, the committee on the status of endangered 
wildlife in Canada, known as COSEWIC, brought in for review a 
list of 339 species that were listed as threatened and 
endangered.  At this point the review is nearly completed.  Only 
53 species need to be reviewed.  By the spring the total review 
will be completed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that we leave cabinet with the discretion of when 
to list these species and at what point each species will be 
chosen or not chosen instead of having a startup list in the 
legislation before it becomes a statute.  We have been asking for 
this very strongly.  I do not think cabinet should be left with 
the discretion of deciding when, where and what species will be 
listed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also want habitat protection to be compulsory in the law 
instead of being at the discretion of the cabinet.  It is like 
that in several pieces of legislation that the provinces have put 
forward.  There is not one substantive argument that has been 
brought forward to convince us that habitat protection should not 
be compulsory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that habitat protection must be compulsory on federal 
lands, north of 60 and in areas of federal jurisdiction for cross 
border species and species that migrate between our country and 
other countries.  In this connection, a letter was sent by the 
United States senate to the President of the United States on 
October 6, 1999 by 11 senators of both parties, republicans and 
democrats alike, including the senate minority leader, Thomas 
Daschle.  The letter pointed out that Canada must ensure that any 
new bill contains habitat protection for U.S.-Canada shared 
species on all lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that unless we can cover species and habitats on a 
compulsory basis on our federal lands and on lands north of 60 
for cross border species and species that migrate between our 
country and other countries, our law will be left to the 
discretion of this government and successive governments that may 
or may not enforce it and put it into place.  We need it very 
badly because it as an essential tool. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has a wonderful chance with this bill, which will 
soon go to committee.  We all know there are only a few areas in 
the bill that need modification or improvement in order to make 
it a strong piece of legislation and one for which we can all be 
satisfied and proud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I implore the minister and the government to give the committee 
a chance to work freely.  Allow it to amend the bill in the 
critical areas, such as the listing of habitat protection and 
coverage on federal lands and in federal jurisdictions, so that 
we will have a substantive bill and one that has a mandatory 
safety net. A safety net that leaves discretion to the cabinet is 
no safety net. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of us know which areas need to be improved.  All we need now 
is that little push forward, that consent by the minister to do 
what he kindly suggested to us himself, to let these suggestions 
come forward so that the bill can be improved.  This is my 
fondest hope.

<P><A NAME="LINK180"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP) </B>moved: 
<A NAME="LINK181">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this 
House, the Goods and Services Tax and the Harmonized Sales 
Tax should be eliminated for employees in the trades who 
are required as a condition of their employment to provide 
the tools they need to do their job. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Madam Speaker, I thank the member for 
Burnaby—Douglas for seconding this very important motion for 
employees in the trades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the election campaign, I met with many constituents of 
mine, particularly those who are in the trades. They said to me 
“Why is the parliament not adopting regulations to give us a tax 
break when we buy tools for our work?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point, I would like to say that for once I might have a 
bit of a problem to concentrate and to make my speech because, 
being the youngest in a family of 11 children and the only one 
who does not have grandchildren, I am proud to tell the House 
that I will become a grandfather tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin:</B> My daughter is presently in the hospital, and 
we never know for sure, but it seems that it will be a baby boy. 
He might be in the trades one day and he could then benefit from 
my motion and get a break on the harmonized taxes. This little 
boy will be named Jonathan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It gives me great pleasure to rise in the House and speak to 
this motion. Employees in the trades, like miners, and mechanics 
working for car dealers or in small garages, have to buy their 
own tools, and they feel nothing is being done for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a company needs to hire employees in the trades and decides 
to buy the tools for them, it will be a tax deductible expense 
for the company. Moreover, it does not have to pay the GST on 
these tools. If the employee buys them himself, he has to pay the 
GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Often people who have just completed their courses in a 
community college to learn their trade have had to pay this 
expensive training, and, when they look for a job in their trade, 
they have to buy their tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in the Brunswick mine, in my riding, the carpenter 
had to by $1,200 worth of tools over a year, and the GST was $85. 
That may not be the end of the world, but, for an ordinary 
worker, it counts. Income tax is also deducted on his pay cheque. 
The electrician in the same mine paid $2,918 for his tools, and 
$148 in GST. For the heavy vehicle mechanic, it was $4,970, and 
$347 in GST.

</I></B></P><P align=left>These tradespersons say “I get up in the morning, I go to work, 
I contribute and I do not want more privileges than anybody else, 
but I would like to have a little more. I participate in the 
economy and I help these companies to survive while supporting 
myself and my family. I would like to have a little 
something”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is much like the discussion we had here, in the House of 
Commons, when we asked for tax deductions for forestry workers 
who have to go out to logging camps every spring, drive their 
cars, buy trucks, and so on. We asked for a tax deduction for 
expenses incurred to go work in logging camps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More and more we see workers who want to have a piece of the 
pie. If employers can get tax deductions for everything they buy, 
if they do not have to pay the GST or the HST, why would it not 
be the same for workers? The only difference is that when 
employers buy products, they do not have to pay the GST on those 
products, but when workers buy products, they have to pay the 
GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why workers always feel like they are being punished. I 
think it would really help if, for example, tradespersons just 
starting out, whether they are electricians, painters, welders or 
instrumentation mechanics, were given a GST exemption to buy 
their tools. I think it would be really helpful to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps these workers would say then they got at least a little 
from the government and would like the government a little more. 
Every time we talk to workers, they say the government is always 
digging into their pockets, but they are the ones who help 
companies survive, they are the ones who pay taxes, while the 
others do not pay any. I think this would be a small reward for 
these trade workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the government will say, if we do this for them, we will 
have to do the same for others. Well, this has to start 
somewhere. There is a GST on everything that we buy, but for the 
worker who has to use his tools to do his job, I think no one 
would mind if this worker were to be considered the same way as 
the owner of a company. It would be important for Canadians to 
have this chance and this opportunity. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think my motion is very important.  It is too bad that when it 
went through the committee it was not deemed to be votable.  I 
would have appreciated if it had been votable and left for the 
members of the House of Commons to decide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is easier now for committees of the House of Commons to say 
that it is too bad, it is not votable.  I would like to see the 
Liberal member across the floor face the mechanics and 
electricians in his riding for whom he has refused to eliminate 
the GST.  Those working people just want a break when they buy 
their tools.  These people work all their lives.  They use their 
tools to earn their livings.  They should be given a little break 
when they start. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After they complete grade 12, they go to community college. They 
pay to educate themselves to become mechanics or electricians. 
When they come out of community college, they are already in 
debt.  They have to pay a fee to become electricians. They will 
pay income tax all their lives.  They will not be on social 
programs.  They will be prosperous in the economy.  They just 
want a break when they start. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all like to flick a switch and have the lights on in our 
houses.  When our cars break down, we like the fact that we can 
have them fixed by mechanics.  When our water system is broken, 
we like the fact that we can call a plumber to fix it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we not give them a little gift at the beginning of their 
careers?  We could say that when they buy their tools they will 
not pay tax because they will probably pay income taxes for the 
rest of their lives.  The company that hires those people and 
provides them with tools gets a tax deduction.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If he is the employee though, it is another story.  When it is 
the working people it is like a sin if we treat them the same way 
as others.  I believe strongly that if we want the working people 
to say good things about the government, we have to give them a 
little break.  It would be a break that they would appreciate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding I have lots of people in the trades.  They have 
come to me and asked me why they do not get a tax break when they 
buy their tools.  They say the government will get its money back 
when they pay their income tax.  Every time they get their cheque 
$200 or $300 is taken off for taxes.  However this little $89, or 
$148 or $180 would be a welcome compensation for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the principle.  Sometimes the principle means a lot.  For 
example, sometimes stores have a sale, say 20% off, but no one 
rushes in to buy.  Then they put up another sign that says GST 
free.  People run in and buy because, out of principle, they do 
not have to pay the tax.  The GST is 15% in my riding in New 
Brunswick because of the harmonization.  A store could have at 
20% off sale but it would not have the same effect as if it were 
15% because of the principle of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is because of principle that we should do it.  It is too bad 
the committee refused.  However, that was its right and I accept 
that.  However, it would have been nice for the trades people of 
our country to get that break. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I used this as an example. This is a matter of principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are used to seeing, when they walk in front of stores, a 
20% discount on certain items. People are used to this. It is 
only a 20% discount, prices have perhaps been marked up and then 
the stores claim reduced them by 20%, but it is nothing more than 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However if people see a sign in a window saying “Pay no GST” 
or harmonized tax, then they go in and say “Look, in the end I 
will save money, because I will not be paying the tax”.  It is 
the principle of the thing.  There is a reason stores do this. 
It seems to bring in more customers.  It does not work to offer 
20% off, but if there is a sign advertising no GST, which is 15%, 
that brings them in.  And yet it is 5% less.  It is the principle 
of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were able to say that the government is doing that for 
them, employees in the trades would be thrilled. It is also a 
matter of principle. I know that I am repeating myself, but 
sometimes it has to be said 27 times for the members on the other 
side to understand.  I may not have the chance to say it 27 
times, but I am at least going to say it several times. If this 
tax relief were to be given to our mechanics and electricians, I 
think that they would appreciate it.  They have gone to school, 
paid for their studies and, at least, when they buy their tools 
in order to join our country's labour force, they would get a 
small reward.  The government would not be seen as being there 
solely to take their money away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A woman in my riding told me “It is unbelievable.  The 
government taxes us when we come into this world, and we are 
taxed right up until we are buried, because they even make us pay 
taxes on our coffin”.  When my grandson is born this evening, he 
will be taxed as soon as he takes his first breath. We are taxed 
from the time we come into this world until we die.  It is 
unbelievable.  It is as though the government is tax crazy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should give people a break once in a while and show some 
humanity in this case. I think it is only human to give employees 
in the trades a break.  I think it would boost morale and it 
would help them financially. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having finished my short speech, I would like to hear what other 
members have to say.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the member for 
Acadie—Bathurst for his initiative in bringing the motion before 
the House of Commons. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also congratulate him on his good news. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mechanics' tools and tools required for work seem to be a very 
topical debate right now.  The motion proposes that the Excise 
Tax Act be amended to eliminate the application of the goods and 
services tax and the harmonized sales tax for employees in trades 
who are required as a condition of their employment to provide on 
the job tools. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently GST-HST relief is provided via a rebate mechanism for 
the GST-HST paid on those employee expenses that are deductible 
in computing an employee's income from employment for income tax 
purposes. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is recognized that presently there are a number of private 
members' bills, as I mentioned before, Bill C-222, Bill C-244 and 
Bill C-225, before the House with respect to the income tax 
treatment of the tools of mechanics and others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the GST and the HST rules should be consistent with those for 
income tax purposes, it is prudent to await the outcome of the 
debates and the outcome of the discussions on these private 
members' bills.  I am sure the hon. member would agree. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, it should be stated that any tax policy with 
respect to the matter of employee tools should be fair.  In 
addition, any changes should also be relatively simple to 
administer and enforce for the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency, 
and easy to comply with for taxpayers.  In this regard, any 
changes with respect to the tax treatment of employee provided 
tools should take into account a number of factors. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, any measure in this regard should be targeted to 
extraordinary expenses.  In other words, the cost of the tools in 
question should be beyond those that most employees must incur in 
the normal course of employment.  The motion before the House 
today would provide GST and HST relief to all employees 
irrespective of the size of their expenditures instead of 
targeting relief to those who incur extraordinary expenses 
relative to their income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For employees with tool expenses comparable to those incurred by 
other employees this would be unwarranted as tax relief for 
normal employment expenses is provided through the basic personal 
exemption amount.  That is the case with apprentices.  Perhaps a 
special case needs to be considered for those with low incomes 
and high tool costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, effective control mechanisms would have to be put in 
place.  Under existing rules for income tax purposes the employer 
must certify certain expenses as eligible for deduction from 
employment income.  This is important as many items provide a 
personal benefit even when they are required for work.  One would 
need to ensure that any tax relief is provided only for items 
required as a condition of employment and not for those purchased 
for personal use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would be very difficult to do because many items could be 
purchased mostly for personal reasons even if they are used for 
work.  For instance, the computers home based employees need to 
purchase are available outside working hours for personal use. In 
these circumstances providing full tax recognition and a GST-HST 
employee rebate would be unwarranted. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, any new measures would have to both take into account 
the existing capital cost allowance provisions and appropriately 
deal with change of use and transfers to other arms length 
persons. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provisions needed to address these issues would inevitably 
be very complex since they would need to account for the large 
variety of items for which tax relief may be claimed and the 
different work situations in which such items are used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To understand this, let us consider the extensive provisions 
needed to ensure the equitable recognition of automotive 
expenses. 
Provisions governing the deductibility of employee equipment 
expenditures and corresponding GST-HST employee rebates would 
apply to hundreds of disparate items and numerous occupations.

that need to be examined carefully.  In particular, with respect 
to the GST-HST employee rebate, I hope the hon. members agree 
that it is essential to ensure that the GST-HST rules be 
consistent with those for income tax purposes. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, I think members of the House would agree, given the 
number of other private members' bills dealing with the tools of

deliberations of the House and for any government response that 
might deal with the issue of income tax deductions for employee

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned, I applaud the member's goal.  My party and I 
want to do everything possible to help the hard-working men and 
women of the country.  However I agree with my colleague for 
Etobicoke North that the mechanism would be too complex given all 
that was outlined.  I would like to perhaps see a utilizing the 
income tax system to incorporate the incentives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As was mentioned by my friend from Acadie—Bathurst, there is a 
discrepancy between workers who are workers and those who are 
self-employed.  Why not eliminate the discrepancy and utilize the 
income tax system to deal with some of the legitimate concerns 
that have been put forth by my friend from Etobicoke North? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, if a self-employed trades person buys a tool, it 
can be deducted through the income tax system through something 
called a depreciating business capital acquisition.  That 
basically means one can deduct a certain amount of the cost of 
the tool through the income tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as was correctly pointed out by my hon. friend for 
Acadie—Bathurst, if that same person is an employee the 
deduction cannot occur.  However there is a provision in the 
Income Tax Act, T-2200, that allows employees to claim certain 
types of expenses.  The rule for this would be if it is 
consumable.  It deals with certain types of supplies such as 
paper, pens and gasoline.  It would not include tools, except for 
one exemption and that is what I want to talk about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Income Tax Act now, loggers are covered.  Their power 
saws are utilized under this part of the Income Tax Act for the 
purpose of deduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would propose, and I am sure my friend from Etobicoke North 
would agree, that if we eliminate the complexities of applying 
GST to a particular point and utilize the income tax system as I 
outlined, perhaps we can work together on passing a motion which 
I and the party believes is good.  It would not be this 
particular one.  It would be one that incorporates the good 
points that I and my hon. friend from Acadie—Bathurst have put 
forth.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to join the previous speakers in 
commending the hon. member for Acadie—Bathurst for the motion he 
has brought forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can tell that the hon. member for Acadie—Bathurst has a 
strong social conscience. So do I. This motion is consistent with 
his concerns and those of some workers who do not necessarily 
feel supported by society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying that these people are working for minimum wage. 
However, contrary to popular belief, these people spend a lot of 
money to buy the tools they need to do their job. The key words 
here are “tools they need to do their job”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To get a job, any electrician, pipefitter, welder, building 
painter, blue collar worker or carpenter needs a tool kit. 
Members will see what I mean when I thank the hon. member for 
Acadie—Bathurst for standing up for the workers who do not 
necessarily get all the support they need, who do not earn high 
wages but still have to incur major expenses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance, the 
member for Etobicoke—North, pointed out earlier, there are 
before the House other bills addressing the same issue, including 
one of mine. I introduced my bill in the 36th parliament. 
It was called bill C-205.  I have again introduced this bill, 
which a committee of MPs has judged to be a votable item. 
Eventually, sometime during March I imagine, we will be 
discussing my bill, Bill C-222, which is aimed at allowing 
automobile mechanics to deduct from their income the cost of 
purchasing their tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amounts involved are considerable.  I am talking about the 
tools required by auto technicians. I will take this opportunity 
to raise the awareness of all colleagues in this House.  In order 
to work, an auto technician requires a tool kit worth at least 
$15,000, and the amount can easily be as high as $25,000, $30,000 
or $40,000. He has to have that tool kit in order to be able to 
work.  Today, with all the computers and electronic sensors, a 
person has to have quite a tool kit in order to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a heavy burden for a young apprentice, who has just 
finished a course and is saddled with student debts, whose 
parents may not be well off and often have gone into debt to help 
him get the minimum tool kit he needs to get a job.  From my 
meetings with those working in the automotive industry, I know 
that the apprentice's tool kit costs at least $4,000.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A young person just finishing his course and already in debt has 
to go into further debt or ask his parents to co-sign a $4,000 
loan for him.  When he goes looking for work at an auto dealer or 
a service station, he will have to have his own tools.  The first 
thing the owner will ask him is “Do you have your tool kit?” He 
cannot be constantly begging tools from others, going into other 
people's tool kits.  That is not the way it works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad that the parliamentary secretary said earlier that 
there were other bills before the House.  I hope that when we 
debate Bill C-222 he will not tell me what he did when we 
debated Bill C-205.  I listened very carefully to what he 
said.  He said “We cannot agree to deductions for mechanics. 
What will we tell electricians, plumbers, pipefitters and 
welders?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has found a way to distance himself from the entirely 
reasonable and legitimate motion by the member for 
Acadie—Bathurst.  I do not want to start taking a dislike to the 
parliamentary secretary, because I would like this motion and 
mine to be approved, but he cannot have it both ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He tells the member for Acadie—Bathurst “Perhaps we would not 
be ready to go with your approach, because there are other bills 
that will cover the deductibility of tools”.  I am anxious to see 
what will happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had discussions beforehand with the Parliamentary Secretary to 
the Minister of Finance.  He held this position and he told me 
that he could not vote in favour of the motion.  I met with 
members individually and brought the problem to their attention. 
I urge the member for Acadie—Bathurst to bring this problem to 
his colleagues' attention, because we each of us have in our 
ridings pipefitters, plumbers, automobile technicians, welders 
and house painters. These are ordinary people who are not 
floating in money and who are listening now, over supper in the 
case of those on eastern standard time. These people are eating 
their supper and saying to their spouse “That is right. A motion 
like that should be agreed to, because we need this”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I brought this problem to the attention of members of the House 
and the vote at second reading was 180 for and 11 against.  I 
therefore hope that when it comes time to continue the discussion 
on the mechanic's bill, we will remember the fine words of the 
parliamentary secretary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close because it is getting late. Once again, I point out 
that in an earlier life, before I was elected, I worked in the 
field of human resources for 16 years, 14 of them in the pulp and 
paper industry. 
I think that such a deduction for the cost of tools required in 
employment is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my work, the necessary tools have always been a pencil, an 
eraser and a calculator, to some extent. I am not a mechanic buff 
and my toolbox at home only includes a minimum number of tools. 
But I know that there are workers who need something like Motion 
No. 248, which was tabled by the hon. member for Acadie—Bathurst. 
It is simply a matter of equity, of social justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other categories of workers who are already allowed a 
deduction, including musicians and people who must use their car 
to work. These people can take full advantage of the deduction. 
Whether or not they pay the GST does not really change things, 
because they can deduct the amount from their income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is simply a matter of social justice and equity. We just had 
an election campaign last fall. Members from all parties in the 
House, including myself, worked hard to get elected. We visited 
many companies, small and medium sized businesses and plants.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Acadie—Bathurst introduced this motion in the 
House. Of course, he is intelligent enough to have thought of it 
on his own, but I think he will honest enough to recognize that 
he did so because people have made him aware of that issue. It 
must be understood that our role as members is to act as 
messengers, as spokespersons for the citizens whom we represent. 
This motion only asks for greater justice.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is 
with pleasure that I rise tonight to speak on Motion No. 248. The 
issue of fairer tax treatment for all Canadians is one in which 
we have been actively engaged in the House over the last several 
years.  Fairer tax treatment for all Canadians is an issue that 
has been at the forefront of my personal interest as a member of 
the House since being elected in 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member's motion specifically addresses the tax 
treatment of those involved in trades.  It would provide relief 
for GST and HST on the tools required for those trades and would 
certainly help, but I think we have to address the issue in a 
macro sense and in a more holistic way.  The whole issue of tax 
reform needs to be addressed in this place, at the finance 
committee and in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly, we should now be engaged in a budget debate.  It is 
late February.  Every February we have a budget introduced.  That 
is the tradition.  In fact, we do not have a budget 
this year.  One of my colleagues opposite, a member of the 
Liberal government, has just said that we have a budget.  In fact 
we have a mini budget, which was introduced in October and 
reflected a set of circumstances very different from those that 
exist today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We currently are at the edge of, if not a recession, certainly 
an economic slowdown, which is not just a U.S. phenomenon.  It is 
a global phenomenon.  Our reliance on the U.S. market certainly 
means significant levels of concern in Canada.  For instance, 
yesterday in response to a survey, 57% of Ontarians expressed the 
view that we will be in an economic downturn in the next year. 
Canadians are very concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a recent report from the chief economic analyst of the 
Toronto-Dominion Bank, Don Drummond, who used to be the associate 
deputy minister of finance under the current Minister of Finance. 
In his report he said that even after the promised tax relief 
from recent federal budgets, our reliance on personal income 
taxes in Canada will mean that we are the most highly taxed 
jurisdiction in the G-7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that we have not even caught up to the U.S. in terms 
of fairer and lower tax rates.  The U.S. is preparing to leapfrog 
even further ahead with a $1.3 trillion tax reduction in the Bush 
tax plan, which is proceeding through congress now, garnering 
support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is dreaming in technicolour.  The Minister of 
Finance and my colleagues opposite, with due respect, are 
dreaming in technicolour if they believe that we are insulated 
against the effects of a significant economic downturn in the 
U.S.  We have not, in the mini budget, done as much as can be 
done through fiscal policy to provide the level of economic 
stimulus that Canadians need in the—

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry Bagnell:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I am new here, but I thought we were discussing a 
mechanics' bill.  This member is talking about the budgets of the 
United States and Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Madam Speaker, I do agree with the hon. 
member.  He is new here.  If he would read a little further, he 
would see that we are talking about taxes and that does tie into 
this subject.  I certainly appreciate his intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that this is the kind of debate in which we in the 
House should be engaged in the context of a federal budget.  My 
colleague from Acadie—Bathurst has introduced the motion in 
terms of a tax reform measure that would provide fairer tax 
treatment for tradesmen.  Other colleagues have, at various 
times, presented motions to provide mechanics the ability to 
write off the cost of their tools every year.  These types of tax 
reforms are all very important, but they form only a part of what 
we should be debating aggressively in the House and at the 
finance committee in the context of a federal budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be talking about issues such as capital gains taxes, 
for instance, and the fact that we still have a higher capital 
gains tax burden in Canada than citizens in the U.S. do  This is 
a very critical area as it affects the new economy.  We still 
have a tax burden in Canada on the corporate side which puts us 
second highest in the OECD.  That is of course going to have a 
significant impact on growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend and colleague in the New Democratic Party may not 
agree with all my positions on tax policy, but he would agree 
that we need to have a legitimate debate.  A mini budget was 
introduced which reflected the many levels of intellect on the 
opposite side of the House when it came to economic and other 
matters, but that mini budget was part of another parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of my hon. colleagues opposite actually shadowed my riding 
for the last caucus.  I do not know the name of his riding and no 
one else in the House does either.  He was the shadow member for 
Kings—Hants and was represented in the Liberal caucus.  I want 
to thank him for the great job he did, because his involvement in 
representing the Liberal Party in my riding obviously helped me 
to come back to the House representing the Progressive 
Conservative Party for that riding.  I hope he continues to do 
that type of great job because he is such a likeable individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is, that mini budget, which reflected a mini vision of 
Canada, was introduced by the previous government.  A previous 
group of parliamentarians approved, discussed and debated that 
budget.  This is a new parliament.  Many of the members here now 
were not here in the previous parliament.  The question is why 
current parliaments and the current House of Commons are denied 
the opportunity to debate and discuss the fiscal direction of the 
country.  That is what parliament is for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the contempt in which members opposite hold parliament. 
We have seen that demonstrated time and time again, including 
during the debate last night on the motion of the government 
House leader, the former patron saint of effective opposition. He 
has become the patron saint of hypocrisy in terms of what he has 
done in denying opposition members and, in fact, members of his 
own caucus opportunities to effectively represent their 
constituents in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the fundamental issue in not having a budget and not 
having an accountability for the fiscal policy of the government 
to parliament goes much deeper than simply having a budget that 
does not reflect current economic times.  It strikes to the very 
core of parliamentary accountability and respect for the 
parliamentary institutions that are the cornerstones of our 
democracy in Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT51"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all concerned on this side of the House.  In fact many 
members opposite are gravely concerned although they will not 
express that in the House.  They express their views of 
dissatisfaction with the current government and lack of respect 
paid to backbenchers behind the curtains as they impale 
themselves on microphones when reporters talk to them quietly 
looking for comments without names. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are very brave when they are outside the House where they 
can make comments with the impunity of comments provided as 
background and without any regard or fear of repercussions from 
the Prime Minister's Office or Mr. Goldenberg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that we need a significantly renewed sense of 
respect for parliament.  There is no better way to provide that 
in the current context than to introduce a February budget.  In 
the past seven years there has not been a worse February than 
this one to duck the issues and not even introduce a budget. I 
would like to be debating the hon. member's tax reform measures 
as part of a February budget as we should be doing.

<P><A NAME="LINK185"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP): </B>Madam Speaker, first 
of all, I would like to touch on a few points that were raised in 
order to make corrections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague of the Canadian Alliance said that independent 
workers have the right to deduct their expenses, but not the 
mechanics or the electricians or the ordinary trade employees who 
work for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not what I was saying. I was saying that, if it is the 
companies, the big corporations or the small businesses that buy 
the tools, they are deductible, but if it is the employee himself 
who buys them, they are not deductible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to disagree with my colleague from Kings—Hants, because 
I am introducing a motion to assist the small mechanics and the 
small electrician. However, he takes his little two minutes to 
talk about corporations, to say that we should give a tax cut to 
big corporations. I believe parliament talks about this day in 
and day out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is sad to see the parliamentary secretary, across the floor, 
asking me how we are going to do this. He is telling us that the 
solution might be to allow those with lower salaries to use the 
deduction, and not those who have higher salaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have never seen the government give tax deductions to small 
and medium sized businesses that do not make a lot of money and 
take them away from the big companies. Strangely, they had the 
formula in those days and they were able to live with big 
companies that make a lot of money enjoying tax deductions. But 
when it comes to workers, they cannot find a formula. What a 
pity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If my colleague from the other side, the parliamentary 
secretary, has a problem with the GST formula, I would suggest 
that the Liberals fulfil the promise they made in 1993 and 
eliminate the GST as they said they would do in the red book. We 
would have no problem with that. The tax would be eliminated for 
everybody. This is what the Liberals promised in 1993: to 
eliminate it altogether. Then it would not be a problem for 
anybody, rich or poor. It would not exist anymore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not what happened, however. It is still there. Despite 
all his promises, the Prime Minister realized that he needed it. 
The only thing we are asking of the government is to try to be 
fair to certain workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is just like eating a pie. Everyone takes only one piece, but 
after it has gone around the table, maybe there is nothing left. 
With the GST, we can start with one group of workers, and maybe, 
in the end, there will be no more GST. It was introduced by the 
Conservatives. I would say, with all due respect, that the 
Conservatives may say all they want about corporations and things 
like that, but they should not forget that they are the ones who 
introduced the GST, who imposed this 7% tax burden upon workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would ask the House to agree to my motion 
unanimously. I am sure the Liberals opposite will agree, because 
it is a reasonable motion. Therefore, I am asking for unanimous 
consent to have my motion agreed to.

abolish the GST completely. So I am asking for unanimous consent

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to seek some clarity on an 
issue that I raised in the House on February 5 after the fatal 
accident involving a Russian diplomat.  I rose in the House to 
ask two questions.  Actually I asked the same question twice and 
I did not even come close to getting an answer.  I am very 
optimistic that the distinguished parliamentary secretary, who is 
commissioned today to answer the question, will answer my 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This question arose after a Russian diplomat was involved in a 
fatal accident in Ottawa.  We have recently learned that he is 
being investigated for criminal charges in Russia.  He has now 
been fired from the diplomatic service, which is only too 
appropriate.  It appears that he will never come back to Canada, 
at least as a diplomat, and be a menace to our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not the first time that this Russian diplomat was 
involved with the police.  In fact, on two other occasions he was 
found to have been drinking and driving.  However, after one 
episode, Mr. Knyazev, the diplomat, received a letter of apology 
from foreign affairs due to the manner in which we was treated by 
the Ottawa-Carleton police.  It appears now that the 
Ottawa-Carleton police were absolutely correct and the apology 
should not have been submitted to the Russian embassy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question that I asked twice and did not get an answer either 
time was: When Canada apologizes to a country like Russia does it 
not require the approval of a minister, or can just anybody 
apologize on behalf of Canada?  My first question was: Did the 
minister approve this apology specifically?  When I did not get 
an answer I asked again:  Who authorizes letters of apology on 
behalf of the Canadian government to other governments? 
<P><A NAME="LINK189"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Public 
Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
prepared to answer all the questions the member has raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade 
manages its relationship with the diplomatic and consular 
community in Canada through the office of the chief of protocol. 
The department's deputy head has traditionally delegated the 
responsibility to interact with the diplomatic and consular corps 
to the chief of protocol, and in his absence the deputy chief of 
protocol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of its duties, the office of the chief of protocol is to 
be accountable for upholding the Vienna convention on diplomatic 
relations so as to guarantee to this community that Canada will 
respect its rights to immunities and privileges under the 
convention.  A corollary to this responsibility is that the 
office of the chief of protocol endeavours, to the extent 
possible, to ensure that diplomats and consular representatives 
respect Canadian laws and regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In cases involving a breach of Canada's obligations under the 
Vienna convention, the offended diplomat entity can at times 
merit an apology.  Each such incident is treated on a case by 
case basis.  Traditionally this responsibility has been delegated 
to the deputy head of the chief of protocol or his 
representative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the specific case which the member raises in which a letter 
of apology was sent to the embassy of the Russian Federation in 
July 1999, the facts were deemed to merit such an action.  The 
diplomat in question was handcuffed by the police, taken to the 
police station and detained for a number of hours.  This form of 
detention of a diplomat is specifically prohibited under the 
Vienna convention, and thus an apology was provided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This apology did not receive ministerial approval but was

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. James Lunney (Nanaimo—Alberni, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, last week I directed a question to the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans regarding the Canadian coast guard search 
and rescue dive team based on the west coast, on Sea Island.  The 
question was this:  why has the minister disbanded this dive 
team? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian coast guard dive team at Sea Island was founded as 
a pilot project in 1995.  Previous to this, between 1985 and 
1995, there were 36 deaths, at least 13 of which, it is 
suggested, could have been prevented had there been divers 
present.  The coast guard dive team was operating on a Hovercraft 
out of the Sea Island base. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a letter I received from the minister, the reasons put 
forward for disbanding the program were that there was risk to 
the divers and a minimal gain.  While the letter was in transit, 
a tragedy did occur on the west coast.  A car driven by Mr. Paul 
Sandhu went over a dike and ended up in the Fraser River. 
Tragically, Mr. Sandhu died in that accident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been three reasons put forward as to why the dive 
team was disbanded.  The safety of divers was one issue.  Second, 
there was the issue of the need for a dive team.  Third, there 
was a question of jurisdiction.  Exactly whose responsibility is 
it for search and rescue dive capability on the west coast? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the minister, it is not the coast guard's 
responsibility.  If it is not the coast guard's responsibility, 
then whose is it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Richmond <I>Review</I> published an article on this just 
recently.  According to an interview with Vice-Admiral Ronald 
Buck, commander of maritime forces in the Pacific region, he said 
that it is not the department's mandate to respond to these types 
of emergencies, although it will respond when it is ordered to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of National Defence has bases in Esquimalt and 
Comox, but both are quite a bit removed from the Sea Island area 
where there is such heavy marine and air traffic exposed to 
considerable risks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is not the responsibility of the Department of National 
Defence, then perhaps it is the RCMP's responsibility.  The RCMP 
also has a dive team, but when contacted, RCMP Sergeant Dennis 
Erickson, program manager for the E division underwater recovery 
team, said that his squad is not set up as a rescue team although 
it will respond to distress calls.  It is not the RCMP's mandate 
to perform underwater rescues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the tragic incident involving Mr. Sandhu, the RCMP divers 
arrived at the scene of the accident about 35 minutes after they 
were alerted.  The hovercraft based team was there within three 
minutes of being notified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question of jurisdiction comes back to this:  why was this 
team disbanded?  Looking at the other two issues, that is, safety 
of the divers and need, I alluded to a report that said in the 10 
years previous to when the dive team was originally operating, 
there were 36 incidents, 13 of which might have resulted in lives 
being saved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no other site in B.C. and probably in Canada with a 
combination of search and rescue influences like the lower 
Georgia strait and the Fraser River.  The factors include heavy 
year round traffic, a demonstrated high frequency of capsized 
vehicle incidents, close proximity to a busy year round port, and 
a major urban centre.  All this is in proximity to an existing 24 
hour a day crewed high speed vessel platform, with personnel who 
are very well trained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister said he would be taking several weeks to review the 
issue.  Will he commit to table in the House the parameters of 
the review, indicating the deadline that he has issued to his 
department for the review?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lawrence O'Brien (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to 
speak today about the government's commitments to safety on the 
water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I continue, I wish to state that it is unfortunate that 
the automobile accident in Richmond, British Columbia, resulted 
in a death on February 18.  My heartfelt sympathies go out to the 
Sandhu family on this tragic accident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rescue diving was initiated in the Canadian coast guard as a two 
year pilot project in 1995.  The project was undertaken to 
determine the effectiveness of rescue diving as a complement to 
coast guard search and rescue.  The pilot project was meant to 
gather necessary information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rescue diving is not a core mandate of the coast guard. However, 
the coast guard is not a static organization.  It continuously 
reviews all aspects of its services to Canadians as part of the 
government's commitment to safety.  This includes establishing 
projects as necessary to ensure that the coast guard has all the 
facts before recommending changes to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997, after two years of operating the rescue diving pilot 
project, the project was extended in order to collect further 
information.  The coast guard did not have sufficient information 
to determine the effectiveness of providing a rescue diving 
capability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In November 2000, after reviewing the information spanning a six 
year period, the coast guard, in light of the low demand and low 
effectiveness of rescue diving and out of concern for the safety 
of divers engaged in the very high risk operations in these 
activities, suspended the pilot project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ending a pilot project that is well known is a difficult 
decision.  The dedication of the professional specialists in this 
project is well known.  We acknowledge that.  Let us not forget 
that this was a pilot project.  It is not the mandate of coast 
guard to deliver underwater rescue services.  It is noteworthy 
that the United States coast guard and the British royal navy 
terminated their programs for the same reasons that prompted our 
decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members are aware, on February 21, 2001, the minister 
announced an independent review of the February 18 accident and 
of the basis of the decision to terminate the Sea Island rescue 
diving pilot project.  Until this review is complete, and a final 
decision is announced, the rescue diving project will remain 
suspended.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon—Humboldt, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, last Friday I asked the minister for 
multiculturalism to explain an advertisement that appeared on the 
online job search for the Government of Canada.  This was a job 
with Correctional Service Canada that specifically excluded 
anybody from applying for the job who was not an Indian person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The job advertisement was brought to my attention by a 
constituent of mine.  She was highly offended that the Government 
of Canada would deny her the opportunity of even applying for a 
job, an administrative position in this case, with Correctional 
Service Canada because she was, according to the government, not 
the right skin colour or not the right race to qualify for this 
job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's justification for this policy was what it 
called affirmative action.  Affirmative action or employment 
equity are racist policies that discriminate against people on 
the basis of race in the hiring process.  There are a couple of 
things that the proponents of these highly discriminatory and 
prejudiced race based hiring policies do not understand or are 
not able to answer.  I would like to direct my comments to the 
minister about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I would like to explain to the minister, because the 
minister appears to not understand, that it is not possible to 
discriminate in favour of someone on the basis of race without 
discriminating against somebody else because of his or her race. 
For example, June Kuhn, a constituent of mine brought to my attention the 
fact that she was discriminated against because she was not an 
Indian.  That is a blatant act of discrimination and is 
unjustifiable.  The person who obtained the job in this case 
received it because he or she was discriminated in favour of 
while my constituent was discriminated against because of her 
skin colour.

<A HREF="#LINKT55"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These policies are not only racist but highly offensive.  That 
is why over 90% of all Canadians are opposed to them.  They are 
offensive in many ways, not the least of which is the message, 
which in this case singles out Indian people.  The message is 
that they are inferior and incapable of competing for jobs on the 
basis of skills and merit, so they must therefore be provided 
with special circumstances that discriminate against other 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on for quite some time, but I will wrap this up by 
asking the minister a very specific question.  I request a 
detailed answer.  What does the minister say to my constituent, 
June Kuhn, who is denied the opportunity to even apply for a job with the 
Public Service of Canada because she is not the right race?  What 
does he say to her?  Instead of politically correct rhetoric and 
doublespeak, I would like the minister to be very specific in the 
answer.  What does he say to someone, in this case my 
constituent, who was denied the opportunity to seek employment 
with the federal government because she is of the wrong skin 
colour? 
<P><A NAME="LINK195"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the concept of merit as the 
basis for hiring is one that we all agree on.  However, good jobs 
and promotions elude many visible minorities and aboriginal men 
and women in Canada according to a recent report written by the 
Canadian Council on Social Development, the CCSD, and based on 
1996 census data. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The study, “Unequal Access: A Canadian Profile of Racial 
Differences in Education, Employment and Income”, found that 
while keeping education levels constant, 50% of aboriginals were 
unemployed, followed by 34% of visible minorities and 25% for 
non-racialized groups. Even though labour force participation is 
higher for visible minorities than it is among other Canadians, 
their occupational status is generally lower. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CCSD study also found that visible minorities earn less 
money than non-visible minorities with the same qualifications. 
The same is true for aboriginal people and women and persons with 
disabilities.  Earnings gaps were found between visible minority 
groups and aboriginals and white males after accounting for 
factors such as education levels.  The gaps increased if the 
individual visible minority person obtained his or her education 
in a foreign country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the same education levels, aboriginal people were the 
least likely to be in the top income bracket, 5.8%, followed by 
foreign born visible minorities at 12.5%.  Non-racialized groups 
were most likely, 20%, to be in the top income bracket. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his paper, “Immigrant Skill Utilization in the Canadian 
Labour Market:  Implications of Human Capital Research”, 
Professor Jeffrey G. Reitz speaks of the underutilization of 
skills in Canada which leads to substantial economic losses and 
has a negative impact on Canadian society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government and its institutions must represent the people they 
serve.  Forty-six percent of Canadians report at least one origin 
other than English or French.  In order to represent all of this 
diversity we must ensure that we find out why they are not 
equally represented in our institutions and set strategies in 
place to rectify that.  Good government ensures that we help 
Canadians identify and remove barriers to full participation in 
Canadian society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  It being 6.39 p.m. 
the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m. pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1).
