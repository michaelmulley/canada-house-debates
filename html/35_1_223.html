	<B>Mrs. Georgette Sheridan (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Canada employment centre for students is 
celebrating its annual hire a student week across Canada, June 
19 to 23.
<P>
	The goal of hire a student week is to gain support from 
potential employers and to heighten awareness of the services 
available through the Canada employment centre for students in 
Saskatoon as well as in other parts of the country.
<P>
	People will notice the hire a student buttons being worn by 
students at the events planned to celebrate this week. In 
Saskatoon we had button day on Monday, flag raising day was 
yesterday, today is a hot dog sale, fitting for students, tomorrow 
is job shadowing day and on Friday, most important, is 
employment appreciation day.
<P>
	I extend a big thank you to the hard working young people in 
the Canada employment centre for students office in Saskatoon, 
in particular Thomasina Burke, for all the hard work they do in 
helping students find much needed summer employment.

	<B>Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have to 
deplore the government's inaction regarding the mining 
industry. In spite of several initiatives on the part of 
parliamentarians and the natural resources committee, this 
government never agreed to provide assistance to this major 
industry which employs tens of thousands of Canadians and 
Quebecers.
<P>
	On June 5, I supported the motion put forward by the hon. 
member for Timiskaming-French River to implement a mining 
incentives program. Instead of taking steps to ensure this 
industry's viability, the government chose to let the investment 
climate deteriorate.
<P>
	We must make sure that our mining sector will be able to 
develop in the future and continue to create thousands of jobs in 
Quebec and Canada instead of abroad.

	<B>Mr. George S. Rideout (Moncton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the 
committee on natural resources requested during the 
examination of the Department of National Resources Act, the 
Minister of Natural Resources tabled this morning the fifth 
annual report to Parliament, ``The State of Canada's Forests, 
1994''.
<P>
	Canada's forests continue to be a major engine of economic 
growth for Canada, particularly in certain regions of the country 
such as my home province of New Brunswick, but they are also 
essential to our environment.
<P>
	The theme of this year's report, ``A Balancing Act'', 
describes the challenges of maintaining timber for our industry 
while conserving habitat for wildlife.
<P>
	As the world's largest exporter of forest products, the eyes of 
the world continue to watch how well Canada is able to balance 
its economic and environmental needs.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to urge all my hon. 
colleagues to read the fifth annual report tabled in Parliament

	<B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am deeply 
troubled to address the issue of child poverty, a phenomenon 
generally attributed to the third world.
<P>
	Canada is not a third world nation and yet there are nearly 1.3 
million Canadian children living in poverty, enough to form the 
fifth largest province. Think about it: shocking, incredible, 
terrifying, intolerable; yes, all of these.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14310"> 14310 </A></B>
<P>
	Five years ago the Government of Canada in the House 
resolved to achieve the goal of eliminating poverty among our 
children by the year 2000. Resolutions and objectives are not 
enough. Effective anti-poverty initiatives and immediate action 
are warranted, indeed demanded.
<P>
	None will deny the necessity to eliminate the deficit as 
expeditiously as possible but let us strive to bring this deficit to 
zero in a compassionate and reasonable way. Let us not forget 
the children in poverty during this era of fiscal restraint. Our 
country's future depends on solving both problems quickly and 
fairly.

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I offer an alternative version of the interpretation being put on 
the G-7 summit by the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The G-7 summit did not deal in any significant way with a lot 
of the serious problems facing the international economy. The 
G-7 summit did not deal with growing polarization between rich 
and poor within industrialized countries and between 
industrialized countries and the third world. It did not deal with 
the international debt problem of third worlds.
<P>
	Finally and most significantly, because this is what the Prime 
Minister likes to talk about, it did not deal with the whole 
question of money speculators.
<P>
	All it did was provide that the IMF might have more money in 
the end to bail out economies damaged by speculators. When we 
bail out those economies in the current context we bail out the 
speculators themselves.
<P>
	What we have increased here is the global welfare state for 
money speculators rather than dealing with the root of the 
problem which is curbing speculation-

commend the laudable actions of many students across Canada 
for their participation in the safe grad program.
<P>
	This year's students from across the country including 
Manitoba will again take part in the safe grad program. This 
combines student graduation celebrations with realistic 
measures to prevent accidents and other problems which could 
be associated with drinking and driving.
<P>
	Safe grad is a student run program with input from parents, 
teachers and police. Safe grad is geared toward the needs and

of the opposition. Apparently the leader of the third party has 
decided he needs a car upgrade. Chevys are great cars and lately 
he has found his accommodation not to be to his liking.
<P>
	Having made these discoveries he felt it was easier to become 
leader of the opposition than to get the Reform Party to increase 
his expense account. Therefore he has initiated a feeble attempt 
to get backbench Liberals to defect to the Reform Party. Such 
unrestrained political ambition is so blatant it is embarrassingly 
dangerous.

increasingly obvious that the measures taken to protect potential 
witnesses are largely inadequate. Indeed, several members of 
the armed forces fear reprisals from their senior officers if they 
tell what they know or what they saw in Somalia.
<P>

these soldiers and encourage them to testify, by publicly 
promising that no retaliation measures will be taken against 
them.

<P>
	The justice minister needed reminding by Reform that DNA 
evidence can be a useful tool in determining a suspect's guilt or 
innocence and that Canadians wanted action on this issue now.

immediately introduce legislation allowing court ordered DNA 
testing of suspects charged with violent crimes providing he has 
the support of the House.
<P>
	We assure the justice minister not only will our members 
support his initiatives, all Canadians will most heartily support

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="FEDERALISM">FEDERALISM</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs tried to 
justify Ottawa's new strategy on the Quebec referendum as 
follows, and I quote: ``There has not been enough emphasis by 
the federalists on demonstrating that the federal system works 
well and works for Quebec. I think that is one of the problems''. 
The minister's perception of the facts is selective, to say the 
least.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Can he 
seriously claim that the federal system works well and works for 
Quebec, when in one particular case, his Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs has refused to compensate Quebec 
for what it spent on educating young Crees, a total of $130 
million?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs gave 
a very good explanation. If I remember correctly, there was an 
agreement between the federal government and the provincial 
government. The terms of that agreement were met, but there 
were some additional, unforeseen expenses that were not 
covered by the agreement.
<P>
	That particular aspect is being discussed now, but the terms of 
the agreement as such were met. If there were additional 
expenses that were warranted, that can be discussed, but we did 
what is essential to good federal-provincial relations, that is, we 
complied with the agreement as negotiated and approved by 
both parties.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, how can the Prime Minister keep saying that the 
federal system works well and works for Quebec, when Ottawa 
still refuses to transfer responsibility for manpower training to 
Quebec and in fact plans to intervene even more in this area, thus 
leading to further costly and inefficient duplication?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Human Resources Development made 
offers to all the provinces, including Quebec, in which he 
proposed to conclude temporary agreements that would include 
a transfer of responsibilities, but Quebec said no. Other 
provinces are discussing the problem with the minister, but 
Quebec wants all or nothing.
<P>
	I think we must maintain a federal presence in these areas, 
because Quebec, like other provinces where the economic 
situation is not as good as in the richer provinces, needs the 
federal government to redistribute resources from those who 
have jobs to those who do not. And this has no connection with 
federal-provincial relations.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister says that Quebec wants all or 
nothing. This is an outright reproach to one of his ministers, the 
minister responsible for the referendum in Quebec, who when 
she was a minister in the Johnson government, turned down the 
federal government's offer on manpower training.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister keep saying, like his minister, 
that the federal system works well and works for Quebec, when 
Ottawa's withdrawal from social program funding puts the 
provinces, including Quebec, in the very difficult position of 
either having to cut services or raise taxes?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, even before the federal budget, the provincial 
government in Quebec City cut $500 million from its budget for 
health care services, and that was last fall, when the PQ came to 
power. Look at what Minister Rochon is doing now. I read the 
papers like everybody else.
<P>
	I think we explained our position very well. As for the 
reference of the Leader of the Opposition to the position taken 
by the Minister of Labour, as a party leader who changed parties 
five times, he is certainly not in a position to tell anyone to be 
consistent in politics.

	<B>Mr. Michel Daviault (Ahuntsic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister. The Fédération nationale des 
associations de consommateurs du Québec and the Canadian 
Council, which represent over 300 organizations, have joined 
forces with dairy producers and processors to demand that the 
federal government renew the moratorium on bovine 
somatotropin, which will end in nine days.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	Since the ministers of agriculture and health have been 
waffling for months on this important issue, I would ask the 
Prime Minister whether he intends to follow up on the request of 
consumer associations, the dairy industry and even the Standing 
Committee on Health to impose a strict moratorium for an 
indeterminate period on the use of somatotropin? It is up to him 
to set down the rules.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, just because the voluntary moratorium agreed upon by 
manufacturers and the Department of Agriculture ends on July 1 
does not mean that the sale of BST will automatically become 
legal.
<P>
	Health Canada continues to study the issue and will approve 
the product only if scientists are convinced that it is safe and 
effective.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Daviault (Ahuntsic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister does not even recognize the work of the heath 
committee, which is unanimous regarding the issue. The 
agriculture committee has declared war and is demanding that 
Health Canada make its studies public and the minister is taking 
no action.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister acknowledge that people have the 
right to drink the most natural milk possible, and that by 
refusing to extend the moratorium, he is exposing consumers to 
the risk of unknowingly drinking milk tainted with hormones, 
without knowing the real impact that this will have on the health 
of humans and animals?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think that the Minister of Health explained the 
situation clearly. There was a voluntary moratorium and the 
Minister of Health did not give permission for this product to be 
used for the Canadian market. And we will not give permission 
until we have very clear advice that there is no danger.
<P>
	At the moment, we are fully aware of the recommendations of 
the Standing Committee on Agriculture, and I would like to 
remind you that almost weekly, a member of my caucus raises 
the issue. We are very much aware of the problem and, contrary 
to what some people are implying, the product will not be 
authorized for use after July 1 of this year.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as this session comes to an end the great imperative for 
the Prime Minister is to re-establish the ethical standards of his 
government.
<P>
	When the government came to power it promised to make 
government integrity its number one priority but 20 months later 
that red book promise is in tatters with ministers flouting the 
federal code of ethics, the ethics counsellor reduced to 
impotence, and the Prime Minister defending party loyalty and 
discipline over the principles of democracy and ethics.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister send a clear signal to Canadians today 
that unethical behaviour in government will not be tolerated? 
Will he can tainted ministers, starting with the Minister of 
Canadian heritage?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, after many days of arguing the case we stated that 
everything had been done according to the laws of Canada. The 
record of the government over the last 20 months has been the 
best we have seen in a long time. I am applying myself to making 
sure that all ethical and normal rules that should apply to 
members of Parliament and to cabinet are followed by all 
cabinet ministers. That has been debated.
<P>
	After 20 months and on the last day before we adjourn they 
repeat the same question they have used for the last three weeks. 
We must be doing quite well if they have nothing else to talk 
about.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government also promised to put an end to the 
politics of patronage and backroom deals.
<P>
	But over the last 20 months what have we witnessed: $26 
million diverted in Nova Scotia from highway 104 to a road in 
the riding of the minister of public works, campaign workers 
lined up in Victoria for patronage plums from the justice 
department, and the Liberal family contact rewarded again and 
again with government contracts and favourable cabinet 
decisions. This is like a rerun of an old movie: Brian Mulroney 
Part II.
<P>
<B>(1425 ) </B>
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister make a new commitment today to 
purge political patronage from his administration by restoring 
funding to highway 104 and by disciplining members tainted by 
patronage, starting with the minister of public works?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr.

element of it to the House of Commons.

	The Minister of Transport said many times that the change 
in the situation in Nova Scotia was requested by the elected 
provincial authorities in Nova Scotia. The member refuses to 
recognize that.
<P>
	He made another so-called attack talking about family 
contacts, knowing very well who he is trying to attack, and he 
cannot prove anything. I will not go to his level to try to defend 
myself; I have a record of 32 years in public service.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> Not one contract or not one 
favour has been given to anybody close to me and my family. I 
do not have to insist. Every member in good faith knows it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government also promised freer voting in the 
House of Commons and a meaningful voice for backbenchers.
<P>
	In the past few weeks, however, we have seen nothing from 
the government but a growing disregard for the democratic 
process: time allocation and closure, Liberal backbenchers 
being punished for voting the wishes of their constituents, and 
cabinet ministers who break conflict of interest guidelines being 
defended by the Prime Minister himself.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister reaffirm his red book promises of 
freer voting and greater MP power in the House by lifting the 
heavy hand of discipline from those MPs whose only crime was 
to respect their constituents' wishes?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have done it since I have been prime minister.
<P>
	In some opinions expressed not long ago, it seems a few years 
ago, this institution was considered not very acceptable in 
performing well. It was 9 per cent. The last time there was the 
same poll it was published not long ago that collectively we have 
managed to lift respect for this institution from 9 per cent to 
virtually 30 per cent.
<P>
	There was an international poll which said there was more 
respect for the Parliament of Canada in Canada than there was in 
England, the United States, France, Italy, Germany and so on.
<P>
	I am not afraid to reply to the person who fired his own justice 
critic. I have some rules in my party which people know about, 
but we have more democracy in our party than in any other.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have been a 
member of Parliament for quite some time and it is the first time 
in the history of this Parliament when members of Parliament of 
the government side presented dozens of amendments to the 
House of Commons, as we saw last week, and we let them vote 
on them.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> Yes, we did. It is the first 
time there was so much freedom in the House of Commons. We 
have never seen that before. The vote has passed and I think 
members on this side of the House of Commons are going home 
happy, feeling they have done a good job.

	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry.
<P>
	A study done by the defence industry research group reveals 
that Quebec would be particularly affected by cuts to the 
defence industry production program, DIPP. This study 
concluded that 60 per cent of DIPP's funding in Quebec would 
be cut, that is, $50 million, and so research and development 
would drop by $150 million.
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
	Will the minister admit that he is on the wrong track in cutting 
funds to DIPP, when he knows very well that, for every dollar the 
government puts into this program, the industry puts in three, 
and jobs in high tech industries like aerospace are directly 
related to contributions to the program?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, we discussed this issue last week. As I indicated then to 
the member, I acknowledge that DIPP is very important, but the 
government has decided to reduce grants to Canadian private 
enterprise and to review DIPP.
<P>
	We think that it has long been an important program in 
Canada, but this does not mean that this sort of program should 
not be reviewed. Perhaps the member has some ideas that could 
be adopted.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister should not concern himself with my ideas. 
I am more worried about his.
<P>
	After attacking at the Quebec pharmaceutical industry, the 
minister is now going after the aerospace industry by cutting 
DIPP. Is this the sort of federalism being offered to Quebec, 
where Ottawa continually threatens high tech industry in 
Quebec, offering only unemployment and technological delay in 
exchange?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I know the Bloc supports high tech companies like 
Monsanto and Eli-Lilly.
<P>
	I would remind him that Quebec is not the only province with 
a high tech sector, particularly in aerospace. There are 
companies all over Canada, such as Pratt &amp; Whitney, which is 
located not only in Montreal but also in Lethbridge and Halifax, 
and is very concerned about international competition for grants 
from the government. We are very much aware of this 
competition and have some ideas to propose for this sector.

Nova Scotia.

<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, now I find 
that the hon. member for Cumberland-Colchester is telling 
people that the federal government has found a solution.
<P>
	Before the session closes I would like to try to get the minister 
of public works up on his feet and be blessed with an answer. 
Will the Liberal government be returning the $26 million to 
highway 104 as suggested by the hon. member for 
Cumberland-Colchester?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I know that the hon. member for 
Cumberland-Colchester is very interested in this matter and I 
understand her concerns. We have listened to people who have 
made representations with respect to highways in Nova Scotia 
on a number of occasions.
<P>
	Although the hon. member for Cumberland-Colchester is a 
very hard working member of Parliament, it does not change the 
reality that decisions for highway construction, the allocation of 
funds and the routing of highways is a provincial matter.
<P>
	I know it is extremely difficult for the hon. member who has 
asked the question to understand that, but I intend to be patient 
and to continue to explain to him that whether it is in Manitoba, 
British Columbia or Nova Scotia, the decision for the 
construction of highways and how the funds are allocated is the 
primary responsibility and falls within the constitutional 
jurisdiction of the provinces in question.

wonder who is going to get the babysitting fees for the minister 
of public works, the minister of transport or me?
<P>
	The government has refused to give documents to the Citizens 
for Fairness Coalition in Wentworth Valley, Nova Scotia, but I 
delivered them myself at a rally in the valley.
<P>
	I would like the Prime Minister to answer this question. Why 
does the government have to be threatened with lawsuits by 
outraged citizens before it acts to rein in cabinet ministers who 
are clearly out of control? What assurances do we have that the 
minister of public works, in particular, will be given a wake-up 
call by the Prime Minister?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as we continue with the programs already in place to 
deal with highway construction in a number of provinces, no 
doubt citizens in every part of the country are seeking as much 
as they can get to build highways. That is the case in Nova 
Scotia.
<P>
	We fully understand the concerns, especially in my case being 
a New Brunswicker. We recognize that highways in Atlantic 
Canada need a lot of funding.
<P>
	Rather than railing at the rally in the valley about the 104, I 
look forward to the hon. member and his party telling us where 
they would get more money and what they would propose for 
highway construction in the country. Since this is not federal 
jurisdiction, they might want to tell us how they propose to fund 
highway construction in Nova Scotia and elsewhere where it is 
required.

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, after providing financial assistance to Canadian 
research journals for years, in January, the Social Sciences and 
Humanities Research Council announced a new policy based on 
the number of subscribers rather than on the quality of the 
publications. As a result, funding for French-language journals 
is being reduced by half.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Industry. Will the minister 
confirm that the cuts under the new Social Sciences and 
Humanities Research Council's policy will be borne almost 
exclusively by French-language journals, while 
English-language ones will be generally unaffected?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Jon Gerrard (Secretary of State (Science, Research

Social Science and Humanities Research Council will have less

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the council's new criteria do not take into account 
the relative size of the francophone and anglophone markets in 
Canada. To give out grants on the sole basis of the number of 
subscribers amounts to a death sentence for francophone 
journals.
<P>
	In that context, does the minister recognize that the real 
impact of this new policy of the Social Sciences and Humanities

anglophone journals, is tantamount to eliminating funding for

<P>
	On January 1, the United States took advantage of the 
establishment of the World Trade Organization to impose on 
Canada new restrictions on imports of sugar and products 
containing sugar, thus jeopardizing over 2,400 jobs. Also, a bill 
sponsored by Senator Jesse Helms is currently before the U.S. 
Congress and seeks to prohibit access to the American market to 
any business having commercial ties with Cuba.
<P>
	Meanwhile, American sugar is flooding our market to the

<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Roy MacLaren (Minister for International Trade,

the Helms bill. They have taken a variety of forms. We followed

he takes a close look at the proposed legislation he will find, and

in Canada to have the direct expropriation powers they enjoyed 
over many years.

something.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> Calm yourself.
<P>
	One reason for supporting literacy programs is to bring 
important opportunities to large numbers of Canadians, 
particularly those who have not had an opportunity for 
education. It brings them into the system to learn the basic 
functions of reading and writing. We supply those grants to a 
wide variety of organizations, mainly the ABC Canada 
organization, a group of corporate sponsors which provides that 
kind of funding. They make the decisions based on those peer 
groups.
<P>
	If the hon. member wants to send me a copy of the 
publication, I would be glad to look at it and respond. The hon. 
member should recognize the ultimate and important value of 
helping street kids to learn to read.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
is going to every school in the country, not just to street kids and 
government money is being spent on it.
<P>
	My party believes in literacy and keeping kids off our streets, 
but handing out scripts like this to every high school in the 
country is hardly the way to do it. Learning how to spell 
obscenities is not literacy and the real language the government 
talks about can be learned by reading washroom walls, not 
through government programs.

<P>
	The many cuts imposed by the federal government on the 
National Film Board since 1984 have literally disrupted their 
services. In Quebec, seven municipal libraries are affiliated 
with the NFB and carry NFB films and documentaries. However, 
citizens who do not reside in these municipalities must pay up to 
$100 per year, for example in Abitibi-Témiscamingue, to avail 
themselves of the services of an NFB library.
<P>

is that access to the NFB collection has become considerably 
more restricted for residents of remote regions?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage,

there is nothing surprising about that. In addition, we are

<P>
	One of the good things about our country and medicare is the 
fact that people do not need a large wallet and there is no need to 
spend excessive dollars on insurance administration. The 
dollars we spend go directly to patient care. We are going to 
continue to ensure that happens. That is the best way to treat the 
people of Canada: based on need, not based on whether they can

need. In other countries it may be based on how much money the 
person has, where they live or whether they have insurance. 
When a person goes to a hospital in Canada they are treated 
because they are sick, not because of the kind of insurance they 
have.

<P>
	On Monday in Quebec, Minister Blackburn announced a 
thorough reform of the income security system.
<P>
	Within the context of flexible federalism and consultation 
with the provinces, how does the Minister of Human Resources 
Development, who is about to table components of the federal

Quebec?

member for Brome-Missisquoi for his question.
<P>
	I was very interested in the proposals from the Quebec 
government, especially since the approach suggested by 
Minister Blackburn reflects the approach taken by our own 
government as year ago, particularly the proactive measures for 
steady employment and plans for decentralizing authority, for 
local centres and community centres.

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Labour.
<P>
	One of the main demands made by womens' groups, 
especially those that organized the bread and roses march, is for 
governments to raise the minimum wage.
<P>
<B>(1455) </B>
<P>
	Since the federal minimum wage has not been increased since 
1986, does the minister intend to correct this situation and 
announce an increase this year?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are looking into this right now, and we intend to 
make a decision very shortly.
<P>
	I might add that after checking with federally regulated 
employers, we found that most businesses operate on the basis 
of the minimum wage in each province. Right now, we can 
assume that a very small majority of workers are paid the federal 
minimum wage.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
may be a good opportunity to look at federal encroachment on 
provincial jurisdictions in all areas connected with manpower.
<P>
	Since the average provincial minimum wage is around 
$5.60-even if only a small majority of people are concerned, 
these are always too many, and we should find out how many 
people are earning such a low wage-would the minister agree 
that a federal minimum wage of $4.00 is clearly inadequate and 
should be increased as soon as possible?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as I said before, the minimum wage varies widely in 
this country, depending on the province. It varies from $4.75 to 
$7.00 in certain provinces. Most employers adjust to the 
minimum wage in the province where they live, and meanwhile, 
we are looking into adjusting the federal minimum wage 
accordingly.

	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the defence minister promised the Somalia inquiry 
would be free and open. He said that anyone having pertinent 
testimony had the responsibility to appear. However earlier this 
week Justice Letourneau suggested serving soldiers might need 
to be protected and offered that some could testify in camera.
<P>
	Does the minister accept that military witnesses may need 
protection? Will he ensure that soldiers can testify, perhaps even 
against the department and their seniors without fear of reprisal?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my understanding is that Justice Gilles 
Letourneau, the chairman of the commission, was quoted in 
press reports as stating that some soldiers may fear reprisals or 
being prejudiced in their military career. He did insist however 
that there is no evidence to that. Perhaps he was taking 
precautionary steps. He is considering a promise of 
confidentiality of information, a pledge that the inquiry will 
investigate any allegation of ongoing reprisals and an offer to 
allow vulnerable people, if it is shown that this is the case, to 
give testimony in private.
<P>
	It would be improper for me or the minister to comment on 
any other aspects of the commission until the commission has 
finished its work.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, let us look at a specific example.
<P>
	Justice demands that Mark Boland testify, but he has made 
allegations about the conduct of military police and even now is 
in their custody. He may have the right to appear, but I question 
his freedom to do so as long as his treatment and even 
well-being are under the control of the very people against 
whom he may testify.
<P>
	What will the minister do to ensure that a soldier like Mark 
Boland can without fear of retribution testify freely before the 
commission?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I just suggested and mentioned some of the areas 
that were being considered by the chairman of the commission. I 
believe it is the commission's responsibility to decide on this 
aspect of witnesses and their protection if necessary. I would 
like to leave it at that.

question is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	It is clear that current drug enforcement policies need to be 
reviewed in this country. The B.C. coroner last week raised the 
issue again, as law enforcement officials and many other people 
have done recently, suggesting that a radically different 
legislative approach needs to be taken for the possession and use 
of hard and soft drugs.
<P>
	In Canada the last comprehensive public review was in 1970 
with the Le Dain commission. Has the minister's department 
taken any steps to initiate a comprehensive review of Canada's

Justice we are always looking for controversial new topics to 
undertake. Perhaps the hon. member has given us something to 
do for the summer.
<P>
	I should say that at the moment, as the hon. member may 
know, the Standing Committee on Health has Bill C-7 before it, 
which was introduced by the government to deal with a variety 
of matters in relation to non-medical drugs, their use, and 
prosecution and enforcement of laws in relation to their illegal 
use.
<P>
	It may be that after that bill has been dealt with the Minister of 
Health may wish to speak more broadly to the question of the 
drug enforcement strategy. I am sure she will take into account 
the points made by the hon. member in formulating that 
suggestion.

<P>
	As the House will be rising for the summer, the Prime 
Minister and the government will know Canadians are 
extremely concerned about what is happening to our soldiers in 
that part of the world. Given the fact that the House is rising, I 
would like to ask the government whether it would make a 
commitment to voluntarily brief members of the House of 
Commons on a regular basis, in particular members of the 
Standing Committee on National Defence, so we can be kept 
abreast of what is happening in this ongoing situation.
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to indicate to 
members of the House who are interested in the safety of our 
soldiers in Visoko that a liaison officer from the Bosnian 
government is now in the camp in Visoko to make appropriate 
arrangements to restore freedom of movement to the troops, 
including the resupply of our soldiers there.
<P>
	In regard to the suggestion just made by the hon. member, 
indeed we have offered periodically to brief political parties, the 
official opposition and the Reform Party. Certainly if the caucus 
of the Conservative Party could get together we would be 
delighted to brief them.
<P>
	As the member knows, we are the servant of parliamentary

will respond quickly and expeditiously.

for Abitibi and of members from all regions of Quebec and 
elsewhere, I draw your attention to the remarks made by the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage in response to a question from 
my colleague for Québec.
<P>
	The Minister of Canadian Heritage showed a flagrant lack of 
respect and a disdain for the people of remote regions like mine. 
In his response to my colleague for Québec, he referred to new 
technologies, using qualifiers. He then used the expression 
``reculées'' (out of the way, backward) to describe the regions, 
probably in reference to all sorts of things going on in his head 
as his department is making decisions regarding major cultural 
sectors in the regions-such as the National Film Board or the 
Festival du cinéma international.
<P>
<B>(1505) </B>
<P>
	As the member for Témiscamingue, I cannot accept such 
remarks. Through you, I ask the Minister of Cultural Heritage to

everyone living in the regions, who are not necessarily the 
people who live in large urban centres.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage,

Quebecer for all parts of Quebec, but a knowledge of how to 
speak the French language. I refer you to page 1632 of the <I>Petit 
Robert</I>, where ``reculé'' is defined as ``lointain, difficile 
d'accès, isolé'' (distant, hard to reach, isolated). I see nothing to

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> I

extremely poor image of those Quebecers who do not live in 
cities when he said that he finds it utterly normal, parliamentary, 
respectable and acceptable to say that these people live in 
isolated, hard to get to and distant regions. There are no distant

talking about people who live in vibrant and constructive 
communities which contribute to our society.

have several petitions from Lac-la-Biche, Alberta in the 
constituency of Beaver River.
<P>
	Pursuant to Standing Order 36, they are saying whereas the 
majority of Canadians are law-abiding citizens and respect the 
law, whereas the majority of Canadians respect the sanctity of 
human life, and whereas the majority of Canadians believe 
physicians in Canada should be working to save lives, not to end 
them, they are praying that Parliament ensures present 
provisions of the Criminal Code of Canada prohibiting assisted 
suicide be enforced vigorously.
<P>
	They pray that Parliament make no changes in the law which 
would sanction or allow the aiding or abetting of suicide or 
active or passive euthanasia.
<P>
	Also pursuant to Standing Order 36, I present a petition on 
behalf of constituents from Bonnyville, again in Beaver River. 
Whereas decriminalizing assisted suicide or legalizing 
euthanasia could lead to a reduction in patient-physician trust 
and respect, the degrading of the value of human life and the 
erosion of moral and ethical values, and whereas palliative care 
is active and compassionate care which can relieve the pain and 
suffering of terminally ill persons and families without the 
dangers of suicide, these petitioners pray that Parliament 
continue to reject euthanasia and physician assisted suicide.
<P>
	They also request present provisions of section 241 of the 
Criminal Code of Canada which forbids the counselling, 
procuring, aiding or abetting of a person to commit suicide be 
enforced vigorously and that Parliament consider expanding 
palliative care that would be accessible to all dying persons in 
Canada.

this petition may be one of the most important petitions tabled in

Windsor Park Collegiate and Nelson McIntyre, all schools in my

<P>
	These petitioners point out that:

<P>
	Quebec has been a founding partner of Canada and its richness 
and uniqueness in terms of language and culture, its population, 
its size and its position have enriched the entire nation.
<P>
	In spite of differences we have had over time, we have been 
able to reach accommodation to the benefit of all parties and 
certainly to the benefit of the entire nation. These students 
believe separation would jeopardize the quality of life of all 
Canadians, particularly young people. They insist we all work

interest of the House, the last two petitions have had the greatest 
number of petitioners coming to my office. The first one 
specifically refers the bill of my colleague from Surrey-White 
Rock-South Langley, Bill C-240. The petitioners call on 
Parliament to enact legislation against serious personal injury 
crimes being  committed by high risk offenders by permitting 
the use of post-sentence detention orders and specifically 
passing Bill C-240.

	A related petition with 686 signatures calls for keeping

eliminating statutory release and posing stiffer sentences for

Quebec from Canada, and whereas the majority of residents of

therefore the undersigned petitioners humbly pray and call on 
Parliament to inform the Leader of the Opposition he is not

	The petitioners, most of whom are concerned parents, have 
expressed grave concerns of the arrival in Canada of new phone 
sex services that originate from foreign countries. These 
services are classified as standard overseas calls and their 
advertising and access are not regulated, as are domestic 
services of the same nature.
<P>
	Unlike -900 and -976 calls which parents can block, these 
-011 numbers cannot be blocked. The petitioners believe 
children's access to these services should be curtailed and they 
request Parliament to enact a publication ban on foreign sex line 
numbers and to regulate foreign sex lines and restrict 
publication of the numbers to adult subscriptions to be 
accompanied by a warning as to their graphic nature.

	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and

the precise allocation of the $300 million multiyear WGTA 
adjustment fund. Discussions with private sector stakeholders, 
including farm organizations, and provincial governments are 
underway to solicit advice as to priorities. The fund first 
becomes available on April 1, 1996.
<P>
	To date, the advice received by the government has 
emphasized the use of this fund to: offset some of the impact of 
changes in the Canadian Wheat Board's freight cost pooling 
system; provide transitional support for the alfalfa dehydration 
industry; and build or upgrade agricultural infrastructure on the 
prairies, and especially the road system.
<P>

account, recognizing that a $300 million fund cannot address

	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. For the 
second time I am asking about Question No. 117, which I placed 
on the Order Paper on December 1, 1994.
<P>
	I understand that the government normally takes 45 days to 
answer these questions. It has now been seven months. I thought 
it was a fairly simple question, asking about the taxable liability 
of civil servants who have travel allowances and chauffeured 
limousines to move around the country.
<P>
	I hope the government will see fit to answer this question 
forthwith, after seven months.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="14330"> 14330 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, as I said the other day in 
responding to a similar point of order raised by the same hon. 
member, the question asked involves a tremendous amount of 
detail from all parliamentary agents, crown corporations, every 
department and agency of the government, all governor in 
council appointees, armed forces personnel and RCMP 
personnel. He has asked for a tremendously detailed answer. 
Frankly, I am not surprised that it has taken so long to answer. 
I am sorry it has taken so long.
<P>
	I should advise the hon. member and he will be interested to 
know that of the 209 questions on the Order Paper to date, 166 
have been answered and 43 are outstanding. That will be less the 
ones that have been answered this week. I think there have been 
four answered already this week.
<P>
	In fact, 80 per cent of the questions that have been placed on 
the Order Paper during this session of Parliament have been 
answered. The government has been assiduous in attending to its 
duties. I know the hon. member will agree, having heard those 
figures.

	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, before I get into the debate I would like to express my 
appreciation for the unanimous consent given to the grouping 
and that all of these motions are deemed to have been put, to 
expeditiously advance the debate and the passage of the bill.
<P>
	However, I also need to register very clearly and 
unequivocally that the establishment of a crown corporation like 
the Federal Business Development Bank or by whatever other 
name it might be called in the future is not consistent with 
Reform Party policy. We would suggest that such a crown 
corporation, organization or corporation not exist. Even though 
that is our position, we want to make the crown corporation as 
efficient and effective as it can be. That is the purpose of the 
amendments that our party is presenting to the House this 
afternoon.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	With regard to Motions Nos. 16, 17 and 18, which refer to 
clauses 23, 24 and 27 of the act respectively, each of these 
amendments and those respective clauses refer to the capital 
structure of the proposed FDBD. The capital structure as 
covered in clause 23 suggests that it consists of a variety of 
instruments. The first of these are common shares with a par 
value of $100 each and an unlimited number of preferred shares 
without par value, but the paid-in capital of the bank together 
with any contributed surplus related to it and any proceeds 
referred to in paragraph 30(2)(d).
<P>
	This paragraph from 30(2)(d) really has to do with hybrid 
capital instruments. We will talk about that in just a moment. We 
also need to recognize that those things that have been described 
as equity have to do with contributed surplus and retained 
earnings.
<P>
	Therefore, a couple of things need to be suggested here. First, 
the categorization of common shares versus preferred shares 
needs to be distinguished. The common shares and the preferred 
shares will be owned by the crown which is the Government of 
Canada. However, as I understand it, there is a difference in how 
they are treated in terms of the presentation of the budget to the 
House of Commons.
<P>
	The preferred shares, to the best of my knowledge, will not be 
in the budget but off budget. In other words, they are considered 
as an investment of the government so the people are unaware of 
what the disposition or exposure is of the Government of Canada 
in the equity of the Federal Business Development Bank.
<P>
	Motion No. 16 deletes from the capital structure of the bank 
the category of preferred shares. This would suggest that it is 
better to take them out.
<P>
	When we get to clause 24, if there is going to be a share capital 
part of the capital structure of the bank, to make it more efficient 
then it ought to be possible, in fact it is necessary in our opinion, 
that there be a variety of classes of shares and that they be 
created in such a way that there is a maximum of flexibility 
possible.
<P>
	If some future government would like to do what the current 
government is doing, that is privatizing crown corporations like 
CNR, then this capital structure would be a very convenient way 
to make the thing go smoothly. From that point of view, it is an 
improvement to go to a share capital position.
<P>
	Our suggestion is that there be only one class of shares which 
are common shares rather than preferred shares. Motion No. 17 
clarifies and makes more efficient the disposition, control and 
management of those shares.
<P>
	I would like to focus briefly on the hybrid capital instruments. 
Nowhere does the act define exactly what is meant by a hybrid 
capital instrument. This raises a whole series of questions. The 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14332"> 14332 </A></B>
<P>
first question has to do with what is the priority claim in the 
event of dissolution of the bank or in the event of looking at the 
earnings of the  bank as to who gets paid and in what order they 
get paid. Do they take preference to the preferred shares or do 
they take a secondary position or do they maybe even take a 
tertiary position? It is not clear.
<P>
	Therefore the act is deficient in not making that clear. The act 
is also deficient in not clarifying exactly who will own these 
hybrid financial instruments.
<P>
	The question really arises of who will be expected to buy 
these things. Are they going to be individual citizens? Is it going 
to be the Government of Canada?
<P>
<B>(1600 ) </B>
<P>
	The way the act is written, it is possible that the government 
could own these, that individual citizens could own these, that 
corporations could own these. That raises the other good 
question: Could some kind of persuasive power be directed 
towards the banks and it be requested that they supply this 
hybrid capital, in which case it is almost an expectation that it is 
just short of exercising a tax on the banks in order to supply the 
capital for this crown corporation? I do not think that is a 
desirable situation to be in.
<P>
	The other situation is that if you create a hybrid capital 
instrument and nobody knows exactly what we are talking 
about, that is like creating something we are supposed to be 
supporting and we are not sure what it is we are supporting. One 
has to be very critical of that kind of provision in an act of this 
kind.
<P>
	There is one other point that has to be raised here, and that is 
the actual manner in which the retained earnings and the 
contributed surplus is going to be handled by this bank. On one 
hand, the bank is told that it must manage its affairs in such a 
way that there is complete cost recovery in terms of the loans 
and the financial transactions it engages in. On the other hand, 
there is a provision that the capitalization of the bank contain a 
parliamentary appropriation.
<P>
	It depends a lot now on what the mix of these equity positions 
is going to be. If the major portion of the capitalization of the 
bank is going to be a hybrid capital instrument and if that has 
prior claim, then indeed the bank is obligated to pay the holders 
of these hybrid instruments before it considers any profit to the 
bank or any return on investment. If the major part of that is 
there, that becomes a direct charge against the earnings the bank 
might make. Most of those earnings will come from the money it 
lends to various entrepreneurs.
<P>
	I would respectfully suggest to the House that we adopt these 
three amendments to the act.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, to begin I would like to say 
to the industry critic for the Reform Party and the critic from the 
Bloc Quebecois that as we in committee designed this bill we 
had a very constructive debate, a very solid exchange of views. I 
am happy to see that this spirit is continuing today in the House, 
because it is important that we put this bill through the House 
today, with all the responsibility we have been given to make 
sure we do the right thing.
<P>
	At the same time, members must realize that this Business 
Development Bank of Canada is an instrument that we need to 
act as a catalyst with the small and medium size business 
community and it must be done. This bill must be passed before 
this House adjourns.
<P>
	I now want to deal with the Reform Party member's concerns 
about this area of the bill on these motions. I want to humbly 
differ with him. Where the member has said that we are not 
specific about the options the bank may choose to get into and 
therefore the crown's liability might be increased, I differ with 
that.
<P>
	I want to be very specific. Under section 30 of the bill, it is 
entitled the debt to equity ratio. Section 30 is very specific. The 
aggregate of (a) the borrowings of the bank under subsection 
18(1) and section 19 and (b) the contingent liabilities of the bank 
in the form of guarantees given by it must not at any time exceed 
12 times the equity of the bank.
<P>
<B>(1605 ) </B>
<P>
	We go on and we are very specific about the definition of 
equity:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For the purpose of subsection (1), the equity of the Bank consists of</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) the amounts paid for its shares, including any contributed surplus;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) the retained earnings of the Bank, which may be positive or negative;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(c) the amounts paid to the Bank as capital by Parliamentary appropriation; and</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(d) such proceeds of debt instruments, hybrid capital instruments or any other 
arrangements as may be prescribed as equity by the Governor in Council.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	What I am suggesting by that very specific control the bank 
has is that the amendment the Reform Party is putting forward is 
not necessary because any activity in respect to the concern of 
the member of the Reform Party could only be undertaken if it 
met the bank's eligibility criteria. If the eligibility criteria were 
not met, then the bank could not proceed holus-bolus on its own.
<P>
	I believe that the bill, as it stands, amply covers the Reform 
Party's concerns.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise to participate in the debate on the fourth 
group of motions and I am pleased that we have agreed to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14333"> 14333 </A></B>
<P>
accommodate one of our Reform Party  colleagues, who had to 
return to his riding unexpectedly early.
<P>
	I should mention from the outset that the amendments before 
us are very technical and very specialized. We support them, 
because, on the whole, they strike us as not altering the spirit of 
the bill to any degree, a bill, I might add, that we condemn with 
all the strength we can muster. This is perhaps a bit of a 
disappointment for our Reform colleagues.
<P>
	This very important bill changes the rules of the game and the 
way of doing things in addition to changing the name of the 
largest federal financial institution. The change is being made 
on the sly, without debate or show, make no mistake about it, 
even though the bill will completely change the operation and 
the mission of the bank in its relations with future clients.
<P>
	It will have the role of agent of regional development. We 
will, however, come back to this point at length during the 
course of the day. The mission of the bank is being changed in 
that the nature of the role of economic developer through small 
business will be altered. We have questions about the way the 
bank will work in the future, because, in our opinion, it will have 
to become more commercial in nature and assume the 
accompanying concerns.
<P>
	At this point in the debate, I would like to inform you that we 
will support the three motions by our colleague from the Reform 
Party, and particularly the amendment to prevent the issue of 
preferred shares. We consider it important in the context that the 
legislation clearly state preferred shares may not be issued.
<P>
	I end my remarks here and will comment further on the bill 
itself in the coming hours.

	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am delighted to have the 
opportunity to speak to this motion put to the House by the 
government wherein we name the Federal Business 
Development Bank the Business Development Bank of Canada.
<P>
	I think it is only fair to give a little background on this issue, 
because it was quite a contentious issue in the industry 
committee. It is important for Canadians to realize that the 
industry committee over the last year has been seized with one 
issue primarily. That one issue has been access to capital for 
small business.
<P>
	Most members of the committee would agree that we did not 
let a day go by when we did not explore and examine 
opportunities and ways in which we could put the small business 
community on the front burner in the House of Commons. 
Having worked in this city for many years, I must say that I have 
found the industry committee to be a united force on this issue.
<P>
	There were times when we felt we were not the industry 
committee but really the small business committee. I think it 
would be fair to suggest that we all wanted to put the small 
business stamp on every issue we touched. Lo and behold, when 
the reform of the Federal Business Development Bank came 
along we decided as a committee to rename it the Small 
Business Bank of Canada. We became emotionally attached to 
the issue of small business, to the point where we would 
probably have wanted to name this institution the Small 
Business Institution. But reason prevailed and a number of 
people took the committee's recommendation and did a more 
thorough analysis of exactly how Canadians felt about that name 
in all regions of the country. A number of important facts came 
back to us.
<P>
<B>(1615 ) </B>
<P>
	By naming the Federal Business Development Bank the Small 
Business Bank of Canada we would be creating an expectation 
for that institution which in fairness it could not fulfil. We would 
have been suggesting that the bank had powers way beyond the 
powers this bill is giving it. Most Canadians probably do not 
even realize that the Federal Business Development Bank is not 
a deposit taking institution. Right off the bat that is an important 
thing for Canadians to realize.
<P>
	Another thing we have discovered is that even though the 
bank is committed to the traditional sectors of our economy, we 
also want to give it a new type of energy and a new focus on the 
innovative economies, the knowledge based industries, et 
cetera. The small business categorization seemed to limit that 
group. These are new and emerging businesses but it does not 
take long before they become large businesses. To restrict the 
bank to the small business name would, in the long run, have 
created an adverse image and adverse impact on the bank. All 
committee members did not in any way, shape or form want to 
do anything other than make sure that this re-tooled, renewed 
bank with expanded powers got off on the right foot.
<P>
	I realize that emotionally many of us, including myself, were 
attached to the name Small Business Bank of Canada. In light of 
the fact that all of this other information has been brought to our 
attention, I would ask members to support the government 
amendment with respect to the new name, the Business 
Development Bank of Canada, which better reflects the mandate 
of the bank.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise for the second time. Changing the name of 
the Federal Business Development Bank is a substantial change 
indeed, especially when there has been no real expressed need. It 
would appear that the parliamentary secretary's memory of what 
happened in committee differs from mine.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14335"> 14335 </A></B>
<P>
	I would invite you to read again the report on small and 
medium sized business financing, put out last year by the 
committee, especially recommendation 19, if my memory 
serves me well, which came out of left field since the 
committee had not debate whether the FBDB should change its 
name. It was our very courteous colleague from 
Broadview-Greenwood who, as Parliamentary Secretary to 
the Minister of Industry, strong armed the committee into 
considering the results of the reflection which had taken place 
in the minister's office to the effect that the Federal Business 
Development Bank should change its name to the Small 
Business Bank of Canada. Strangely enough, there is no 
comment regarding this recommendation in the report. I believe 
that everybody understood that the parliamentary secretary had 
no other choice than to present certain proposals.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	However, it was not enthusiastically received, since 
everybody agreed that the Federal Business Development Bank 
had a very good reputation and that changing its name to the 
Small Business Bank of Canada would result in extra costs and a 
waste of efforts, all the more as it apparently narrowed unduly 
the federal bank's mandate.
<P>
	It would appear that cabinet continued to reflect on the issue. 
We are told that, during the past year, they consulted many 
Canadians, from coast to coast I suppose, and concluded that the 
Canadian public wanted the Federal Business Development 
Bank to change name. Whereas, last year, they had a very narrow 
view of the issue, now they have a wider view, and want to call 
the bank the Business Development Bank of Canada. The 
decision has already been made; that is what the bill proposes.
<P>
	The name was too restrictive before, but now it is too 
presumptuous. I think that the development of a country like 
Canada does not rest on the name of a bank. This would mean 
that the only possible kind of development is a financial one 
when, in fact, there is also a social and cultural development in 
Canada.
<P>
	This name change will bring about all the disadvantages we 
had anticipated right from the start, that is unnecessary 
spending, the costs of changing all business cards, letterheads 
and signs and a waste of energy. We also learned from the bank's 
representatives, during the proceedings of the committee, that in 
these times of economic recession and budget crisis, the bank 
has decided to move most of its branches, economic austerity 
notwithstanding.
<P>
	So we ask where is the coherence in this government if it cuts 
seven billion dollars in transfers to provinces for social 
programs and allows spending of that nature which seems 
entirely unnecessary and untimely. We know just how capable of 
deep and logical thinking those people across the street, in the 
Langevin Building, are.
<P>
	Unless the federal government sees in this Business 
Development Bank of Canada-and this is how we interpret the 
objective of the government-some special instrument for 
intervening in the post-referendum Canada which is coming, 
where the federal government, without any mandate and without 
consultation with anyone and especially not with provincial 
governments, is establishing-and we have said it many times 
and we hope Quebecers will understand what is involved, what 
is behind all this manoeuvring, truly the dark side of the 
moon-a whole system of instruments which will allow it to 
meddle more and more in the daily lives of Canadians and 
Quebecers. This is the new flexible federalism which, in fact, 
will turn provincial governments into regional governments.
<P>
	What worries us is when we hear the testimony of well-known 
Liberals like Claude Castonguay and Jean-Claude Rivest, now a 
senator, and a former special adviser to Premier Bourassa, all 
articulate federalists. They declared publicly on the CBC that 
Canada is being fundamentally restructured. Quebecers should 
reflect on that, on what these people say.
<P>
	So, when we see how far the federal government is going in 
terms of the new mandate of the Business Development Bank of 
Canada, which will be asked, among other things, to promote 
entrepreneurship and support all programs developing 
entrepreneurship in Canada, we notice that these terms are 
unclear and undefined in the bill and will allow the government 
to intervene as it sees fit in any area that it finds interesting, as it 
will be able to do in another context, under Bill C-88 concerning 
internal trade that we will also comment on later today. Again, 
in clause 9, the federal government is giving itself huge powers, 
without any mandate, without consulting the stakeholders, even 
if nobody asked for this. It is again doing it on the sly.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	We are also aware that there was a meeting on this issue in 
Calgary; no one had authorized the federal government to act as 
it did and the federal government did not inform its partners of 
its intention to pass Bill C-88 that we are going to study later on 
today or tomorrow.
<P>
	Instead we propose that clause 1 to maintain the status quo 
regarding the name of the Federal Business Development Bank 
be dropped, for all kinds of reasons. It is a corporation which has 
an excellent reputation and with which Canadians and 
Quebecers are familiar. It has proven itself, it has played a 
useful role as a bank of last resort and we will come back to this 
concept later on.
<P>
	If only to set an example and because of the costs and 
unnecessary efforts involved in changing the name of the 
Federal Business Development Bank to Business Development 
Bank of Canada, which furthermore we find presumptuous, we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14336"> 14336 </A></B>
<P>
are going to vote against the government's amendments. We are 
going to propose  instead to cancel clause 1 which aims at 
changing the name of the bank.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, there are a number of principles I would like to adhere 
to when rising to debate on this first group of motions having to 
do with changing the name of the Federal Business 
Development Bank. A number of the principles I want to centre 
on are fiscal responsibility, democratic decision making, and 
some of the provisions in the bill itself.
<P>
	My hon. colleague from the Bloc has illustrated so clearly and 
so well the additional cost that will be incurred because of these 
kinds of changes that I do not think are necessary. If on the one 
hand it would change the function of the bank by changing the 
name, then let us do it but it does not.
<P>
	In the whole function of the bank the mandate has been 
expanded and the capitalization structure has changed. The 
capital that is available to be lent out has changed. In fact the 
current capital is about $3.2 billion and under the new 
provisions of this bill it rises to $18 billion. There are some 
points there that this bank now becomes a very major player in 
small business lending.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary made a big point about the fact 
that this is going to be the small business bank and that we all 
have an emotional attachment to small business. My attachment 
to small business is not on an emotional basis. My attachment to 
small business is very pragmatic and very hard headed. It is very 
simply that 85 per cent of the new jobs created in Canada are 
created by small business. That is the significant part. If we ever 
want to really build this economy, we have to pay attention to 
small business. We have to grow it and we have to develop it. It 
has to become larger and eventually has to graduate from a small 
business to a big business.
<P>
	Those are all very desirable things. The big point here is that 
we are entering into a request to change the name of a bank. I 
really wonder what the result will be of changing that name.
<P>
	What bothers me on the democratic part of this thing is that 
we entered into an arrangement in this House where we could get 
the bill to committee before second reading, a bill that was 
supposed to be discussed in the House. What happened? It meant 
that all the members in the House were not able to contribute to 
the debate on the provisions of the proposed legislation in the 
House.
<P>
	The bill went to the committee and the committee worked on 
it. It worked fast. All parliamentary standing committees should 
take a lesson from the way the industry committee works. It gets 
co-operation. It works well. There is a lot of disagreement and 
fighting back and forth but there is no recrimination and that is 
very significant. We recognize a good idea. It does not matter 
where it comes from and that is wonderful.
<P>
<B>(1630 ) </B>
<P>
	When the decisions of that kind from committee are presented 
to the minister and he turns right around and says he is sorry 
about that committee but he is on his way, it will be the Business 
Development Bank of Canada and he does not care what we 
think, that calls for real criticism and begs the questions of how 
important a committee is. What has happened to the procedure?
<P>
	If everyone in the House agreed to name the bank the small 
business bank of Canada, would the minister have said sorry, 
Parliament of Canada, but the name will be the Business 
Development bank of Canada not the small business bank? The 
minister exercised that kind of authority in committee, which he 
would not dare do in the Parliament of Canada. There has been 
an abuse of the intent and the spirit of bringing this to committee 
before second reading.
<P>
	I also want to come to grips with the word complementary 
which was touted. This new bank is now supposed to be 
complementary. We could not get the experts, legal or anything 
else, to define complementary clearly. It was ultimately brought 
into the bill in a new kind of way. I hope the parliamentary 
secretary, the minister and all of the department officials will be 
able to administer this act so it is complementary and not in 
direct competition with the existing field.
<P>
	I do not think it is fiscally responsible to incur costs of making 
all of those changes from the Federal Business Development 
Bank to the Business Development Bank of Canada. It is 
unnecessary and will change nothing. If we are to do it that way 
let us not change it at all.
<P>
	Democracy needs to prevail in the House. We ought to 
recognize how important it is the wishes of committees have 
meaning. I must recognize at the same time, although it is not 
part of these motions, that in the committee there were some 
significant amendments made and the minister accepted them. 
We need to recognize the minister went the other way around, 
which I think is an abuse of his privileges.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> You cannot win them 
all.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Schmidt:</B> Madam Speaker, is it interesting how the 
parliamentary secretary gets so excited about this issue. That is 
to be a fundamental question not only for the parliamentary 
secretary but for all members on that side of the House. How 
well do they recognize democracy and the wishes of the people 
when it comes to voting in the House?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would like to say that I totally agree with what my 
friend from the Reform Party said about committee 
proceedings. In committee there are ideas exchanged, some 
serious work done. However, we get the impression that, in spite 
of all 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14337"> 14337 </A></B>
<P>
the work that is done, when the  government wants to impose a 
direction or a decision, a committee does not carry much weight.
<P>
	As regards this grouping of amendments, I would like to 
remind members that with this bill, the government aims at 
streamlining and modernizing the Federal Business 
Development Bank. These are words that are really suited to the 
market situation as this century comes to an end. But they do not 
fool anyone about the primary intention of the federal 
government, which is to interfere even more in regional 
development. Knowing as we do that this element of regional 
development is extremely important to Quebec, it is obvious 
that the government intends increase its presence through this 
structure, this bank, to interfere, to play a role in the most 
important processes of the economic development of the state of 
Quebec. We can feel that very clearly.
<P>
	The government is introducing totally new legislation, the 
Business Development Bank of Canada Act, which is the new 
name of the bank, and thereby revokes the Federal Business 
Development Bank Act. The Bloc opposes any amendment to 
the current act instituting the Federal Business Development 
Bank. The bank must continue to provide last resort bank 
services to small business. Why? Because this is its basic 
mission, which is to support small businesses having difficulty 
obtaining financing.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	But now, the government wants to set itself up as a banker. We 
all know very well that Quebec's position is very clear as 
regards financial support to business. The Quebec premier said 
clearly that Quebec does not want to act as a banker but that it is 
ready to implement numerous measures to support small 
business.
<P>
	The federal government has just given itself a means to act as 
a banker and to compete directly with banks. This group of 
amendments on the new name of the Federal Business 
Development Bank is particularly important. The intent of the 
government is to turn it into a genuine bank.
<P>
	If we look closely at the very centralizing bill put forward by 
the Liberal Party of Canada, we understand the reason for this 
name. It comes from a very clear federal Liberal tradition that 
goes back to the Trudeau era. A very centralizing tradition with 
tentacles everywhere.
<P>
	From now on, the central government will not be involved in 
regional development, and even less in local development. It is 
developing, using a global strategy, all over the map. In other 
words, what is good for Canada is good for Quebec, what is good 
for Newfoundland is good for Quebec, what is good for Ontario 
is good for Quebec, what is not good for Ontario is not good for 
Quebec. We know that Ontario has the final say, because the 
Minister of Industry is from Ontario.
<P>
	We oppose this group of government amendments relating to 
the naming of the Federal Business Development Bank. I refer 
to the motion of my colleague for Trois-Rivières that says that 
the Federal Business Development Bank is to be maintained as a 
body corporate. We propose that the bank retain its primary 
mission, the current one.
<P>
	The dissenting report of the Bloc Quebecois members sitting 
on the Standing Committee on Industry concerning small and 
medium size enterprises says, and I quote: ``That the Quebec 
government is in a better position to recognize the funding needs 
of small and medium size enterprises, to develop programs and 
to implement them''.
<P>
	I will go further into other groups of amendments later on and 
list the tools Quebec has in this field of activity. By moving into 
this field, the federal government is once again creating a lot of 
costly duplication.
<P>
	As we have said on many occasions, Quebec does not accept 
that the central government can apply Canadian industrial 
development plans throughout Canada, with national standards 
and objectives established by the Department of Industry.
<P>
	We have to acknowledge something that is very obvious: 
``Quebec's control in this field of activity must be recognized by 
its Canadian economic partner, that is Quebec must have sole 
control over access to small and medium size enterprises and 
regional development''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it is a great pleasure for me to speak to Bill 
C-91 and emphasize the very positive work done by the critic of 
the Bloc Quebecois on this matter, the member for 
Trois-Rivières, who, as you know, has extensive experience in 
financial assistance to small business.
<P>
	I think it is worthwhile to repeat what others have already 
said, that such a bill worries the Bloc. We do not understand how 
the Minister of Industry could waste his time reviewing the 
Federal Business Development Bank, since this institution was 
and still is an instrument much appreciated by small business.
<P>
	We are convinced that, if the Minister of Industry is really 
hard-pressed for work, he could have reviewed the assistance 
programs for the defence industries, with some help from the 
secretary of state for science, research and development.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14338"> 14338 </A></B>
<P>
	I see that the secretary of state is eager to participate in the 
debate, whether directly or indirectly. Essentially, we are 
concerned about the fact that this bill is sanctioning a concrete 
and immediate interference in an area of provincial 
jurisdiction, that is regional development.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	Madam Speaker, you certainly know that Quebec has been 
demanding that regional development be recognized as a 
provincial jurisdiction, in accordance with the constitution, 
since 1974-in fact probably since 1968, but at least since 1974, 
when the Industrial Development Bank was established. That 
was the first real interference by the federal government.
<P>
	I could very easily demonstrate that, certainly as far back as 
1974, the federal government has used regional development as 
a pretext to meddle in a lot of areas that are not under its 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	As for ERDAs, or Economic and Regional Development 
Agreements, why is it that we are debating in June 1995 a bill 
put forward by the Minister of Industry, when he did not even 
deign to negotiate and sign ERDAs? Why is the government 
making this a priority, but did not feel concerned and compelled 
to get involved in the renewal of these agreements? One can only 
wonder.
<P>
	In fact, this needs to be said. Our friends opposite are 
consistent in their ways; they are using regional development as 
an excuse to move into areas over which they have no 
jurisdiction under the constitution. That is what this interest in 
regional development and ERDAs is all about. Let me back this 
up with a few facts and figures.
<P>
	The second batch of ERDAs, those covering the 1984-94 
period-I think the parliamentary secretary to the Minister of 
Industry should listen, because even if he is from Toronto, he 
could learn a thing or two-were on cultural products, fisheries, 
transportation and tourism. Can you think of an area that is more 
obviously and explicitly a provincial responsibility than 
tourism? Regional development was used to step into areas of 
jurisdiction not assigned to the federal government.
<P>
	That is the kind of trick that should make us see clearly that 
the federal government will never play fair and square at the 
game of federalism and abide by sections 91 and 92 of the 
British North America Act. It had been amply demonstrated that 
this many armed, one track and rule bending government is 
trying to encroach on areas of jurisdiction that are not its own.
<P>
	It must be said that the Federal Business Development Bank, 
in the present state of affairs and because of the way it operates, 
is something small and medium size businesses in Quebec 
appreciate because it had a well-defined mandate limited to 
providing last resort assistance. I think that every member of 
this House has had the chance at one time or another to deal with 
officials of the Federal Business Development Bank. I know that 
often, when as an MP I had occasion to refer  people to the 
FBDB, it was because traditional institutions such as chartered 
banks had refused to help. As stated in its enabling legislation, 
the FBDB was a last resort lending institution.
<P>
	Why review the mandate of the Federal Business 
Development Bank? At whose request? Why is this a 
government priority when we have so many other fish to fry, 
particularly I might add in the area of science and technology, 
about which the National Advisory Board on Science and 
Technology published a report? I do hope we will get to discuss 
it in this House, as it would provide me with an opportunity to 
share views with my good friend, the parliamentary secretary. 
Over the weekend I read the report, which was tabled recently 
and found it quite enlightening.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	This report of the National Advisory Board on Science and 
Technology talks about growth, and wisdom, and it proposes 
four courses of action, but it gives no real indication that this 
government wants to work to make science and technology a 
priority. It would have been much more useful for the 
government to work toward that goal than to review the Federal 
Business Development Bank Act that no one, in the end, wished 
to review.
<P>
	Once again, we must keep in mind that the Federal Bank, 
established in 1974, was appreciated, and still is, by small and 
medium size businesses in Quebec and perhaps even in Canada, 
because it offered consulting services, financial services which 
were mostly self-financed. For no apparent reason, the Federal 
Business Development Bank, under a new name, is being asked, 
as my colleague for Trois-Rivières pointed out, to become a 
rather traditional lending institutional and to compete with 
existing institutions. I know that some witnesses raised this as a 
concern before the Committee on Industry. We fail to 
understand why the government is bent on stiffer competition in 
an area that did not need it.
<P>
	There is cause for concern here, and I think that we will never 
give enough attention to the real threats for Quebec which are 
included in this bill, especially under clauses 20 and 21. Are you 
aware of the Liberals' old tactic? The bill will allow the new 
bank to do business with organizations or persons directly, over 
the head of the Quebec government. This is the same old 
unhealthy, obsolete tactic of divide and conquer, and it fools 
nobody.
<P>
	They want to divide and conquer by making funds available. 
The government whip is a well informed man generally, but 
obviously, his somewhat Canadian naïvety can sometimes lead 
him to support principles that are unhealthy for Quebec. As we 
know, under clause 20, the bank will be allowed to do business 
directly with organizations or persons, without taking into 
account the will of the Quebec government.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14339"> 14339 </A></B>
<P>
	I know the government whip would surely not have wanted 
the official opposition to support such principles that 
obviously-and this cannot be said too often-are very 
disrespectful to Canadian federalism.
<P>
	As I have stated, Madam Speaker-and I will conclude with 
that since you indicate that my time is up-if the government is 
really serious about regional development, it should transfer tax 
points or make direct payments to the Quebec government, 
because we have plenty of projects.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to address this House on Bill C-91. This bill seeks to do 
many things, including changing the name of the Federal 
Business Development Bank, which will become the Business 
Development Bank of Canada. As they say, what is in a name? 
What does that name change involve? Let me explain a few 
things, particularly as regards clause 21, which reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Bank may carry out duties or functions that may be assigned to it by the 
Designated Minister in relation to the administration of any program supporting 
Canadian entrepreneurship, to the extent that it is able to recover the costs of 
carrying out the duties or functions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
The clause says ``to the extent that it is able to recover the costs 
of carrying out the duties or functions''. As you know, when a 
bank lends money, it takes a risk. Here, the level of risk is not 
defined. We have reservations about that.
<P>
	The minister responsible for implementing the act can ask the 
Business Development Bank of Canada to support Canadian 
entrepreneurship by carrying out duties or functions currently 
assigned to other federal departments or agencies.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	Bill C-91 seeks to ensure that the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, better known as the FORD-Q, will be 
the provider of federal services and programs to small and 
medium size businesses.
<P>
	I have several objections regarding this bill. First, this 
legislation is another centralizing measure which will create 
unnecessary and costly duplication. Bill C-91 completely 
eliminates the role of the provincial government in terms of 
helping small and medium size businesses.
<P>
	As you know, this contradicts the Liberal government's 
claims that it wants to abolish duplication and overlap with the 
provinces. This centralizing attempt is obvious in clauses 20 and 
21, which will allow the Business Development Bank of Canada 
to enter into agreements with other federal departments to 
deliver assistance to small and medium size businesses directly.
<P>
	The agreements signed, including with the Federal Office of 
Regional Development for Quebec, will allow the federal 
government to interfere more in regional development projects. 
I did not say ``to get involved'', but to ``interfere'', which is 
definitely not the same.  ``To get involved'' is to act like a 
partner, while ``to interfere'' is to usurp a place when you are not 
invited.
<P>
	Clause 20 of the bill provides that the Business Development 
Bank of Canada may enter into agreements directly with any 
other body or person. That means that it could have agreements 
with regional development councils, which is precisely what the 
FORD-Q would like. In Quebec, the Act respecting the 
Ministère du Conseil exécutif does not allow agencies under 
provincial jurisdiction to enter into agreements with the federal 
government without the minister's approval. We can see here 
the difference between partnership and interference.
<P>
	Consider the context of clause 20, which is far from 
innocuous because the Quebec legislation could be bypassed. 
Given the present budgetary restrictions, if the federal 
government wants to fund projects advocated by a regional 
development council, the council will strongly pressure the 
Quebec government for an exemption. Unfortunately, this is 
already a common occurrence. The federal and provincial 
governments are on a collision course because of legislation that 
does not foster partnership, but interference in a local process.
<P>
	Once again, we have the federal government blatantly 
disregarding the very existence of the Quebec government and 
securing the legislative authority to act without prior 
consultation with Quebec or, for that matter, any other province. 
I am referring to the Quebec situation because I am familiar with 
it, but all provinces will suffer from the adverse impact of this 
bill.
<P>
	My second misgiving concerns regional development and 
more particularly the federal government's centralist attack that 
is in direct contradiction with Quebec's regionalization policy.
<P>
	I had the honour and the privilege to sit on the National 
Capital Commission-and I am talking about Quebec City and 
the future of Quebec-and I heard the presentations made by 
many stakeholders who believed that regionalization in the 
province of Quebec is crucial. However, the federal government 
has never recognized that regional development is an area of 
exclusive provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	During every round of constitutional negotiations, Ottawa has 
ignored our demand. Instead, Ottawa promised the government 
of Quebec to limit its presence in the regions to what is provided 
for under the Canada-Quebec framework agreements. However, 
ERDA, the Economic and Regional Development Agreement to 
which my distinguished colleague referred earlier, came to an 
end, that was in December 1994 I think, and the federal 
government has refused to renew it. The Canada-Quebec 
agreement has expired.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	Without joint programs with the government of Quebec, the 
mandate of FORD-Q becomes practically obsolete. So, to 
maintain its visibility in the regions, the federal government has 
found nothing better than to redefine the mandate of FORD-Q.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14340"> 14340 </A></B>
<P>
	Nowadays, FORD-Q is known as the delivery arm for all the 
small businesses assistance programs set up by the federal 
departments and will be able, on the one hand, to provide 
assistance services to small and medium size businesses 
through a single information window and, on the other hand, 
to develop new programs, particularly for exporting SMBs, 
through federal departments.
<P>
	A third concern of mine has to do with the fact that the federal 
government prefers to withdraw from social program funding. It 
is well known. It takes the taxpayers' money to create useless 
overlaps with Quebec agencies which support small and 
medium size businesses.
<P>
	The 1995 federal budget, as we know, cut more than $7 billion 
from social programs. The federal government is asking people 
to make sacrifices because it has no more money. It even uses 
the surplus in the unemployment insurance fund-of all 
things-which is financed by employers and employees. And 
what does it do with this money? It finances new child care 
programs, new programs to fight against poverty, new 
manpower training programs, which, it must be said, all infringe 
on provincial jurisdictions.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the federal government is in no hurry when it 
comes to responding to Quebec's demands, which are that it 
withdraw from the fields of manpower training and regional 
development and reduce this costly and useless duplication. 
However, Ottawa continues to ignore Quebec's demands, even 
though this waste of money affects taxpayers and creates an 
administrative mess, because the beneficiaries of these 
programs no longer know where to turn. Moreover, it creates 
unproductive and unhealthy competition between programs that 
are not even based on the same strategies. And that is where the 
problem lies. These programs are not based on the same 
strategies. Strategies which are useful, necessary and beneficial 
to Quebec are not necessarily the ones chosen by the federal 
government.
<P>
	I will conclude by saying that I regret that this bill has been 
proposed in this form by the government and that I fervently 
hope that, this fall, Quebec will take control of its destiny and 
that we will no longer have to engage in these pointless 
negotiations cap in hand, with Ottawa, but rather will be able to 
negotiate as equals with the goal of a happy and healthy 
prosperity for all.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réjean Lefebvre (Champlain, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am very pleased to rise today to speak to Bill C-91, an Act to 
continue the Federal Business Development Bank under the 
name Business Development Bank of Canada. The purpose of 
the bill is to replace the Federal Business Development Bank by 
the Business Development Bank of Canada.
<P>
	The Liberal government has decided to introduce a totally 
new piece of legislation, creating a new body, the Business 
Development Bank of Canada, instead of amending the existing 
legislation governing the Federal Business Development Bank. 
We must not delude ourselves. This new legislation is 
fundamentally similar to the present legislation although it 
makes some major changes.
<P>
	As for the mandate, it is changed in such a way that the 
Federal Business Development Bank will no longer offer only 
last resort financing, but will now have the power to offer 
financing to complement that available from other financial 
institutions.
<P>
	It will also be easier for the new Business Development Bank 
of Canada to enter into agreements with private and public 
partners, at both the federal and provincial levels, to form 
lending consortiums. The new bank will therefore be able to 
establish subsidiaries and to use a greater number of financial 
tools to fulfil its mandate. Clause 20 of the bill gives the bank 
great flexibility to negotiate agreements with other federal 
departments as well as with provincial and local agencies in 
order to fulfil its specific mandate.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	By giving the bank greater leeway, the federal government 
will be able to develop an integrated approach to interfering in 
every aspect of regional development, in Quebec in particular, 
where the Federal Office of Regional Development has become 
the delivery arm for all federal programs.
<P>
	In this context, Bill C-91 constitutes another centralizing 
offensive from the federal government, resulting in costly and 
needless duplication. It completely negates the role of the 
Quebec government in providing assistance to small business. 
This is in contradiction with repeated statements by the people 
opposite, who said they wanted to eliminate duplication and 
overlap with provincial programs. On the contrary, this a perfect 
way to perpetuate the problem.
<P>
	As I said earlier, this is a centralizing offensive based on 
clauses 20 and 21 of the bill. These two clauses enable the 
Federal Business Development Bank to enter into agreements 
with other federal departments or agencies in order to deal 
directly with small and medium sized businesses, which will 
allow the federal government to interfere even more in regional 
development projects.
<P>
	Clause 20 of the bill also enables the Federal Business 
Development Bank to enter directly into agreements with a 
person or agency, which means that the bank could enter into 
agreements with regional development councils for example. In 
Quebec, however, the Executive Council Act prohibits 
provincially regulated agencies from entering into agreements 
with the federal government without ministerial consent.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14341"> 14341 </A></B>
<P>
	One could think that this section is harmless, since it is 
governed by a Quebec provincial statute. However, in the 
present context of fiscal restraint, if the federal government 
offers to fund projects put forward by a RDC, the latter will 
press the Quebec government to allow a departure from the law, 
which is common practice.
<P>
	Once again, Ottawa dismisses Quebec's role in the matter and 
shamelessly gives itself the power to act without consulting the 
provinces. This centralizing offensive in regional development 
runs directly counter to Quebec's regionalization policy. The 
federal government has always refused to recognize regional 
development as an exclusive provincial jurisdiction, dismissing 
this claim in every constitutional negotiation, while implicitly 
making a commitment to the Quebec government to limit its 
action in regions through Canada-Quebec agreements.
<P>
	However, the Economic and Regional Development 
Agreement, or ERDA, expired in December 1994 and the federal 
government refused to renew it. This government can never 
claim to support regional development by replacing essential 
components of a social plan with direct assistance to small and 
medium size businesses. By dismissing Quebec's achievements 
in terms of assisting exporting small and medium-size 
businesses, the federal government is trying to make Quebec 
look like the one responsible for the overlapping which it is 
creating with this bill.
<P>
	The FBDB is a successful regional development tool which is 
greatly appreciated by small and medium size businesses. By 
and large, Quebec's small and medium size businesses get one 
third of the loans from the FBDB, but they definitely do not rely 
as heavily on the bank's extension services. Since the bank has 
no exclusive commercial objective, such as maximizing 
profits-it only seeks to recover its costs-, Mr. Rémillard, of 
the Canadian Bankers' Association, says that it helped develop 
new financial tools which were often used later by commercial 
financial institutions. The bank acts as an innovator by 
proposing new forms of financing which other financial 
institutions can apply when dealing with small and medium size 
businesses.
<P>
	Therefore, the Bloc Quebecois will make sure that the bank 
remains first and foremost a tool for economic development, 
that it does not compete with other such tools used by 
Quebecers, including the caisses populaires, the solidarity fund 
and the CNTU fund, and that it has the means to support Quebec 
businesses.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	The effect that the bill could have on the bank's role in 
economic development is very worrisome. In fact, two 
provisions in the bill, when combined, cast doubts on the bank's 
ability to maintain its role as a tool of economic development: 
the broadening of the bank's mandate and the bank's ability to 
obtain private capital financing  through hybrid instruments, 
contingent on certain conditions.
<P>
	Firstly, the bank would no longer be just a last resort lender: it 
would be able to offer complementary financing which would be 
a little different from what existing financial institutions offer. 
The danger is that the bank could target its activities more 
towards complementary financing than last resort financing. 
Since there is less risk involved in complementary financing, 
naturally the bank will tend to favour this type of financing.
<P>
	Bill C-91 is another move in the federal government's 
centralizing offensive, as I mentioned earlier, which only causes 
costly and useless duplication. Bill C-91 dismisses totally the 
provincial government's role regarding assistance to small and 
medium size businesses. It goes against the Liberal 
government's claims that it wants to abolish overlaps and 
duplication with the provinces.
<P>
	Furthermore, clause 20 of the bill allows the bank, the FBDB, 
to enter into agreements directly with individuals and with 
organizations. This means that the FBDB could enter into 
agreements with regional development councils, for example.
<P>
	But in Quebec, the Executive Council Act prohibits 
organizations which are governed by provincial law from 
entering into such agreements. Regarding regional 
development, the federal government's push for centralization 
runs counter to Quebec's policy on regionalization.
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
welcome this opportunity to speak at the report stage of Bill 
C-91.
<P>
	When the bill was tabled on first reading, I had the impression 
it would simply change the name of the bank and increase the 
amount of capital available. In other words, it would make a 
certain number of adjustments, considering the fact that the 
legislation establishing the bank was at least 20 years old. At 
first glance it seemed quite logical and understandable that the 
minister responsible for the bank should want to update the 
legislation.
<P>
	However, after considering the bill and reflecting on the scope 
of certain clauses, I feel I must condemn this legislation and, as 
my Bloc Quebecois colleagues have done, point out to the House 
that a number of clauses are potentially dangerous.
<P>
	In fact, the bill would change the mission of the Federal 
Business Development Bank and allow the bank to be used for 
purposes which may be questionable and even unacceptable to 
the provinces and to certain regions in the provinces.
<P>
	First, a few words about the bank's mission. As you know, the 
Federal Business Development Bank continues the tradition of 
institutions that were established after the war to help small 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14342"> 14342 </A></B>
<P>
businesses raise the capital they needed. In the case of defence 
conversion, they were to  help Canada build a thriving civilian 
industry that would contribute to the country's prosperity.
<P>
	The institution was well received by Canadians and 
Quebecers. It has excellent credentials and has proved its worth.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	The bank's mission was, more or less, to provide last resort 
financing, in other words, to help developers who found it 
difficult to get financing from traditional financial institutions. 
The Federal Business Development Bank was set up to ensure 
that the necessary capital would be available to entrepreneurs so 
they could start small businesses.
<P>
	It is clear that this bill will change the mission of the bank. It 
is now described as providing complementary financing not 
customarily provided by traditional financial institutions. 
Complementary financing is not the same as last resort 
financing. Last resort financing is needed when the institution or 
the developer goes to the institutions and although the banks 
agree the project is worthwhile, they cannot provide the capital, 
while complementary financing does not have quite the same 
connotation.
<P>
	It is clear that if the bank is described as providing 
complementary financing, it is directly competing with 
institutions across Canada that were set up to help entrepreneurs 
find capital. An example is the venture capital fund which has 
become an institution in Quebec. It seems that in Canada, 
Quebec is known for its institutions that specialize in providing 
venture capital for entrepreneurs.
<P>
	I am thinking as well of the solidarity fund of the FTQ, the 
industrial development corporation and the Innovatech 
companies. In short, the Federal Business Development Bank, 
by abandoning its purpose of providing last resort capital, will 
now be competing with institutions that make attractive capital 
available to promoters.
<P>
	This change in the bank's purpose is regrettable. In my 
opinion, the aim of the bank was to provide last resort funds. It 
was good at that. By changing its purpose and allowing it to 
subtly change its objectives and the type of capital it will 
provide, we may be putting Canadian business seriously at risk.
<P>
	Perhaps we of the Bloc could have viewed somewhat 
positively the purpose of providing complementary funding, but 
I think the bill should have provided that the purpose of the bank 
was to continue to provide last resort funds.
<P>
	Two clauses are also cause for concern. Perhaps there are 
others, but I think my colleagues will look after pointing them 
out to the House. Clauses 20 and 21 raise problems, in my 
opinion. Clause 20 provides that ``the Bank may enter into 
agreements with -any department or agency of the government 
of Canada or a province or any other body-''. The reference 
here is perhaps to  cities, educational institutions, regional 
development councils-any other body in order to carry out its 
purpose.
<P>
	If clause 20 were adopted as it stands, the bank could 
intervene directly with bodies that come under provincial 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	I think this is potentially dangerous, given Canada's 
economic history and even its political history. One realizes that 
over the years one of the major problems with Canadian 
federalism has been that, given its spending power, the federal 
government has been able to interfere in areas of exclusive 
provincial jurisdiction. The most obvious and striking example 
is education, an area which, under the constitution, clearly 
comes under the exclusive jurisdiction of the provinces but an 
area where, over the years, the federal government, with its 
spending power, has been able, first directly with the 
universities, and also directly with some school boards for 
certain programs, to step in and often, to a certain extent, divert 
these bodies from their goal because they had to meet the federal 
government's funding requirements.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	I am myself an educator by profession. Over the years, I have 
often seen federal programs proposed. It was a little difficult for 
the local administrators to refuse. They were afraid that if they 
did, they were going to be turning down large amounts of money, 
maybe $10,000 or $100,000. Administrators therefore did what 
the province of Quebec did in the fifties with respect to 
university funding.
<P>
	Local or provincial governments must, in such a situation and 
as a last resort, accept the interference of the federal government 
because large sums of money are at stake.
<P>
	In clause 20, the federal government provides itself with the 
necessary means to interfere, again, in areas that come under the 
exclusive jurisdiction of the provinces. It is probably also 
ensuring that there is yet more duplication so that federal, 
provincial and municipal agencies compete, which is very 
harmful. The history of the Canadian federation since day one 
shows that this was a serious flaw in the Canadian federal 
system, where different levels of government can compete in 
major areas.
<P>
	I would have liked to say a few words more on clause 21, 
which mandates the bank to support entrepreneurship. This is an 
extremely vague term that could be made to mean just about 
anything. Again, this could be another excuse for the FBDB to 
interfere in areas of provincial jurisdiction.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14343"> 14343 </A></B>
<P>
	Perhaps we would see less cause for concern or suspicion if 
the whole regional development policy had not changed so 
drastically these past few months. But since it did change, we 
suspect that the Federal Business Development Bank could be 
the federal government's way of making up for what it is no 
longer investing in the area of development and ensuring that 
there is more and more duplication in areas of provincial 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to address Bill C-91, which seeks to change the name of 
the Federal Business Development Bank, as well as its purpose.
<P>
	The Federal Business Development Bank is a long-standing 
institution which has played an important role in economic 
development, as a bank of last resort. That was and should 
continue to be its mandate since that bank should not compete 
with other financial institutions.
<P>
	The bank gets a new name which is of strategic importance for 
the federal government. It will become the Business 
Development Bank of Canada. What does that name mean 
exactly? Will it strive to develop business and the economy or 
Canada?
<P>
	It reminds me somewhat of development banks in Africa. I 
guess the government now recognizes that it is running a 
developing country. We must look like a developing country in 
the eyes of the international community. The federal 
government just confirmed that the state of its economy is 
appalling, that its debt is staggering. It just said so. It will 
probably get foreign money through the Business Development 
Bank of Canada, just like the European Bank for Reconstruction 
and Development gets money, even from Canada, the United 
States and Japan, to develop eastern countries which have 
problems.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	By using such a name, it should be easier for us to go to Japan, 
even China, and to richer countries, since Canada has become a 
developing country. In fact, we are among the 65 or 70 poorest 
countries of the world if you look at the national and foreign 
debts. Canada is on the same level as developing countries. This 
new name is a pretty smart idea. It will probably allow Canada to 
borrow more money abroad to promote its own development, 
before it goes bankrupt, assuming this is not already the case.
<P>
	In Quebec, we took control of our financial institutions a long 
time ago. In Quebec, we already have control over a few 
hundreds of billions of dollars thanks to our <I>caisses populaires</I>, 
the Fédération des caisses d'économie Desjardins du Québec, 
the provincial charters we control ourselves, as well as over our 
priorities in terms of our activities, and we want to keep it. We 
also want very much to continue to cooperate with our financial 
institutions.
<P>
	We do not want the federal government to interfere through a 
financial institution which will have a much broader mandate 
and will prevent Quebec from working hand in hand with its own 
financial institutions as it has always done.
<P>
	We had to build our financial institutions ourselves because 
the federal government was not very useful in helping us to keep 
our money and invest in our industries. Again, I understand very 
well why the very centralist Liberal government wants to 
control everything. It wants to control our priorities, it wants to 
collect our tax revenues and spend the money according to its 
own priorities. Not only does it want to impose its priorities in 
terms of manpower training, but it also wants to do so in the 
trade area.
<P>
	Let me give the House some examples which have led me to 
believe that the federal government is trying to increase its 
control. It says that it will be able to sign agreements with other 
financial institutions and with other private companies in order 
to defend some industries. For instance, we know, and I often 
come back to this issue which I find important, that the federal 
government never supported Quebec's hydro development 
programs. The province of Quebec was the sole investor in 
Hydro-Quebec. It invested tens of billions of dollars, while the 
federal government never spent a penny on these projects.
<P>
	Again, the federal government will want to be the one to 
decide which industries should be given priority for 
development purposes. This means that the federal government 
could favour businesses in the uranium, natural gas or oil 
industry, for example, over businesses in the electric power 
industry. That is what it means. When we say that the federal 
government wants to control industrial priorities in Quebec, it 
does it through the Federal Business Development Bank by 
interfering even more and by making decisions regarding 
economic development priorities in that province. It is terrible.
<P>
	Do not think that we are fooled. We can see very clearly what 
is going on. We know the history of Quebec. We have lived 
through it. I come from Quebec, I was part of the business 
community and I know full well that Quebecers had to work 
twice as hard to achieve the equivalent of what Ontario was able 
to achieve. Why is that? Because the federal government was 
working against us.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	The federal government has always worked against us. Just 
look at what is happening in Ottawa with regard to research and 
development, for example. Three or four years ago, I conducted 
a study to see who was getting research and development 
contracts. Well, in 1990, research and development contracts 
awarded to businesses and universities by the federal 
government totalled 1 billion-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> It was done previously.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="14344"> 14344 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> Yes, it was done previously under 
the Liberals and it continued a little under the Conservatives. 
It cannot be done overnight; it takes time.
<P>
	In 1990, the federal government gave $1.2 billion more in 
contracts to businesses, universities and research centres for 
research and development in Ontario than it did in Quebec.
<P>
	We are not totally blind in Quebec. I can assure you that this 
new financial institution which is coming to Quebec has gotten 
Quebecers quite worried. This worries not only the 
sovereignists, but also Quebec's other financial institutions. 
The reason we are protesting this new kind of bank which will in 
a certain way change the order of things in Quebec's financial 
system is that we are totally against any change in this system.
<P>
	To reply, in part, to the hon. member who is muttering over 
there, back when I was a Conservative, we simply wanted to 
scrap the Federal Business Development Bank. We came very 
close to scrapping it precisely because we really do not need this 
financial institution, especially now with its new vocation, 
which will be to rock the boat when it comes to the agreements 
between our financial institutions, our businesses and our 
universities. If we could gain control of job training, we could 
close the loop and bring lasting prosperity to Quebec, and be rid 
of the federal government that is stifling our growth. We are 
really looking forward to becoming sovereign.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
welcome this opportunity to speak to Bill C-91, whose purpose 
is to provide a new name for what was referred to as the Federal 
Business Development Bank and will now become the Business 
Development Bank of Canada.
<P>
	As usual, and as has been going on for a long time, the federal 
government took advantage of this opportunity to change the 
mandate of the institution, so that from now on, as other Bloc 
members have said so eloquently, it can be used as an 
instrument, and it is indeed an instrument, to put the finishing 
touches on this contemptible encroaching on provincial 
jurisdictions, disguised as regional development.
<P>
	I would like to elaborate somewhat on the monster the 
government is creating with this legislation. In this bill we sense 
the minister's involvement in the bank's administration. The 
minister appoints the chairperson of the board and the president. 
Speaking of instruments, the government seems to be creating 
an instrument for dispensing patronage. According to clause 21, 
the minister will be able to control the bank's functions by using 
his influence with the people he appointed, perhaps by 
persuading them to approve loans in cases where they would 
have been reluctant to do so. That is a real danger.
<P>
	In Quebec under the Liberals, they gave $950 million over ten 
years to the Société de développement industriel as a political 
favour, which often happens just before an election. The Premier 
intervenes and says: You are going to approve this loan.
<P>
	People appointed at the pleasure of the minister or the Prime 
Minister do not dare refuse and so grant the loan, which they 
would not otherwise have done. Gradually, Quebec was left with 
a bill for $950 million because of principles just as laudable as 
those our colleagues opposite were talking about: helping 
development and helping small and medium size business 
become big business.
<P>
	This new mission does not come about because of popular 
demand. We saw no one come before Parliament demanding a 
change in the purpose of the Federal Business Development 
Bank. The whole idea came from ministers' offices, the Privy 
Council, old friends who got talking and decided to change the 
vocation of the bank. We are creating an instrument of 
patronage.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry, it being 5.30 
p.m., the House will now proceed to the consideration of Private 
Members' Business as listed on today's Order Paper.

	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should begin 
consultations with the provinces and territories to establish the parameters for a 
national registry of drugs, medical devices (implanted in the body for more than 
one year) and various forms of biotechnology.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	She said: Madam Speaker, I am pleased to move this private 
members' motion today calling for a national registry of drugs 
and implanted medical devices.
<P>
	Many Canadians assume that any such drugs or medical 
devices that are used are safe and have been well tested. I am 
sure that in the majority of cases this is true, but there are some 
glaring exceptions which I will discuss later in my speech.
<P>
	The motion under discussion today is taken directly from a 
1992 report by a House of Commons subcommittee on the status 
of women entitled: ``Breast Cancer: Unanswered Questions''. 
While at the time the motion was meant to address the problems 
associated only with breast implants, the subcommittee 
recognized that a registry of many other medical devices would 
be a great step forward in protecting Canadian consumers. 
L'Association coopérative d'économie familiale du centre de 
Montréal made a call for a similar type of registry at that time.
<P>
	I would like to say at the beginning that a national registration 
system would have to be voluntary and that privacy laws would 
have to be respected. At this point, we would be looking at 
something that both physicians and patients would have the 
choice to participate in.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14345"> 14345 </A></B>
<P>
	Why do we need to consider such a national registry? What 
would it do for Canadian consumers? There are two issues. The 
first is that a national registry of medical devices would allow 
men and women who experience problems to notify a central 
data bank and document their complaints. The 1992 
subcommittee suggested that Statistics Canada might be used 
to house such a registry.
<P>
	The second value of such a registry is for those who might 
have some complaints about a drug or device to simply note who 
is on such a registry and do not necessarily have complaints. 
That would increase the long term safety of consumers by 
putting in place mechanisms to notify patients of potential 
problems or complications that arose or knowledge that came 
forward after the use of such drugs or devices.
<P>
	As well, a registry could assist physicians in tracking those 
patients who may have experienced problems. It would open the 
door to more expansive research studies that could help to 
protect consumers.
<P>
	At the moment, one of the problems is that there is no central 
data bank for researchers to collate information on people who 
may have had either devices or drugs. This kind of information 
is extremely important to consumers. It is an opportunity also 
for physicians to pass on new information to patients that may 
come to light and to better access long term risks and advantages 
of such medical practices. A national registry could certainly 
help Canadians to make more informed choices about their 
medical treatment and the options available to them.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	If we look at the Canadian experience with medical devices 
and compare that to other consumer practices, it is clear that the 
Canadian system for medical devices lacks some basic 
resources. Canadian consumers can register complaints about 
automobiles, business transactions and the houses they buy. 
However, there is still no comprehensive and central system in 
place for things like breast implants, heart valves, pacemakers 
or other medical devices and drugs people use.
<P>
	With new technologies and new drug products coming on the 
market all of the time, it is increasingly important that 
consumers have an opportunity to access information on the 
possible complications and risk factors associated with these 
new devices and drugs. As it now stands the monitoring of 
medical devices in this country is based on the notion of 
voluntary compliance by the manufacturer. In other words the 
manufacturers will comply voluntarily with both health and 
welfare regulations and the parameters of their own health 
standards.
<P>
	Ultimate responsibility for the safety and efficacy of medical 
devices rests on the assurances that manufacturers provide to 
Health and Welfare Canada. The role of Health and Welfare 
Canada is still largely an auditing role to ensure that market tests 
and studies have been carried out by the manufacturers.
<P>
	Many Canadians probably assume and not necessarily 
correctly, that there are independent studies done by Health and 
Welfare Canada on the whole range of medical technology, but 
on the whole its role has been to monitor and to assess. It is the 
role of Health and Welfare Canada to ensure the safety of 
Canadians. The government obviously has to have 
responsibility for giving Canadians confidence in the kinds of 
medical devices and medications they take.
<P>
	Although there are many successes in the Canadian system for 
monitoring such medical procedures, there are some instances 
and some very serious ones that clearly indicate how the system 
has broken down. One issue that is currently in the news is that 
of breast implants which has been discussed in the House many 
times.
<P>
	Members will know that just yesterday a settlement against 
the American manufacturer of the Meme implant was reached 
on behalf of Quebec and Ontario women through a class action 
suit. It has been a long time in coming and of course it is still one 
more step in the battle of Canadian women for compensation. 
What is important in both the Dow Corning decision in the 
United States and the Bristol Myers decision is the fact that 
settlements have been made. This indicates that the 
manufacturer is accepting some responsibility and admits that 
these medical devices did cause problems to some of the women 
who used them.
<P>
	My office spoke to a lawyer involved in the case just recently 
settled. He pointed out that one problem is that only the women 
involved in the class action suit benefited. There is no way of 
knowing if other women in Ontario or Quebec might have 
benefited who might have been a part of that case if there had 
been some way to contact them and make the resources available 
to them.
<P>
	It is estimated, and it is just an estimation, that there are about 
150,000 women across Canada who have received a breast 
implant since their introduction in the mid-1970s. They made 
that choice on the advice of physicians, governments and 
manufacturers that the implants were safe. Women were 
routinely told not only that they were safe, and I am talking now 
specifically about the silicone gel implants, but that they would 
also last a lifetime and there would be no problems.
<P>
<B>(1740 ) </B>
<P>
	I might also add that there are now options to those silicone 
gel implants. The same assurances are being given and with the 
same lack of real data on the health risks associated with these 
implants.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14346"> 14346 </A></B>
<P>
	For many women unfortunately the safety factor has not met 
the reassurances given by the manufacturer. For many it has 
been a nightmare. If members had been at many of the meetings 
I attended, they would have heard about women who had 
suffered a number of medical problems from outright rejection 
of implants causing massive infections to scarring. In some 
cases, women are reporting a variety of physical symptoms 
from chronic fatigue to autoimmune diseases. Even more, 
women are having difficulty in having their symptoms 
recognized as being legitimate symptoms. Many women were 
referred for psychiatric and psychological services. Their 
complaints were not taken seriously.
<P>
	It was only when women came together that they began to 
realize their experience was not unique. Finding out there were 
other women who had similar experiences, they were able to 
approach physicians to tell them that there was a common thread 
and a problem. However, as in many areas of women's health, 
often the symptoms women present are not taken seriously. 
Looking at this simply in financial terms, the cost of multiple 
operations, the psychiatric and psychological counselling, apart 
from the personal devastation to these women who have had 
problems with the implants, is phenomenal to the health care 
system.
<P>
	As the research has continued it is clear there are many 
symptoms including fatigue, skin lesions and neurological 
dysfunction that many women have experienced.
<P>
	Just last month an Alberta study of 2,500 women with silicone 
gel implants reported preliminary findings showing a link 
between the implants and the way that a woman's body 
processes fat. I believe later this summer a report is expected on 
the association of implants and autoimmune diseases.
<P>
	There clearly is a demonstrable connection between the 
implants and the complications reported by women. These court 
cases which we have seen successfully settled in favour of the 
women underline that there clearly was a problem. Long before 
we had to prove a problem this is where we come to the 
importance of adequate research being done, adequate data 
being kept and the responsibility of the federal government's 
health protection branch to ensure that Canadians are adequately 
protected in these areas.
<P>
	In the case of the breast implants, there are still a lot of 
outstanding questions. There certainly is some dispute among 
physicians and researchers as to exactly what the effects have 
been. Of course there are women who have not had any 
symptoms. Having said that, I think this is one of the reasons 
that a national registry is so important. It could be useful in 
helping women to answer some of the questions they have about 
this issue.
<P>
	Despite all the evidence women have had countless 
symptoms. Those symptoms while being increasingly 
recognized are still by no means accepted by all physicians and 
all of those involved in the field. To the  personal and family 
lives of those women, the trauma they have suffered both 
psychologically and physically is very real.
<P>
	We do not really know how many people have experienced 
complications because adequate mechanisms are not in place to 
monitor complications or long term effects of these and other 
implanted devices. Consequently, there is no way to adequately 
and specifically identify the number of implants done and those 
that are in use at this time, the possible range of problems or 
indeed the level of satisfaction associated with these devices.
<P>
	A national registry such as is proposed in this motion would 
go a long way to helping women assess their risks not only for 
silicone gel implants but also for the new versions, such as the 
saline implants now on the market.
<P>
<B>(1745 ) </B>
<P>
	Today I have used the example of the breast implant to 
highlight the importance of a national registry system. Clearly 
the system would be a great benefit for consumers in other 
instances as well. It would help researchers track patients over a 
long period of time in order to provide for a clearer database for 
better research. It would give Canadian men and women a 
greater opportunity to access information and to be aware of 
potential problems.
<P>
	There has been much written on the issue of health care in 
Canada, specifically about the increasing lack of confidence 
people have in the ability of the federal government to ensure 
the safety of drugs and products routinely used. The breast 
implant issue came to the House only as a result of certain 
members' raising the issue; they made it an issue. The Minister 
of Health at the time finally after much discussion and a lot of 
pressure did put in place a moratorium.
<P>
	All this took place after the federal drug administration in the 
United States had made its findings. Most people may agree we 
are very reliant on the research of other countries to determine 
the level of safety for products used in Canada.
<P>
	I do not want to suggest for a moment the health protection 
branch and its members are in some way at fault for this. 
Funding cutbacks to the system have affected the testing of new 
devices and drugs on the market with a greater reliance on 
secondary research as opposed to primary research by the 
department.
<P>
	There is no doubt in the minds of Canadians they rely on the 
federal government, the department of health and welfare, the 
health promotion branch and the health protection branch to 
ensure certain standards. Most Canadians probably assume any 
product in this area which they take or is implanted has gone 
through a rigorous set of tests and is safe without question. It 
would be naive to assume anything can be safe without question 
since it is not a perfect science.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14347"> 14347 </A></B>
<P>
	I urge support support for this motion. It is not a panacea to 
all the things that need to be done to ensure greater safety for 
the Canadian consumer in health related areas but it would be 
a positive step toward the protection of consumers, access to 
information and providing and assisting the maintenance of a 
database which would assist in the research of long term 
consequences.
<P>
	I hope all parliamentarians will seriously consider this issue. I 
hope the Minister of Health will seriously consider this issue. It 
would be in the interest of all Canadians, men and women, and 
would provide Canadians with greater faith in our medical 
system.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, the motion placed before the 
House by the member for Yukon is certainly worth considering. 
Any proposal that would contribute to maintaining and 
improving the health and safety of Canadians deserves 
thoughtful discussion.
<P>
	There is some ambiguity in the member's motion. Does the 
hon. member want a national registry of drugs and devices or a 
national registry of patient profiles and adverse reactions to 
those drugs and devices or both?
<P>
	The fundamental question regardless of what the member 
means is would setting up a national registry of drugs, medical 
devices and various forms of biotechnology protect the health of 
Canadians better than the system we have in place? Before we 
review that system we should consider the context of the 
motion.
<P>
	In 1992 a resolution by the subcommittee on the status of 
women called for such a registry. In its report, ``Breast Cancer: 
Unanswered Questions'', the subcommittee said one of the 
problems with breast implants in particular and medical devices 
in general is adequate mechanisms are not in place to monitor 
the complications and long term effects of implanted devices. 
The resolution called for a national patient adverse reaction 
registry through which patients would be able to register any 
problems, complications or ill effects.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	No one disputes this but the resolution on which the motion is 
based was conceived in response to a specific problem, the need 
for women to have accurate information regarding the use of 
breast implants.
<P>
	The subcommittee had heard wrenching testimony by women 
who said they had been scarred and made ill as a result of breast 
implant surgery. In its report the subcommittee concluded a 
crucial factor for women facing these decisions was the need for 
accurate information regarding the risks and possible 
complications associated with the use of implants, hence the 
idea of a national registry.
<P>
	The report says: ``We see the lack of such a registry as a major 
inadequacy in our current system. Without such a mechanism 
physicians and surgeons can easily lose track of patients who 
have breast or other implants. This complicates their ability to 
pass the new or emerging information on possible problems with 
implants''.
<P>
	This specific resolution and the motion go well beyond 
implants to take in drugs and various forms of biotechnology. 
Whatever the merits of a registry for breast implants, Canadian 
women and Canadians in general are at present well served when 
it comes to the safety and efficacy of medical drugs and devices.
<P>
	Many Canadians and the hon. member may be unfamiliar with 
the co-operative system administered by federal, provincial and 
territorial governments which ensures medical drugs available 
in Canada are safe, effective and of high quality. I will limit my 
remarks to mostly drugs, and my hon. colleague will discuss 
devices.
<P>
	The department's health protection branch through its drugs 
directorate not only approves all drugs offered for sale in 
Canada before they go on the market but monitors their use after 
they are on the market so that any drugs sold in Canada must 
meet the requirements of the food and drugs regulations.
<P>
	Once a drug has met these requirements the department issues 
a notice of compliance, an NOC, and assigns a drug 
identification number, a DIN, to the drug. The drug directorate 
maintains a database that includes information on all the drug 
products assigned and the identification number. This database 
now contains information on approximately 22,000 drug 
products sold in Canada.
<P>
	In addition, Health Canada makes information on drug 
products sold in Canada available to the public in a variety of 
ways, including the drug directorate's electronic bulletin board 
system which we can access through modem. The building 
blocks of a national drug registry are already in place through 
the co-operation of all three levels of government.
<P>
	In addition to registering drugs and giving public 
information, the drugs directorate through its bureau of drug 
surveillance promotes and supports the safe and rational use of 
drugs after they enter the market and are in the public domain. 
This bureau ensures drugs are manufactured according to 
regulations and internationally recognized good manufacturing 
practices and standards, ensuring the safety of market drugs.
<P>
	An important part of the bureau of drug surveillance is the 
adverse drug reaction monitoring program. Canada has had a 
system to gather information on adverse drug reactions since 
1965. Under this program health professionals report adverse 
drug reactions voluntarily. Reporting by pharmaceutical 
manufacturers is subject to control by the Food and Drugs Act 
and regulations.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14348"> 14348 </A></B>
<P>
	To enhance the value of spontaneous reporting in Canada the 
adverse drug reaction program has established a series of 
regional reporting centres across the country, serving as a front 
line for this reporting program.
<P>
	There are four centres fully operational right now: the B.C. 
adverse reporting centre located at the drug and poison 
information centre at St. Paul's hospital in Vancouver; the 
Saskatchewan adverse drug reporting centre located at the drug 
information centre at the University of Saskatchewan's college 
of pharmacy; the regional drug information service for the 
Atlantic region at Camp Hill hospital in Halifax; the Quebec 
regional adverse drug reaction centre located at the Centre 
d'information pharmaceutique at Hôpital du Sacré Coeur de 
Montréal.
<P>
	However, in my experience as a physician I believe voluntary 
reporting may not be as accurate as it should be. There should be 
mandatory reporting by physicians of adverse drug reactions.
<P>
	What I am really trying to say is this building block will 
provide the basis for future evolution of national drug programs.
<P>
<B>(1755 ) </B>
<P>
	The initiatives involve the federal, provincial and territorial 
governments as well as industry and a number of professional 
health organizations, including the Canadian Co-Ordinating 
Office for Health Technology Assessment, CCOHTA, the 
Canadian Institute for Health Information and the Patented 
Medicines Review Board. CCOHTA is an excellent example of 
the way the federal, provincial and territorial ministries of 
health work together and jointly fund it. CCOHTA collects, 
analyses, creates and disseminates information concerning the 
effectiveness and cost of technology and its impact on health.
<P>
	Currently CCOHTA is conducting pharmaceutical 
evaluations to provide information on the relative therapeutic 
and economic value of medicines and alternatives.
<P>
	Referring back to the original resolution on which the motion 
is based, we can safely say that when it comes to medical drugs 
we do have national mechanisms in place to ensure our medical 
drugs are safe and effective. Patients and physicians are 
educated about the side effects and use, and adverse effects are 
reported, albeit voluntarily, which is the weak link in a very 
strong national chain.
<P>
	Would mandatory reporting by physicians of adverse drug 
reactions instead of the current voluntary system be the only 
step needed to put in place a complete system of drug and 
medical device safety? If so, the question to be asked of the hon. 
member is whether this motion is redundant.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise today to speak to motion M-375 brought 
forward by the hon. member for the Yukon. This motion 
proposes that the government begin consultations with the 
provinces and territories to establish the parameters for a 
national registry of drugs, medical devices implanted in the 
body for more than one year and various forms of 
biotechnology.
<P>
	This motion deals mainly with the serious problem of breast 
implants and the deleterious effects they have on the health of 
those women who have them.
<P>
	An estimated 150,000 women, in Canada and Quebec, have 
had silicone breast implant surgery between 1969 and 1992. 
Approximately 75 per cent of these implants were for purely 
aesthetic reasons, and the remaining 25 per cent for 
post-surgical reconstruction of the breast. Although the use of 
breast implants is strictly voluntary in both cases, medical 
considerations compounded with cultural factors turn this 
procedure into a complex source of concern for women's health.
<P>
	Today, many women are confronted daily with the disastrous 
results of silicone leaking into their body. These leaks cause 
immune deficiencies. The implants contract and the body tries 
to reject this foreign substance, creating massive scar tissue.
<P>
	Some women develop problems like the hardening of their 
breasts, chest pain or loss of sensitivity. Others have more 
systemic problems like pain in the joints, kidney trouble, 
infections, sclerosis, chronic fatigue, etc. All these 
complications are part of what we now call the silicone-related 
syndrome.
<P>
	Canadian women are worried. Some scientists still refuse to 
admit the dangerous effects of silicone. Officials and 
representatives of the federal health department do recognize 
that some women with breast implants experience health 
problems, but they quickly add that no link has yet been proven 
between these health problems and the fact that they have 
received these silicone-filled prostheses. However, the 
potential health hazard of silicone has been a proven fact for a 
long time now. Hundreds of American women have sued and 
won their case against the makers of silicone gel breast 
implants; American courts have recognized that this product is 
dangerous and the victims have received substantial 
compensation.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	In 1992, the House of Commons Sub-committee on the Status 
of Women released a report entitled <I>Breast Cancer: Unanswered 
Questions</I>. Although this study was originally on breast cancer 
and the breast implant that was called Même at the time, 
developments on silicone-based implants led the 
sub-committee to expand its study and to make several very 
significant recommendations concerning breast implants.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14349"> 14349 </A></B>
<P>
	One of the greatest problems the sub-committee recognized 
was the lack of a satisfactory mechanism for monitoring the 
development of complications and the long term effects of these 
objects implanted in our body. So, it is now impossible to tell 
the number of breast implants that were used, the range of 
potential problems or the rate of satisfaction with these 
implants.
<P>
	The lack of a national registry is a major flaw in the current 
medical system. Doctors and surgeons may easily lose track of 
people with breast or other implants, and this limits their ability 
to give their patients new information or updates on problems 
that may arise from these implants.
<P>
	It also makes it impossible to follow up on patients for 
prolonged periods to produce the scientific data bases required 
for proper methodological research. A national registry would 
also make it possible to identify problems and complications 
related to implants or inquire about the incidence of 
complications related to the use of implants and other medical 
procedures.
<P>
	At present, consumers can lodge complaints about business 
transactions, cars they buy or service contracts, but surprisingly 
enough, there is no equivalent for products such as breast 
implants, cardiac valves, artificial hip joints and what not.
<P>
	This recommendation to establish a national registry is not 
new. It has already been made by several groups. For example, 
ACEF, the Montreal Association coopérative d'économie 
familiale, published a report on breast implants last year. In it, 
ACEF again urged Health Canada to provide women with 
adequate information on the subject and to establish a national 
registry of women with silicone gel breast implants to facilitate 
and ensure efficient medical follow-up.
<P>
	In a study conducted in 1992, the Sub-committee on the 
Status of Women made further recommendations. It felt that 
``women have a fundamental right to accurate information 
regarding the risks and possible complications associated with 
the use of implants''.
<P>
	The sub-committee recommended that the Canadian Society 
of Plastic Surgeons and the Canadian Society for Aesthetic 
Surgery prepare in coordination with the appropriate 
government officials information sheets that accurately reflect 
current knowledge and debate around the possible effects of 
breast implants.
<P>
	The sub-committee also requested that the federal 
government, in co-operation with the provinces, identify 
alternatives to breast implants and outline the conditions under 
which such surgery should be considered.
<P>
	To develop properly, society cannot do without women or 
ignore women's issues and the problems they face.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	Women's health is one of the factors which have a direct 
bearing on the place of women in our society. Here, as 
elsewhere, we must take effective action.  Women's health has 
always been neglected. There is never enough money allocated 
for research are always inadequate. There are major problems 
with research related to breast cancer, gynaecology and 
obstetrics, chronic and degenerative diseases, mental health, 
violence, occupational diseases, particular needs of immigrants 
and ethnic groups, teenagers, elderly women, etc.
<P>
	When she first took office, the Minister of Health explained 
how she intended to promote women's health. She told us about 
the programs which her government was going to implement to 
correct the imbalance affecting women in the health care 
system. So far, not much has been done. When will a true health 
program will be developed for women?
<P>
	If the Minister really cares about women's health, now is the 
time to act and support motion M-375. In doing so, she would 
make a concrete step toward that goal.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, the motion 
is fairly broad and the mover actually took some pains to narrow 
the focus of her motion. I am going to do the same. I have respect 
for the mover. The member for Yukon has a significant and 
specific interest in this subject.
<P>
	The hon. member did take the time to focus on silicone breast 
implants and went on to say that this motion would be a 
voluntary motion where physicians and patients would 
voluntarily comply, that it would help with notification and the 
tracking of those individuals who had medical device problems.
<P>
	If we look carefully at the issue of silicone breast implants we 
could say that a registry of these devices would have been a help 
in tracking those women who had them implanted. As it turned 
out it was consumer groups that took up the slack, women who 
had advocacy groups set up to take that information. Today that 
is still the case. Whether a government registry would have been 
the most cost efficient and best mechanism for this, I am not 
convinced. I leave that as a question I cannot answer.
<P>
	As the member spoke about silicone breast implants, she 
suggested that it was the FDA in the U.S. that was really the 
instigator of our regulatory process here in Canada. Because this 
is a subject of great personal interest to me, I went back and 
researched very carefully the genesis of this problem. I am not 
sure I agree with the member on this specific issue. Let me tell 
this House what I found on silicone breast implants.
<P>
	One of the very first individuals in the world who expressed 
concern about silicone breast implants was a scientist of our 
Canadian HPB. This scientist went to the manufacturer of the 
Meme implant and found manufacturing techniques that he said 
were completely unacceptable for a device to be implanted in 
the human body. He came home to Canada and made that public 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14350"> 14350 </A></B>
<P>
over a fair portion of time. I have copies of his original  memo 
saying that he had grave reservations and he advised the HPB to 
discontinue the certificate of compliance for the Meme implant.
<P>
	What happened to that scientist? He was fired. The HPB, 
through pressures that went beyond the scientific data, fired 
him. That scientist, a Canadian, was not at all convinced that he 
was wrong and he went to the FDA in the United States and 
asked if it had any concerns. He was personally instrumental in 
getting the FDA to move toward the moratorium that 
subsequently was established.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	If members who were not part of the debate in this House on 
the breast implant issue want to go back and look at a fascinating 
series of documents, I invite them to do that. It sounds like a spy 
story with manufacturers making claims, the health minister 
making promises, the regulators involved in the middle and 
finally, a big moratorium established. Most people know the 
subsequent events of the manufacturers having been accused of 
some inappropriate behaviour and lawsuits are now on the table.
<P>
	I go back to the regulatory process. A scientist in a very good 
department said there was a problem and he was fired. What has 
happened to him since? Has he been honoured in Canada? Has he 
been elevated on a pedestal as a hero of the regulatory process? 
Not a chance. Today that scientist is still vilified by his record 
from HPB.
<P>
	I think that someday Dr. Pierre Blais will stand in this 
Chamber to be recognized for his contribution to the health of 
women in this country. Someday he will be recognized for the 
visionary scientist that he was, the man who put his reputation 
on the line, who put his avocation on the line, who said that it is 
more important to tell the truth than it is to go through a process 
of saying that it is okay.
<P>
	I direct all my comments to: Is our regulatory process in 
Canada effective and efficient? Is it the best regulatory process? 
Politicians, and I include myself in this group, should only be 
certain the regulators are doing their job.
<P>
	I have watched with great interest BST. What is happening to 
BST? It has become a political hot potato. Forces from three 
different directions are coming at us on BST.
<P>
	I simply say that when members of Parliament start to think 
they are scientists, that they are regulators, they are stepping 
beyond their purview. We, as politicians, should be making sure 
the regulatory process is perfect, as best as it can be. When the 
scientists make their decision to make certain that new data, new 
information is readily available to them, then politicians should 
get out of the regulatory process.
<P>
	I considered this motion carefully. I have not decided fixed in 
my own mind that all the things this motion asks for would be 
suitable for Canada. I do believe that a registry of medical 
devices makes good sense and I will limit my support to that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am very pleased to speak this afternoon on Motion 
M-375 moved by the hon. member for Yukon.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	More than one million Canadians have some type of 
surgically implanted medical device. Some implants such as 
heart valves and pacemakers are life sustaining devices. The 
recipients will not survive without them. Other implants, such 
as intraocular lenses, joint replacements and breast prostheses 
improve the quality of life.
<P>
	In considering the merits of a registry of implant patients, let 
me first discuss the question of therapeutic implants.
<P>
	Recent widely publicized problems with some implants, such 
as heart valves, pacemakers and teflon coated jaw implants have 
highlighted the need to track implant recipients so that they can 
be quickly notified by their physicians in case of serious 
problems.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A better option would be to set up a national registry of 
medical devices implanted in the body, similar to the one 
already in existence in England for high risk cardiac implants.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	Such a registry would provide all the required information to 
track down the patient.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
It would also provide additional data needed to develop risk 
management strategies and valuable feedback, including earlier 
warnings about device failures to clinicians, manufacturers, 
Health Canada, and provincial health ministries.
<P>
	A national registry could be administered by a board of 
directors made up of representatives from the implanting 
surgeons, manufacturers, Health Canada, and provincial 
ministries of health. The board will be responsible for managing 
the collection, storage, analysis, and dissemination of the data. 
All information in the registry will be deemed confidential. To 
protect the privacy of registered patients rules will have to be 
established by the board of directors for the use and release of 
information contained in the registry.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14351"> 14351 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	There is strong support for the creation of such a registry from 
the Canadian Orthopaedic Association and the Ontario cardiac 
care network. Medical device manufacturers have also shown a 
keen interest, because this registry would allow them to meet 
mandatory standards on the replacement of medical devices.
<P>
	In short, what is being suggested is the creation of a new 
program to improve the follow-up on all implants and medical 
devices used in the human body.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Since medical services are delivered and funded by the 
provinces and territories, the authority of the different levels of 
government to require patients to register or to require surgeons 
to register their patients will have to be explored, as will the 
authority to collect change of address information from 
provincial or federal records. The federal government could 
coordinate the involvement of provincial health ministries 
across Canada to ensure that the registry will meet the 
requirements of all participants.
<P>
	The major drawback of the establishment of implant 
registries has been the lack of money. The start-up costs would 
be about $200,000. These will include the costs to develop the 
computer database program and data entry forms, negotiating 
participation in the registry, setting up a board of directors, 
developing a long-range plan and operating procedures, and 
establishing longterm funding.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Since about one million Canadians now have implants or 
medical devices, the annual costs would be $20 million.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Maintenance of a registry of implant patients is estimated to 
cost about $20 per patient per year. There are approximately one 
million Canadians with medical device implants, resulting in a 
total annual cost of $20 million.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Cost sharing will have to be considered with the federal 
government, the provinces and territories, manufacturers and 
patients.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The medical device industry and the provincial governments 
already spend resources on implant monitoring. It may be 
possible to redirect these funds to a national implant registry.
<P>
	Let me now address the special case of a registry for breast 
implant patients.
<P>
	In 1992 the Minister of Health instituted a moratorium on the 
use of silicone gel breast implants and commissioned an 
independent advisory committee to examine their safety. One of 
the key recommendations made by the committee in April 1992 
was to create a national registry of breast implants. The proposal 
was for a confidential continuing registry of consenting 
recipients of breast implants in Canada.
<P>
	Since most cosmetic surgery is not funded by provincial 
health insurance plans and provinces would therefore not have 
health records on breast augmentation procedures, the only way 
to collect information on such patients will be by voluntary 
participation of the patients.
<P>
	It was recommended that start-up funding be provided by 
manufacturers and that the registry be operated by a national not 
for profit organization.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The initial cost of this national registry could be anywhere 
between $120,000 and $190,000, with an estimate of 5,000 new 
patients each year. After that, annual operating costs could be 
covered by a $10 registration fee.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The drawbacks that will be encountered in setting up a breast 
implant registry are the difficulty in the collection of patient 
information and inaccurate patient information, since many 
breast implant recipients do not know the type of implant they 
have or the manufacturer. These deficiencies will limit the 
usefulness of the registry.
<P>
	After completing its preliminary assessment of the issue, the 
department believed it was not feasible to implement a breast 
implant registry for recipients who had surgery more than a few 
years ago because of the high cost and inherent difficulties in 
collecting complete and accurate information.
<P>
	In summary, a registry for patients with therapeutic implants 
that is funded by provincial health insurance plans will have 
advantages for federal and provincial regulatory agencies, 
manufacturers and patients, provided that financial, legal, and 
organizational problems can be solved.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The benefits of such a national registry would be: a very quick 
way to trace the women concerned, when problems are 
discovered following the insertion of such implants; the 
gathering of useful data on the value of such products for 
clinical practitioners, manufacturers, Health Canada, as well as 
the health departments of the provinces and territories. 
Moreover, it would be possible to analyze the long term 
evolution of these implants.

	The House resumed consideration of Bill C-91, an act to 
continue the Federal Business Development Bank under the 
name Business Development Bank of Canada, as reported (with 
amendments) from the Committee; and of Motions Nos. 1 to 6 
and 26 to 33.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Resuming debate. The 
hon. member for Chambly. You have seven minutes left.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
thank you for giving me the floor again.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
rise on a point of order. If I understood the Chair correctly, you 
said we would resume debate on the second set of motions. That 
suits the government quite well, but is it the second set or are we 
going back to Group No. 1?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry. It is Group 
No. 1.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> Madam Speaker, I was thanking you for giving me 
the floor after interrupting me so abruptly earlier. I do 
acknowledge your sense of fairness.
<P>
	Earlier, before I was interrupted, I was saying that this new 
Business Development Bank of Canada will be used for 
patronage and propaganda purposes, including the promotion of 
federalism by the members opposite. I urge them not to make the 
same mistakes as did the former Quebec government with the 
Société de développement industriel. Indeed, we recently 
learned-with the arrival of a responsible provincial party in 
office-that $950 million had been wasted on all kinds of 
unnecessary projects, because of the intervention of some 
ministers who were urging the corporation to grant loans which 
should never have been made. However, because of the authority 
exerted then by the responsible minister, or the Quebec Premier, 
over that agency, it ran up a bill of $959 million. So, there is a 
real danger.
<P>
	That danger also exists with Bill C-91 now before us. For 
example, if you look at clause 6, you will see that the minister 
appoints the chairperson and president.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	I am tempted to say that I support this bill, because it will 
make the number of independentists swell. Indeed, this is the 
kind of legislation which explains why an independentist such 
as myself is here to speak on  Quebec's behalf. I have seen too 
many measures like this one.
<P>
	I read literally every bill tabled in this House and I realize that 
the government, although it has not publicly said it and will not 
do so, is currently trying to destabilize the provinces and really 
infringe on fields of provincial jurisdiction. I am not referring 
only to Quebec. The other provinces are also affected. However, 
the danger is greater for Quebec than for the English speaking 
provinces, because the infringing authority if you will is 
English-speaking.
<P>
	Westerners and easterners recognize this government as their 
primary government, while Quebecers, because of their 
different language as well as other factors such as culture, 
consider the Quebec government their primary government. The 
fact is that the Quebec government did not only do bad things, 
quite the contrary. Just think of the Quebec Deposit and 
Investment Fund, created in 1964. We literally got rid of the 
Canadian capitalists who were using the pension plans of 
Quebec workers, both in the public and the private sectors. 
Some people have become immensely rich playing with the 
money of others like that, without our governments paying any 
attention to the security of the investments made.
<P>
	So, the Quebec Deposit and Investment Fund was established, 
as well as the General Investment Corporation of Quebec. The 
government has created several instruments that have met their 
objectives. We now have before us Bill C-91, with its Federal 
Business Development Bank renamed Business Development 
Bank of Canada. When we say that there is duplication in 
personnel, that is what is happening. One can only wonder what 
changing the role of the FBDB to give it complementary status is 
meant to achieve.
<P>
	I can remember, back in my days as a notary, when I was very 
involved with business financing, seeing people go to the FBDB 
although their investment was no less safe than others. The bank 
refused to lend money when it knew the project would not get off 
the ground. The exception, I must admit, was slightly out of the 
ordinary projects, where the entrepreneur wanted to set up a 
business in an area less familiar to traditional bankers but still 
had a fair chance of being successful. Then, the FBDB got 
involved.
<P>
	We are now debating a bill to turn it into a complementary 
bank. We know the criteria used by banks. For instance, in 
business financing, you do not lend more that 75 per cent of the 
investment value. Does complementary mean lending the 
remaining 25 per cent? Will the bank lend 75 per cent and the 
Business Development Bank the rest? I think not. At least, I 
hope not, because it would be terrible.
<P>
	Giving the bank this complementary status will mean that 
anyone who wants to market or commercialize a new product 
and, as a last resort after being refused everywhere, goes to the 
Business Development Bank will get the answer: ``Sorry, friend. 
Your application was rejected everywhere else. Even if we 
wanted to, we could not help you. We are no longer qualified''. I 
can understand giving a complementary role to this institution, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14353"> 14353 </A></B>
<P>
but it is a bit difficult to complement what does not exist in the 
first place.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	I do not want to accuse the people who tabled this bill of 
having bad intentions, but I do have to say that this will serve 
only to increase political intervention in loans, which would not 
have been granted by any other institution anyway. Talk about 
political intervention-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> I know that the hon. member for 
Broadview-Greenwood just yelled something, but I am not 
accusing him of having bad intentions, far from it. Sometimes, 
politicians, and especially politicians in power, feel the need to 
intervene in areas only because of the next election and in order 
to get the Canadian economy going, I think.
<P>
	Ministers are people too, like you and I, and they are not 
impervious to lobbying. Chairpersons and presidents are also 
human and also have to deal with ministers twisting their arms, 
saying: Think about it, in such and such a sector, in such a place, 
will you not reconsider your decision? Will you not thoroughly 
review the issue, to see whether you can swing it?
<P>
	If this were to happen, it could very well have unfortunate 
outcomes. I would have suggested that the chairman and the 
president be appointed by the House of Commons, by the 
government and not by the minister himself. Then, you and I 
would have to assume responsibility for the appointment. Then, 
in the future, if it did not work out, if we did not have a good 
president, we could blame everybody, not just a certain minister 
or hon. member. This was the issue I wanted to speak about.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it may be the first time since I have been a 
member of this House that we have actually been critical of 
name changes. Usually, this is a mere technicality. A name will 
be changed to make it a little more modern or more precise, but 
in this case, when we see the Federal Business Development 
Bank being renamed as the Business Development Bank of 
Canada, it is clearly all part of this vast strategy of a federal 
government that has decided, in its wisdom, that it is going to 
run the show.
<P>
	I would put this on a par with the agreement on internal trade 
in Canada, where again, a bill is being used to let the federal 
government penalize the provinces that do not comply with the 
agreement by cutting funding in their social programs, and I am 
referring to Bill C-76, where in any case it wants to intervene in 
sectors that are not its responsibility. In the case of the bank, 
which is going to be the Business Development Bank of Canada, 
if the House ever passes this bill, personally, I think the name is 
rather pretentious.
<P>
	Canada has quite a few financial institutions that are involved 
in development. There are other banking institutions that may be 
involved in a positive and occasionally in a negative way in 
development and which are very much part of the process. There 
cannot be just one business development bank of Canada, unless 
there is more than meets the eye here.
<P>
	I am also somewhat amazed at the direction in which this bill 
is going. During the first few months I was in the House, I was a 
member of the industry committee. At the time, members from 
Ontario were looking for ways to make the banks more sensitive 
to the problems of small entrepreneurs. They were interested to 
see what Quebec had in the way of institutions that provide 
complementary financing. I am thinking for instance of the 
Centre d'aide aux entreprises, the Mouvement Desjardins, the 
FTQ Fonds de solidarité-the CNTU is about to develop a 
similar fund.
<P>
	It was clear Ontario had had a difficult time during the last 
recession and there was this feeling of hostility towards the 
banks.
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	Now with this bill, this feeling seems to have disappeared. 
Does it mean that the bank lobby was successful? Does the fact 
that they contribute very generously to the Liberal Party of 
Canada make a difference? I do not know for sure, but there is 
something strange going on here.
<P>
	This decision also seems to be part of a broader strategy I 
would like to explain very briefly. When the Liberals came to 
power, there was a network referred to as business development 
centres. It was decided to amalgamate these with the community 
futures committees. Now that these two bodies have been 
amalgamated, they are attached directly to the Federal Office of 
Regional Development.
<P>
	Therefore, the whole community development element set up 
by the community futures committees will, in my opinion, lead 
to the systematic and progressive dropping of the community 
development mandate over the next few months, since the 
transfer to the FORD takes place on September 30.
<P>
	There was already one regional office per administrative 
region, but the Federal Office of Regional Development will try 
through the Business Development Bank of Canada to set up a 
network of branch offices to catch bigger service points across 
Canada in the web.
<P>
	What is particularly sad is that two networks are being set up 
in parallel, one beside the other. Neither Quebec nor Canada has 
the means to pay for a double network. A choice has to be made. 
Quebecers will have the opportunity this fall to decide once and 
for all who they want to serve them.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14354"> 14354 </A></B>
<P>
	Do they want Canadian banks-like the Royal Bank, for 
example? Is this the network we want to look after our interests 
in the future? Or do we want a network that belongs to us much 
more and that is under our complete control? We must not 
forget that Quebec has found itself in a very bad situation in 
relation to the federal government on a number of occasions 
in the past.
<P>
	What about the time they wanted to limit the number of CN 
shares that could be purchased. Each time Quebec capital tried 
to get in, it was foiled. This seems to be very much the approach 
of the Business Development Bank of Canada.
<P>
	Another rather paradoxical element in the current bill is that 
the government, which claims to be in favour of a free market 
environment, is directly infringing on the Mouvement 
Desjardins, among others, and the banking institutions. All of a 
sudden, the government takes a step backward and decides that 
there will be an additional competitor.
<P>
	Just what is this complementary loan? It is not very clear and 
we are not sure of the result which will be achieved. How will it 
be integrated into the Canadian banking system? One can 
understand the concerns of those who already corner the market.
<P>
	Before changing the mandate of an agency such as the Federal 
Business Development Bank, we must take a close look and see 
if we can afford more duplication. I doubt that there is a single 
Quebecer or Canadian who thinks so.
<P>
	If the federal government dismisses the solutions which will 
avoid such duplication and wants first and foremost to ensure its 
presence in every province and in every sector when there are 
already other stakeholders involved, it will only follow the 
pattern set a long time ago, particularly during the Trudeau 
years. Remember the sign war, when the federal and Quebec 
would each claim to have made the largest contribution to a 
given project.
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
	There was some kind of blackmail going on at that time, 
which we all paid for in a way. Today, answers are sought much 
more in terms of guidelines and comprehensive solutions. In 
that regard, this bill will not solve anything as it only increases 
duplication. What is happening here is the same thing that 
happened to the Federal Office of Regional Development a 
while ago. The FORD's mission was changed by taking away the 
resources that allowed it to play an active role in the Quebec 
economy, while at the same time increasing the number of 
service points, when services were already available from the 
Quebec ministries of tourism as well as Industry, Commerce and 
Technology.
<P>
	That is what happened to the FORD. The same thing is now 
happening to the Federal Business Development Bank, and I 
think this is a bad move on the part of the government. It reflects 
the old belief that Ottawa provides, that it has the answer to 
whatever problems the people of Quebec, British Columbia, the 
maritimes and elsewhere may have, when the fact of the matter 
is that tools are already in place in many regions.
<P>
	Therefore, the federal government should review its bill to 
make sure that it will not result in the interference that the 
implementation of the Business Development Bank of Canada 
Act will bring about.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to have an opportunity to speak in the debate this 
evening. I listened with interest when the hon. member for 
Broadview-Greenwood, the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Industry, made his presentation.
<P>
	I must say from the outset that for many years I have listened 
to my hon. colleague from Broadview-Greenwood and I have 
learned from much of what he has had to say. I have appreciated 
the sincerity he has always brought to the debate. I appreciate 
his personal commitment to small business and the funding 
plight it faces. I have never heard a more pathetic explanation in 
terms of why the government has done something.
<P>
	First I want to take him off the hook. I cannot imagine that 
what he was saying was his own idea. I can only assume that he 
has been given marching orders from cabinet. As an advocate of 
small business funding he has stood in the House for years 
urging the previous government and encouraging the present 
government to take action. He has led the way on a number of 
initiatives in terms of support for small business. He has been 
actively involved in the development of the report called 
``Funding for Small Business'' which had a whole set of 
recommendations. To make this proposal is not the kind of 
initiative he would take.
<P>
	When I first saw Bill C-91 I was elated. I was encouraged 
because after years and years of the Liberals saying we had to 
take dramatic action to provide funding for small business here 
was the opportunity. I read the bill. I suggest we should make 
another name change.
<P>
	The bill at the moment is entitled ``an act to continue the 
Federal Business Development Bank under the name Small 
Business Bank of Canada''. Probably a more accurate title 
would be an act to continue the Federal Business Development 
Bank with an inadequate mandate, with a pointless mandate, 
with a wimpy mandate. We could use whatever word we like 
because in my judgment we have missed a real opportunity, 
looking at Bill C-91.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14355"> 14355 </A></B>
<P>
	At the moment we are talking about the name change. Most 
members of Parliament were elated when they saw that the 
government had listened to the committee and had decided to 
call the Federal Business Development Bank the Small 
Business Bank of Canada. We could hear cheering from coast 
to coast to coast. We could hear small business organizations, 
chambers of commerce and boards of trade saying that finally 
the federal government had acknowledged the fact that 
something needed to be done in the country to provide funding 
for small enterprises.
<P>
	I am talking about the kind of enterprise that requires a 
$10,000, $20,000, $50,000, $75,000 or $100,000 loan. All of us 
have countless cases on our desks that we have worked on over 
the years. We know small enterprisers, small entrepreneurs or 
small business people have a difficult time obtaining capital for 
their operations, to start a new venture or to expand a venture. If 
they need $20,000 they might as well forget about it because 
they just cannot go to the traditional lending institutions, the big 
banks.
<P>
<B>(1845) </B>
<P>
	We are not here to assist the big banks. Headlines the last few 
days read: ``Banks on track to record profits. The earnings for 
the first half of 1995 exceed even last year's $4.25 billion 
pace''. In other words, the chartered banks are doing just fine. 
As a matter of fact they have never done so well. They can take 
care of the large enterprises, traditional enterprises and so on.
<P>
	However, we are not here to facilitate the chartered banks. 
They make profits for their shareholders and that is it. We 
understand their mandate. We are here as members of 
Parliament for something else. We are here to provide 
opportunities for that job creating sector of the economy called 
the small business sector.
<P>
	In my judgment, having looked at Bill C-91 for many days, 
clause by clause, we have missed an incredible opportunity. Part 
of the opportunity we have missed is betrayed by what the 
government is now asking us to do. It said it first came up with a 
winning idea based on the recommendations of the committee to 
call the FBDB the small business bank of Canada. I say, right on, 
government. It has done the right thing. However, it now says: 
``Hold it, we want to change that. We are going to call it the 
development bank of Canada''. What does that mean? What 
kind of a signal does that send?
<P>
	By changing the name of this bank, a tremendous cost will 
accrue to change every bank sign across the country, every 
letterhead, envelope, and all kinds of other things. It is going to 
cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, perhaps even millions, to 
call it the development bank. We do not need another 
development bank. We have the large chartered banks. We have 
other federal lending institutions that are able to provide that 
kind of capital. We need something to assist the small business 
sector. The name the small business bank of Canada would  
indicate a new initiative or a new direction or a new mandate for 
the FBDB. God knows it needs it.
<P>
	However, according to the legislation this is the purpose of 
the bank. It reads: ``The purpose of the bank is to provide 
Canadian entrepreneurship by providing financial and 
management services-in carrying out its activities. The bank 
must give particular consideration to the needs of small and 
medium size enterprises''.
<P>
	I have read wimpy legislation and legislation that meant 
absolutely nothing and this legislation says absolutely nothing. 
It states that the bank will give some consideration to small and 
medium size businesses. Well big, bloody deal. What does that 
mean? What kind of a mandate does that give the bank? What 
requirements does it give the bank? Absolutely none.
<P>
	What was going to be called the small business bank of 
Canada and not called the business development bank of Canada 
will be just like the Royal Bank of Canada or the Canadian 
Imperial Bank of Commerce. It will be lending to the very 
secure borrowers, the larger businesses and so on. Those small 
entrepreneurs and small business people will still have to be 
scraping and searching to find capital for their new enterprises. 
This is wrong. This is a missed opportunity.
<P>
	I wonder if there is any sensitivity to the fact that we have to 
encourage the bank to carry out a fair lending practice across 
Canada so that one region does not benefit over another. 
Acknowledging that 85 per cent of the new jobs in the future are 
going to be created by small businesses, will that same business 
be created in the eastern, central and western part of Canada? 
No, not with this legislation. Every single cent of this new bank 
could be put into one province, into one region, into a few cities. 
Is that the kind of bank we want? Absolutely not. It is a disgrace 
and a disappointment.
<P>
	I do not hold my hon. friend from Broadview-Greenwood 
responsible for this wimpy initiative. I hold the government and 
the cabinet responsible. I am pleased to see that representatives 
of the cabinet are here because they have not only done a 
disservice to the small enterprises of Canada, but they have done 
a disservice to the incredibly excellent work done by that 
committee which worked hard for months on end to incorporate 
diverse points of view and had an excellent set of 
recommendations. Then the cabinet and the minister said: ``We 
don't care about the work you have done. We don't care about 
the research that has been done. We don't care what the 
witnesses said. We want to simply put our stamp on this 
legislation''. That is wrong.
<P>
	I do not think this is a good piece of legislation. I do not think 
this is a good amendment. When I vote later tonight I am not 
going to be voting to do away with the name the small business 
bank of Canada and replace it with the business development 
bank of Canada. It is wrong and bad. It sends the wrong signal. It 
says we do  not care about those enterprises that create jobs, that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14356"> 14356 </A></B>
<P>
we want to continue to support the GMs, the Nova Corporations, 
the big corporations.
<P>
<B>(1850) </B>
<P>
	I know my friend across the way, the member for 
Broadview-Greenwood, was making a valiant attempt to 
explain the government's initiative when he said that the small 
business title limits and restricts loans, that the government 
wants to encourage the leading edge technologies to seek 
funding through this federal bank. So they should.
<P>
	The fact that small business does not exist in the present name 
does not preclude small businesses from seeking loans. Calling 
it a small business bank does not preclude a medium size 
business from seeking loans. We will do the entrepreneurial 
sector of Canada a disservice if we pass this amendment.
<P>
	I call on my colleagues from all sides of the House, from the 
Bloc, from the Reform and particularly those members of the 
government that have some sensitivity to small business and 
some respect for the work of the committee, to give some 
respect to the people that come into our offices day after day 
seeking capital to assist their small business enterprises. In 
other words, listen to the people just once.

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Group No. 2 includes 
Motions Nos. 7 to 11, but Motions Nos. 2 and 5 are not in that 
group. They were in Group No. 1 which we just dealt with.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Madam Speaker, Motions Nos. 2 and 5 are not 
among the motions which you mentioned earlier. Since these are 
motions tabled by a Bloc Quebecois member, we expected to 
vote in support of our two proposed amendments.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Motions Nos. 1 to 6 and 
26 to 33 are in Group No. 1.
<P>
<B>(1855) </B>
<P>
	A vote will be taken on Motions Nos. 2 and 5 if Motion No. 1 
is lost. These motions are included in Group No. 1. You may 
refer to the Speaker's ruling, which explains this clearly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Madam Speaker, from what I gather, this means 
that we will not have to vote on the two motions, unless two 
others, before them, are lost.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> That is correct. As I was 
saying, Motions Nos. 7 to 11, 14, 15 and 19 to 25 are in Group 
No. 2.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I am supposed to discuss Group No. 2 on behalf of the official 
opposition.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> You are right, dear 
colleague. I apologize.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rocheleau:</B> We are slowly but surely getting to the heart 
of the matter, Madam Speaker. This important bill will 
significantly change the operations of a Canadian institution 
which has proven successful, both from a financial point of 
view, as well as in terms of fulfilling the federal government's 
role.
<P>
	However, I draw your attention to the fact that the government 
is not only working in secret, but is also using misleading terms. 
The title of the bill itself is confusing and does not adequately 
inform the reader as to its scope.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14358"> 14358 </A></B>
<P>
	Indeed, Bill C-91, An Act to continue the Federal Business 
Development Bank under the name Business Development 
Bank of Canada, alludes to the new name, but not to the new 
purpose of the bank.
<P>
	This legislation changes the role of the former Federal 
Business Development Bank, which will soon become the 
Business Development Bank of Canada. The mandate is 
changed because, in the past, the Federal Business Development 
Bank was formally recognized as a bank of last resort.
<P>
	Last year, when the committee looked at the role of the FBDB, 
it is the Bloc Quebecois which, along with the other members of 
the committee, in an attempt to convey the notion of last resort, 
proposed the term ``complementary''. That term was accepted 
by the committee. The word ``complementary'' therefore 
defined the role of last resort bank under the act.
<P>
	Today-I do not know how to qualify it, and some words may 
be a little too strong-but there is definitely something wrong. 
The word `complementary'' completely changes the bank's 
mandate and completely obliterates the concept of last resort.
<P>
	The Federal Business Development Bank is switching leagues 
and is more or less going into direct competition with the current 
network of chartered banks and the network of Caisses 
populaires Desjardins.
<P>
	Last resort implied that the whole outlook of the Federal 
Business Development Bank was geared to concern about 
regional development, expressed through <I>ad hoc</I> financial aid 
for small and medium size businesses. It assisted small and 
medium size businesses which had higher than usual risk factors 
because of their capital outlay or the economic sector in which 
they operated.
<P>
	Therefore, the bank's mandate, under the legislation, was to 
look at cases which had already been rejected by at least two 
conventional financial institutions. That was the last resort 
mandate. Consequently, the whole outlook was geared to 
regional development.
<P>
<B>(1900) </B>
<P>
	Today, the bank will soon be competing with conventional 
institutions and this may perhaps fulfil needs in the rest of 
Canada. Although the operation seems quintessentially 
political, the changing of names is a perfect example-without 
condemning too harshly the people from the Langevin Block 
and the minister's office-of the government's desire to fill 
existing market needs in the rest of Canada.
<P>
	But, this will also affect institutions in Quebec which have 
already carved out their niches, which have solid reputations 
and have been successful in filling the needs of the market. In 
particular, I am thinking of the Mouvement Desjardins, which is 
very concerned, by the way, by the federal government's 
approach, and of the Fonds de solidarité de la FTQ and the 
Société de développement industriel du Québec, which, together  
with the Caisse de dépôt and the Banque nationale, worked and 
contributed to making it possible for businesses in need in the 
various regions of Quebec to obtain loans.
<P>
	Therefore, we had cultivated a last resort mentality, and I am 
personally very upset when I hear people at the Federal Business 
Development Bank say that it will no longer be a bank for losers. 
We have to see things more objectively.
<P>
	Life in the business world is not always rosy. It is difficult at 
times. There are nuances. It is absolutely necessary to have a 
lending institution like the Federal Business Development Bank 
with a mandate to review the situation of businesses which are 
different from others, out of an almost socio-economic concern 
to ensure that businesses which otherwise would not be backed 
by conventional sources will find backing in the public sector.
<P>
	I often heard the president of the FBDB refer to the case of 
Lassonde, in Quebec, a company that today is thriving and at the 
time had access to funds from the federal bank when traditional 
institutions could not, I suppose, justify approving a loan 
because the risk may have been too high, but the federal bank, 
acting in the public interest, did, and the rest is history.
<P>
	There has been one obvious change. The clause on last resort 
financing has been eliminated, and the new Business 
Development Bank of Canada will, as a result, be competing 
directly with traditional institutions.
<P>
	There are some subtle changes as well, because the Federal 
Business Development Bank has a new way to raise funds. So 
far, the bank has been operating only with public funds. From 
now on, it will be able to turn to private financing as well. The 
private sector will be able to lend money to the new Business 
Development Bank of Canada through what are commonly 
called hybrid instruments.
<P>
	The bank's mandate has changed in two ways. Formerly, the 
bank only had to break even. Today, when it deals with the 
private sector, it will have to be a good investment in terms of 
interest yields on investments by the private sector. So it will 
have to pay attractive rates which, we must assume, will be 
based on the bank's profits. This is no longer about breaking 
even. The yield will be based on profits. The bank's focus on 
regional development will have to change. The bank will have to 
change its culture, its vision and gradually become a strictly 
commercial bank. This is a profound change in the bank's 
mission.
<P>
	Finally, I am worried. Let me explain. As our NDP colleague 
said earlier, 52 per cent of the loans approved by the Federal 
Business Development Bank were for $100,000 or less. Once we 
no longer have this philosophy that the bank should promote 
genuine regional development by small business but instead 
operate on a more commercial basis so that it can offer  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14359"> 14359 </A></B>
<P>
attractive yields to private investors, where are these loans 
going to come from, those 52 per cent?
<P>
<B>(1905) </B>
<P>
	Who will approve these loans worth $100,000 or less which 
represent 52 per cent of the FBDB's portfolio at the present 
time? We have every reason to be concerned about the future 
impact of these changes.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, on a point of clarification. Do I understand correctly 
that the government has only one opportunity to respond to the 
opposition's motions?. The member for Trois-Rivières spoke on 
basically half of the motions in group 2?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> There are no periods for 
questions and comments or responses. The government can 
partake in the debate or lead off if the hon. members had been on 
their feet. On that point, I apologize to the member for Simcoe 
Centre.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In the case of the hon. member of Trois-Rivières, there is no 
precedent since he was one of the movers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to speak to the amendments to Bill 
C-91 we are addressing this evening. I am pleased to do this 
because of my small business background.
<P>
	As a small businessman for many years I had many sleepless 
nights looking for capital. Therefore I am very hopeful that the 
changes we are attempting to make to this bill will improve the 
access to capital for those new small businesses starting up.
<P>
	The amount of time spent on the correct name bothers me to 
some degree. I do not think the name is all that important. What 
is in the bill is important to small businesses which we are trying 
to help.
<P>
	I was interested in some of the comments coming from my 
colleagues in the Bloc, particularly the member for Longueuil 
when said he had been in business in Quebec and found that 
Quebec businessmen had to work twice as hard as the 
businessmen in Ontario. I had a little trouble with that because I 
challenge anybody to have worked twice as hard as I did in my 
business. If one is to be successful in small business today one 
must work hard.
<P>
	In my business, the tire and automotive service business, I had 
occasion to come in contact with people in the same business in 
Quebec. At no time did I get from them that they were working 
or attempting to work twice as hard as I was. Those in business 
in Quebec I came in contact with were doing very well because 
they were working hard. That was the secret.
<P>
	I listened to the comments about the FBDB and what is 
happening in Quebec. I look at the 1994 annual report from the 
FBDB and see that some 23 per cent of its portfolio is in Quebec. 
Its head office is there as well. At some point during the debate 
earlier I was wondering if the scenario was that people were 
being forced at gun point to borrow from the FBDB. It is not 
compulsory. If businesses want to go there they go on their own 
volition, as it should be.
<P>
	I will briefly run through the amendments in group 2 and 
outline Reform's position on them. The first is Motion No. 7. 
Reform is opposing this motion because the term financial 
assistance is too broad, too sweeping and too general in terms.
<P>
	When I read that I thought I would have really appreciated, 
when I went to my bank for funding, that I could say I wanted 
financial assistance and the bank manager would have been 
prepared to take it on that basis. Whenever I asked for financial 
assistance, the next question was how much financial 
assistance. The decision was then made on that. Therefore we 
feel it is too sweeping and we will be opposing Motion No. 7.
<P>
	Motion No. 8 deals with limiting the bank's ability to go to 
$18 billion rather than $23 billion as is in the bill now. We think 
there should be a limit there. In our estimation the limit should 
be $18 billion. We will be supporting Motion No. 8
<P>
<B>(1910) </B>
<P>
	We are opposing Motion No. 9. The mandate of the bank in 
our opinion is still not satisfactorily defined.
<P>
	On Motion No. 10, a Reform motion by the member for 
Edmonton South, we will be supporting it because it eliminates 
loans to crown corporations. I do not know whether that was 
anticipated or thought of at the time but it might appear to the 
public as a form of double dipping. We will be supporting the 
amendment to eliminate loans to crown corporations.
<P>
	Motion No. 11 restricts the role of the bank to complementary 
activities not already provided by the private sector. We will be 
supporting Motion No. 11.
<P>
	Moving into the grouping of Motions Nos. 14 and 15, Motion 
No. 14 we feel removes some restrictions we feel are necessary 
in the bill. We will be opposing the removal of those sections.
<P>
	Motion No. 15 is also a Reform motion and we will be 
supporting it. It ensures the bank is not active in trust, insurance 
or security companies.
<P>
	Motion No. 19 is proposed by the Bloc. We will be opposing 
it. Yield of hybrid instruments will reflect the profit and cost of 
borrowing.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14360"> 14360 </A></B>
<P>
	Motion No. 20, a Bloc motion, does not change the potential 
for conflict. It refers only to disclosure. We do not feel it covers 
that and we will be opposing it.
<P>
	Motion No. 21, a Reform motion which we will be supporting, 
refers to the conflict of interest that changes the requirement 
from disclosing conflict to not doing any business with an 
interested person.
<P>
	Motion No. 22, a Reform motion, will be supported and I see 
it was adopted at committee stage. Motion No. 21, a Bloc 
motion, we will be opposing because the motion appears to be 
unnecessary in our estimation. Motion No. 24 we will be 
opposing for the same reasons as were outlined on Motion No. 1; 
because it refers to the name change.
<P>
	Motion No. 25 requires a definition of a hybrid capital 
instrument be included in the bill. Reform put forward this 
motion and we will be supporting it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I will deal with the motions 
and then with some of the comments members of the opposition 
parties have put forward.
<P>
	We will be supporting Motion No. 20 put forward by the 
member from Trois-Rivières. We will also be supporting 
Motions Nos. 24 and 25. Motion No. 24 is ours and Motion No. 
25 is put forward by the Reform Party. All other motions in this 
section we will be opposing.
<P>
	I will deal with some of the concerns the member for 
Trois-Rivières put forward and some of the concerns expressed 
by our colleague from Simcoe Centre. Before I do, I will deal 
with some of the comments made by the hon. member for 
Kamloops.
<P>
	The member said earlier the government has missed a 
tremendous opportunity to move this bank forward with a very 
specific mandate to help small business.
<P>
<B>(1915 ) </B>
<P>
	We will not miss that opportunity. Even though in the 
committee we felt strongly about the name that was on the 
bill-it was changed today-there is one thing we will make 
sure the Business Development Bank of Canada does: we will 
make sure that its marketing thrust will be centred around the 
small business sector.
<P>
	Make absolutely no mistake that as sure as I am standing here, 
if there is one issue this Prime Minister continues to be 
committed to with all the energy and passion he has-and I say 
that straight out-it is the small business sector.
<P>
	Through you, Madam Speaker, to the opposition members and 
especially to the member for Kamloops, who, like myself, has 
campaigned vigorously in this House in opposition and in 
government, we have not let go and we will not let go. And we 
will not let the executive of this government forget that we were 
given the trust 20 months ago due in large part to the Prime 
Minister's commitment and the Minister of Finance's 
commitment even before the red book that we were  going to be 
the government that championed small business and we were 
going to be the government that took on the financial 
institutions of this country, the chartered banks.
<P>
	There is not a member on this side of the House who will stand 
up and defend the chartered banks of Canada and say that they 
are doing a great job for small business. If anyone can find a 
member on the government side of the House who will stand up 
and say that the banks of Canada are doing a great job for small 
business, name them. I certainly could not find one. We talk 
about this among ourselves and in our ridings. We are 
committed to that sector.
<P>
	Getting back to this bill, this Business Development Bank 
will be committed to small business. I want to read into the 
record a note from the newly appointed chairman of the board of 
this bank, which I just received. He has been listening to this 
debate. I was summoned to the phone by him and I received a 
letter. We are going to make him accountable for this letter by 
reading it into <I>Hansard</I>. It is from Patrick J. Lavelle, the 
chairman of the board of the Business Development Bank of 
Canada:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In passing this legislation, the House is giving the bank expanded powers and 
greater responsibilities. The implementation of which will test the mettle of the 
banks directors and its management.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This House isn't giving the bank a blank check. The mandate calls for the 
bank to increase its activities in the new economy of Canada, in 
telecommunications, biotechnology and other technologies of the future. We 
must not abandon the declining sectors but we must see change and progress in 
the new ones.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The determination of the banks portfolio should reflect the country in that all 
regions: the Atlantic, Ontario, as well as Quebec and the West see increases in 
the availability of capital; after all that is what the bank is supposed to do.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The new bank with its new name should be visible and accountable. And we 
are going to bring the banks management before the committee to gauge what 
actions they are taking to fulfil their new mandate as quickly as possible.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Make no mistake the expectations for the bank are high and it will take extra 
efforts on the part of the management and its directors to achieve the promised 
results.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I want to deal specifically with the concerns the Bloc 
Quebecois has. They talk-

<B>(1920 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I think 
the reference the hon. colleague has made to the communiqué by 
the new bank chair is appropriate. I wonder if it would not be 
appropriate for my hon. friend to seek unanimous consent to 
append that letter to be part of <I>Hansard</I> today.

have the unanimous consent?

<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would just like to take some of my personal notes off it before 
we append it to <I>Hansard</I>.
<P>
	I would like to deal with the remarks I put on this note to the 
member for Trois-Rivières. We can see what the concerns are of 
the Bloc Quebecois. Make no mistake about the fact that the 
Bloc Quebecois does not in any way, shape, or form support the 
Government of Canada presence in the province of Quebec. 
They object to this instrument. As the Bloc Canadien on this side 
of the House, we believe this instrument is there to help small 
business.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois does not want this instrument in the 
province because it is going to show Quebecers, small business 
men and women, that the people and the Government of Canada 
play a vital role, a central role, an integral role in their 
development as a part of Canada.
<P>
	Make no mistake about it, we intend to use this bank to make 
sure that the Government of Canada presence is alive and well in 
the province of Quebec.
<P>
	I cannot speak for the cabinet here, but as a committee and for 
those of us who believe in Canada, we would be encouraging the 
new Business Development Bank of Canada to have many 
locations in the province of Quebec, just as many as we hope to 
have in all the other provinces across Canada.
<P>
	Quite frankly, I would find it very hard to imagine that the 
small business men and women in the province of Quebec would 
reject that kind of financial support, and not just financial 
support but counselling assistance. We must make sure that we 
understand that this Federal Business Development Bank of 
Canada now has another unique feature attached to it. It supplies 
counselling assistance for small enterprise and for 
entrepreneurs, both men and women. What better way to show 
the new and emerging entrepreneurs in the province of Quebec 
that the counselling assistance provided by the Government of 
Canada is alive and well?
<P>
	This Business Development Bank of Canada I believe will 
play an integral role in helping to galvanize this spirit of Canada 
from coast to coast, including the province of Quebec. I would 
encourage members to support the government's amendments 
on this section of motions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B> Madam Speaker, again I 
am pleased to have an opportunity to make some remarks 
regarding this grouping of amendments to the bill regarding the 
new federal bank's name and some changes in the mandate.
<P>
<B>(1925 ) </B>
<P>
	I listened with interest to my colleague from 
Broadview-Greenwood when he said that the government will 
not miss that opportunity-and I suspect he is obviously 
implying the bank will not miss this opportunity-to provide an 
increased level of service to the small business sector. I am 
pleased when he reminded us that the new chair of the bank is 
listening in and is obviously getting a sense of the feeling among 
members of the House.
<P>
	The member goes on to say that we can be assured that the new 
marketing thrust of this newly revised bank will be taking into 
consideration the needs of the small business sector. I will not 
even qualify it by saying probably, because I know he speaks the 
truth. I know this is what he wants to do. But why could we not 
have a little clearer direction actually in the legislation to 
guarantee that? We have seen tonight, in my judgment, that what 
the hon. member wants and what the executive wants can be two 
different things.
<P>
	So let us acknowledge that, yes, it is good to say these great 
things and it is nice to comment on all the things the government 
plans to do, but we also remember the government's plan to 
abolish the GST. I suspect that probably somebody in there 
actually meant that at one time. They also said that they would 
abrogate the free trade agreement, and so on. It goes on and on.
<P>
	There is some hesitation for us in opposition to become 
enthusiastic when we hear these commitments, verbal as they 
are. Mind you, the government even had the abolishment of the 
GST and abrogating free trade in their red book. These were 
actually written down, and they obviously have set those aside.
<P>
	However, let us be positive this evening and assume that the 
member is accurate and that the new chair listening in will hear 
us and will take this bank in the right direction.
<P>
	I listened with interest to my hon. colleague talk about the 
sensitivity the bank will have to ensure that adequate provision 
is given to small business enterprises in all the regions of 
Canada. We applaud that.
<P>
	I just want to point out that my hon. friend refers to the west. I 
know he is from Broadview-Greenwood and I know that he 
recognizes the realities of western Canada. I want to remind my 
friend that the west includes two regions: the cordillera regions 
of British Columbia and the Yukon, and of course the prairie 
region. So let us be sensitive that we want to balance that B.C. 
and Yukon is actually a region that ought to get their fair share 
separate from the prairies and so on and so forth. That is just a 
little sensitivity from us across the mountain range.
<P>
	I got a little shaky when my hon. friend was up talking about 
the letter from the new chair that said we must provide special 
consideration for the newly emerging technologies, 
biotechnology and telecommunications and so on. No one would 
dispute 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14362"> 14362 </A></B>
<P>
that. I question whether or not this is the small business sector 
we are talking about here tonight in large part. It may be.
<P>
	When I think of biotechnology and telecommunications, I 
often do not think of the person making the loan for $20,000 or 
$30,000. I would call for a little extra sensitivity. Yes, we would 
applaud that the bank ought to be leading a lot of the capital and 
funding initiatives into these sectors, but also we are talking 
about small business that is quite often apart from these two 
sectors.
<P>
	We want to see expanded powers. Again, I will be looking 
carefully at the new initiatives. My hon. friend can simply nod at 
this, but I think he said that the chair of the bank wanted to come 
before the committee with his directors and meet with the 
committee to develop some of these ideas further. I think that is 
what he said. I applaud that initiative and look forward to that 
opportunity.
<P>
	On behalf of my party we will be supporting with some 
enthusiasm Motion No. 7 by my colleague from Trois-Rivières. 
We will also be supporting Motion No. 10, by my friend from 
Edmonton Southwest. We will also be supporting Motion No. 
20, Motion No. 21, Motion No. 22, Motion No. 23, and Motion 
No. 25.
<P>
	I want to make a comment about Motion No. 23, and that is the 
addition in the legislation of the line ``for the purposes of a 
committee or either House of Parliament'' as the possibility of 
reviewing what the bank is doing. I do think that is an 
appropriate initiative if in fact that inclination is there.
<P>
	Again, these are very thoughtful amendments. Some do not 
receive our enthusiastic endorsement. I appreciate the reasons 
people are bringing them forward, but I do not see the necessity 
and some of them I find actually rather regressive. We are being 
positive here tonight, so I will keep my statements on the upbeat 
and positive note.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 13</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-91 be amended by deleting Clause 21.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak for the last 
time at this stage, following the impassioned speech by the 
parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Industry, whom I 
would like to congratulate on his candour. We no longer hear 
from Liberals who are proud to be Canadian and proud to tell 
Quebecers what it means to be Canadian at this time and what 
Canada will become.
<P>
	We have seen the passion of the member for 
Broadview-Greenwood in defending the Trudeau vision of 
post-referendum Canada. I almost feel like congratulating him, 
because it helps us understand the scope of the present debate, 
the role foreseen for the Federal Business Development Bank, 
the Business Development Bank of Canada, in this 
post-referendum Canada.
<P>
	In particular, the Bank will be able to meddle, and this is the 
aim of clause 20, in regional development throughout Canada, 
and particularly in Quebec. The legislation provides that the 
new Bank will be able to do business with so-called 
``provincial'' agencies, despite the fact that, in Quebec, 
however, there is a law that provides that provincial government 
agencies must deal with the Government of Quebec, which then 
does business with the federal government and subsequently 
authorizes its agencies to act as it sees fit.
<P>
	Ignoring the presence and the existence of the Government of 
Quebec, the bill provides that the federal government will now 
deal with provincial agencies. This raises the whole leadership 
problem. Who is primarily responsible for regional 
development in Quebec? In our opinion, it is the Government of 
Quebec. The federal government could perhaps support it, but it 
does not have to try to duplicate it, as it is currently doing.
<P>
	Quebec has established so many agencies. With the SDI, the 
regional development councils, the solidarity funds, the deposit 
fund for major matters, and so on, Quebec's regional 
development organization is well structured.
<P>
	We refuse to permit waste of public funds and competition 
between officials, as we have too often seen in the past, or 
between two groups of officials, which compete with each other, 
instead of helping each other, and will be encouraged to compete 
more. We all know that the new Bank of Canada will back the 
Federal Business Development Bank, which has become merely 
an empty shell since its mandate changed.
<P>
	And it is about to start adding its energies to those that the 
departments of Industry and of International Trade devote to 
exporters, mostly high tech companies. They are going to supply 
them, like an agent of federal interventionism, through the 
Federal Business Development Bank in total disregard for the 
regional development infrastructure already in place in Quebec.
<P>
	I feel that this describes the mentality prevailing in this 
government. They use clause 21 to spread it, which I will read to 
you:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>21. The Bank may carry out duties or functions that may be assigned to it by 
the Designated Minister in relation to the administration of any program 
supporting Canadian entrepreneurship, to the extent that it is able to recover the 
costs of carrying out the duties or functions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Therefore, having changed the mandate, they are not only 
mobilizing to try to develop entrepreneurship in Canada by any 
means they feel are good means, but they also want to develop 
programs. We asked this question in committee. What 
programs? What does business administration mean?
<P>
	That is a very vague catch-all term which the federal 
government could use to give itself any mandate or to assume 
any responsibility without consulting with either the provincial 
government in Quebec, for the time that we will remain a 
provincial government, or the other provincial governments.
<P>
	This demonstrates the mentality behind this bill and how 
urgent it truly is for Quebecers to realize how serious the 
situation is and to realize that, in the Langevin Block, people are 
drawing up the Canada of tomorrow which will be centralized 
and unified like Pierre Elliott Trudeau always wanted it to be.
<P>
<B>(1940) </B>
<P>
	Except that the process does not allow for debate or consultation 
and all of the other provinces are being  tricked, along with Quebec, 
in an anti-Quebec referendum strategy. They are pulling a fast one 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14364"> 14364 </A></B>
<P>
on the other provinces. I personally find it dishonest to make 
lofty speeches on the Canada of the future instead of really 
debating this bill. Alas, this is a small-time short-sighted 
Canada, run as if it were a chip truck.
<P>
	That is what we are in for. I can feel it, the measures are 
already in place. And if Quebec makes the catastrophic decision 
to vote no, this is what Canada and Quebec will have to endure. 
They will have to live in this Canada or Quebec, which, as it is, 
is not recognized as a province that is different from the others; 
they will have to yield to the bulldozer that they are setting in 
motion in order to build the Canada of the future, and I hope that 
this kind of measure will make Quebecers think twice.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to speak to the last grouping of 
amendments on Bill C-91, Motions Nos. 12 and 13.
<P>
	I am very much impressed by the comments of the member for 
Broadview-Greenwood about his dedication to small business 
and the government's dedication to helping small business. I 
hope the sincerity and dedication extend beyond access to 
funding.
<P>
	There are many other important areas that are really big 
factors to small businesses. Certainly they are looking for relief 
from the tax burden they are under and their customers are 
under. It is number one on their list, as well as the government 
bureaucracy that is on their backs. These are two areas we have 
to address to encourage not only new businesses but small 
businesses to expand and grow as we know we need them to do.
<P>
	The Reform Party will be opposing both Motions Nos. 12 and 
13 because they remove some restrictions from the bill that we 
feel are important and should remain in there.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, this is the last grouping. 
The government will not be supporting these Bloc amendments.
<P>
	I listened carefully to the member for Trois-Rivières. I was 
surprised he would suggest that the business development bank 
would be perceived as an anti-Quebec initiative.
<P>
	The member referred to the Langevin Block. He indicated that 
the bill was some scheme for the pre-referendum exercise. 
Being a former assistant to Prime Minister Pierre Elliott 
Trudeau and having worked in the Langevin Block, I say that he 
is giving them too much credit. The bill was really the work of 
all members of the industry committee.
<P>
	The member for Trois-Rivières does not believe in 
Government of Canada presence in the province of Quebec. That 
is fair ball; he is entitled to that opinion. That is the hon. 
member's ideology. However, the member knows that all the 
other members on the committee are not anti-Quebec. The 
member cannot stand in the House and say I am anti-Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1945) </B>
<P>
	I cannot imagine that a Quebecer listening tonight to the critic 
for the Reform Party or to the hon. member for Simcoe Centre 
would say this debate was anti-Quebec.
<P>
	This debate is about assisting and supporting small business 
men and women who represent the greatest hope for putting 
Canadians back to work. That is what this bill is about.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Will the bill work?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> An hon. member 
opposite asked if the bill will work. I do not know the answer to 
that question. Are we to stay with the status quo?
<P>
	This work was the result of members of the Reform Party, 
members of the Bloc and our members listening to dozens of 
small business men and women. We listened to bankers. This 
was not the government's idea. This was not an idea conjured up 
in the Langevin Block. This was a bill designed by all parties for 
the small business men and women of Canada.
<P>
	With the deepest respect to my friend whom I have enjoyed 
working with from the Bloc Quebecois, please reflect between 
now and the vote tonight. I ask him to reconsider his position 
and get behind the government bill in the interests of putting the 
unemployed people of Quebec back to work. That kind of spirit 
will have a ripple effect throughout Canada.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Réginald Bélair (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to address Bill C-82, a bill which will 
enable the Government of Canada to replace the $2 note with a 
$2 coin.
<P>
	The bill was recently studied by the Standing Committee on 
Government Operations. I am pleased to say all witnesses 
appearing before the committee supported the introduction of a 
$2 coin as a cost saving measure. This confirms the results of 
earlier surveys conducted by the Royal Canadian Mint whereby 
Canadians strongly approved of the new coin given the 
substantial savings that accrue to the government.
<P>
	Clearly Canadians appreciate any step their government takes 
to reduce the deficit and save money.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Representatives from the vending machine industry 
confirmed their support for the proposed coin, even though they 
expressed some concern regarding the date of introduction of 
this coin. They fear that they will not have time to adjust the 
mechanisms of all their machines by the introduction date.
<P>
	I can assure hon. members that we are sensitive to these 
concerns. In response to these concerns the Royal Canadian 
Mint, the Department of Finance and the Bank of Canada will 
co-operate with the individuals and groups involved, and 
especially with the vending machine industry, to ensure a 
smooth introduction of the new coin on the market, in order to 
minimize sale and business disruptions.
<P>
	There will be a public awareness campaign to promote 
acceptance and use of the $2 coin by the Canadian public.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The government intends to introduce the new $2 coin in early 
1996, as announced by the Minister of Finance in his budget 
speech in February 1995. We cannot afford to delay this budget 
item because we all stand to gain from the introduction of this 
new coin.
<P>
	By replacing the $2 note with the coin, Canadians will save 
approximately $254 million over 20 years from the reduced 
production and distribution costs of the $2 coin as compared to 
the note.
<P>
	The average life span of a note is one year while the average 
life span of a coin is twenty years. The cost to produce the note is 
6 cents per unit compared to the estimated cost to produce the 
coin at 16 cents per unit. This combined with the savings the 
government will generate by changing the metal composition of 
the lower denominations will result in total savings of $500 
million over 20 years.
<P>
<B>(1955) </B>
<P>
	Some have suggested that half a billion in savings is small 
change. We disagree. In our fight to eliminate the deficit we 
believe every dollar saved is a dollar earned. No saving is too 
small or insignificant.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14366"> 14366 </A></B>
<P>
	As the Minister of Public Works and Government Services 
explained to the committee members, we need five pennies to 
make a nickel, five nickels to make a quarter, and four quarters 
to make a dollar; every penny counts.
<P>
	The government takes deficit reduction very seriously. Any 
member of the House elected on a platform to reduce or 
eliminate the deficit must support this initiative. As we all 
know, the deficit cannot be eliminated through program cuts 
alone. Innovative ways must be found to cut government 
expenditures. The introduction of the $2 coin to replace the $2 
note is an innovative cost saving measure.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Some people wonder why we did not simply do away with the 
$2 bill. They say we would have saved even more money, but we 
disagree.
<P>
	Canadians use $2 notes in a large number of transactions 
every day. Because they are so heavily used, these notes tend to 
be in poor condition. The coin is a practical and far more durable 
alternative to the note. It allows the government to save more 
money than it would by simply eliminating the note.
<P>
	If we eliminated the $2 denomination, we would not reduce 
the number of coins in the purses of Canadians, on the contrary. 
Studies have shown that the combination of $1, $2, $5 and $10 
values is the most effective in reducing the number of coins and 
notes required. Without the $2 note, more loonies would be 
needed and Canadians would carry even more change in their 
pockets. Two loonies weigh 14 grammes, compared to 7.3 
grammes for the proposed $2 coin. If we eliminated the $2 
denomination, we would have to mint more $1 coins and that 
would cost an extra $23 million over a period of 20 years.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Some others might wonder why the government is proposing 
to introduce a $2 coin at a time when more and more people are 
using credit and debit cards. A $2 coin might seem a step 
backward to a time before paper money instead of a step forward 
toward more plastic. Cash cards will not mean the end of cash in 
society.
<P>
	For the foreseeable future cash will be a necessary 
requirement. Like credit cards and debit cards, cash cards will 
find their own market niche for people who prefer to manage 
their cash in this way. However, there will always be a need for 
cash. This was also confirmed during the hearings of the 
government operations committee.
<P>
	The presentation by the Canadian Federation of Independent 
Grocers revealed that debit cards are not being used as often as 
anticipated. The extent to which cash cards may replace coinage 
is at this time only a matter of conjecture. However, even if cash 
cards replace a significant percentage of transactions most of 
these will be of higher value and not coinage.
<P>
	Coins will continue to play a role in commercial transactions. 
Already coins are used to acquire numerous services such a mass 
transit, telephone calls, washing machines at the laundromat, 
video and pool games, parking meters, even showers at 
campgrounds. The vending machine industry is presenting us 
with a greater variety of products and choices. These changes 
reflect the nature of the vending machine industry and of our 
economy in general.
<P>
<B>(2000 ) </B>
<P>
	The only constant is change and in the modern world, the 
process of change is rapid, wide reaching and never ending. 
Businesses must constantly adapt to new technologies and new 
practices.
<P>
	As an aside, I want to point out to my colleagues in the House 
that representatives of the vending industry, including the 
president of Coca-Cola, clearly stated the costs of converting 
vending equipment would not be passed on to consumers.
<P>
	Some people have suggested that we should compensate the 
vending machine industry for the expense of altering their 
machines. In an era of fiscal restraint, we simply cannot afford 
it. We must use our limited resources very strategically in ways 
that result in the greatest possible benefit for the greatest 
possible number of Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As I said earlier, the Royal Canadian Mint, the Department of 
Finance and the Bank of Canada will co-operate with the 
industry to ensure a smooth transition. Studies conducted by the 
Royal Canadian Mint have shown that 79 per cent of Canadians 
approved of this initiative when told that it would save the 
government millions of dollars.
<P>
	Moreover, the disappearance of the $2 note does not seem to 
worry Canadians too much. Forty-five per cent said they were 
not very concerned, while only 19 per cent felt some nostalgia 
but no real concern. In concluding, we believe that to be 
practical a currency system must adapt to change. We must stay 
in the lead and be an example to others.
<P>
	This bill reflects the will of the Canadian government to 
accept change in areas where others avoided it. Change is never 
easy. We believe that it is by making choices that we show 
leadership. Sometimes, making choices means letting go of 
some traditions to turn with confidence towards innovation and 
renewal.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise today on the subject of Bill C-82. Unlike 
Bill C-91 and other bills introduced by the government, which 
are opposed in Quebec, this bill is not. It does, however, prove 
conclusively that the government has blocked its ears and that it 
is ready to do anything when the time comes to have its bills 
adopted.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14367"> 14367 </A></B>
<P>
	We have heard a speech by the minister's parliamentary 
secretary that was full of errors and had little to do with reality. 
For example, it is not right to say that the business people most 
affected by the issue of a $2 coin were in favour of it. It is not 
true. They were not in favour of it. Not a single representation 
was made by businessmen in favour of a $2 coin being issued. 
A representative of the Coca-Cola company told us they were 
indifferent, that is, they were prepared to make the adjustment 
and they, like all the other business people, asked that the 
government at least delay the issue of the $2 coin for a year 
so that the industries most affected could adjust.
<P>
	This is the least we can do for the business people, industries, 
vending machines and companies most affected by the issue. 
The government plugged its ears. Companies are not even being 
given a year to get ready for the new coin.
<P>
<B>(2005) </B>
<P>
	Why is the government in such a hurry?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It is a matter of money.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> Yes, it is definitely a matter of money. It is 
incredible how little time the government took to consult 
people.
<P>
	The member for Cochrane-Superior said earlier, or seemed 
to imply, that, in fact, people had been consulted and were in 
favour. A look, however, at the government's so-called survey 
reveals the extent to which it was manipulated. It is not a real 
survey. Some people were asked if they were in favour of a $2 
coin being issued if it meant a saving of $300 million.
<P>
	Half the respondents were opposed, really opposed. One 
cannot be opposed in principle to the government saving money, 
but in its survey, the government did not even discuss more 
economical alternatives, like maintaining the status quo or 
eliminating the $2 bill. The people were not consulted. In fact, 
the public in general does not even know, in principle, that the 
government is planning to put out a $2 coin. This measure is 
slipped through, as though they wanted to impose it. Well, that is 
what they want to do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bélair:</B> It was announced in the budget.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> The hon. member for Cochrane-Superior is 
telling me it was announced in the budget. Spoken like a true 
Liberal. Whatever the minister or the Prime Minister says, we 
will vote yea.
<P>
	Regardless of the fact that the business community is asking 
for the decision to be deferred and is against the idea, the Liberal 
members are all for it. Furthermore, this is the conclusion 
reached about Liberals in an article in the <I>Ottawa Sun</I> written by 
Douglas Fisher. When it comes to proposing bills, it is ``Forget 
constituents, forget personal belief-'' and, I would add, forget 
public opinion, forget all the people who might have something 
to say about the bills. ``Being a Liberal MP begins with always 
saying yea at the leader's command''.
<P>
	They blindly follow the leader, unable it seems to express 
their own opinions. For all I know, maybe they are not capable of 
expressing their own opinions, they lack intelligence. Bill C-82 
certainly does not show any signs of intelligence, just the 
government's indifference.
<P>
	It shows that this government is not listening. It could not care 
less. The bill smacks of arrogance, of disregard for public 
opinion. The government could have consulted the public, it 
could have informed people that it was planning a $2 coin and 
really tried to find out if they were in agreement or not, but this 
was not done. The public has not been prepared for this soon to 
be introduced change.
<P>
	Having done nothing to pave the way and shown little interest 
in public opinion, the government is going ahead. As I said, even 
the best informed people, those most affected by the 
introduction of a $2 coin, who know that it is coming, are 
concerned about the speed with which it is being introduced. 
Why the haste? Why not give the business community time to 
adjust?
<P>
	The member for Cochrane-Superior tells us that the 
government will co-operate with business people in introducing 
the coin. This government is making empty promises. 
Furthermore, we were already promised consultation on this 
matter.
<P>
<B>(2010) </B>
<P>
	When members of the business community presented their 
report to the public works committee, they said that the 
government had promised them that after the reception given the 
loonie, there would be consultation when it came time to discuss 
the introduction of a $2 coin. There was no such consultation. If 
the government were truly interested in the opinion of business 
people or in public opinion, it would take the time to talk to 
them, to provide them with adequate information and to ensure 
that they understood the importance of issuing this coin. And if 
there was opposition, the government could at least have 
suggested alternatives, which it has not done.
<P>
	It is presenting the $2 coin and saying that it will lead to huge 
savings. This suggestion is a joke, because any way you look at 
it, it would not create any savings. And there are costs involved. 
Admittedly, the government will save approximately $250 
million, like the hon. member for Cochrane-Superior said 
earlier, but it will probably cost the business sector twice that 
amount to make the adjustments necessitated by this $2 coin. It 
is almost as if they are claiming that the introduction of the $2 
coin will have no effect, no impact, that it will not bother anyone 
and that co-ops and IGAs will not have to change their cash 
trays and that vending machines will not have to be adjusted to 
make allowances for the $2 coin. All coin-operated devices will 
have to be updated.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14368"> 14368 </A></B>
<P>
	Elementary math shows that the introduction of the $2 coin 
could cost business up to $400 million within the first year.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bélair:</B> Eighty million.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> Four hundred million. The hon. member for 
Cochrane-Superior said $80 million. That figure is only for 
one industry. There are 200,000 vending machines in Canada 
and it costs between $300 and $800 to adapt them to accept a 
new coin. For this industry alone, the total cost will be between 
$60 million and $160 million.
<P>
	The hon. member just told me that it will cost the vending 
machine industry $80 million, but that is not important because 
the government will be saving $200 million. But the cost will be 
between $60 million and $160 million for the vending machine 
industry alone in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No. No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> Yes it will. There are 200,000 of them in 
Canada. Who is going to foot the bill? The A.F.I. Automatic 
Vending Company, perhaps, which objected to the bill when it 
appeared before the Standing Committee on Government 
Operations?
<P>
	The hon. member for Cochrane-Superior said earlier that all 
businesspeople supported this move. In a letter to the members 
of the committee, a representative of the vending machine 
industry said: ``The government's cost savings is my expense''. 
He is not in agreement. If you read the letter, you notice that the 
representative of the industry is opposed to the introduction of a 
$2 coin. Once again, he suggests that he will not only incur 
expenses, but also that he is aware that the bottom line is that 
consumers will end up paying the $60 million to $160 million 
that the vending machine industry will have to shell out. 
Ultimately, consumers will end up paying.
<P>
<B>(2015) </B>
<P>
	Consumers will have to pay. This is only the beginning. 
Imagine, every cash register in every store across the country 
will eventually have to be replaced to accommodate a $2 coin.
<P>
	The hon. member for Cochrane-Superior and our colleague 
from Manitoba do not realize that. They do not see that. This is 
the down to earth stuff, but they are up there in the clouds, they 
hear no evil and see no evil but they listen to their minister 
because he said: You are going to vote for this bill, come hell or 
high water.
<P>
	How many cash registers? In Canada, probably half a million. 
All stores have cash registers, every cornerstore and every IGA. 
They will all have to change eventually. First they will have to 
adjust to the changeover but eventually they will have to replace 
them.
<P>
	The representative for this association, and this for the benefit 
of the hon. member for Cochrane-Superior, appeared before 
our committee to say no, we do not want the $2 coin because it 
will cost us a lot of money. I will have to buy another cash 
register which costs between $100 and $150. They do not come 
cheap.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> You do not have to take them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> No, of course not. People in northern Ontario 
will put their $2 coins in their piggybank or in another box, I 
imagine. That is one way. We have responsible people who are 
listening, people who know about these things, who are 
professionals and who know that cornerstores and shops will 
have to spend $100 and $150 to buy another cash register. This is 
another $75 million people will have to spend. And who is going 
to pay? The consumer, Mr. Speaker. You and me and the people 
watching us on television. They are going to have to pay. This is 
only the tip of the iceberg. Eventually, we will also have to 
change the parking meters, as the hon. member pointed out 
earlier, and all types of vending machines.
<P>
	There are administration costs and conversion costs. Costs the 
government did not take the trouble to calculate, because it 
could not care less.
<P>
	As for the cost of handling coins as opposed to bills, for 
example, the representative for Canada's grocers explained that 
to us. I think the hon. member for Cochrane-Superior was 
there, and if he was, he was not listening, because the hon. 
member for Ottawa Centre and the hon. member for 
Carleton-Gloucester were there, and they will be able to 
confirm this: introducing the new coin will cost more and it will 
be heavier to carry. We will have to pay someone to count the 
coins. There are additional costs. In his own store, he figured 
that introducing the new $2 coin would cost him between 
$10,000 and $15,000 in administration and conversion costs. 
And if we multiply this by 500,000 stores, it starts to add up, and 
quite a bit. Millions of dollars consumers will have to pay.
<P>
	When the hon. member for Cochrane-Superior tells me the 
government will save $250 million by introducing the $2 coin, I 
think he is pretty gullible.
<P>
<B>(2020) </B>
<P>
	Because, in the end, who is going to pay for it? Consumers 
will pay two or three times more. It is too bad, because the 
saving we are talking about is the one the Royal Canadian Mint 
could theoretically make. This is the only saving we are talking 
about. There is no mention of all the costs that will be generated 
by the issue of this coin. Even here, when we look at the savings 
mentioned by the member for Cochrane-Superior of $250 
million over 20 years-not $250 million next year-they 
amount to $12 million a year over 20 years. We realize that the 
issue of the $2 coin will cost industry and the Royal Canadian 
Mint dearly, because, for the Mint, it will mean producing these 
coins, which cost a lot more to produce than a bank note.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14369"> 14369 </A></B>
<P>
	A $2 bill costs six cents to produce. A $2 coin costs 16 cents. 
In the first few years, it will cost the government and the Mint 
a lot. The government will have to borrow money to produce 
the coin. The $250 million will not be saved in the first year. 
The savings will be made over the long term. The turning point 
will come after five, six or seven years. Over time, the value 
of money changes. You know just as well as I do that saving 
a million dollars today is not the same as saving a million 
dollars twenty years from now, because the million in 20 years 
will not be worth the same as this year's million. That is a fact.
<P>
	So, when the government and the member for 
Cochrane-Superior tell me we will be saving $254 million over 
20 years, when 20 years have passed we will realize we have not 
saved a cent. We will, however, have forced industry, business, 
companies, corner stores, the IGA and everyone affected by the 
issue of the $2 coin to spend money immediately, next year, after 
the coin is issued. They will have to pay right away. Consumers 
are going to have to pay up front for this change.
<P>
	The most absurd thing about this bill is that, as the member 
indicated in his presentation, the time is near when the money of 
the future, electronic money, will be introduced. He seemed to 
want to say that it did not matter. After all, we will continue to 
have coins, hard cash.
<P>
	But if the government had taken the trouble to read up on the 
magnitude of the current currency revolution, it would realize 
that indeed times are changing. Many changes are already under 
way. The government does not really have to impose more costly 
changes that will ultimately be for nothing when, in five years 
perhaps, coins will be replaced with chip cards. A few days ago, 
on June 19, 1995, <I>La Presse</I> was reporting what a smart wallet 
the chip card was.
<P>
<B>(2025) </B>
<P>
	It was introduced in Canada on May 12 by the Royal Bank and 
a few other institutions under the name MONDEX. Let me read 
you part of the article: ``A plastic card containing a microchip, 
the MONDEX wallet can be refilled at automatic teller 
machines and through certain telephones. The MONDEX 
package also includes an electronic safe about the size of an 
electronic memo pad. This safe can interface with a bank 
account through telephone circuits. It allows the chip card to be 
refilled without having to use communications channels. It will 
be widely available this summer''.
<P>
	This is taking place in Canada. The article goes on to describe 
how the introduction of electronic money will revolutionize the 
way we pay for what we buy. It is already in use in Europe. In 
France, money is no longer used to pay for telephone calls; they 
have been using cards for over ten years. In my riding, I can even 
pay for my newspaper with my card. The technology exists, here 
in Canada as well. But, apparently, government members do not 
read papers or magazines.
<P>
	MONDEX. There a lengthy article on the subject in the June 
12 issue of <I>Business Week</I>. That is quite recent. It is the feature 
article of this issue entitled ``The Future''. They refer to 
MONDEX as ``a new kind of electronic money known as E 
money'', adding that: ``Digital money is the ultimate and 
inevitable medium of exchange for an increasingly wired 
world''.
<P>
	Earlier, I got the impression from the hon. member for 
Cochrane-Superior that he could see into the future and predict 
that coins will always be used, that there will always be a need 
for our $2 coins. It seems that others have a different opinion. It 
is possible that we will use less real money, that we will replace 
it with ``E money'', electronic money, and that may be 
happening very soon.
<P>
	According to the experts who wrote the article, it could 
happen within the next five years. The ``E money'' revolution 
could take place that soon. This does not surprise me. In our 
rapidly changing world, the idea of using an electronic card to 
replace money does not surprise me. In fact, I would not be 
surprised if we more or less stopped using money, and if most 
people were to start using cards.
<P>
	Ten or fifteen years ago, who would have thought that the use 
of credit cards would become so widespread? If people had been 
told then that, five or ten years later, they would use credit cards 
to pay in any hotel or store, they would not have believed that.
<P>
	Sometimes, we have to open our eyes and ears to see and to 
understand. The government has obviously not done that in this 
case. We are about to enter an era which will see the introduction 
of a new form of money. According to experts, electronic money 
is definitely the way of the future, and it is also what 
businesspeople, merchants, bankers, corner store owners and 
grocery owners want.
<P>
	Even if it may cost them more, they are prepared to invest in 
this new system, because it reduces their handling costs and 
their losses, it eliminates fraud and NSF cheques, it simplifies 
the system, and it is also a step in the right direction.
<P>
<B>(2030) </B>
<P>
	Business people are ready to invest in such a system, but not 
one of them supports the issuance of a $2 coin. As the hon. 
member for Cochrane-Superior knows, all the witnesses and 
all the business people who appeared before the committee were 
against this measure.
<P>
	However, since the government will go ahead with it anyway, 
these business people have asked for at least a year to find new 
cash registers. It takes some time to change 500,000 cash 
registers as well as all the vending machines.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14370"> 14370 </A></B>
<P>
	This bill provides for the issuance of a $2 coin by January 
1996, which is just a few months away. The bill has not been 
passed yet, but the Royal Canadian Mint has already called for 
bids to produce the $2 metal coin.
<P>
	The hon. member for Cochrane-Superior may deny it, but on 
May 31, 1995, the <I>Ottawa Citizen</I> ran as a headline 
``Government calls standards for two dollar coin''. It is written 
in black and white. Another headline read ``Industry seeks help 
with coin flip''. All the same, the government has already 
received several bids. We called and were told that the bids must 
be in by October 31, 1995.
<P>
	If we need to take another five minutes to try to hammer some 
sense into these people, we will do it. We will at least take the 
time to explain these things that the government members 
unfortunately still do not understand.
<P>
	Again, the government has called for bids to produce the $2 
coin. It wants to start production on October 1, 1995, in a few 
months, and start distribution on January 1, 1996. This is fast, 
very fast.
<P>
	All those affected by this measure say that things should not 
go so fast, that they do not totally agree with the introduction of 
the new $2 coin, that they want a year to adjust. But the 
government is not listening and still wants to go ahead with this 
initiative.
<P>
	What is troubling me is that there are no solid arguments 
justifying the introduction of a $2 coin. The savings that will 
result from the introduction of this new coin are not a sure thing. 
We cannot say that savings will be achieved when we know that 
adjusting to the new coin will cost our industries money and 
that, ultimately, these costs will be passed on to the consumers.
<P>
	Is this a good time to introduce a $2 coin? The government has 
not taken the time to consider the alternatives. Domtar, which 
produces our present $2 bill, has proposed to make it more 
durable. Right now, the life span of the bill is said to be only a 
year. Domtar has offered to produce a bill that could last up to 
three years, which would represent considerable savings. The 
government has not considered this alternative.
<P>
	There are also other alternatives that it has not considered, 
such as maintaining the status quo or even eliminating the $2 
bill. If the government really wanted to save money, eliminating 
the $2 bill would be a good way of doing it. It would not cost 
anything.
<P>
<B>(2035) </B>
<P>
	The government could really save money. Industries, tuck 
shops, municipalities would not have to adapt to a $2 coin. This 
is an alternative. I am not saying that it is the solution, but why 
rush? Why not wait a certain time, one or two years, and see how 
the electronic card is being integrated into people's lives? The 
elimination of the $2 denomination could be considered. It 
could always be put back in circulation later on if needed, but 
why now and why so fast?
<P>
	The government is incredibly irresponsible because, really, 
nothing truly justifies a new $2 coin. If this government were 
really serious about saving money, I could suggest to the public 
works minister several ways to achieve real savings. He could 
have saved $300 million right off the bat this year by eliminating 
ACOA. This is $300 million he gives to industries. He could 
have supported, for instance, bills to give people in his own 
department the right to speak up and disclose abuses, which are 
numerous.
<P>
	The member for Cochrane-Superior is well aware of this. 
The government has no control over contracting out. The 
government is wasting billions of dollars. But the minister will 
not support such bills, and yet they would be real money savers. 
This Minister of Public Works has also made the news with some 
ill considered projects, and occasionally some almost shady 
deals.
<P>
	He had a wall, the famous Dingwall that cost several hundreds 
of thousands of dollars, built on a campus in his riding in Cape 
Breton. That was part of a $600,000 envelope squandered. I 
could give examples of the considerable sums of money wasted 
by the Minister of Public Works.
<P>
	Examples of questionable spending involving the Minister of 
Public Works are legion and involve millions of dollars. The 
member for Cochrane-Superior has just said that this is a 
minister interested in savings. I have my doubts. This cannot be 
the main reason for presenting this bill with such haste, when the 
people actually affected by the introduction of a $2 coin want at 
least a year to prepare for the transition.
<P>
	I would not give you $2 for this bill. In conclusion, I would 
say that the MP's role is often an empty one. Here we all are 
debating, giving speeches and arguing as reasonably as possible, 
but we know that the power rests with the people across the way 
and power often has a dulling effect. It also corrupts.
<P>
<B>(2040) </B>
<P>
	Absolute power corrupts absolutely; power just corrupts. We 
have examples of this. If we had the time and if it was worth the 
trouble to list the instances of corruption, we would do it, but I 
would rather conclude my comments on Bill C-82 by saying that 
the Bloc Quebecois is in favour of the government saving 
money. But we are in favour of real savings. We have suggested 
all kinds of ways for the government to really save money, from 
taxing family trusts to taxing banks. We have also made many 
suggestions to the Minister of Public Works regarding how he 
could reduce wastage of all kinds. We from the Bloc want 
savings. On this point, we agree. But, there is no proof that Bill 
C-82 will really create savings. On the contrary, it will be costly 
to business and consumers. People are not prepared.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14371"> 14371 </A></B>
<P>
	There already are some 40 to 50 million $1 coins which are 
out of circulation. We could easily encourage the circulation 
of loonies which are not being used. We would have preferred 
that the government consider at least delaying this bill and 
doing its job, which is to consult with the public and to think 
of alternatives, such as eliminating the $2 denomination. I am 
not saying that this is the best option, but they could at least 
consider it, because there are apparently more savings to be had 
by dropping this denomination then by issuing a new $2 coin. 
They could even decide to keep up the status quo.
<P>
	There are at least a few alternatives worth examining, which 
the government did not take the time to do. Once again, the 
government is not doing its job, it did not take the time to 
consult the public, it did not listen to the concerns and worries of 
the business community, it does not really have any solid 
arguments for introducing Bill C-82 and certainly has no solid 
arguments for doing it so quickly.
<P>
	That is why the Bloc opposes Bill C-82.

	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, sometimes we 
hurry through our days without pausing to give thanks to people. 
While I listened to that amazing speech just past, it occurred to 
me again that because much to my regret I am unilingual English 
I would not have understood a word of it if it were not for the 
interpreters. I think they did a fine job in translating not only the 
words of the hon. member but also the emotion with which he 
spoke. I would like to thank and congratulate the interpreters.
<P>
	We are here today to discuss Bill C-82, which would permit 
the government to introduce the $2 coin. When we come to the 
question of the $2 coin, of course when we hear of the savings 
that will be made it looks at first glance like an excellent idea 
and one we should wholeheartedly support. However, in the 
Reform Party we are accustomed to asking questions about these 
initiatives of the government. We always begin by asking what it 
will cost and what the net effect will be to the taxpayer.
<P>
<B>(2045) </B>
<P>
	We were sent here, all 52 of us, primarily on the platform of 
fiscal responsibility and the desire to balance the budget. We 
need to get into perspective how totally inadequate the 
initiatives and priorities of this government are. Here we are in 
the closing days of this session and this government is invoking 
closure and extended hours in order to put through all of this 
really important legislation before we are all sent home to our 
constituencies to do our work there.
<P>
	Among all the things the Liberals have deemed to be a high 
priority, we have this $2 coin. Of course anyone hearing the 
member from the government speak earlier would have said this 
is indeed important; we are going to save $254 million. We 
could make it sound like even more by saying a quarter of a 
billion dollars. Instead of saying we are going to save that over 
20 years, we could say we are going to save a billion dollars in 
80 years. That would make it sound much more significant.
<P>
	The fact of the matter is that this government speaks of this as 
such a huge priority, which will keep us here late at night 
debating and voting on these issues, as if this is going to save the 
country. Frankly, I wish it could. I really do. I would then be so 
strongly in favour of this motion that I would just say let us go 
for it, let us get it done, let us not wait until tomorrow, let us pass 
it and get it under way.
<P>
	However, we need to ask what the real effect is. We need to be 
aware of the fact that in proportion to the total indebtedness of 
this government, this is really, although I hesitate to say it, a 
drop in the bucket. I suppose we could say it is a drop in the 
ocean. Unfortunately, we are taking as a priority this one little 
drop and allowing the big one to slip away from us. While we are 
worried about the cup of water that spilled off the cupboard, as 
the people in southern Alberta would know firsthand from their 
experiences, the basement is full of water from the flood. This is 
what the relationship is in our debt's picture.
<P>
	It is very important for all members and all Canadian citizens 
to be aware that this saving of some $254 million over 20 years 
comes down to about $12.7 million per year. If we also consider 
that every day we are increasing our indebtedness by about $110 
million, then we become aware that the saving of $254 million 
over 20 years is just a little over the amount by which we are 
increasing our indebtedness in two days. That is a shame. I hope 
this is not unparliamentary, but I think this is a crime.
<P>
	I am not accusing the government of committing a crime, but 
it is derelict in its duties. It is not focusing on the picture of 
having to balance the budget and get government spending down 
in a real way.
<P>
	As a matter of fact, as the House will hear in the next few 
minutes, this savings the government is getting is really a form 
of a hidden tax, as I will show in the next few minutes. The 
savings that are derived are so derived by increasing the costs to 
taxpayers, and thereby the real saving to the government is 
simply a form of taxation on the already overburdened taxpayer.
<P>
<B>(2050 ) </B>
<P>
	The question we need to ask and have answered is, as I have 
already indicated, why this should be such a high priority. Even 
though it is a significant amount of money to any individual, in 
balance with total government spending it is not significant 
enough. We ought not to be chasing this rabbit when we should 
be out hunting bear.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14372"> 14372 </A></B>
<P>
	There is a big challenge out there, and we are being detracted 
by something glistening on the side of the road. We are being 
detracted while our country is going into the ditch.
<P>
	I would like to ask a few questions and talk a little about the 
answers the government has given to some of the questions. It is 
important for us to become aware of what is happening here.
<P>
	The first question: What is the total plan of the government in 
terms of currency? We are told that for the present, at least for 
the next five years, this is probably the only change it is going to 
make, with four coins being changed at the same time. Again we 
need to be aware that the change in metal content to the nickel, 
the dime, the quarter, and the 50-cent piece has nothing to do 
with the bill. It is just being done at the same time.
<P>
	If we are going to add a $2 coin, it is wise to do it at the same 
time so all the coin recognition systems in coin operated 
machines will not have to be changed twice. It can be done all at 
once. We must commend the government for deciding that if we 
are going to make a change, let us do it all at the same time. 
However, we should ask whether we should be doing it at all. Is 
it really a saving to the taxpayer? My contention is that it is not. 
Here is my reasoning.
<P>
	If one divides the total savings projected by the government, 
the $12.7 million per year over 20 years, one does not have to be 
a math whiz to compute this. There are approximately 29 
million Canadians. Using round numbers, quite clearly we are 
going to be saving less than half a dollar for each one of the 29 
million Canadians. As a matter of fact, it is very close to 44 
cents.
<P>
	If we can save $12.7 million per year, should we not be doing 
that? My answer would be yes, if it were a true saving. However 
it is a fairly safe assumption that every Canadian would use a 
coin operated machine a minimum of five times a year. If that is 
true and if the cost of retooling machines in order to recognize 
the new coins is included in the new cost to the vendors, say at a 
nominal rate of 10 cents per purchase-a 90-cent chocolate bar 
going up to $1, which would be typical and we can probably 
expect that-then for every person who uses a machine more 
than five times per year, which is a safe assumption, it is going 
to end up costing more. They will pay less in taxes but more in 
services. Right off the bat the equation is counterbalanced. The 
saving disappears when we look at it from the point of view of 
the taxpayer.
<P>
	In addition, there is the scenario that there is going to be an 
accrued value here because with the old $2 bill the banks were 
permitted to return the surplus currency for a credit. I remember 
reading somewhere that the total value of being able to return 
the currency to the Bank of Canada, even at 5 per cent interest, 
worked out to a benefit of approximately $80 million per year.
<P>
<B>(2055 ) </B>
<P>
	There is a saving there to the government because under the 
rules of the banks coinage is not eligible to be returned to the 
bank when it is in surplus. The banks have to hold it. 
Consequently, there is an $80 million cost there that will go to 
the banks.
<P>
	I suppose we should not perhaps worry about that too much, 
because the banks would then have an opportunity in some 
tangible way to contribute to our government's coffers. It would 
be an indirect tax, which would require no bookkeeping or 
anything. It is just an expense, for which they could no longer 
get reimbursement.
<P>
	However, the banks, like other businesses, are there to make a 
profit and retain their earnings. Undoubtedly they will recover 
that cost as one of their additional costs in other ways, which 
again will come out of the pocket of the consumer. There is a 
saving to the government, which will be taken out of the 
consumer's pocket in another form.
<P>
	Then we heard about the issue of seigniorage. This of course 
is very important. The difference between the value of the coin 
and the cost of its production is really quite significant. These 
new $2 coins are projected to cost around 16 cents each to 
produce, but of course their face value is $2. Therefore the 
difference, $1.84, is seigniorage. For every coin that is produced 
there is $1.84 benefit to the government. Here again the 
government's briefing notes to us included the fact that this is a 
large benefit to the government and they are expecting around 
$400 million of seigniorage.
<P>
	Let us ask ourselves the question. If we can do that by 
producing some 244 million coins and we can give a benefit to 
the government of almost half a billion dollars, the temptation 
arises to ask why we do not produce about 10 times as many of 
these coins. If we did that we could pay off $5 billion worth of 
the government's debt. Maybe we should do a hundred times as 
many coins and pay it all off. Then we would not have to pay any 
interest.
<P>
	The fact is that the seigniorage is another form of tax. The 
government issues a coin to a bank that pays $2 for it to the 
government. That is true. That is currency, which is really a 
representative value of each citizen's proportional share of the 
assets of this country. That is really what it is, because the coin 
in itself does not have the value. It is not a gold coin that is worth 
$2 in metal. It has a couple of components in it. It is nickel and 
things like that. The total value of the coin is 16 cents. So the 
coin has no inherent value. Hence, in a way very similar to our 
printed currency, it is a promissory note. It is a coin of value 
against the assets of the country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14373"> 14373 </A></B>
<P>
	If you increase the number of coins, then really you simply 
divide the value of the country among all the citizens. You 
would say that is done with the $2 bill right now. That is 
absolutely correct. If we take the $2 bills out of circulation and 
put the $2 coins into circulation, then there is no difference. 
The fact that we claim seigniorage on it is a magical rabbit 
trick, which tries to tell people that we now have more value 
to the Canadian government when we do not.
<P>
	I would like to talk a little about the changes that should be 
made to this bill.
<P>
<B>(2100 ) </B>
<P>
	As was indicated at the time we started to debate the bill 
today, we tried to introduce an amendment because we were 
concerned, as were all members of the committee. I hasten to 
remind members of the committee that we shared a concern 
regarding the implementation of the new currency. Even though 
it is outside the concern of this bill and outside the study of the 
committee, we were concerned about the implementation and 
the introduction of all the new coins: the new dime, nickel, 
quarter and 50-cent piece. Very few coin machines recognize 
the 50-cent piece. Most of them recognize nickels, dimes, 
quarters and loonies.
<P>
	When the new coins are introduced every one of them will 
require a coin recognition system for the three new coins. Two 
nickels, two dimes and two quarters will have to be recognized 
by the machine because they have different weight properties. 
Just that change would require an alteration to the mechanism 
that recognizes coins for all coin operated machines.
<P>
	In addition, the machines have to recognize the new 
two-dollar coin as well as the old loonie. Whereas the old ones 
had to recognize only four coins, the new mechanism will now 
have to recognize eight different coins.
<P>
	It is important to recognize that this change is a very costly 
one. There are some devices out there right now which, with a 
minimum of adjustment, will be able to accommodate the new 
machines. We have heard in committee testimony some 
estimates as low as $70 per machine. However there are many 
machines with mechanisms that will be obsolete. Individual 
owners of the machines will either be forced to replace them 
entirely or simply take the machines out of business. In some 
instances perhaps the individual will simply stop the business of 
coin operated machines.
<P>
	We have no idea how many machines are out there. We are 
talking about food vending machines, pop machines, cigarette 
vending machines and lottery machines. By listing the machines 
I am not indicating in any way my approval of them but they are 
out there. We also have telephones and parking meters.
<P>
	I know there was some giggling on the other side when the 
member from the Bloc was listing these items. That represented 
a lack of concern for all businesses, and there are many of them, 
that make their livelihood in this way.
<P>
	I received a letter from a person in an adjoining riding to 
mine. I assume he felt he would perhaps get a little better 
hearing from me than from his Liberal MP. Perhaps he wrote to 
me because I was on the committee and in opposition. It was not 
Edmonton Southeast; it was a different riding adjacent to mine 
and with a Liberal representative. We can all figure it out if we 
know the geography.
<P>
	The person said that he was in this business. He had a number 
of coin operated machines and because of his business he had a 
number of change making machines, machines which were 
geared up to making change for a two-dollar bill, a five-dollar 
bill and a ten-dollar bill. He said those machines would have to 
be changed. Either he would have to change his vending 
machines to recognize the two-dollar coin or he would have to 
change his change making machines to recognize the two-dollar 
coin. He also said it would cost a minimum of $750 each to alter 
the machines. This was how he made his living.
<P>
	The total cost of his small family business was $138,000. He 
said: ``This is a tremendous cost to me. If you just dump it on me 
it is far more than I can afford to take in one year''. Among all 
other considerations for going slowly on making these 
alterations that is another reason. He would have the opportunity 
to amortize the cost over a greater length of time without 
incurring huge interest costs.
<P>
<B>(2105) </B>
<P>
	We talked earlier today about lending money to small 
business people. I am sure he would have to borrow the money if 
this measure were implemented quickly. There is a cost that is 
very real and it is a large amount of money to him.
<P>
	There is another reason for giving a little better time line. 
Businesses cannot produce overnight the new coin 
identification devices. There must be time for research and 
development. We heard in committee testimony that the mint 
had not submitted true industrial quality samples of the coins. 
That is rightfully so because it has not been approved by 
Parliament. They need to get all the coins. They need to have all 
the nickels, both the dimes and both the quarters. The loonie 
stays the same but they need the new two-dollar coin. They need 
samples of the four new coins before they can begin their 
research and development into the design of the new 
mechanism.
<P>
	After that they have to build a prototype and go through 
sufficient testing to ascertain that those coin recognition devices 
are accurate and dependable. The last thing we want to do is to 
arrange the affairs of the country in such a way that the 
recognition devices of all business people who directly depend 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14374"> 14374 </A></B>
<P>
on our coinage  system and its acuity, size and weight will not 
clearly discriminate between them.
<P>
	Let me explain that. There are two kinds of errors the 
machines can make that are both very detrimental. The first 
error is that of not recognizing a legitimate coin. If a customer 
goes to a machine wanting to make a purchase and his new 
quarter and new two-dollar coins are rejected, he gets upset. We 
are told by people in the industry that when people submit a coin 
which is rejected several things happen. First, some of the 
rejections result in jamming so the person does not get the 
product or his coin back. Therefore the mechanism must be very 
reliable in recognizing legitimate coins. It must not jam. It must 
recognize them and accept them.
<P>
	Another thing that frustrates the customer is if he submits the 
coin and it goes straight through to the coin return pocket. He 
wants the machine to accept the coin because he wants to buy the 
product, whatever he is after. If he cannot get it because the 
machine will not accept the coin, he will probably kick the 
machine. The industry people told us that in committee. They 
say their coin recognition machines must be highly reliable 
because if they fail to recognize legitimate coins their machines 
are subject to a lot of vandalism.
<P>
<B>(2110) </B>
<P>
	We would not want to impose that on people who depend upon 
the Canadian government's coinage system. That is why they 
have to be given ample time to research and develop coin 
recognition machines.
<P>
	As I said there are two types of errors. One is failing to accept 
a legitimate coin. The other is failing to reject an illegitimate 
coin. That is every bit as important. Coin recognition devices 
must also have the ability to recognize a slug from the electrical 
department or a washer or something that is not a legitimate 
coin. The devices must reject those or the merchant will be 
ripped off. The devices must be very reliable.
<P>
	It is not realistic for us to pass Bill C-82 at the end of June and 
give the government the right to introduce these new coins in 
early 1996. That is less than a year away. It is just over six 
months away. That is not adequate and the industry has told us 
so.
<P>
	I will not make several pejorative statements to the 
government. I will rather try to appeal to its common sense and 
concern for the business people that we have heard expressed 
often. I am challenging the government to put actions to its 
words. I appeal to its business sense and to its sense of caring for 
Canadian people. That is what we are here for.
<P>
	A very legitimate concern is that the coin recognition systems 
have to be developed. They have to be brought into production. 
As I said that requires a research and development phase, a 
testing phase of the prototypes and then full production. After 
that the devices get shipped out. In some cases they will be 
retrofits for existing mechanisms. In other cases they will be 
actual replacements. The merchants will have to take the old  
device out of the machine and replace it completely with a new 
one. Sometimes that will involve changing from some of the old 
mechanical devices to the new electronic devices. It may mean 
wiring changes. It can mean all sorts of different things. In some 
cases it will mean the changing of the solenoids that actually 
operate the delivery systems.
<P>
	We have to give industry time for the research, the 
development, the testing, the production and the installation. If 
we in the House believe that by snapping our fingers and passing 
a law it can be done overnight, it is not realistic. I appeal to 
members opposite to do it right.
<P>
	I remember a colleague at the technical institute where I 
worked who used to have a little placard over his desk that read: 
``If you don't have time to do it right, when will you find time to 
do it again?'' That is the issue here. If we do not do it right we 
will produce a lot of frustration and anger. Right now we are 
already facing that. Many small business people I talk to keep 
crying about the GST. A lot of the vending machine operators 
are in that category. They landed up picking up the tab for GST 
out of their own pockets. They were opposed to it. They are still 
opposed to it. They are saying: ``The government said it would 
eliminate it and it is still here. When will that happen?''
<P>
	There is already a deep anger across the country about the 
GST and other unfair taxes. If we add this frustration and 
difficulty for the same people again it will further erode the 
respect of people for the government and their willingness to 
participate in our economy through our voluntary tax system. 
Without that, the whole system would fail.
<P>
<B>(2115 ) </B>
<P>
	We need to make certain we do this right. If the government is 
going to go through with this despite my previous pleading that 
it is not economic and should not be done, then at least it should 
get the timing right. That is very important.
<P>
	In my previous speech I asked the minister a number of 
questions. The minister was kind enough to give me a written 
response. In his covering letter he said: ``Thank you for your 
letter''. After the speech I received a phone call in my office. I 
was asked to submit my questions in writing and the minister 
would provide answers to them. He said: ``I trust these 
responses will satisfy your concerns and that you will now be in 
a position to support Bill C-82''.
<P>
	Frankly I am appreciative of the minister and his staff taking 
the time to answer my questions. They covered about five or six 
pages.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14375"> 14375 </A></B>
<P>
	I regret the answers are insufficient. For example, I asked 
what was the estimated total impact on the retail sector, 
including items such as cashier trays and coin counting 
machines. Basically the answer was that one year ago the 
industry estimated it would cost $25 million. Since then they 
have raised their cost to $80 million and the last line is: ``The 
cost of adjustment will vary''. In other words, the government 
does not have the answer. That is not good enough. Until we 
have those answers it should not jam this bill through.
<P>
	I asked what the effect would be on the economy. Again, some 
answers were given but they were very general. No real work has 
been done. Consider the soft drink industry.
<P>
	Again we urge the government to consider not having a new 
$2 dollar coin. If it costs too much to print $2 bills, just 
eliminate them. I know there are two sides to the argument of 
eliminating the $2 currency. We do this for values less than $1. 
If you look at our currencies for less than $1 we go from 1 cent to 
5 cents. Why can we not go from a $1 coin to a $5 bill? It is 
exactly the same. I am not going to repeat myself but I insist it is 
absolutely the same. If you go from 1 cent coin to a 5 cent coin 
that is parallel to going from $1 coin to a $5 bill.
<P>
	I am not going to repeat what I said in my previous speech. If 
anybody is interested in this I urge them to read it since I gave a 
really good, well thought out, well documented speech when 
this bill was debated previously. I raised the same point then that 
with the weight of these coins we are talking about the 
difference to a person of having to carry an extra one-half 
ounce. That is the difference.
<P>
	Some members opposite may disagree. For a small fee I will 
give a math lesson after hours. I would have to ask the 
government to seriously consider that as an option. It would not 
cost a great deal to implement that change, only the cost of 
producing the currency. If we are going to stay with the $2 
currency, there is one thing that was not properly considered: the 
use of a more durable substrate. That has not been studied.
<P>
	The current $2 bills wear out very rapidly. That is because the 
quality of the paper provided is not adequate for the kind of 
circulation these $2 bills get.
<P>
	We talked to suppliers of the substrate for the printing of the 
bills. They said with the new plasticized material they could 
produce a $2 note that could last two to four times as long and it 
would only cost marginally more to produce. Has that been 
studied as an alternative? As far as we know it has not and we 
think it should be.
<P>
	We had many other questions. I would concede that some 
were adequately answered. When I asked if dropping the $2 
denomination was considered, the government simply answered 
that eliminating the $2 coin was considered and rejected. It then 
went on to say that Canadians depend on the $2 note for a great  
number of their transactions. I believe that to be true because it 
is there.
<P>
<B>(2120) </B>
<P>
	However, if the next denomination in paper were $5 we would 
still only be required to carry four coins in order to produce the 
$4 and the next one would be the $5 and then we would have the 
change in between as well.
<P>
	With all that being said, the message I want to give to the 
members opposite is one that is very clear. I appeal to their 
common sense to reject this bill but failing that, I would like to 
at least have it amended. The work of this Parliament is to pass 
good laws. Is that not our prayer at the beginning of each day: 
``Help us to pass good laws?''
<P>
	However, included in that definition is that we must reject bad 
laws or we must amend bad portions of laws before we pass them 
so they will be good laws.
<P>
	Therefore I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the word ``that'' 
and substituting the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-82, an act to amend the Royal Canadian Mint Act be not now read a 
third time, but be referred back to the Standing Committee on Government 
Operations for the purpose of reconsidering clause 1.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That clause is with respect to the issue of the timing of the 
bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I want to assure the members opposite that I will 
not be long, but it is only fair that having seconded an 
amendment that I speak briefly to it. I assure members opposite, 
who I know are concerned about the time, that I will be the only 
Reformer speaking on the amendment.
<P>
	All across Canada, Canadians are doing business today. They 
were buying and selling. They were working and travelling. 
They were caring for kids and patients in hospitals. That is the 
real Canada. In here we are debating minting a $2 coin in place 
of a $2 bill when this country is going $100 million a day in the 
hole. That is a really sad case to consider.
<P>
	I just want to briefly outline why we suggest that a January 
1996 implementation date is not a reasonable and fair 
imposition on small business, which is the engine of our 
economy.
<P>
	In the bill the government has failed to address the actual cost 
to the industry of the conversion to a $2 coin. My hon. colleague 
from Elk Island has given us 101 on the cost of implementing 
this bill and certainly a 101 course on vending machines and the 
problems involved in converting them to accept $2 coins in the 
new regime that is being planned by the Canadian Mint under 
the supervision of the minister of public works.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14376"> 14376 </A></B>
<P>
	The cost to the industry will be substantial and in all 
likelihood these costs will be passed down to the consumer. As 
just an example for comparison, when pulp prices increased 
there was an increase in the price of newsprint resulting in an 
increase in the price of newspapers which was then passed on 
to the consumer. The same will happen with the vending 
machine industry.
<P>
	Three organizations have asked the government to reconsider 
this proposal and, in particular, the implementation timetable 
for Bill C-82. They are the Canadian Soft Drink Association, the 
Canadian Automatic Vending Merchandising Association and 
the Canadian Bankers Association. The CSDA represents 
manufacturers and distributors of soft drinks across Canada. 
Members distribute their products through approximately 
100,000 vending machines. The CSDA, along with all vending 
industries, is requesting that the federal government delay by 
one year the introduction of the new coins to provide adequate 
time to convert existing coin mechanisms to new ones.
<P>
<B>(2125) </B>
<P>
	Paulette Vinette, president and CEO of the Canadian Soft 
Drink Distributors Association estimates that it will cost its 
industry $200 per machine to convert existing mechanisms to 
accept the new coins and as much as $600 to replace an existing 
mechanism. The total cost to the industry would be 
approximately $30 million.
<P>
	The Canadian Automatic Vending Machine Association 
estimates that changes to pop, potato chip and candy machines 
will cost between $75 and $800. The total cost of conversion to 
the industry, according to Canadian Automatic Vending, will be 
as much as $80 million. This $80 million cost also includes the 
government's plans to replace the metal alloy used in pennies, 
nickels, dimes, quarters and 50-cent pieces with cheaper plated 
steel coins.
<P>
	They also bemoan the fact that the proposed date of 
implementation will not provide the industry with enough time 
to develop and implement the required modifications. That is a 
real problem. The industry has yet to receive sample coins from 
the Mint so that it can develop coin recognition equipment.
<P>
	Vending machine operators are asking that the federal 
government provide compensation to help defray the cost of 
conversion to some 200,000 pop and candy machines. These 
operators insist that they are unfairly bearing the burden of cost 
cutting by the government.
<P>
	In 1967, when the government fiddled with the metal content 
of the coin, the government agreed to compensate vending 
machine operators for half the replacement costs of the coin 
mechanisms. That is not the case in this bill, therefore more time 
should be offered to the industry.
<P>
	Cash registers will also have to accommodate the extra coin. 
Instead of having five slots for coins, the registers will have to 
have six. This will result in additional costs for the cash register 
users.
<P>
	The Canadian Bankers Association also has concerns with the 
introduction of the $2 coin, as I pointed out during second 
reading. The Canadian Bankers Association has proposed a total 
abandoning of the $2 coin as mentioned by my colleague from 
Elk Island.
<P>
	The banks have anywhere from $30 to $50 million in excess 
loonies sitting in the vaults and as the government has refused to 
take back the surplus coins, the banks are unable to earn interest 
on that money. This is likely to be repeated with the $2 coin.
<P>
	The government is so confident that the Commons will 
approve the $2 coin that it has asked manufacturers for quotes to 
deliver 25 million blanks by the beginning of October 1, 1995.
<P>
	The Reform Party proposes that the government reconsider its 
decision to delay the introduction of the coin for a year. This will 
allow vending operators the time needed to convert the 
machines. Ideally we should scrap the coin but if that does not 
happen, we should certainly delay its implementation.
<P>
	Mark my words, there will be big problems if the government 
pushes this ahead too quickly. The minister of public works has 
not shown good judgment in the past and he is not showing good 
judgment now by insisting on ramming this legislation through 
before the industry and small business people have time to 
adjust to its consequences. I would appeal to the minister to be 
more considerate.
<P>
	In closing, I want to update the House. In my speech at second 
reading I recognized that the government was probably going to 
ram this bill through. We would prefer that it did not ram it 
through but it probably will. We would prefer if it was to ram it 
through that it would consider some amendments.
<P>
	If it is going to go through, those members have said that they 
want suggestions for what should be put on the $2 coin. I made a 
suggestion at second reading and surprisingly enough it is 
getting a lot of support from across the country.
<P>
	I ask that the minister of public works consider putting a 
replica of the Hanson buck, a white tailed deer on the $2 coin. I 
did that to deal with some disparity in the images and the 
representations on our bills.
<P>
	I have to be careful not to use props in the House but I am 
using real notes. We have a $20 bill which was actually donated 
by the hon. member for Simcoe Centre to the Heart Foundation 
for me to ride a bicycle to raise money for the Heart Foundation 
this coming weekend.
<P>
	It has on it a replica of the common loon swimming in a pond.

<P>
<B>(2130) </B>
<P>
	We have the $10 dollar bill with a replica of the osprey. It is a 
beautiful animal. May I have a donation to my cause by from the 
hon. member from Kingston and the Islands? I appreciate that he 
donated five dollars for me to ride this bike on the weekend to 
raise dollars for the heart foundation.
<P>
	The $5 dollar bill has on it a belted king fisher, a beautiful 
animal as well. Then we are to get rid of the two dollar bill. It has 
on it a very nice picture of two robins. I guess we will have to say 
goodbye to the robins and have a new coin.
<P>
	We have the loonie in existence already and it has a loon on its 
tail side. The quarter has a caribou. The loon actually is from the 
wetlands; the caribou is from the north. Our next coin is the 
dime with the Bluenose on it, representing the history of the 
Maritimes and the wonderful history surrounding the <I>Bluenose</I>.
<P>
	The next denomination is the five cent piece with a beaver on 
it, representing the development of Canada when the fur trade 
occurred and the country was inhabited by trappers and traders 
looking for this pelt. The penny has a maple leaf.
<P>
	It so happens the prairies were overlooked in all these 
symbols and so I have recommended to the minister of public 
works and to the Canadian mint that they consider a replica of 
the Hanson buck on our new $2 dollar coin should they go ahead 
with it. I have a lot of support for this idea. I have had support 
from people from Halifax to Montreal. Fellow members of 
Parliament have supported this.
<P>
	A newspaper report said I wanted to put a dead deer on the $2 
dollar coin. I do not know if that beaver is alive, but I know the 
Hanson buck was and was a beautiful animal. It represents a 
world champion record for the nicest antlers of any white tail 
ever taken. It broke an 80 year old record held by the Americans 
and certainly it would be a wonderful replica, a wonderful image 
to put on our $2 dollar coin should we pass this bill. It is elegant. 
It has been represented in paintings, in photographs. It 
represents an animal that has been an environmental success 
through proper conservation practices.
<P>
	If the minister goes ahead with this $2 dollar coin, please 
delay its implementation. I ask the minister to consider putting 
the Hanson buck on the coin.
<P>
	I encourage entrepreneurs who might be listening to invest 
and start manufacturing men's suspenders because our pants 
will weigh a lot more with our pockets full of $2 dollar coins. 
Women's apparel manufacturers may need more shoulder 
shoulder pads and probably stronger purse straps.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lastewka:</B> Mr. Speaker, being a new member I would 
from time to time like to get clarifications on using props in the

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> We will now debate Group No. 1.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to address Bill C-65, an 
act to reorganize and dissolve certain federal agencies. As we 
are all aware, the government is proposing to get rid of many 
boards and commissions and reduce drastically a great number 
of them for greater efficiency and as a cost saving measure.
<P>
	One of the agencies which interests me greatly is the National 
Capital Commission. The bill proposes the membership of the 
National Capital Commission be composed as follows: two from 
the city of Ottawa, one from the city of Hull, one from a local 
municipality in Ontario, other than the city of Ottawa, one from 
a local municipality in Quebec, other than the city of Hull, and 
eight from Canada generally, other than from the cities or 
municipalities just referred to. Clauses (c) and (d) give me great 
concern, the ones that refer to a local municipality in Ontario 
and a local municipality in Quebec. I shall explain.
<P>
<B>(2140) </B>
<P>
	I would like to replace this with my motion:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-65 in clause 54 be amended by replacing lines 22 to 25 on page 
14 with the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(c) one from a municipality in Ontario, other than the city of Ottawa, wholly or 
partly within the national capital region</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(d) one from a municipality in Quebec, other than the city of Hull, wholly or 
partly within the national capital region.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	My explanation for this is it has been the practice to have 
representation from local municipalities around the capital city 
of Ottawa. In Ontario a local municipality could be Sarnia, 
Kapuskasing, Smiths Falls, Kingston or a variety of other 
places. We have like in the province of Quebec, regional 
municipalities such as the Muncipalité régionale 
d'Ottawa-Carleton, and we have, du côté de l'outaouais, la 
Municipalité régionale de l'Outaouais.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Just like Montreal has the MUC, the Montreal Urban 
Community. I may add that these regional municipalities 
represent several local municipalities.
<P>
	So when the definition refers to a local municipality, this is 
not the same as a regional municipality. In this particular case, 
we must remember there is a difference between a local 
municipality and a regional municipality, which could be, 
Kapuskasing or Hearst, for instance. We should refer to the 
National Capital Region. And to justify this explanation, we 
consult the-
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The National Capital Act, chapter N-4, section 2, gives a 
description of the national capital region. It gives a description 
of all the municipalities surrounding the national capital, 
Ottawa. In the description it talks of Gatineau, Aylmer, Hull and 
on the Ontario side it talks of Gloucester, Cumberland, Nepean 
and a dozen other local municipalities.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14380"> 14380 </A></B>
<P>
	The reference here is that in the National Capital Act it is 
well defined what is meant by a local municipality. People do 
not juggle from one act to the other. When governments change 
and commission memberships change or board memberships 
change I would not appreciate seeing errors made and instead 
of having a representative from a local municipality of the 
national capital region, having a local municipality within the 
province of Ontario or the province of Quebec.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	And now there will be representatives from the Province of 
Quebec. The last part mentions eight members from Canada 
generally. Ontario, of course, will not be left out. It will also 
have a representative among the additional eight.
<P>
[English] 
<P>
	The government is proposing the national commission should 
be reduced from 20 to 15 members appointed by the governor in 
council, which translates into a reduction of five members. It is 
something I agree with but, as I was stating, it is extremely 
important that the local municipality in the region be respected.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We have the city of Gloucester, for instance, where 52 per cent 
of the land belongs to the federal government. This means that 
there is a lot of negotiating with the federal government. 
Activities within the Greenbelt or at Ottawa Airport, for 
instance, are very restricted. Infrastructure projects always 
require agreements between the municipalities and the NCC.
<P>
<B>(2145) </B>
<P>
	If you go from Ottawa to Cumberland, you have to go through 
Gloucester, and if you want to build sewer mains or water pipes, 
you have to negotiate agreements with the NCC. That is why it is 
so important for local municipalities within the National Capital 
Region to be included. The same applies on the Quebec side. For 
instance, we have Gatineau and also Aylmer, which is involved 
in the National Capital Region.
<P>
	My motion reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``(c) one from a municipality in Ontario, other than the city of Ottawa, wholly or 
partly within the National Capital Region;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Paragraph (d) would read:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(d) one from a municipality in Quebec, other than the city of Hull, wholly or 
partly within the National Capital Region;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I appreciate the support I received for this amendment from 
the Minister responsible for the Privy Council and 
Intergovernmental Affairs and the government. This proves 
once again that the government is very flexible when it 
introduces legislation, and that it listens to government and 
opposition members when they make reasonable suggestions. 
Personally, I believe it is entirely reasonable to make sure that 
the wording of the bill is clear.
<P>
	The way the bill was worded originally, my local municipality 
in Ontario was confusing and a local municipality in Quebec 
was confusing, and by ensuring that the local municipality is 
within the National Capital Region, either on the Quebec side or 
the Ontario side, we comply with the National Capital Act's 
definition of the boundaries of the region. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank you for giving me this opportunity to explain the reasons 
for my amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be 
speaking on the motions in Group No. 1, and I may have 
something to say on the other groups later. Thank you. I am 
pleased to speak once again in the debate on Bill C-65, an act to 
reorganize and dissolve certain federal agencies.
<P>
	As I mentioned in my last speech on this bill, Bill C-65 
changes and reorganizes 15 federal agencies by reducing the 
number of their members. It also dismantles seven other federal 
organizations. I say dismantles, because their function becomes 
incorporated into a sector department, in certain instances, or is 
amalgamated with that of another organization.
<P>
	There are 16 motions for amendment to this bill; 11 are from 
Bloc members, four are from the Reform member for Elk Island 
and one is from the Liberal member for Carleton-Gloucester, 
who has just spoken to us. I would first like to express my 
unequivocal support for Motions Nos. 1, 3, 7, 9, 11, 14, 15, and 
16 tabled by the members for Trois-Rivières, Chicoutimi, 
Châteauguay, Québec-Est and Joliette, respectively.
<P>
	In essence, these motions recommend that the main 
appointments to the boards of government agencies be made 
only after consultation with the government of each province, 
not only Quebec, but of all the provinces in Canada, and with the 
approval of the standing committee of the House normally 
charged with matters concerning the sectoral department 
responsible for these agencies. In this case, Heritage Canada, 
the Department of National Defence and the Department of 
Industry and other departments are involved with certain 
agencies.
<P>
	I invite the members of the House to also support Motions 
Nos. 4, 5, and 6, which I proposed and for which notices were 
given on May 15.
<P>
<B>(2150) </B>
<P>
	These motions propose, respectively, that the appointments of 
the chairperson and vice-chairperson of the Canada Council, the 
executive director of the Canadian Film Development 
Corporation and a maximum of ten members including the 
chairperson of the Canadian Cultural Property Export Review 
Board be made only ``following consultation with the 
government of each province and with the approval of the 
standing committee of the House of Commons that normally 
considers cultural matters-in this instance, the Standing 
Committee on Canadian Heritage.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14381"> 14381 </A></B>
<P>
	The idea of cutting political appointments by order in 
Council, in reality by the Prime Minister's office, is aimed at 
reducing the arbitrary decisions and the waste of public money. 
This bill tries to put an end to patronage and too high a number 
of what I would call almost honourary appointments.
<P>
	However, <I>The Globe and Mail</I> has revealed over the past year 
that, despite Bill C-65, under the Liberal government, political 
appointments are being made with renewed vigour. In several 
instances, the elimination of any legal reference to advisory 
bodies leads us to question the genuineness of the 
Liberals'commitment to administrative transparency.
<P>
	Will the House of Commons have a say regarding 
appointments to advisory bodies which will no longer have a 
legal status? Whither transparency? This question is central to 
the whole debate; Bill C-65 provides only a timid answer.
<P>
	Under its present form and without the amendments brought 
forward by the Bloc Quebecois, we cannot support this bill. The 
motions brought forward by the Bloc Quebecois are aimed at 
making clearer and more transparent the appointment process to 
the boards of the bodies mentioned in there.
<P>
	We are in agreement with Motion No. 13 presented by the 
member for Carleton-Gloucester to the effect that a member of 
the National Capital Commission, other than the chairperson 
and vice-chairperson, must come from a municipality in 
Ontario, other than the city of Ottawa-and the member 
adds-from a municipality wholly or partly within the National 
Capital Region.
<P>
	Also, under the motion presented by the member for 
Carleton-Gloucester, a member of the Commission must come 
from a municipality in Quebec, other than the city of Hull-and 
the member adds-wholly or partly within the National Capital 
Region.
<P>
	What would be more normal than having commission 
members come from the area covered by the National Capital 
Commission? We believe that this proposal is important and 
should be accepted. In a few minutes I will deal with the other 
groups.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
begin my debate on Group No. 1 by saying that in general we in 
the Reform Party believe the provinces ought to be more 
involved in issues that affect them directly.
<P>
	In general, we agree with the impetus of the motions in this 
group put forward by the members of the Bloc. I would like to 
qualify that agreement and also ask a question about the 
reasonableness of this in terms of the total amount of 
bureaucratic and administrative time that would be taken to 
administer these things as they are proposing.
<P>
	They are basically saying that before the governor in council 
appointments are made they should be approved by the various 
provinces. Although I said that in general we agree the 
provinces should be more involved in the workings of our 
country, I do not believe it should be done in this way.
<P>
	They speak of contacting the lieutenant governor in each 
province. If we stop to think about it, the lieutenant governor is 
an appointed, unelected position, so this is not necessarily going 
to get the democratic input from the people. That would 
probably be the greatest reason for us to oppose most of the 
motions in this group.
<P>
<B>(2155) </B>
<P>
	I would like to speak about several of the motions. The hon. 
member from the Liberal Party who spoke earlier talked about 
the necessity of having input into the board of the National 
Capital Commission. He was quite concerned that there should 
be more representation from areas around the region. In other 
words, if they are not a part of Ottawa they should be included if 
they are adjacent to Ottawa.
<P>
	There are two parts to the administration of the different 
functions. Whether it is the National Capital Commission, one 
of the museums, or something else, these people do two things. 
They generally oversee the administration of the facilities. And 
they are wonderful facilities; I do not want to minimize them in 
any way. However, another aspect of this, which is so important 
and which is overlooked, is that the taxpayers come from across 
the entire country.
<P>
	I did not have the privilege of visiting the canal during the 
winter festival, but I was told by someone who went there that 
every garbage can has NCC written on it. In other words, the 
National Capital Commission owns the garbage cans. I suppose 
that is good. If there are people skating on the canal they have to 
have garbage cans, and if it is under the jurisdiction of the 
National Capital Commission then they should be identified. 
However, the question occurred to me: What possible fiscal 
interest could any voter living more than 100 miles away from 
Ottawa have in buying garbage cans for the city of Ottawa?
<P>
	I would be opposed to the idea of concentrating more heavily 
the representation on the board in terms of the people who want 
to spend the money and try to increase it for those who are more 
distant, who would have a greater interest in trying to save the 
money.
<P>
	It is sort of a spend versus save conflict we have, and it needs 
to be balanced according to the different regions. There is no 
doubt in my mind that the formula should specify very clearly 
which regions of the country the members should come from. I 
do not think it should necessarily be the lieutenant governor in 
the province who should be involved in the consultation. There 
should be a better mechanism for that. Perhaps it could be the 
choice of elected legislatures putting forward a slate from which 
people could be chosen.

	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am very pleased to be able to take the floor on Bill C-65, an act 
to reorganize and dissolve certain federal agencies.
<P>
	My motion deals more specifically with the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency, or ACOA, and reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-65, in Clause 2, be amended by replacing line 14, on page 1, with 
the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``recommendations of the Minister, following consultation with the 
Lieutenant Governor of each province in Atlantic Canada and with the 
approval of the standing committee of the House of Commons, that normally 
considers matters relating to industry, to hold of-''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The goal of this motion is both simple and two fold. We would 
like that the government of each of the Atlantic provinces, as 
well as all the members normally interested in such matters, that 
is the members of the industry committee, be involved in the 
appointments.
<P>
<B>(2200) </B>
<P>
	This would make for a better climate in government and fulfil 
a need. We know that it is rewarding to be a Liberal, as the <I>Globe 
and Mail </I>showed, but our amendment would avoid situations 
like the one we are experiencing, where the minister responsible 
for ACOA recently nominated political organizers to the board 
of a federal agency based in his riding.
<P>
	This is the kind of thing we want to correct or at the very least 
avoid.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John English (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
the opportunity to respond to some of the comments made on 
these amendments.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Excuse me. There are two other 
members who wish to speak. Would the member wish to wait 
until everybody else has spoken on these amendments? Is that 
acceptable? Very well.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to take part in the debate on the amendments proposed by the 
official opposition to Bill C-65, an act to reorganize and 
dissolve certain federal agencies. As you know, this bill amends 
the statutes that establish fifteen federal boards, agencies or 
commissions, in order to reorganize them or to reduce the 
number of their members. The bill also dissolves seven federal 
organizations.
<P>
	Since the bill received first reading on December 14, the 
official opposition has been emphasizing the importance of 
using this opportunity to improve the democratic process in the 
public service. Indeed, we feel it is important to democratize the 
appointment process for office holders within the organizations 
affected by this legislation. We want less patronage and more 
transparency. It is in that spirit that the Bloc is presenting a 
series of ten amendments.
<P>
	I want to concentrate on the amendment which deals with 
subclause 25(2) of the bill. That clause amends a provision of 
the Emergency Preparedness Act. More specifically, the bill 
seeks to increase the ministerial responsibility. To that end, it 
more or less replaces Emergency Preparedness Canada by the 
minister himself. In other words, the minister will assume full 
responsibility with respect to the development and 
implementation of civil emergency plans.
<P>
	It is in regard to the implementation of these plans that we 
want to make a suggestion to the government. Subclause 25(2) 
of the bill currently reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The responsibilities of the Minister with respect to the implementation of 
civil emergency plans are</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) to monitor any potential, imminent or actual civil emergency and to report, 
as required, to other ministers on the emergency and any measures necessary 
for dealing with it;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We feel that the minister should also have to report to the 
government of each province. An emergency situation, whether 
potential, imminent or actual, is never something which takes 
place in isolation. It may be potential or obvious, but it always 
concerns a specific place, community, region or province. This 
is why we feel that provincial authorities should be informed of 
the measures taken by the federal minister responsible for 
emergency preparedness.
<P>
	This is too good an opportunity to miss. I would like to refer to 
a civil emergency that has forever scarred my riding, the 
electoral district of Châteauguay. The events of the summer of 
1990 were officially classified as a provincial emergency under 
the Emergency Preparedness Act as a matter of fact.
<P>
	All the hon. members will remember that, on July 11, 1990, 
armed warriors withstood a tactical operation carried out by the 
Sûreté du Québec in the Oka area. Following this, another group 
of warriors blocked access to the Mercier bridge linking the 
greater Châteauguay area to Montreal Island. As a result of this 
coup de force, more than 80,000 commuters were unable to 
cross the bridge, with implications that are still underestimated. 
Peaceful people were the victims of this action. Businesses were 
closed, jobs were lost and incalculable time was lost because of 
detours.

<B><A NAME="14383"> 14383 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(2205) </B>
<P>
	We know that the handling of this crisis was a disaster. This 
lack of initiative was one of the main reasons why the Liberals 
were defeated in the last provincial election. That government 
was weak. This was a government without backbone or vision 
and dependent on this Canadian constitution which no longer 
meets modern-day needs.
<P>
	This government which has seen one of its cabinet members 
fly off to Ottawa after losing the last provincial election is now 
advocating the constitutional status quo like its leader. This 
status quo, however, could well plunge the city of Châteauguay 
into another crisis, since this constitution contains no specific 
division of responsibilities between the parties involved. After 
having demanded, with her former leader, constitutional 
changes, how can a former Quebec minister stand for the status 
quo? Moreover, no effort has been made to set up real 
negotiations between the native peoples and the federal 
government on their respective rights and responsibilities.
<P>
	At least the federal government did not step in on its own 
initiative. It only acted at the request of the Quebec government, 
fortunately. We can easily assume that if the federal government 
had stepped in on its own, it would have messed up things even 
more.
<P>
	Now, to get back to the case in point with Bill C-65. 
According to this piece of legislation, the minister would only 
have to report to his or her fellow cabinet members. Everybody 
will agree with me that, in such circumstances, it would be 
unthinkable for the Quebec government not to be officially 
informed of the measures taken by the minister.
<P>
	This is a good example that shows the need for the amendment 
to Bill C-65 moved by the Bloc Quebecois. We think it is 
important that the federal minister be required to report to his 
provincial counterpart when he implements civil emergency 
plans and more particularly when he monitors any situation of 
potential, imminent or real crisis. Public security requires 
positive discussions between all governments and public 
authorities.
<P>
	The federal government should not overlook its 
responsibilities when it reorganizes or abolishes any of its 
agencies, as it does under Bill C-65. That is also true of the 
minister who becomes responsible for Emergency Preparedness 
Canada. His duty to co-ordinate with provincial and local 
authorities must not be limited to the development and 
implementation of civil emergency plans. He must also report to 
all public authorities concerned by the actions he will take in 
matters of civil defence, including provinces.
<P>
	It is a question of good co-ordination but also a question of 
transparency. The federal government is concentrating powers 
in the hands of the ministers. This concentration increases the 
risk of abuse, discretionary decisions, partisan treatments and 
arbitrary choices. Therefore it is increasingly necessary to 
establish transparency mechanisms in order to preserve the 
integrity of the government.
<P>
	The Auditor General of Canada keeps asking for such 
accountability mechanisms. They are even more necessary 
when power is placed in the hands of fewer people. This is what 
is happening now within the federal government, and Bill C-65 
is another move in that direction.
<P>
	This is why the Bloc Quebecois is presenting amendments 
asking for more transparency. This is what we want when we ask 
that the minister responsible for civil preparedness be 
accountable to the provinces, when we ask that the lieutenant 
governor in council of each province be consulted before some 
of the appointments, when we ask that the appropriate standing 
committee of the House approve some of the appointments and 
when we ask that each provincial government be consulted 
before certain appointments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill C-65 
received a lot of publicity. The minister responsible for the bill 
had announced very proudly that it was very important because 
it would have the effect of eliminating several government 
agencies that had become useless and cutting back others.
<P>
<B>(2210) </B>
<P>
	There is no need to exaggerate the importance of this bill 
financially since we are talking about savings of only $4 
million. For the people who are listening to us, it takes only 
about an hour and a quarter for the Canadian deficit to absorb $4 
million.
<P>
	Through this very important bill on the streamlining of some 
agencies and the elimination of others, the government will have 
made it possible to pay for an hour and a quarter of the Canadian 
deficit. This is not as important as the minister would have had 
us believe when he made the announcement.
<P>
	On the other hand, there is something that could have been 
more important than the amount of money. We agree with 
trimming the government, and when it comes to savings, even a 
paltry $4 million, we must seize the opportunity. This is not the 
reason why we are criticizing the government. If we criticize the 
government, it is because while saving these $4 million, it could 
have taken the opportunity to improve the appointment process 
in these governmental agencies.
<P>
	In its red book, chapter 6, the Liberal Party promised to 
restore integrity in our political institutions. One of the 
recommendations to increase this integrity is to have a thorough 
review of order in council appointments.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14384"> 14384 </A></B>
<P>
	During all the years they were sitting in opposition, the 
Liberals were always criticizing the political appointments 
made by the Conservative government and they were promising 
to review the whole appointment system for people sitting on 
boards, commissions and agencies.
<P>
	Unfortunately, in this bill, the government is not proposing 
anything radical to change this appointment system which 
allows the government to reward its friends. If the Liberal Party 
had wanted to keep its promise, it would have added a clause 
specifying that all appointments should be approved by a 
parliamentary committee.
<P>
	The government did not have the courage to do that. It 
preferred to maintain an unclear partisan appointment system. 
Its decision to simply reduce the number of board members is 
only a diversion tactic. The appointment process in itself 
remains the same.
<P>
	To prove it, I would like to quote major changes made in this 
bill. For example, let us take the Petro-Canada Limited Act. 
Section 64 to be amended by the bill reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``There shall be a Board of Directors of the Corporation consisting of the 
Chairman of the Board, the President of the Corporation and not more than 
thirteen other persons''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This was the old section. The new clause reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``There shall be a Board of Directors of the Corporation consisting of the 
Chairperson of the Board, the President of the Corporation and one other 
person.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The only fundamental difference between these two versions 
is that the number of directors is reduced from 15 to 3. I can see 
savings related to the attendance fees paid by these corporations 
to directors.
<P>
	The second subclause deals with the way directors are 
appointed to the corporation. Under the old section, the thirteen 
other directors of Petro-Canada, for example, were appointed 
by the minister, with the approval of the Governor in Council, to 
hold office during pleasure for a term not exceeding three years.
<P>
	The new clause provides that the director still to be appointed, 
since the chairperson and the president of the corporation are ex 
officio members, the director who is neither the chairperson of 
the board nor the president of the corporation shall also be 
appointed by the minister, with the approval of the Governor in 
Council, to hold office during pleasure for a term not exceeding 
three years. Therefore, nothing has changed.
<P>
<B>(2215) </B>
<P>
	When we look at both texts, we realize that the only thing 
changed is the number of board members. Nothing at all has 
been changed in the vague and partisan process of appointing 
people to these boards. That is why we say that this system must 
go. Measures have to be taken to put an end to the patronage 
system.
<P>
	Let me quote, as an example, a very well-documented article 
published in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> of February 7, under the 
headline: «Liberal loyalty being rewarded with jobs, jobs, 
jobs». The article explained the philosophy of the Liberals on 
party friends. According to the article, more than 100 persons 
close to the Liberals were appointed over the first fifteen months 
of the Chrétien government: former candidates; a nephew of the 
Prime Minister; a fundraiser for the party; an organizer, and 
mostly, more than 15 defeated candidates who have all been 
generously rewarded for services rendered to the Liberal Party, 
out of the public purse. This is the function of crown 
corporations.
<P>
	The recent appointment of Jacques Saada, Liberal candidate 
defeated in La Prairie, is one of the most obvious examples of 
patronage. Mr. Saada, who is a friend of the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs, was hired to implement a communication plan for 
CIDA.
<P>
	Since Mr. Saada is a translator by trade, we have a hard time 
figuring out where he acquired the experience and the expertise 
required to prepare a communication plan for CIDA. Moreover, 
his contract amounts to a tidy $99,150 for one year. What a 
coincidence. It is just under the $100,000 limit over which the 
government has to call for tenders, in which case Mr. Saada 
would likely not have won because of his lack of experience and 
expertise in that area. The name is Saada.
<P>
	Sometimes we have difficulty understanding when friends are 
involved. We can easily forget their names, but I am glad to 
remind the House of it. That explains the importance they 
wanted to give to the bill. These are the savings to be made. But 
fundamentally there is nothing changed. Friends of the 
government will continue to be appointed to the boards of large 
crown corporations et large para-governmental corporations. 
They could at least have done things differently.
<P>
	Many of those large agencies, and this is another feature of 
this bill, have an impact on the taxation of provinces and many 
of those agencies and boards in the bill definitely have an 
impact. Nowhere in the amendments proposed by the 
government are provinces consulted nor do they take part in the 
decisions which are taken. This is why we have proposed an 
amendment, a motion. That is Motion No. 16 that I moved, 
seconded by my colleague for La Prairie, which reads: ``That 
Bill C-65, in Clause 64, be amended by replacing lines 11 and 
12, on page 17, with the following:''
<P>
	The board members I spoke about earlier should be appointed 
by the minister to hold office during pleasure, but not in a 
discretionary way; they should be appointed by the minister 
following consultation with the government of each province, 
since these corporations have an influence on the administration 
of the provinces, and with the approval of the governor in 
council and, moreover, of the standing committee of the House 
of Commons that normally considers matters relating to 
industry.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14385"> 14385 </A></B>
<P>
	If we want to practice openness to improve the situation, if 
we want to fundamentally change what is not working properly, 
we must be straightforward and honest and deal with the real 
problems.
<P>
	I hope this amendment will be supported not only by my 
colleagues of the opposition, but also by my Liberal friends 
across the way.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John English (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome the 
opportunity to speak to the bill and to respond to some of the 
comments made by the members of the Bloc Quebecois and the 
member for Elk Island.
<P>
	The amendment moved by the member for 
Carleton-Gloucester is a constructive amendment which the 
government accepts. It is the kind of amendment which 
contributes to the nature of the bill in recognizing that regional 
interest must be served.
<P>
<B>(2220) </B>
<P>
	We do not think, however, that regional interest should be 
served specifically in the bill on a national basis. The member 
for Carleton-Gloucester moved that regional interest be 
recognized on a local basis in the national capital region. That 
seems appropriate, but regional representation is only one 
element of the qualifications for boards and agencies.
<P>
	In a broader sense the amendments offered by the member for 
Elk Island and the members of the Bloc Quebecois fall under 
two categories. The first is that the provinces must play a larger 
role in appointments. Appointments made by the federal 
government under federal government legislation should be 
subject to provincial approval.
<P>
	The point raised by the member for Elk Island is a very 
sensible one. This is a cumbersome, costly and time consuming 
process. Moreover, reciprocity does not exist. The provincial 
governments do not offer the capacity for the federal 
government to approve provincial government appointments 
made by their lieutenant governor in council. Surely some 
reciprocity on this basis must exist.
<P>
	In this respect the bill is to simplify federal government 
agencies. It is part of a process begun in the budget of February 
1994. What has occurred since that time is that we have 
eliminated 150 patronage positions with the bill. This is the first 
stage of agency review. The second stage will take place later in 
the fall and it will eliminate 350 so-called patronage positions.
<P>
	When we look at the total numbers, this is the first time I can 
recall since the second world war that there has been any 
reduction in patronage positions. This is a radical reduction and 
it is something to be commended.
<P>
	The member for Joliette said that the reduction amounts to 
only $4 million. I am sure the member for Elk Island will agree 
that this is not a meagre amount. It is a significant contribution 
and it is a pattern for the process the government is going 
through under agency review and in the budget itself.
<P>
	In terms of the standing committees the Bloc amendments 
tend to emphasize the need for standing committees to approve 
of the appointments. The standing orders currently allow 
committees to review appointments made by the governor in 
council to non-judicial bodies.
<P>
	We are not seeking to revise the parliamentary system in the 
bill. Certainly in terms of standing committees there may need 
to be in the future some revision in the work they do. However, 
in this bill we are working to simplify, we are working to do it 
quickly, and we are working to deal with what we have now. In 
that respect the amendments offered are not constructive at this 
time.
<P>
	I emphasize that this is a bill to simplify government, to make 
it more efficient, and to fulfil the aims we have expressed in the 
red book and in the budget.

	He said: Mr. Speaker, once again we have the challenge of 
persuading the government members since they outnumber us. 
In the next few moments I will try to persuade them to our point 
of view.
<P>
	This motion specifically concerns the CBC and its board of 
directors. We are all aware that Bill C-65 reduces the number of 
directors from 15 to 12. We have the horse headed in the right 
direction and somebody will have to slap its rump so that it gets 
going.
<P>
	To go from 15 to 12 directors, we barely started doing it. We 
want to be a little more dramatic in our cutting of the CBC board 
because we feel the functions it performs could be efficiently 
carried out by two members, a chairman and the president.
<P>
	It is unfortunate we do not have full freedom in the House to 
do whatever we want. Maybe that is okay, it helps to limit us 
from bizarre decisions. The amendment we would have really 
liked to make would be that CBC be privatized or sold to private 
interests.
<P>
	We think it is time CBC make money for the country, that its 
shareholders should make a profit and should all pay some taxes 
instead of taxpayers funding the broadcasting organization.
<P>
	In saying this I am certainly not speaking against the CBC. I 
am one of many Canadians who enjoys the CBC and certain 
parts of its programming. It is not all bad, it is not all useless. It 
has a lot of very good public service time. Some of its musical 
programs are excellent.
<P>
	We object to its being such a sinkhole for taxpayers' dollars. 
CBC radio operates without commercials and I guess we could 
argue that if we listen to other radio stations we pay for them 
through the products we buy. We indirectly pay for the 
advertising costs those producers incur by advertising on other 
radio or television stations.
<P>
	CBC television, on the other hand, has ample advertising. It 
has such a large share of the market potential. It was in there 
ahead of the game and taxpayers funded a great deal of hardware 
for it. They gave it the inroad into many markets not originally 
viable financially.
<P>
	Why in the present day of modern technology with very 
efficient and excellent ways of communicating electronically 
with people can this organization not now be turned around and 
made into a profit producing organization?
<P>
	As long as it stays under government control with government 
subsidization most likely this will not happen. That is why we 
favour privatizing the CBC. We believe good solid 
entrepreneurs could turn it into a real money making machine.
<P>
	A person who started a small television station out west told 
me a few years ago that having a television station was like 
having a printing press to print money. It was very lucrative 20 
years ago. He has had difficult times more recently.
<P>
	We want to support a substantial reduction in the size of the 
board of directors. If we had had the total freedom to do what we 
wanted we would have reduced them to zero with the 
recommendation to privatize. However, we were told that would 
be outside the limits of this bill and would be ruled as an illegal 
amendment. So we compromised. We knew we already had them 
going in the right direction by reducing the number of members 
from 15 to 12, so we should just take 10 more off and we would 
be down to two and that would do the trick for now and would 
give a very clear message as to the direction in which we would 
choose to go.
<P>
<B>(2230) </B>
<P>
	We also want to indicate that the CBC, as other crown 
corporations, must get the message very clearly that they have to 
become more efficient. They need to operate with lower costs 
and wherever possible with as large a generation of income as 
possible. That is the message that goes along with this 
amendment. It reflects the Reform Party's position that we 
ought not to be taking by coercion money from Canadians via 
the medium of taxation in order to fund a particular point of 
view. We believe that the marketplace would carry that through.
<P>
	It has been enlightening in the last little while to find that the 
CRTC has been giving approval to some types of broadcasting 
companies that before this would not have been considered. So 
there is that move anyway, and we feel that this would hasten it.
<P>
	We are the stewards of the money entrusted to us by the 
Canadian taxpayer. Consequently, in promoting and 
encouraging support for this motion we are simply 
strengthening that message. I urge all members opposite, who 
by their majority have the power to determine how things will 
be, to think very carefully and do the right thing here.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14387"> 14387 </A></B>
<P>
	We know that the deficit and the debt need to be cut. The 
CBC, with its access to the Canadian taxpayer dollars of over 
a billion dollars per year, has to undergo a very rapid 
restructuring.
<P>
	With that, I simply urge the people to support this amendment 
and get the show on the road. Let us get that horse moving.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
representatives of the Canadian provinces would greatly 
appreciate being consulted about the appointments to all 
agencies mentioned in Bill C-65.
<P>
	I would like to mention here two of those representatives to 
whom I wrote recently. Ken Rostad, the Alberta minister for 
federal and intergovernmental affairs, had this to say: ``We 
appreciated greatly being informed of the suggestions you made 
in this debate concerning consultation with provincial 
governments''.
<P>
	Let me quote also Mr. Stephen Kakfwi, the minister of 
intergovernmental and aboriginal affairs of the Northwest 
Territories: ``We do not oppose this fundamental principle of 
consultation. If your motions recognize territorial governments 
for the purposes of consultation, the Northwest Territories 
government could support those motions''.
<P>
	These quotations speak for themselves.
<P>
	Concerning Motion No. 2 moved by the hon. member for Elk 
Island, I have to say we do not support it, because it involves 
reducing from twelve to four the number of directors on the CBC 
board. We all know that this kind of board is often a haven for 
political friends, and that real decisions are made by the 
chairman and the president and chief executive officer under the 
approving eye of the minister. Bringing down to four the number 
of board members, as in the case of the Canadian Broadcasting 
Corporation, would risk turning it into even more of select club 
where, between friends, they would decide on the allocation and 
use of taxpayers' money.
<P>
	We have to change that practice and ensure better provincial 
representation, better representation for Quebec. The number of 
members on the CBC board of directors has to be kept to twelve, 
with a fair representation for Quebec.
<P>
<B>(2235) </B>
<P>
	I would also like to take this opportunity to make a few 
comments on the three other motions put forward by the hon. 
member for Elk Island. The Bloc Quebecois is in favour of and 
supports Motions Nos. 10 and 11 put forward by the Reform 
member. The Bloc wants to maintain a National Archives of 
Canada Advisory Board, and to ensure that a committee of the 
House of Commons composed of two members from the 
government party and three members from opposition parties be 
authorized, as required by Motions Nos. 10 and 11, to select 
seven out of the ten members of this advisory board. That is the 
price for openness, and we  will thus prevent the government 
from politicizing the operation of this National Archives of 
Canada Advisory Board.
<P>
	One could wonder how this kind of advisory council, with 
such a technical mandate, could have any political influence.
<P>
	In April 1986, the federal government ordered the destruction 
of a large part of the archives kept by the Canadian Unity 
Information Office, which would have helped to determine the 
rather obscure role the federal government played in the 1980 
referendum campaign and the full amount of funds invested 
beyond what the Quebec legislation allowed.
<P>
	Nevertheless, since the documentation has been destroyed, 
we have estimated that the federal government spent about 
$17.5 million on the NO campaign during the 1980 referendum. 
An advisory board partially composed of members from 
opposition parties might have avoided the destruction of these 
archives, which was done only for partisan purposes, to hide the 
role Ottawa played in 1980 and the excess amount the federal 
government invested at that time.
<P>
	To conclude, I just want to add that we are in favour of 
amendment No. 8, put forward by the Reform member, which 
provides for Emergency Preparedness Canada to submit an 
annual report to the House of Commons.
<P>
	Three of the four motions moved by the hon. member for Elk 
Island seek to give Parliament better control over the 
management of government operations and to allow opposition 
members to monitor more closely the operations of the National 
Archives of Canada. We support Motions Nos. 8, 10 and 11.
<P>
	If Bill C-65 is passed, Emergency Preparedness Canada will 
come under the Minister of Defence. Emergency Preparedness 
Canada will no longer be a separate agency for budgetary 
purposes. Why then should a service under the Minister of 
National Defence have to table a separate annual report in the 
House of Commons? We agree that Emergency Preparedness 
Canada should be accountable to Parliament and the best way to 
ensure that this happens is to have the agency table in the House 
of Commons an annual report which would then be directly 
examined by Parliamentarians. So, we support this motion put 
forward by the hon. member.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John English (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome the 
comments of the member for Elk Island on the excellence of 
CBC programming. I share his views in that respect.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14388"> 14388 </A></B>
<P>
	The difficulty with this motion by the member for Elk Island 
is that the proposal to reduce the CBC board of directors from 
twelve to two plus the president and the chairperson to form 
the board would in effect render the CBC's programming 
excellence that we just heard complimented operationally 
dysfunctional.
<P>
	Secondly, there is a more technical reason why this 
amendment cannot be supported by the government. The 
statutory committee structure of the CBC board of directors 
would be rendered redundant. Under the Broadcasting Act the 
corporation has to have two permanent committees on English 
and French programming, plus an audit committee of at least 
three directors. With a board of two directors of course these 
committees would again be operationally dysfunctional. 
Therefore a subsequent amendment to the Broadcasting Act 
would be required. Naturally that is a separate exercise from this 
bill and one we did not intend in the presentation of this bill.
<P>
	Finally, the regional representation would be dramatically 
affected. With only two directors it would be impossible to 
recognize all of Canada's regions and diverse interests and 
therefore it would completely undermine regional 
representation.
<P>
	It is therefore impossible for the government to support this 
amendment.

<BLOCKQUOTE>``6.1 The Minister may, with the approval of''''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, we spoke about the proposed changes to 
Bill C-65 to reduce the number of members of the board.
<P>
	Motion No. 8 is a little different. It has to do with the Minister 
of Public Works and his requirement to oversee emergency 
preparedness in the country. That is a very important role. In this 
instance, we feel there is one small change that would be 
required. I would like to persuade members opposite this time 
by appealing to the red book.
<P>
	The red book has become the standard by which we gauge 
whether or not legislation is effective and whether it is going in 
the right direction. The red book said there would be more 
openness, more accountability, and a renewed trust in 
government. This amendment is very small, but it is in that 
direction. I do not think it is so dramatic an amendment that 
members of the Liberal Party could in any way be against it. It 
does go in the right direction and it does not go so far that they 
should be frightened by it. It simply requires that the minister 
report annually on his activities and on the degree of emergency 
preparedness that is in place. That is a very important aspect for 
the security of the country, for a country that is ready to deal 
with emergencies of all kinds, whether they are civil 
insurrections or natural disasters.
<P>
	We are simply asking the minister to open up a little and 
report annually. I do not know whether members know what is 
involved. For example, the minister has the power to require that 
the railroads have a one-year supply of fuel on hand, so that if 
for some reason the normal supplies of fuel are destroyed by 
some disaster, either natural or through some sort of an act of 
war, we would still be able to operate our railroads for a 
reasonable length of time. It is good for Canadians to know what 
kinds of arrangements the minister has made in this area.
<P>
	What we are asking is very simple. I plead with members 
opposite, in order to fulfil the promises of the red book, to vote 
in favour of the amendment. It would provide a little more 
openness, a little more accountability, and a little more 
transparency. It would go a long way in undoing some of the 
criticism that has been levelled at them in terms of their being 
secretive and too closed.
<P>
	I will abbreviate my comments because of the urgency of the 
day. I will gladly stop speaking in exchange for the commitment 
of Liberal members to support the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John English (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member has spoken most eloquently about the need for 
transparency 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14389"> 14389 </A></B>
<P>
and openness. He has  also spoken often in the House of 
Commons about the word ``economy''. In the case of this 
motion the two purposes are in conflict.
<P>
<B>(2245 ) </B>
<P>
	I say this with respect to the hon. member's amendment. This 
motion seems to perpetuate the requirement that the minister lay 
before Parliament an annual report on the operations of the act.
<P>
	The rationale for eliminating annual reports is 
government-wide. It is an attempt to lower costs and is focused 
on reducing associated preparation costs. We intend to provide 
new mechanisms such as expanded Part III estimates, and most 
important, new department outlet documents will be provided to 
parliamentary committees for this review.
<P>
	In this case the argument for economy is a very cogent one. 
There are other means through which transparency and openness 
will be provided.

	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am having a busy evening but I am still 
smiling. I have to concede it is somewhat frustrating to have 
such well thought out amendments, which I sincerely believe are 
defensible, decided against by the members opposite. It is a bit 
of a rebuff but I will try to live with it and I will recover by 
tomorrow. The Liberals now have an opportunity to redeem 
themselves by supporting Motions Nos. 10 and 11.
<P>
	The National Archives have a problem. The amount of 
material to be saved keeps growing. It grows and grows. Until 
now to dispose of things the administration of the archives had 
to consult with the members of the board. These members, who 
are GIC appointments, held the archivists responsible for not 
destroying records which should be kept.
<P>
	It is almost like having a Senate, a place of sober second 
thought, but a real one. It is a case of: ``Here is a decision to 
throw something away. Do you agree?'' Perhaps the judgment of 
one person could be flawed. Perhaps that person could miss 
something that is important. It would be an advantage to have 
more people involved to provide for checks and balances against 
discarding material which others would have the insight to 
recognize might have value in the future and should be kept.
<P>
	In this instance the amendment would only require a very 
small expenditure. It says that the national archives advisory 
board should not be eliminated entirely. This is a change in the 
system. Sometimes members of the Reform Party are charged 
with only wanting to cut, cut, cut. We want to cut in the right 
places. We want to manage the fiscal affairs of the country so 
that we do not have cut in areas where cuts are unwarranted. This 
is one area where we want to retain the powers.
<P>
	I want to give an example. We presently have in the country 
and in Parliament a very sharp division on what is important. 
The members of the Bloc Quebecois are very interested in taking 
their province out of the country and the rest of us want to keep 
Canada together.
<P>
	The individual looking at the archives' records may have a 
certain historical perspective and even a certain present political 
perspective. It could cloud the decision of whether certain 
documents should be kept or destroyed. That is why we are 
strongly recommending that the decision not be made by an 
individual, but that there should be consultation involved. This 
small board would have a very real and very important function.

<P>
	Consequently I am recommending that the backbenchers in 
this instance exercise their powers of thinking and cogitation to 
consider very carefully the argument I have made and 
notwithstanding anything they have been led to believe earlier 
today, think of the weight of the arguments and vote in favour to 
the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John English (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I agree that 
this is a very important matter.
<P>
	I believe the member for Elk Island raises some important 
points about the retention of certain records and the importance 
of the decision prior to destruction.
<P>
	Currently the situation is that all proposals for destruction 
under the care of the archivist must be reviewed internally. 
There will be an examination of all contractual and legal 
obligations, the importance of the records in relation to the 
mandate of the National Archives, and that the National 
Archives acquisition policy must determine if these specimens 
or copies are held in other depositories.
<P>
	I am inclined to agree with the member for La Prairie that it is 
deplorable that some records have been destroyed in the past 
which fall within the purview of historical records of 
importance. It is important that a board of this kind recognize at 
all times the importance of the historicity of records.
<P>
	I do not think this amendment responds to that need. The 
current board of voluntary users effectively scrutinizes 
historical records. Moreover, the archivist has undertaken to 
establish a voluntary panel of experts on archives matters which 
will represent a cross section of interests across Canada, 
representing users, institutions and archival communities. This 
board will preserve historical records as is necessary.

<P>

<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Francis G. LeBlanc (Cape Breton Highlands-Canso, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to begin third reading debate on 
Bill C-54, an act to amend the Old Age Security Act, the Canada 
Pension Plan, the Children's Allowance Act and the 
Unemployment Insurance Act.
<P>
	I am pleased to do so for two reasons. First, as chair of the 
House of Commons committee on human resources 
development I had the opportunity to review the legislation in 
detail when it went through clause by clause consideration. I 
want to thank the members of that committee on all sides of the 
House for their careful work in examining the provisions of this 
sometimes complex and very technical bill.
<P>
<B>(2255) </B>
<P>
	Second, I thank the officials of the human resources 
development department, the income security programs 
division, for their patience in explaining the complex, technical 
aspects of these programs.
<P>
	Particularly I thank those groups who came on short notice 
and made representations to the committee on behalf of seniors 
and Canadians with disabilities who are most affected by this 
legislation. I especially to thank the Council of Canadians with 
disabilities and the one voice, the Canadian Seniors Network, 
for their valuable contribution to the work of the committee 
studying Bill C-54.
<P>
	Second, I am pleased to speak to the legislation as a regular 
member of Parliament for whom sorting out difficulties with the 
various components of the Canada pension system is an 
important part of my regular constituency work.
<P>
	By and large these difficulties are of two types. First of all, it 
is financial, questions about the adequacy and the timeliness of 
benefits, conditions for entitlement, sudden or unexplained 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14391"> 14391 </A></B>
<P>
changes to the level of benefits and other  matters of that sort 
that bother the seniors or those who are dependent on this stream 
of income for their income security.
<P>
	The second category of difficulties with elements of the 
Canadian pension system that members of Parliament are 
frequently called on to deal with are administrative in nature: 
the mechanisms for applying for benefits, rules pertaining to the 
delegation, the splitting or the reassignment of pension benefits 
or credits, appeals dealing with errors and overpayments 
sometimes which are caused by the bureaucracy, and finally, 
matters of security and confidentiality.
<P>
	It is primarily this latter set of concerns that are addressed by 
Bill C-54. The bill improves services to clients. It allows for 
improved co-ordination and more efficient program 
administration and service delivery. It increases the consistency 
between the old age security and Canada pension plan programs. 
It also reduces administrative costs. It minimizes duplication 
and paper burden to clients and various departments, and it will 
also help members of Parliament to better assist their 
constituents.
<P>
	According to estimates by the Department of Human 
Resources Development, the proposed amendments to Bill C-54 
would benefit about 1.4 million senior citizens with no net cost 
to the taxpayer. Expected savings from the amendments will 
total approximately $10 million annually, largely as a result of 
more efficient program administration.
<P>
	I would like to go through in the time that is available some of 
the aspects of this legislation for the House this evening. For 
nearly 1.4 million seniors, many of whom are women, at present 
they must reapply annually to receive the guaranteed income 
supplement and spouse's allowance benefits. At that time they 
must make a statement of income even though the income of 
many does not change significantly from year to year, being 
limited to old age security and perhaps Canada pension plan 
benefits.
<P>
	Payments for the new fiscal year cannot be made until the 
application is received and approved. As a result, each April up 
to 100,000 low and middle income pensioners may suffer 
hardship when benefits are delayed due to late application or a 
need to verify the information on the application.
<P>
	This legislation allows the Minister of Human Resources 
Development to waive the requirement for annual renewal 
applications for GIS and SPA benefits for any month or months 
in the following year. The proposed sections of the bill would 
require the minister in situations where he or she had waived the 
requirement for an application to give written notice to the 
pensioner when a subsequent application was required.
<P>
<B>(2300 ) </B>
<P>
	The minister would have to meet certain time limits in this 
regard. These changes would avoid an interruption in benefits 
for those pensioners and would improve service and 
administration. There might also be implications for benefit 
overpayments and underpayments.
<P>
	Generally what this legislation does is eliminate the need for 
inconvenient and costly reapplication when that is not necessary 
because for the most part the information is already in the 
possession of the department.
<P>
	The second category has to do with reconsiderations and 
appeals. Clause 16 of the legislation allows a person to satisfy, 
with a decision or a determination relating to the payment or the 
amount of the benefit, to make a request to the minister within 
certain time limits for reconsideration of the decision, after 
which the minister could confirm or vary it.
<P>
	A person dissatisfied with the minister's decision could 
appeal it to the Canada pension plan, old age security review 
tribunal established under the Canada pension plan. Where the 
basis of the appeal was an incorrect ministerial decision about 
the income of the applicant, the beneficiary or spouse of either 
of these, the appeal can be referred to the Tax Court of Canada. 
This legislation thereby facilitates portions of the appeal 
process.
<P>
	Another category is retroactive payments. Clients often apply 
for OAS-CPP retirement benefits at the same time. If 
application is made after age 65 retroactive old age security 
benefit payments are made but the Canada pension plan 
provides for an actuarial increase in the value of the benefit. The 
result is that benefits that begin to be paid after age 65 are 
treated differently by the two programs.
<P>
	With clause 3 of the bill, the section on the Old Age Security 
Act, section 2(a), periods of retroactive payments to the two 
programs would be harmonized. The period would be set at a 
maximum of one year, a reduction from the present maximum of 
five years in the case of old age security benefits. In the case of 
retroactive payments a streamlining takes place as a result of the 
bill.
<P>
	In this area the council on disabilities made an important 
contribution to the legislation which I acknowledge. In this case 
the council led the standing committee to adopt an amendment 
to the bill which provides for retroactive, early retirement 
benefits for some recipients of CPP disability benefits. The 
provision is intended to mitigate to some extent the loss of 
income for a person no longer eligible for a disability benefit 
and to assist that person to reduce the amount of overpayment 
which must be returned to the program. This provision was 
always intended to be optional for the client.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14392"> 14392 </A></B>
<P>
	The government never intended to reduce the options 
available to clients but the council pointed out the wording of 
this provision in Bill C-54 would be construed as requiring the 
client to take the early retirement pension.
<P>
	To address the concern raised by the council, the government 
moved an amendment accepted in the standing committee. The 
government listened to the concerns expressed by the council 
and these concerns are now reflected in the revised wording of 
this provision of Bill C-54.
<P>
	There were numerous other areas in which amendments were 
made to the bill in response to the input by these groups 
representing Canadians with disabilities and seniors affected by 
this legislation.
<P>
	The bill, which streamlines in many ways the administration 
of this legislation, is vital to seniors and to those people 
dependent on these programs because of the complexity this 
legislation by necessity has to be designed to accommodate in so 
many different circumstances. Seniors, many of whom live in 
isolated communities, cannot afford to have their payments 
disrupted by administrative processes very often far beyond 
their understanding.
<P>
<B>(2305) </B>
<P>
	By working to simplify the legislation and streamline the 
process for applying, for reconsidering, for splitting, for 
delegating benefits that apply to seniors and to persons with 
disabilities through the Canadian pension system, we are 
helping Canadians facilitate access to this very important aspect 
of the Canadian safety net.
<P>
	That is the nature of the changes in Bill C-54. They reflect the 
government's concern for making this vital component of the 
Canadian social security system accessible to those who depend 
on it for their livelihood, for their basic fundamental income 
security and in that respect enabling seniors in Canada to have a 
greater assurance and confidence that as they move into their old 
age they will be able to count on secure and regular support from 
the Canadian government.

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> According to our agreement, the hon. 
member for Argenteuil-Papineau now has the floor for 12 
minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, obviously, I had prepared a 40 minute speech, but given 
the requests of our whips, I agreed to cut down my time on the 
floor.
<P>
	I would like to speak to the House regarding Bill C-54 and I 
will focus on the act to amend the Old Age Security Act and the 
Canada Pension Plan. The official opposition proposed several 
amendments to this bill in order to protect seniors from 
injustice.
<P>
	First, in Motion No. 1 we proposed the following 
amendments. In summary, this amendment by the Bloc 
Quebecois aimed to keep the appeals processes for the Canada 
pension plan and the old age security program separate.
<P>
	What was the answer we received on May 8 to this first 
amendment we proposed regarding Bill C-54? The Minister of 
Human Resources Development went on a violent, undignified 
and even indecent rampage, calling our amendments bizarre, 
incomprehensible and absurd. According to the minister, I have 
a twisted mind and I take a perverted pleasure in complicating 
the lives of seniors.
<P>
	The minister wound up with the comment that our 
amendments were the strangest, most bizarre and most 
incomprehensible amendments that he has seen in a long time in 
the House. He also mentioned that if I had truly understood Bill 
C-54, I would not have proposed such absurd amendments. 
Unfortunately for the Minister of Human Resources 
Development, he confused Motion No. 2 with subclause 2 of 
Motion No. 1.
<P>
	Bill C-54 integrates the appeals process for the Canada 
pension plan with that of the old age security program. On May 
8, when this amendment was introduced in this House, I reported 
what the attorney general had said: ``The two-tiered appeal 
process for Old Age Security permits the satisfactory settlement 
of the few cases there are. The process is simple, fast and 
informal, and cases are heard in the regions where the appellants 
live''.
<P>
	Furthermore, the auditor general openly criticized the 
three-tiered appeals process of the Canada pension plan. So, 
why propose to integrate the two appeals processes and to use 
the process under the Canada pension plan, which the auditor 
general deems to be deficient? Clearly, they are not simplifying 
the appeals process. In what way will this improve client 
services?
<P>
	Lastly, the Pension Appeals Board was authorized to appoint 
temporary members. At the present time, someone who is not 
satisfied with a decision made under the Canada Assistance Plan 
has the right to appeal at three different levels.
<P>
	First level appeals are to the Minister of Human Resources 
Development. Second level appeals are heard by review 
tribunals established under the Act. Finally, third level appeals 
are heard by the Pension Appeals Board. Why change an appeal 
process which, according to the Auditor General, works well to 
replace it with a more complicated one?
<P>
<B>(2310) </B>
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois disagrees with this streamlining of 
appeals under the Old Age Security Act and the Canada Pension 
Plan because it is not an improvement.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14393"> 14393 </A></B>
<P>
	Let us not forget the importance of this amendment since 
statistics reveal that in 1993-94, there were 23,046 first level 
appeals, an increase of 0.5 per cent compared to the previous 
year. Of that number, 83 per cent concern disability benefits. 
A total of 27,077 appeals were processed during those years.
<P>
	On Motions Nos. 4, 13 and 15 I supported my colleague for 
Mercier since the Bloc Quebecois cannot support the provisions 
of Bill C-54 intended to change access to certain information 
since the government can increase the number of departments, 
agencies or even individuals that will have access to information 
for the purpose of implementing the acts modified by this bill. 
Agencies having access to information according to the 
previous act were: the Departments of Revenue, Finance, 
Supply and Services, Employment and Immigration 
Commission, Statistics Canada and provincial authorities.
<P>
	These agencies can have access to the information as long as it 
deals solely with the entitlement of beneficiaries or the amount 
of benefits, or if their disclosure is essential to the legislation's 
application.
<P>
	When I supported these amendments, I said that we have to be 
extremely careful when giving personal information on senior 
citizens since it could be used for other purposes. We have to 
protect our senior citizens against potential abuse. The 
government did not prove that disclosing this privileged 
information was essential and necessary.
<P>
	I said also that governments are becoming more and more 
intrusive. This government has the gall to claim that it is a good 
thing to include Canada Post on the ground that, through the use 
of new techniques, it could help accelerate the processing of 
pension cheques.
<P>
	We noticed time and time again that the government cannot 
deal with its own administrative problems, and we recently had 
the best possible example of that when some seniors had trouble 
getting their income supplement cheques. We cannot condone 
government intrusion in the private lives of senior citizens and 
citizens in general.
<P>
	This major change, even if used in accordance with the 
present provisions of the Privacy Act, is an intrusion that the 
Bloc Quebecois cannot accept. Moreover, we proposed in 
Motions Nos. 5 and 6, amendments which did not seek to 
remove Clause 23 entirely, but to amend it. For example, they 
would have kept the one year delay before collecting 
overpayments and forced the minister to remit the debt in the 
cases mentioned. For example, in section 37 the one-year 
statute of limitation is maintained.
<P>
	The government is incapable of dealing with these matters 
within a reasonable time frame. The abolition of this clause, 
which accordingly does away with the limitation or claim on the 
overpayment, is an obvious example of the government's loss of 
control.
<P>
	I repeat here the remarks of the auditor general in his report to 
the effect that pension fund overpayments amount to between 
$120 million and $220 million a year. He said: ``Past efforts to 
prevent and detect overpayments have been minimal and largely 
ineffective''. I am quoting the auditor general's report for 1993, 
at page 486.
<P>
	The auditor general also indicated that over 90 per cent of 
appeals concerned applications for disability benefits under the 
Canada Pension Plan.
<P>
<B>(2315) </B>
<P>
	Does the provision that would permit the minister to stay 
benefits during the appeal process together with the increase in 
the number of unjustified appeals by the department not in fact 
cover up a shameful way to reduce overpayments?
<P>
	Clearly, at some point or other, many old people will be faced 
with administrative errors by the government. They may have 
received money they were not entitled to, without necessarily 
realizing it. How can seniors repay a significant amount all of a 
sudden and budget accordingly?
<P>
	That is why the Bloc Quebecois proposed, in order to remedy 
this situation, that the one year limitation on overpayments that 
are not the result of fraudulent acts be imprescriptible so as to 
force the government to improve management of the program 
and to not unduly penalize seniors, who could have to pay back 
significant amounts a number of years after an error was made.
<P>
	Bill C-54 provides that, in these cases, the minister may 
``remit''. We have proposed there be no discretionary power in 
the above cases, to protect the interests of seniors. I have also 
proposed in Motion No. 12 the following amendment, which is 
of prime importance: ``That Bill C-54 be amended by deleting 
Clause 38'', which reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``Where a decision is made by a Review Tribunal or the Pension Appeals 
Board in respect of a benefit, the Minister may stay payment of the benefit until 
the latest of [three dates]''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The amendment proposed by the Bloc Quebecois, the official 
opposition, is intended to not allow the government to stay 
payments during appeals, because these appeals are the result of 
the government's inability to manage these programs. I assume 
the Minister of Human Resources Development also finds this 
amendment bizarre. How do we tell seniors that they may enjoy 
their rights, but are not entitled to receive the money they need 
to live on during the proceedings?
<P>
	I made a presentation on seniors' incomes when I introduced 
my motion on May 8. Clearly they are not rich. I conclude here 
with the question, why must we insist on reducing the deficit on 
the backs of the most disadvantaged, on the backs of seniors? I 
repeat my question to the Minister of Human Resources 
Development.

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure for me to rise in the House tonight to speak to Bill 
C-54, an act to amend several social programs, including the 
Canada pension plan.
<P>
	Tonight I would like to speak in some detail about the Canada 
pension plan, the amendments proposed to it in the bill, and 
more generally about the policy direction of the Liberal 
government and the minister on CPP.
<P>
	The bill is nothing more than administrative housekeeping. It 
is designed to improve minor flaws in the current system, but it 
ignores, as the government has ignored, the very severe 
problems our social programs face.
<P>
	The Canada pension plan is a nightmare. The unfunded 
liabilities of the plan rival our national debt. Those liabilities 
were estimated to be $491 billion in 1993. That is $491 billion 
that must either be taxed from future generations, our children 
and our grandchildren, or it may mean that seniors will have to 
forgo some of their benefits. Neither scenario is pleasant.
<P>
	The Superintendent of Financial Institutions reported in 
February that CPP will be out of funds in just 20 years. 
Realistically, we have very little time to act to correct the 
situation. We have been here a year and a half, yet the Liberal 
government has offered us only a bill written by the bureaucracy 
for the bureaucracy.
<P>
	In the past year CPP ran its first deficit, seemingly a small 
amount in comparison to the many billions of dollars of benefits 
paid out. The government dipped into the contingency fund for 
$650 million.
<P>
<B>(2320 ) </B>
<P>
	Suddenly the bureaucracy woke up. Even though the 
contingency fund is over $40 billion, the not so astute central 
planners had invested all the funds in 20-year loans to the 
provinces with low interest. As anyone can see, this means that 
only approximately $2 billion is actually liquid in any given 
year. Therefore, last year panic set in as human resources 
development bureaucrats suddenly realized that one-third of the 
available cash in the contingency fund was going to be used up 
meeting benefit obligations.
<P>
	The story does not end here, however. Benefit payouts are 
projected to increase faster than premiums can be collected. In 
the next few years we may face a crisis as deficits climb past the 
point of sustainability. Change must come quickly if we are to 
preserve the integrity of the social programs for those who 
depend on them.
<P>
	Many Canadians are confused about the reasons the Canada 
pension plan is not financially sustainable. It is really quite 
simple. Unlike private pension plans or other savings plans, the 
premiums paid are not invested and then returned to the 
individual with interest upon retirement. Rather, the premiums 
paid are used to fund current beneficiaries, with a small portion 
going to the contingency fund. This would not be a totally  
unreasonable situation if the demographics of the population 
never changed. Canada has an aging population. An increasingly 
higher percentage of the population depends on CPP for their 
retirement. Correspondingly, a lower percentage of Canadians 
are left in the workforce to fund the retirees. This situation will 
only worsen as the baby boom generation reaches retirement 
age.
<P>
	If members think this plan sounds irresponsible, I agree with 
them. I imagine that most members on that side of the House 
have no problem with this. After all, the Liberals have done 
exactly the same thing with their budget. They overspend today, 
taking on debt that future generations will have to pay back. 
They force future generations to pay for this generation. Some 
might even call this financial abuse of children.
<P>
	The Canada pension plan is no different. Today's working 
mothers and fathers are directly subsidizing today's retirees, 
and our children and grandchildren will be forced to subsidize 
us. Based on the current projections there will be no CPP for my 
children and grandchildren. It will only exist for this 
self-serving generation. Serious reforms are necessary and are 
needed immediately to fix this problem. However, we have a 
lack of leadership from this government.
<P>
	There are some good improvements proposed in Bill C-54 for 
the Canada pension plan. There is some streamlining of the 
appeals process, a possible reduction in overpayments to 
recipients. There is simplification in the delegation of authority, 
simplification of the division, reinstatement and assignment of 
benefits. These are good and worthy benefits to be approved by 
this House. It will help Canadians and reduce a few costs, but it 
fails to deal with the most important aspect of pension reform. It 
fails to deal with the imminent bankruptcy of the system.
<P>
	What good are administrative reforms like those in Bill C-54 
if the whole system goes bankrupt? It does not make any 
difference how quickly a pensioner receives his cheque if the 
amount is zero dollars and zero cents. The government of the 
day would probably wish its system were not quite so efficient if 
it is going to be sending out cheques like that. This bill 
represents a baby step when a giant leap was needed.
<P>
	The priority of this government should be to put CPP on a firm 
financial footing. A proposal the government seems to keep 
floating is that premiums should continually increase to fund 
deficits in the plan. This is plainly unacceptable to a large 
majority of Canadians. It is no different from increasing taxes, 
and Canadians have said they are taxed to the limit.
<P>
	Another suggestion is to cut benefits. There may be some 
savings to be found in the myriad of benefits paid out, as I will 
point out in a minute, but these savings will not fundamentally 
alter the main problem, which is that the plan is actuarily 
unsound.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14395"> 14395 </A></B>
<P>
	We plainly cannot cut benefits to those retirees who currently 
depend on them, and it would be cruel to cut them significantly 
for those who are about to retire. The only persons we can cut 
future benefits for are those who have enough time left before 
retirement to make alternate arrangements.
<P>
<B>(2325) </B>
<P>
	I would like to tell of two different constituents of mine who 
have come to me with stories of problems they have experienced 
with CPP. The first constituent complained to me about waste in 
the survivors benefits category, commonly known as widows 
and orphans benefits. My constituent was concerned that after 
marrying a widowed woman and adopting her two children the 
survivors benefits continued to flow. He had to pursue his case 
through the department all the way up to the minister to get the 
benefits cut off.
<P>
	Why is this unacceptable situation continuing to the present 
day? Clearly if one is no longer a widow or an orphan they 
should no longer collect a widow's or orphan's benefit. Savings 
to be found in this area may be in the millions of dollars.
<P>
	Another constituent complained to me about the overly high 
benefit payout she is receiving from CPP for her retirement. 
This constituent had paid in a grand total of $143 in premiums 
over her lifetime, yet is receiving monthly benefit cheques of 
$25. Although $25 a month or $300 a year does not seem to be an 
amount that will bankrupt the plan, think what overpaying many 
other Canadians hundreds or thousands of dollars a year does to 
our balances. It is unsustainable and cannot be justified. We 
must make the plan actuarially sound and financially stable for 
those who have to depend on it.
<P>
	The Reform Party has promised to be a constructive 
alternative in Parliament, and on this issue, like most others, we 
have laid out our plan. We believe that our approach must be 
financially sustainable, fair, promote individual responsibility, 
and must help relieve government of its massive fiscal 
problems.
<P>
	We believe that the registered personal savings plans coupled 
with registered retirement savings plans are a large part of the 
solution for Canada's working generation. We laid out our plan 
in our taxpayers' budget prior to the release of the federal 
budget. We detailed how Canadians would be encouraged to 
plan for their own retirement without government interference 
or financial bungling. We showed how individuals could make 
choices that best suit their needs and we showed how it could be 
done without incurring additional liabilities for the government.
<P>
	Reformers demonstrated leadership in the area of pensions 
and the Liberals have yet to move on the issue. Yet it is the 
Liberals who have the power to effect the changes necessary to 
save these programs. If the Liberals refuse to act then I believe 
the Canadian people will choose leaders who will bring the 
needed reform, and I believe they will choose Reformers to do 
that job.
<P>
	In closing, I want to read the comments of another member 
from another debate on a similar bill from the last Parliament, 
which only tinkered with the Canada Pension Plan and failed to 
effect any meaningful change. I quote:
<P>
	``I simply want to use this opportunity to draw the attention of 
members and hopefully of the government or a future 
government to the fact that the reform of the pension plan 
system has to go beyond just tinkering, fixing some immediate 
problems. We may have to come to grips with a lower level of 
pension benefits that will be available as each generation of 
Canadians reaches retirement age. I would suggest that the 
problem is that we should be projecting the profile of what our 
Canadian population will look like 10, 15, 20 years down the 
road and designing our CPP to meet that problem so that future 
legislators will not have to scramble to face a much broader 
problem or large scale insecurity because we at the present time 
did not exercise our responsibility of stewardship to make sure 
that there would be enough of a benefit base to satisfy those 
needs. Similarly, I also find it of concern that the number of real 
problems that have been identified in the implementation and 
administration of the Canada Pension Plan are not being fully 
addressed in this bill.''
<P>
	The comments were made by none other than the author of 
this present tinkering bill, the Minister of Human Resources 
Development.
<P>
	The leadership and changes the Canadian voters are so 
desperately looking for will have to wait until the next federal 
election, when Reform will form the government.

	The House resumed consideration of Bill C-91, an act to 
continue the Federal Business Development Bank under the 
name Business Development Bank of Canada, as reported (with 
amendments) from the committee.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The first question is on Motion No. 1. 
A vote on Motion No. 1 will also apply to Motions Nos. 3, 4, 6 
and 26 to 33.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	An affirmative vote on Motion No. 1 will obviate the 
necessity of the question being put on Motions Nos. 2 and 5. 
However, a negative vote on Motion No. 1 will necessitate the 
question being put on Motion No. 2.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think you would find that there is 
consent that the members who voted on the previous motion, as 
well as the hon. member for Bramalea-Gore-Malton, be 
recorded as having voted on the motion now before the House. 
The Liberal members will vote in favour of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> The Bloc members vote against this motion, 
Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, the Reform members vote no except 
for those members who wish to vote otherwise.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Blaikie:</B> Mr. Speaker, NDP members vote no on the 
motion.

you would find unanimous consent to apply the result of the vote 
on report stage Motion No. 7 to the motion now before the 
House.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is it agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	[<I>Editor's Note: See list under Division No. 321.</I>]
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I declare Motion No. 23 lost.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The next question is on Motion No. 24.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, if you were to seek it, I believe 
you would find unanimous consent for members who voted on 
the previous motion to be recorded as voting on the motion now 
before the House, with Liberal members voting yea.
<P>
	Perhaps I could indicate that I believe you would find consent 
to apply that result in reverse to report stage Motions Nos. 16 
and 18.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, Bloc Quebecois members will all 
vote no, even those who would have liked to support the motion.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Ah, ah.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, Reform Party members will vote no 
on Motion No. 24, except for those members who wish to vote 
otherwise. On Motions Nos. 16 and 18 they will vote in reverse 
as the government whip stated.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Blaikie:</B> Mr. Speaker, the NDP votes yes and agrees to the 
application of the other two votes as suggested by the whip of 
the government party.
