are not tax free. These types of allowances normally cover travel

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I want to thank Bruce Phillips whose mandate ended on 
August 30 and who carried out his duties with integrity and 
professionalism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An eminent journalist, Mr. Phillips served as deputy privacy 
commissioner from February 1990 to April 1991.  He then assumed 
the position of privacy commissioner from April 1991 to quite 
recently, namely August 30. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the ongoing responsibilities and the extremely delicate 
nature of the position of privacy commissioner, it should be 
filled quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, pursuant to subsection 53(4) of the Privacy Act, the 
governor in council may give any qualified individual the powers 
and functions of the incumbent of this position.  George 
Radwanski has therefore been appointed acting commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that all members of this House will support the 
appointment of Mr. Radwanski as the next privacy commissioner. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on Natural Resources and Government 
Operations met to consider Mr. Radwanski's appointment last 
Thursday, September 21.  The committee reviewed Mr. Radwanski's 
extensive experience which, as I am sure all hon. members will 
agree, makes him very well qualified to assume the role of 
privacy commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A former journalist, Mr. Radwanski is currently president of his 
own public policy and communications consulting firm.  From 1965 
until 1985 he held journalism positions of increasing 
responsibility for various newspapers, including associate editor 
of the Montreal <I>Gazette</I>, Ottawa editor and national affairs 
columnist with the <I>Financial Times</I> of Canada and editor in 
chief with the Toronto <I>Star</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, he was honoured by his peers in the journalism 
profession on two occasions, namely in 1980 and 1981 with the 
national newspaper award for editorial writing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following his departure from the journalism field, Mr. Radwanski 
entered the public service when he was appointed by the then 
Ontario premier, David Peterson, to head major studies into 
matters of importance to the Canadian public, including a study 
into the service sector in Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 at the request of the Canadian government, Mr. Radwanski 
chaired the mandate review of the Canada Post Corporation, a very 
important task. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During his journalism career and indeed his professional 
activities following his departure from the journalism field, 
George Radwanski has demonstrated a commitment to Canadian values 
and to serving the Canadian public.  His long and distinguished 
career will hold him in good stead in this future position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With his background he will bring to the position both knowledge 
and experience with the delicate and difficult problems of 
balancing the public's right to know and the individual's right 
to privacy.  He will also bring to the position of privacy 
commissioner the independence of mind of a journalist, which I am 
sure all hon. members will agree is an extremely important 
qualification for the job of privacy commissioner. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I encourage all members of this House to support 
the motion to have the House approve the appointment of George 
Radwanski as the privacy commissioner.

<P><A NAME="LINK32"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the official opposition certainly supports the 
appointment of Mr. Radwanski as the privacy commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For years now the official opposition has asked that when 
appointing people like this to key positions, the individual 
should be interviewed by certain standing parliamentary 
committees, and that was done in part in this case. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1020"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I proceed any further, I would like to pay tribute to the 
previous privacy commissioner, Mr. Bruce Phillips.  It was my 
privilege to meet with him on several occasions and I have a lot 
of respect for the gentleman.  He did the office a great honour 
and carried out his responsibilities with respect and also with 
great confidentiality.  I am sure that Mr. Radwanski will do the 
same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to refer back to the particular interview process that 
took place at the parliamentary Standing Committee on Natural 
Resources and Government Operations.  This particular committee 
met and the members of the committee were invited “to an 
informal meeting for the purpose of consulting with the interim 
privacy commissioner.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member opposite just indicated that the committee met 
to consider the the appointment of Mr. Radwanski.  To the best of 
my recollection there was no motion made at this particular 
committee, neither was it ever indicated that there was a 
consideration here.  It was for the purpose of consulting with, 
which is quite different from the implication left by the words 
that the hon. member used a moment ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the committee interviewed someone who had already 
been appointed.  In one sense it was really a ratification and, 
indeed, the motion here before the House is in fact a 
ratification.  It is my understanding that Mr. Radwanski has 
occupied the position since September 1, 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask this question.  What was the status of this 
committee meeting at that time?  It was my understanding that the 
committee was to have been conducted in a manner similar to that 
of a regular meeting of the standing committee.  While an 
interview took place, while there was translation services and 
while there was a broadcast on the usual radio channels, there 
was no official record kept of what transpired at the committee 
meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit that there is little practical use of a meeting like 
this, when it is purely a motion.  I want to reinforce the 
concept that we agree that these kinds of interviews should take 
place with people who will be occupying key positions.  It is 
essential that we do this.  There should be transparency, there 
should be respect and there should be dignity for the office and 
also for the people who are being chosen to occupy these 
positions.  In order to have meaningful input it should not be 
simply a consultation and it should not be simply a matter of 
meeting with this person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We met Mr. Radwanski.  He was a good individual.  He met with 
the group and expressed himself well and demonstrated that he was 
able to do the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that in future the record of these meetings be 
recorded.  It will help both the memory of the members who were 
there and will also help to make the process transparent and 
accountable and it will give the respect deserved to these kinds 
of appointments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say something as well about the individual who 
is being considered today, Mr. George Radwanski.  I do not think 
there is any doubt that he is a very capable individual and that 
he has extensive academic and experiential credentials to do the 
job.  However, one wonders whether his connections and 
association, past and present, with the Liberal Party, both 
federally and provincially, may have influenced the selection of 
him as the privacy commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be specific, I want to refer to some of these connections. 
First, he was the special adviser to the treasurer of Ontario, 
appointed by then Premier Peterson to undertake a study of the 
service sector.  He published the study known as “Ontario Study 
of the Service Sector, 1986”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then, in 1987 he was the special adviser for the minister of 
education in Ontario, again appointed by then Premier Peterson. 
He undertook a major study which resulted in a publication 
entitled “Ontario Study of the Relevance of Education, and the 
Issue of Dropouts, 1987”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He served as a senior strategy and policy adviser and principal 
speech writer for the Right Hon. John Turner in the 1988 election 
campaign.  Then very recently, Mr. Radwanski served as a senior 
policy, strategy and communications adviser to the Right Hon. 
Prime Minister of Canada in the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the discussion and consultation in no way did Mr. 
Radwanski ever try to cover this up or in any way suggest that he 
did not have these associations. 
In fact, he had had these associations and was quite open about 
that.  I commend him for that.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He indicated that he wanted to make some recommendations with 
regard to the Privacy Act so that the act could be brought more 
up to date and more commensurate with the conditions in the world 
of government and business today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He wrote “The Future of Canada Post Corporation”, which was 
a review of the Canada Post mandate to which the hon. member 
opposite just referred.  The publication was given to the hon. 
minister then responsible for Canada Post Corporation in 1996. 
Unfortunately, those recommendations did not go anywhere.  I hope 
the recommendations he will make on the Privacy Act will go a 
little further than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Post mandate reflected in my opinion both depth of 
understanding of sound management principles and what a strong 
organizational structure should look like.  His comments, even in 
this early tenure in the position of privacy commissioner, showed 
the same kind of understanding and sensitivity that he revealed 
in that earlier review.  I certainly wish him well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my mind there is no doubt about the competency of this 
individual.  However, I have the sneaking suspicion that his 
appointment was not totally void of patronage considerations by 
those making the recommendation to appoint him the Privacy 
Commissioner of Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK33"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I will make just a few comments on what the House has before it 
today, this motion to appoint Mr. George Radwanski as the new 
privacy commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the outset, I want to say that everything I have to say today 
should not be taken as a reflection in any way upon the integrity 
of Mr. Radwanski or his competence as an individual, an 
administrator or, for that matter, potentially as a privacy 
commissioner.  However, there are a number of concerns that 
should be registered at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we have a recorded vote on this, it may well be that we might 
choose to vote against the motion, not so much as an expression 
of opposition to Mr. Radwanski, but more as our expression of 
opposition to the process which has been followed and the fact 
that the government has missed an opportunity to really do the 
right thing and break new ground with respect to the appointments 
being made to these kinds of positions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One can understand, to a certain degree, what we normally call 
patronage when the government appoints people to carry out its 
policies.  It is understandable even though this can be done to 
excess and improperly with people without merit sometimes getting 
appointed.  Nevertheless, governments have a right to appoint 
people to carry out policy whom they trust share their world view 
and can carry out their policy thrusts in any particular area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there are a number of other positions that are not 
positions in which people are entrusted with the carrying out of 
government policy.  What they are entrusted with is the scrutiny 
of government policy.  Their job is to criticize, if necessary, 
government policy.  For instance, there is no possibility that 
part of the job of an ambassador is to criticize government 
policy.  He is an extension of government policy.  However, a 
privacy commissioner, an information commissioner, an official 
languages commissioner and a number of other of those kinds of 
appointments that may exist either as officers of the House or 
out in the broader realm of the public service are quite 
different in that respect. 
Certainly the Office of the privacy commissioner falls within 
that realm.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I go back, at the risk of sounding repetitive, as I know I do to 
some people in the House, to the McGrath report.  We suggested in 
that report that real power be given to committees of the House 
when it comes to these kinds of appointments and, for that 
matter, when it comes to a variety of other critical 
appointments, like the appointment of the head of the CRTC, at 
that time called the CTC, and those to a number of other 
government boards and commissions.  This was not just to have 
informal consultations but to give committees real power to hear 
from potential candidates, not just candidates that the 
government had already selected, or if it was fixed on only one 
candidate, to hear from that candidate and make a recommendation. 
For that matter, we even suggested that the committee have some 
measure of veto power over whether or not an appointment was to 
be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That long standing recommendation goes back some 15 years.  The 
government had an opportunity here to implement that 
recommendation in one way or another through having a much more 
meaningful process than it did, instead of asking us what we 
thought of a candidate and then appointing him as an interim 
privacy commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is putting the rest of us on the spot now.  The government 
tells us that a candidate is going to come before the committee 
and at committee we then find out that it is a hybrid event.  It 
is not really a committee meeting but an informal discussion. 
There may or may not be a record of the conversation.  I raised 
this matter with the chairman at the time and I understood from 
what he said that there would be a record, but now I understand 
that there is not.  The record is not available.  As far as I am 
concerned, I was misled at the time with respect to the nature of 
the meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lot to be unhappy about.  There is the failure of the 
government to implement a long standing recommendation when it 
had an opportunity to do so with respect to these kinds of 
appointments.  We are unhappy with the inadequacy of the 
government's process, by its own standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Radwanski is capable of impartiality.  Even though he was 
an active Liberal, he has a history of being critical of the 
Liberal government and the Liberal Party from time to time.  That 
is beside the point.  The point is that when it comes to this 
kind of position the government should have chosen someone who 
was beyond reproach at the level of perception.  I am sure that 
there are many capable Canadians who have no particular political 
party association and who would make great privacy commissioners. 
They would not necessarily come from the public service because, 
as we know, sometimes bureaucrats have a tendency to secrecy.  I 
do not mean secrecy in the privacy sense, but secrecy in the 
secrecy sense.  They might not fit the bill either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that there are Canadians who would have been great 
nominees.  Parliament could have had some role in short listing 
them and suggesting to the government that it select from half a 
dozen people.  This would have been a much more meaningful 
process and would have helped, in the public's mind, to reduce 
the cynicism about parliament being a rubber stamp for things 
that are decided elsewhere.  Let us not kid ourselves.  This was 
clearly decided elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could, for the sake of Mr. Radwanski and for the sake of 
public perception, have a nice touchy feely debate in the House 
and pretend that parliament is doing something.  That is not what 
is happening.  Parliament has been presented with a fait accompli 
and an inadequate process.  This is another missed opportunity. 
As far as I am concerned, this is another demonstration of the 
fact that the government and the Liberal Party are a hopeless 
case when it comes to democratic reform or doing anything that 
would really enhance the perception and the power of parliament.

before discussing this appointment, I would like, on behalf of

who, in spite of often extremely difficult circumstances, did a 
professional job. Mr. Phillips can only be praised for the 
impartiality and common sense that he displayed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point, I think that the Parliament of Canada and all 
Canadians and Quebecers want the privacy commissioner to be 
someone with good judgment and with the ability to objectively 
evaluate the facts before him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We congratulate Bruce Phillips and we wish him a new career that 
will allow him to use his skills for the benefit of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the appointment of Mr. Radwanski, anyone taking the time 
to read his resumé can only agree that this man has a very 
extensive knowledge of Canadian politics. He is most certainly a 
brilliant and very intelligent person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know, however, that these qualities are important but do 
not necessarily provide all the rigour required to hold an 
office that must be totally exempt from any partisan behaviour. 
The Bloc Quebecois will not approve this appointment for the 
simple reason that parliament must be allowed to ask questions 
to a candidate to the position of privacy commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is another appointment made by the executive branch of 
government and it could be perceived as a political 
appointment. I believe the government—the one that is still in 
office—would definitely not want to give that impression. I 
humbly suggest that the government order that this candidate be 
called by the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights to 
answer the questions of members of parliament. In my view, this 
is the least we can ask in a parliament that claims to be the 
most democratic and the best one in the world.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to have the hon. member's comments both on the 
systemic attitude that the government has shown in ignoring past 
recommendations and on making these appointments much more open 
and much more transparent to all Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral: </B>Mr. Speaker, 
there is no doubt that the issue of transparency in parliaments 
is taking on increasing importance.  With the emergence of all 
the information technologies, the average person is becoming 
increasingly aware that things are not as they should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The appointment to which the hon. member referred is just one 
more example of what I would call the almost disturbing power 
wielded by a majority government which has the right to decide 
on a number of appointments with ramifications for the public.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Gruending (Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, as our House leader said earlier, our opposition to 
this process is not based on any personal judgment about Mr. 
Radwanski, who is a journalist of some renown although he does 
have historic and close ties with the Liberal Party.  It is the 
process we do not like. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can my hon. friend from the Bloc enlighten us briefly about what 
sort of process would be better in a case like this, rather than 
having the government simply dip into its bag of Liberal contacts 
and friends to make an appointment that really flies in the face 
of any parliamentary debate or participation?  What process would 
be better? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral:</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I will give an example of what I think would be a clear way of 
doing things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be having an election soon, in three weeks or three 
months.  We do not know when but there will be one.  When 
elected parliamentarians return to the House how will they 
choose their Speaker? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the role of the Speaker of the House of Commons to be 
impartial, to use judgment and common sense.  These are three 
attributes required of the privacy commissioner.  I think that 
everyone would agree with me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why, therefore, would parliament not elect one of several 
candidates?  Naturally this takes longer and is more 
complicated than just appointing someone, but when it is a 
question of privacy, something that affects us all, is it not 
worth taking a little of the House's time?  This is something 
that is very basic and I am certain that Canadians as well as 
Quebecers would see it as a plus for democracy. 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to take part in this debate. I think it is about a 
very important matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin my remarks by commending and thanking Mr. Phillips 
for his work. He has worked very hard for the country. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is fair to say that he brought great competence and 
great class to the office he filled and to the work he did on 
behalf of Canadians in his capacity as privacy commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would very much like to attach myself to the remarks of prior 
speakers on the opposition side of the House, particularly those 
of the House leader of the New Democratic Party, who has a great 
deal of experience and a remarkable degree of understanding of 
the inner workings of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much of the theme he touched on in his remarks is that which is 
most important, which we are discussing here, and that is, it is 
not the personal aspects of this appointment but the process that 
was followed that is offensive to those previous speakers on the 
opposition side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also must take issue with the way in which we were given some 
semblance of an opportunity to have interaction and discussions 
with Mr. Radwanski.  I want to preface everything by saying this 
is not to in any way question the integrity, competence or 
ability of this individual.  Yet when the name was first brought 
forward in February of this year by the government House leader, 
there was some initial resistance, some initial question, that 
was expressed on the part of other government House leaders. I 
note that my colleague from the Bloc is indicating likewise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue just seemed to disappear.  It just seemed to go away. 
Then, while parliament was not in session this summer, we were 
suddenly notified after the fact that this person would be given 
this appointment.  It was a very after the fact, stealth like 
consultation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government House leader is being a little economical with 
the truth when he says this has been an open and inclusive 
process.  It is a shame, a crying shame, because in my opinion 
this puts a pall over an individual who very well could serve the 
country in the same professional, proficient fashion we have seen 
of Mr. Phillips.  That remains to be seen.  We will see how this 
turns out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important to note, as my colleague from the reform 
alliance has put on record, the very close personal contacts this 
individual has with the Liberal government. Something else 
important to point out is that the resumé we received at the 
pseudo-committee meeting we had did not include the same 
connections that were on the initial résumé given back in 
February.  Those references have already been pointed out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not to say a person who was senior policy strategy and 
communications adviser to the Prime Minister would necessarily be 
partisan.  However, one would assume that working in that 
capacity he would be called upon on occasion to dispense partisan 
advice.  One would also assume that working in that capacity very 
closely with the Prime Minister he would achieve some level of 
personal attachment and friendship.  Similarly one would suspect 
that in working as a senior strategy and policy adviser and 
principal speech writer for the Right Hon. John Turner a personal 
relationship and connection would develop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know times change.  We know things evolve.  Yet the same 
government House leader who, while a prominent member of the rat 
pack, used to stand on his desk and rail like a banshee at the 
prior Conservative government, using words such as patronage orgy 
and nepotism while in opposition, now has very much embraced this 
supposedly offensive practice.  He has wrapped his arms around 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a compiled list of over 500 appointments in the past 
seven years that indicate a very strong golden thread of 
connection to the Liberal Party which leads to very lucrative and 
rewarding patronage type appointments.  The shoe is on the other 
foot and is now kicking the opposition in the teeth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know I cannot use the word hypocrisy in this place.  I am not 
allowed to use that word, but it is a shame because it seems to 
me it smacks of just that.  Famous words were uttered in debate 
when Mr. Turner was left with that anvil of patronage 
appointments hanging around his neck.  It was pointed out by 
former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney that he had a choice.  He 
had to wear that albatross.  Yet it appears the government House 
leader did not have a choice.  He had to take his marching orders 
from Mr. Goldenberg and the Prime Minister's Office.  He had to 
follow along the same path.  He obviously was in the same boat as 
Mr. Turner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know other very important supposedly non-partisan roles have 
been filled on the advice of Mr. Goldenberg and others in the 
Prime Minister's Office.  As the House leader for the New 
Democratic Party alluded to, it diminishes and sullies the 
process when this attachment exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know as well the significance of the office cannot be lost. 
The significance should never be undermined or in any way 
attacked or somehow devalued during the course of the debate, 
because the ethics commissioner's office is very important, if it 
is exercised in the way it is supposed to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, regarding the privacy commissioner, the information 
commissioner and all of the roles that are filled by individuals, 
I say with great sincerity that one hopes the persons in those 
positions will exercise their duties in a non-partisan fashion. 
When the perception exists that the only reason the appointment 
has occurred is a close connection to an individual in 
government, in this case the Prime Minister, or an individual 
with strong Liberal connections, in my opinion this leads to 
questions and further cynicism, almost bordering on apathy at 
times on the part of the public when this practice continues.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As was mentioned as well, the qualifications of the particular 
person whose name has been brought forward are very impressive. 
He is an author of great renown and an individual with 
connections in the journalistic community.  I am yet to be 
convinced and I am yet to even hear proper explanation as to why 
it is that a person necessarily with a journalistic background or 
an academic background is the person who should fill the role of 
privacy commissioner.  I do not quite follow that thinking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, this is not to attack the personalities here, but what 
special qualifications do journalists have that make them good 
privacy commissioners?  We know the natural role of a journalist 
is to disseminate and distribute information, as opposed to 
protecting the public information.  It seems to me a completely 
contrary role is filled by a journalist or author. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this context, in this parliament we have seen an occasion 
when private information of Canadian citizens was being 
distributed and was being handled in a very sloppy fashion, shall 
we say, by the HRDC, and the privacy commissioner in his capacity 
played a very important role in making that public.  Would this 
person, with his close Liberal connections, have done the same 
thing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again we must ask that question because it is also the public 
perception of impartiality that is important here, not just the 
real impartiality, but the perception of same.  We see that 
phrase used quite often in the courtroom: it is not only that 
justice be done, but that justice is seen to be done.  That is 
exactly what is at issue in this debate and the questions 
surrounding this appointment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government, I would suggest, has failed to discharge its 
duty of giving that public assurance and giving that impression. 
Therefore we have some difficulties with this: difficulty with 
the process, difficulty with that same old Liberal arrogance that 
is being displayed more and more with each passing day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The neutrality of this position has to be paramount, as well as 
certainly a working knowledge of the Privacy Act.  Again, I did 
have the opportunity to participate in the sham of a committee. 
As was alluded to, it was a hybrid.  It was not really a 
committee, but it was an opportunity after the fact to examine 
the qualifications of this individual.  To his credit, he 
certainly owned up very quickly to his connections to the Liberal 
government and expounded on his abilities in other areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One concern I have is a full appreciation and working knowledge 
of technology.  I suspect that in the capacity of privacy 
commissioner there has to be a real indepth grasp and knowledge 
of the information technology explosion and an ability to 
understand how important it is to protect information that is now 
available in computer banks and computer information that is held 
by the government.  Again we are not completely clear on the 
connection and the ability of the particular individual in that 
capacity, but time will tell.  Certainly we will have the benefit 
of hindsight, one would argue, at some time to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should be the focus of this debate. The Liberal 
government has created this situation.  It could have been 
avoided with a more open and inclusive process, if there had even 
been the invitation early on to simply sit down and talk with 
this person, to have an opportunity to meet him even, on an 
informal basis, instead of this stealthy, behind the scenes 
appointment process that occurred in this instance.  Perhaps we 
should have had an opportunity early on to do that, and it would 
have avoided some of the unpleasantness and some of the bad taste 
left in the mouth of the opposition with this appointment.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to conclude my remarks by reminding the House of 
something I was reminded of quite recently.  The individual is an 
officer of parliament whose duty, first and foremost, is to the 
people of Canada and to the Parliament of Canada, to discharge 
his or her duties honourably, with professionalism, and in an 
impartial way, devoid of any sort of partisan political 
considerations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are unfortunately left, to some degree, with damaged goods. 
That is most unfortunate for the privacy commissioner.  This 
could have been avoided if the government had chosen to go about 
this in a different fashion and if the nominee had been given an 
opportunity earlier to meet with opposition members to satisfy 
concerns they might have about the way in which this process took 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I would suggest that our retiring privacy commissioner, 
Mr. Phillips, certainly performed very ably on behalf of the 
country.  We wish him well in his future endeavours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope this debate, to some small degree, will be a reminder to 
the government that those on the opposition side of the House 
have every right to question.  There is in fact a public 
expectation that the opposition will question the way in which 
these appointments are made.  They should not have the ring or 
the stench of patronage.  They should not reflect nepotism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If competence is to be the true criterion, let us ensure that 
takes place through a fair, open and inclusive process of 
examination of those appointments.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
listened with interest to the remarks made by the hon. member 
from the Progressive Conservative Party as well as by all our 
colleagues from the other political parties, except those from 
the party in power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now speaking about an officer of parliament. The privacy 
commissioner is indeed an officer of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would my colleague from the Progressive Conservative Party be in 
agreement with what my colleague from Laval Centre proposed, 
that is that it should be up to parliament, therefore to all the 
members in this House, to appoint officers of parliament? These 
officers should have no connection of any kind since they are 
supposed to represent the whole population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would he agree that all the members of parliament should elect 
the privacy commissioner? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for her 
question. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would certainly agree that parliament should have greater say 
and greater participation in the selection of the officers of 
this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To rule out individuals who have had active participation in the 
political process is somewhat naive.  I am not saying this 
personally to the member.  We do want to encourage people to 
participate in the political process to whatever degree, through 
support of the party, through support of an individual, or 
through participation in politics generally.  We do not want to 
say that would somehow negate a person's ability to fill an 
office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if there is to be confidence and the perception that 
the person will perform the role impartially, then parliament 
should have the final say.  I believe that having an open vote is 
appropriate in some cases, not necessarily in all appointment 
cases, but for roles in which the underlying objective and need 
to be fulfilled is the duty to respond to parliament.  Yes, at 
the end of the day, parliament should have the final say in 
electing those individuals.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague from 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough for his comments.  I only wish 
his good friend the premier of Nova Scotia, Dr. John Hamm, would 
hear his comments.  As we all know, a former major Conservative 
member received a very plum position in Nova Scotia as deputy 
minister of education and received a raise on top of what the 
person previously in that position received. I hope his comments 
translate to the provincial Conservative premier. But that is 
just a little punch to a provincial issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is absolutely correct in that parliament needs to be 
more relevant, more transparent and more open.  What role can the 
hon. member see the general public playing in this? Would it be 
just through elected officials in the committee? Would the 
general public have an actual say in this as well or does he feel 
that it would get too bogged down in some sort of bureaucratic 
malaise?  Can the hon. member see the general public having an 
actual say on who is appointed to these very prestigious 
positions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will respond in two 
parts.  First, about trying to make some sort of a tie to what 
happened in Nova Scotia, that individual was not an officer of 
parliament obviously.  With respect to the NDP, I think there is 
still some residual smarting for the spanking that party received 
in the provincial election in Nova Scotia.  I will not delve into 
that partisan boxing match. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from the eastern shore of Nova Scotia would know 
that it is sometimes difficult to involve the general public 
entirely in the appointment processes.  I would suggest that is 
what elected individuals are supposed to do. They are entrusted, 
one would hope, with the public confidence and with the faith 
that they will fulfil their roles in critiquing the government or 
when in government that they will fulfil their roles in an 
impartial way to as large a degree as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know my friend from Nova Scotia, my fellow Bluenoser, is a 
person who appreciates that these processes have to take place 
sometimes in a speedy fashion.  If we go to complete populism 
where there are referendums on everything and complete public 
input on every appointment, I would suggest that government and 
the bureaucratic malaise he refers to would kick in. There would 
be a grinding, screeching halt to all government operations if we 
tried to approach it in that fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take his point.  Certainly openness and greater participation 
from all sides of the House and certainly increased public 
confidence and increased public participation are things we 
should all strive for in this place. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères—Les-Patriotes, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I listened carefully to what my colleagues from the opposition 
parties had to say. I can only agree with them that this kind of 
appointment should for the most part be made by parliament and 
not by the government, its decision then being ratified by the 
majority in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the difference between an appointment made with the 
consent of all the parties represented in the House and an 
appointment submitted, brought forward and even, as is the case 
today, imposed by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the credit of Bruce Phillips, the privacy commissioner who is 
stepping down today, I must say that he had a very delicate role 
to play in the last few months. The commissioner must absolutely 
deal at arm's length with the government. We saw this not too 
long ago, when he played a key role when the government tried to 
link the data from the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency with 
those of the Department of Human Resources Development. Had he 
been close to the government, he might not have got involved. 
The retiring commissioner also played a major role in bringing 
to light the existence of the longitudinal file of the 
Department of Human Resources Development. 
Had he been close to the government he might not have got 
involved.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We should really make sure that the individual appointed to this 
position is impartial, non-partisan and independent, especially 
from the government, and all the more so because the new 
legislation dealing with the protection of personal information 
in the private sector still seems to us to be very vague, 
especially as regards the development of e-commerce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that the appointee be under no suspicion at 
all for collusion or dubious contacts with the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Conservative House leader 
not find it strange that the appointment process for officials 
of the House provided in various laws is not exactly the same? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is an example. Subsection 49(1) of the Official Languages 
Act reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>49.(1)  There shall be a Commissioner of Official Languages for 
Canada who shall be appointed by commission under the Great Seal 
after approval of the appointment by resolution of the Senate 
and House of Commons. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the Privacy Act, it states under subsection 53(1): 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>53. (1)  The Governor in Council shall, by commission under the 
Great Seal, appoint a privacy commissioner after approval of the 
appointment by resolution of the Senate and House of Commons. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A simple approval is all that is required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not strange that the appointment process is not exactly 
the same for the various House officials and that, in this 
case, the commissioner is appointed by the governor in council? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question. I think my colleague is absolutely right. I 
believe it is necessary to apply the same standards so that 
there is a balance. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is right to point out that for these positions 
there should be a higher standard.  If we are going to expect the 
office to hold the respect of the public, if we are going to 
expect there to be confidence in the proficiency and in the 
process, we should have this equal standard that requires the 
approval and examination and the penetrating view of both houses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely anything to suggest otherwise diminishes the importance 
of the role itself.  The privacy commissioner, language 
commissioner, ethics commissioner and information commissioner 
are all extremely important offices that serve or should serve 
Canadians with the highest degree of professionalism and 
non-partisanship. To ensure that happens in the first instance, 
maybe we should be looking at a similar standard apply 
that will give Canadians the confidence and that will give 
parliament itself the confidence and dignity and raise the 
standard which is applied to these appointments and the process.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is the House ready for the question? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Question. 
<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Just before I put the question, 
the Chair would like to clarify something that happened earlier 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the beginning of debate this morning when government orders 
were called, the clerk at the table rose and announced that the 
item of business to be called was Bill C-8 at report stage.  The 
announcement was complete.  The government House leader indicated 
that had not been his wish.  He wished to proceed with the motion 
that is now before the House and which I am about to put to the 
House. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Verchères—Les-Patriotes raised a point of 
order, asking the Chair to continue with Bill C-8, which had 
been called by the clerk at the table.  At that time I decided 
that the government was always entitled to change the order of 
government orders.  That is what was done through the 
intervention of the government House leader. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I regret that it appears the Chair made an error in making such 
a ruling.  In fact, the Chair should have proceeded with Bill C-8 
at that time. The hon. member for Verchères—Les-Patriotes was 
quite correct in that, and I cite for the House on this point, 
Erskine May's book <I>Parliamentary Practice</I>, page 319: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When an order of the day has been read, it must thereupon be 
proceeded with, appointed for a future day, or discharged. It 
cannot be postponed until after another order except as the 
result of a motion moved by a Minister of the Crown at the 
commencement of public business. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion had in fact been called and should have been 
proceeded with. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, I must also indicate that your Chair has, like all 
other members, read the new work on this subject, <I>House of 
Commons Procedure and Practice</I>, by our distinguished colleagues 
Messrs. Marleau and Montpetit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Its wording is less precise.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Government Orders is called, any item listed may be brought 
before the House for consideration.  Any item that has been 
called, and on which debate has begun, must be dealt with until 
adjourned, interrupted or disposed of. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The wording in the new book is not as precise as in Erskine May, 
but I must state that our practice—and obviously I have been well 
advised on this—has always been what is given in Erskine May, and 
not in the new book. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read something and believed it.  Hence my decision, but it was 
obviously in error, and the hon. member for 
Verchères—Les-Patriotes was absolutely right.  Certainly the next 
time there will not be such a disaster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Louis Plamondon:</B> Mr. Speaker, if you are saying that you 
made a mistake when you authorized the tabling of the motion 
and the debate, the motion must be withdrawn. This debate should 
not have taken place and we must revert to the former version of 
Bill C-8 and ignore the part dealing with this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The problem is that the Chair made a 
mistake. The decision had been taken and it was over and done 
with. We have now completed the debate and the House is ready to 
vote on the matter. I must therefore put the question to the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sorry, and this time I am sure that I am not mistaken.

Hills—Grasslands, could not be proposed since the member was not

<P><A NAME="LINK91"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Bas-Richelieu—Nicolet—Bécancour, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise with pleasure to speak in this debate at the 
request of my devoted colleague from Jonquière, our critic on 
this subject.  She does remarkable work on behalf of the 
environment within our party and always comes up with arguments 
in the defence of Quebec's interests when the federal 
government is likely to overstep the bounds of our jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would first like to put the debate in context.  The Bloc will 
vote against this bill.  We would not object to having stricter 
or more up to date environmental measures voted on in the House, 
but we have clearly defined in two paragraphs our position 
which should it seems to me, rally all members or at least 
those from Quebec, of all parties claiming to speak for the 
interests of Quebec. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1130"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“The Bloc Quebecois supports”, said the Bloc through its devoted 
critic, the member for Jonquière, “environmental protection 
measures”.  More specifically, the Bloc Quebecois reminds the 
government that we supported it when it introduced 
legislation to establish the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the Bloc Quebecois knows that the Government of 
Quebec has its own initiatives to protect the environment and 
specifically the seabed.  The Government of Quebec is also open 
to working in this regard with the federal government, as phase 
III of the St. Lawrence action plan indicates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, and this is where the problem lies, the Bloc Quebecois 
is opposed to the bill for the following reasons:  instead of 
focusing on co-operation, as in the case of the Saguenay—St. 
Lawrence marine park, the federal government can fill marine 
conservation areas without regard to Quebec's jurisdiction over 
its own territory and the environment and, because Canadian 
Heritage is proposing to establish a new structure, the marine 
conservation areas will duplicate DFO's marine protection zones 
and Environment Canada's marine protected areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This position is clear and simple and all members 
representing Quebec should readily support it. The Bloc 
Quebecois arrived at this position after extensive consultations 
with the Quebec government, with opposition parties at the 
national assembly, with Quebec's environmental groups and with 
all the interested people in our province. Our party came to the 
conclusion, along with these stakeholders, that this was the 
best position to adopt in Quebec's best interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the federal government wants to get involved, it should 
harmonize its measures with what already exists. If Quebec 
already has effective legislation in this area, why should the 
federal government interfere? It is as simple as that. Everyone 
should agree to avoid duplication and to respect provincial 
jurisdictions, which means to respect the constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All members from Quebec 
are here to represent the interests of Quebec, regardless of 
which party they belong to. In the case of this bill, the 
interests of Quebec would be better served if the amendments 
suggested by the hon. member for Jonquière were included in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a debate on sovereignty, on a philosophical issue 
or on an issue involving millions of dollars. It is not a debate 
that would put members at odds with their constituents because 
of election speeches made during the last campaign about their 
party's platform. It is a matter of practicality. It is a matter 
of pride and of willingness to serve Quebec's interests. 
Members from Quebec sitting across the way are also here to 
protect Quebec's interests but are not doing so by 
supporting this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very simple, basic and something which 
unites all Quebecers.  Will the Liberal members 
from Quebec refuse to come on board when everyone in Quebec is 
favourable to the amendments we are proposing, the vision we 
have presented in our speeches and through press releases and 
letters written by our critic, the member for Jonquière? 
Everyone in Quebec agrees on this except the federal Liberal 
members.  But what are they doing here?  Do they represent the 
interests of Quebec? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for 
Shefford was here as a Progressive Conservative member. 
She criticized the Liberal Party, voted against Bill C-20, 
against everything.  Suddenly she decides to cross the floor of 
the House.  She announces “I am going to move across to the 
Liberal Party and see that provincial jurisdictions are 
respected. 
I am going to see that the Constitution is respected and, with 
it, Quebec's rights”.  Having gone over to the other side, she 
has fallen silent.  I see her there.  Why does she say nothing?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She now prefers to serve the Liberal Party and its leader, who 
has always worked to crush Quebec.  She prefers that to 
defending Quebec's interests.  What is the member doing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to the people of Granby who are listening at home. 
Their representative has stopped speaking.  The person they 
elected as a Progressive Conservative back then, thinking that 
she would defend their interests, defended those interests for a 
while and then suddenly went over to the other side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to send greetings to the mayor, the municipal 
council and all the community, social and economic 
organizations we had the opportunity to meet.  The Bloc 
Quebecois caucus meeting was held in the magnificent city of 
Granby and we had an opportunity to visit the entire riding.  We 
saw what proud people they are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the people of Granby to know that the Bloc 
Quebecois members will now be proud to defend them and proud to 
speak for them here in the House of Commons.  The people of 
Granby will never hear the voice of their representative again. 
They will never hear a word out of her, no more speeches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a person moves over to the Liberal Party, he or she joins a 
voiceless party, what I called the “muffler party” the other 
day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their representative will no longer speak for them, so I would 
like the people of Granby to know that they can count on the 
Bloc Quebecois and on us. 
If they have questions, letters, phone calls or need someone to 
defend their rights, let them call a valiant Bloc Quebecois MP. 
We will be there to defend the people of Granby. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel:</B> You will not have that opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Louis Plamondon: </B>I have just heard some words from a Quebec 
Liberal MP.  That is the surprise of the day.  He said “You will 
not have that opportunity”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel:</B> From a Franco-Manitoban. Don't you know 
the difference? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Louis Plamondon:</B> Pardon me, a Manitoba MP.  I would have 
been surprised if it had been one from Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel:</B> He is confused.  There is a difference 
between Manitoba and Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Louis Plamondon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I ask the member from 
Manitoba, who will be speaking soon, to tell us just how much he 
serves the interests of Manitoba's francophones.  I sit on the 
committee for the defence of the interests of francophones 
outside Quebec and the official languages committee and I have 
never seen him at this committee, I note in passing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Granby live in a beautiful region but their 
spokesperson will be silent from now on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that this lady gave the next general election 
considerable thought before crossing over.  I know, however, 
that the voters of Granby are now thinking about who they will 
vote for in the next election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation is the same for the member for Compton—Stanstead. 
He was here. 
Why did he criticize everything the Liberal government proposed 
for three years?  For three years he criticized all the bills, 
including Bill C-20.  He rose to say “No, that makes no sense”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then after three years, he is prepared to join 
this party, which has always worked contrary to the interests of 
Quebec.  He is prepared to do so as a member from Quebec.  Is 
that acceptable?  Is he serving the interests of Quebec by doing 
so or is he looking out for his own interests? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am looking forward to seeing the reaction of the people of 
this riding, whom I salute in passing, and to whom we offer our 
full co-operation through our candidate, Mr. Leroux, who was 
selected and who will make an excellent member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It saddens me to think of this riding. 
I remember the two previous members who represented that riding, 
Mr. Bernier and François Gérin. These were men of their word. 
They were elected, they worked hard for their riding and they 
also respected Quebec's interests. Never would they have put 
their personal interests before those of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in that riding must also be disappointed by the 
attitude of a member of parliament who claimed to be a 
spokesperson for Quebec. Now that he has crossed the floor, he 
never opens his mouth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned those two members of parliament but what about the 
member for Lac-Saint-Louis who is here with us and who is a 
former Quebec minister of the environment? Would he have 
accepted such a bill by the federal government? 
In fact, in 1987 when he was a Liberal minister in Quebec, he 
introduced an environmental bill that clearly defined 
jurisdictions.

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would he have let the federal government get involved in a 
provincial jurisdiction? No. He would have risen in the national 
assembly and told the federal government “You have no reason to 
come up with such a bill”. He would have fought as a Quebecer 
but now that he is a federal Liberal member of parliament he 
remains silent. Worse still, he supports this interference in 
Quebec's jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is that?  What is it that they slip the members from Quebec 
when they join the Liberal Party?  Why do they fall silent?  Why 
do they agree to serve Quebec's interests so badly, to serve the 
Liberal Party, to let its leader— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Serve his own interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Louis Plamondon:</B> —and to let the leader of the party serve 
his own interests, to serve the friends of the party and to go 
along with this sham?  How is that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, I saw the member for Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies who was 
appointed by the provincial government of Mr. Bourassa to chair 
environmental commissions.  This member should be the leading 
spokesperson for Quebec because he is very familiar with the issues. 
What is more, when he was commissioner he always said that 
jurisdictions should be respected and that when it came to the 
environment the best approach was not confrontation but 
harmony.  That was what he always said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I again appeal to all members from Quebec, 
whatever their political stripe, that Quebec's best interests 
are at stake.  We must join forces to vote against this bill or 
at least to amend it so that it serves Quebec's interests. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK92"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to speak 
to Bill C-8, an act respecting marine conservation areas.  As the 
title alone would indicate, why would anyone be against marine 
conservation areas?  When we say it like that it sounds great. We 
are going to protect conservation areas in the marine aquatic 
areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, it is just the title.  Like most other things the 
Liberal government does, this is another piece of legislation 
that came out of the south end of a northbound cow.  It is simply 
not strong enough.  It is not going to do what it is supposed to 
do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a bill that is also before the House, Bill C-33, the 
endangered species act.  It is very clear when we speak to people 
within the environment committee and to people who appeared 
before the committee that the bill does not protect the habitat 
of the endangered species.  That is what this bill does.  It does 
not do anything to protect conservation areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will digress for just a moment.  One of the reasons why the 
cod stocks on the east coast of Atlantic Canada are down is the 
massive overfishing through the technology that we use today in 
dragging and trawling the ocean floor.  They completely drag the 
bottom of the ocean floor and everything comes up with it.  Then 
they throw over what they do not need, dead, to the tune of 
millions of pounds of fish.   Every year in this country and 
around the world fish are being dumped overboard.  As we speak, 
there is dumping going on in the Georges Bank and in the NAFO 
areas of the Flemish Cap because they throw overboard the fish 
species they do not want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will permit trawling and dragging in these conservation 
areas.  It is absolute madness.  If we are going to protect a 
particular area it means we must have the most sustainable 
environmental methods of harvesting our dwindling aquatic 
resources.  The bill does not even address that problem.  In the 
entire country, the government did absolutely no consultation on 
the bill with any fishing communities.  I find it absolutely 
deplorable that people who rely on ocean species for their 
livelihood are not even consulted on this very important bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, I cannot help but notice that the Minister of Veterans 
Affairs is reported in the newspapers today as saying that he 
wants an expansion of the 200 mile zone to a 350 mile zone. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1145"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT22"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT22"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1145

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That sounds great, but what is its main purpose?  Is it to 
protect fishing jobs and coastal communities on the east coast 
and on the west coast, or is there another reason for it?  Are 
his comments or ideas included in Bill C-8, an act respecting 
marine conservation areas?  Are they even included?  I would 
doubt very much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a burgeoning oil and gas industry off the east coast. We 
have a beautiful place called Sable Island about 100 miles off 
the coast of Halifax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were told in 1997 that for oil and gas seismic work Sable 
Island would be a no-touch zone.  That means no seismic work 
would be done on Sable Island because they did not need to do it. 
It is a no-touch zone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened last year?  Seismic cables were drawn clearly 
across that island, a very fragile ecosystem.  They changed the 
rules.  They changed the code of practice in order to get that 
work done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it absolutely astonishing that one year they say 
something and two years later they do something completely 
different.  If we are truly interested in protecting marine 
conservation areas, we should stand by our words and truly 
protect the aquatic species in Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, it has cost taxpayers across the country $4.2 
billion to readjust the fishing industry on east coast since 
1988.  Yet the cod stocks are not rebounding.  Salmon stocks are 
in trouble.  We heard the other day that turbot stocks may be in 
trouble.  Crab stocks off Newfoundland are in trouble.  The bill 
could have provided some protection for breeding grounds and 
spawning grounds for many of those species, but unfortunately it 
falls terribly short. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side of the House know that the government cannot 
handle certain areas on its own.  The federal government does not 
have the wherewithal or the knowledge to be able to do it on its 
own.  Why would it not include the province, the communities and 
those people closest to the resource in the decision making 
process? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand why Bloc Quebecois members are so angry.  It goes 
completely against what we voted on in the House earlier in Bill 
C-7, the Saguenay—St. Lawrence Marine Park model.  That was an 
excellent example of co-operation at all three levels of 
government to protect a very sensitive area for beluga whales. 
Now Bill C-8 goes completely the other way.  It is absolute 
madness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again we have that top down, bureaucratic, central based 
government saying to the extremities of the country “We know 
what is best for you in Ottawa, so be quiet, forget about it and 
we will move forward”.   It is disguised under a nice, 
touchy-feely thing called conservation of marine areas and 
protection of the environment, but unfortunately it simply does 
not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another big problem the government failed to address is that 
Victoria, British Columbia, and Halifax, Nova Scotia, still pump 
raw sewage into our oceanways.  They are dumping millions of 
pounds of sewage every year into the waterways and our oceanways. 
The federal government has refused to act.  It refuses to assist 
the city of Victoria and the city of Halifax in stopping 
deleterious substances from going into our oceanways and 
affecting our marine aquatic species.  The bill does not even 
address that issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the Liberals really up to?  They are all right.  They 
are pretty decent people.  In fact some of them in the House 
today are my friends.   However, I doubt very much they have even 
read the bill.  I doubt very much they have even informed their 
constituents about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is very misleading.  We simply cannot have that any 
more, especially on the east coast with a burgeoning oil and gas 
industry.  Many people are very concerned about seismic work off 
the east and west coasts of Cape Breton Island.  There has been 
no consultation with user groups.  The province and federal 
government, through the Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum 
Board, grant the leases and tell the companies to do an 
environmental assessment after they get the leases.  It is sort 
of putting the cart before the horse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The environmental assessment should be done on these areas long 
prior to any seismic work being done.  The government has shifted 
responsibility from the public sector into the private sector, 
which could have devastating effects on fishing communities 
throughout Atlantic Canada.  We do not know exactly what is going 
on in the oceanways.  We have cut back in that department in 
science so much that this does not go a very long way.

opposition or other members of society is simply not acceptable 
in the Liberal way of things.  It is incredible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that there are many good things we can do to protect 
our environment by working co-operatively with all three levels 
of government, with all five official parties, and with our 
friends in society who are seriously concerned about having true 
marine conservation areas on our coastlines to protect aquatic 
species and to protect the planet for many generations to come.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to stand today to talk about the Marine 
Conservation Act, Bill C-8, which I think is what is on the 
table.  I appreciate the member's remarks and some of the insight 
from the Atlantic coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the political rant from the separatists, it is easy to go on 
a rant and the closer we get to an election it seems all the more 
simple.  It seems to me that right now we should be discussing 
the Marine Conservation Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member across the way from British Columbia will be well 
aware of the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society, with which I 
met earlier this morning.  It talks about marine protected areas. 
We are talking about marine conservation areas.  I suspect they 
are pretty much the same, but when we look at semantics we start 
to try to decide what it is we are actually dealing with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as members of the opposition certainly believe in sustainable 
development and the management of the environment.  Anyone in the 
country would be foolish not to realize the importance of that in 
this day and age.  We simply must do that.  We have to be able to 
preserve biodiversity and conserve the environment for the 
enjoyment of Canadians, present and future.  There are always 
generations coming along and it gets more and more important for 
people to be able to enjoy that whether it is in the oceans, in 
the Great Lakes or on land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I question the fact that this bill falls under the heritage 
department.  I am not saying that we do not need to look at 
marine conservation areas.  This may well be important, but I 
question why it is in the heritage portfolio.  Bill C-8 appears 
to fulfil preservationist and environmental objectives instead of 
the usual objectives for national parks, historical or heritage 
sites which generally allow relatively free public access.  We 
need to ask just how much free public access will there be to 
these conservation areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 5 would therefore rightfully change the minister 
looking after the bill from the Canadian heritage minister to the 
fisheries and oceans minister.  Some may ask:  “What difference 
would that make?  Is it not just a title?”  If we look at 
national parks or marine parks, as the minister wants to change 
them, we have to look at the bureaucracy attached to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Granted, national parks and their agencies certainly do a pretty 
good job of looking after and administering national parks.  It 
seems to me that the Department of Fisheries and Oceans already 
looks after some small areas.  Granted, they are not as large as 
the MCAs the minister is wanting to include, but certainly under 
the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans there are already marine 
protected areas.  If the whole structure is in place it seems to 
me it would be wise to make use of it and perhaps put it under 
the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could get skeptical or cynical and say that the same minister 
of heritage was the environment minister before and maybe is 
trying to encroach on her old area.  It could be just some 
nostalgia to say that it would be important to look at the whole 
area of the good old days back in environment.  I understand the 
Minister of the Environment would look after, very specifically, 
seabirds.  To enlarge that area it may not be wise to put it 
under the Minister of the Environment.  Certainly I believe the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans would be a great overseer of one 
of these marine parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have concern about some clauses in the bill which would 
allow the government or the minister to circumvent the usual 
parliamentary process.  When we look at the Henry VIII clauses in 
the bill, the minister would be allowed to designate new areas 
under the act without having to steer an amending act through 
parliament.  Whether we agree or disagree with it, parliament is 
the place where these things should be discussed and at least 
passed so that even if it is a rubber stamp, at least it got 
stamped. 
With the Henry VIII clauses where the minister could bring in 
sweeping new changes and designate new areas, it would not even 
have to come back to pass the House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key Henry VIII clause, clause 7,  delegates the authority to 
object to the creation or expansion of a new marine conservation 
area or reserve to a standing committee.  The whole House must 
confirm the committee's objection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Somewhere in this precinct on Parliament Hill today we see that 
the government has asked if it could strike a couple of 
committees early, ahead of the scheduled time next week or the 
week after, to come up with committee chairs.  That is all it 
wants to do today.  It just wants to come up with a couple of 
chairmen for these committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Opposition members went in good faith to the couple of 
committees this morning, finance and immigration, and agreed to 
allow it to go ahead so a chair could be established, but there 
would be no business done, the government told us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We got in there and all of a sudden it was said:  “We are just 
going to look at these couple of bills today”.  We can 
understand why people are nervous.  They are told one thing, and 
when they walk in there in good faith all of a sudden there are 
surprises.  I love surprises but sometimes after I have made a 
commitment to something I like it to be what I signed on for. 
Those kind of surprises are never much fun. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today before noon we have had the very thing happen we are 
concerned about.  We were told one thing and then something 
absolutely different happened.  That causes us great concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Schedules 1 and 2 are to describe the lands to be set aside in 
marine conservation areas and reserves.  In other words, with 
schedules 1 and 2, the government will make sure it designates 
the lands.  It will tell us about it and have a really good 
conversation so we know everything right upfront, but no lands 
are described in schedules 1 and 2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is asking us to sign the cheque and it will let 
us know what they are later.  It reminds me of the Charlottetown 
accord in 1992 where the government was trying to push a document 
through.  Fortunately it put it to a national referendum, and I 
give the Tories credit for that.  I think it changed the way 
politics will be done in the country because the people had the 
power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be able to say “we will let you know” and designate it, as 
in the Charlottetown accord when it said “Just give us the 
go-ahead on this and we will tell you some of the constitutional 
changes we want to make later”, I would be considered foolish if 
I went to my truck dealer, gave him my signed cheque and told him 
to fill in the amount later.  You would never do that in your 
business, Mr. Speaker.  Nor should the Canadian public with this. 
Canadians certainly have concerns about the whole area of these 
schedules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also it gives the minister too much discretionary power and a 
lack of adequate public consultation.  I have had a briefing from 
Parks Canada and appreciate the fact that a consultative process 
goes on.  I know they have just been through that up in the Lake 
Superior area, that there have been consultations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say that is great.  It is a terrific start.  However the area 
that would cause me the very most concern is the whole idea of 
federal-provincial negotiations.  It looks as though the federal 
government obviously takes precedence over the provincial 
government.  It has just happened too many times and there are 
too many awkward situations where the federal government has come 
in and just stamped out the rights or concerns of the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With discretionary power the minister would be able to just 
waltz right into the provinces and say “Thanks very much for 
that 12 minutes of consultation but, sorry, we are going to go 
ahead and do it our way”.  That works for Frank Sinatra but I do 
not think so for government policy on marine conservation acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to speak about the whole idea of prohibitions in the 
bill.  We have concerns with the whole aviation area, that the 
minister has the right not just to scale back on but to prohibit 
flights over some of these sensitive areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of float planes on the west coast that fly 
around out there.  Could the minister, as it says in the bill, 
and the answer would obviously have to be yes, absolutely 
prohibit some of these small aircraft that may be coming into the 
area carrying tourists?  Aside from any new air traffic that 
might be coming in, would the minister have the power to 
absolutely prohibit them?  There are piles of scheduled flights 
every day. There are seaplanes buzzing around all over the west 
coast.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously that makes me nervous too because we look at some of 
the things we have already seen.  For instance, we saw this 
minister overlook safety concerns in national parks before when 
they wanted to close the Banff and Jasper airstrips.  They 
said that was they wanted to do and they were going to shut 
them down.  I do not think we can do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 22 would put aviation associations and provincial 
aviation councils on the list of bodies to be consulted by the 
minister.  It seems very reasonable to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, regarding resource exploitation or exploring, I know 
some of my colleagues will deal with this with far more expertise 
than I will in the hours to come.  However, for marine 
conservation areas which would have their boundaries 
established, knowing that there would be resource mineral 
extraction, the government would say “Okay, we will put them 
over here then”.  That works for today but how in the world 
would it work in future years if we found that we have the 
technology available to extract some of those resources?  Who 
would have thought we would have ever seen a Hibernia project 15 
or 20 years ago?  It seemed impossible to be able to make that 
extraction through a Hibernia project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those kinds of things are the areas that we have severe concerns 
about.  I know the member opposite will address those and I am 
looking forward to her comments and concerns.  We want to make 
sure we do this as well as possible, but when we see red lights 
and alarms we want to make sure we pay attention to them.  I know 
the government is very pleased to make corrections to address our 
concerns.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity today to participate in this 
debate at report stage on Bill C-8, an act respecting marine 
conservation areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I want to express the regret of the hon. member for West 
Nova who is the Progressive Conservative heritage critic.  He is 
unable to be here today to present his views on this second group 
of amendments introduced at report stage.  I know he is truly 
disappointed that he cannot be here and that he is missing this 
opportunity to condemn the federal government for going forward 
with this flawed piece of legislation, despite the very serious 
ramifications it could have on our coastal communities, 
particularly communities in and around the Atlantic area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government's decision to go forward with the bill at 
this particular time is totally reprehensible.  It shows its 
clear lack of understanding for the potentially explosive 
situation that presently exists in Atlantic Canada.  Violent 
feelings are running very high in and around the Burnt Church and 
New Edinburgh areas because of illegal native fishing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now in the midst of this very dangerous situation, the Minister 
of Canadian Heritage has suddenly decided she wants to pass a 
piece of legislation in the House of Commons which could 
negatively affect fishermen.  It clearly shows the contempt that 
the Liberal government has for the people of Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, the hon. member for West Nova, was told in 
committee that extensive consultations had been conducted all 
over the country prior to introducing the bill.  These so-called 
consultations were more or less confined to sending letters out 
to fishing organizations advising them of the government's 
intention to introduce a marine conservation act.  The government 
has interpreted the lack of response as a total acceptance of its 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most fishermen in West Nova and in the Atlantic provinces have 
never heard of these plans.  Frankly, they have much larger 
problems to deal with and worry about at this particular point in 
time. 
It is inconceivable that lobster fishermen in the Atlantic 
provinces would participate in discussions about a new marine 
conservation act when their livelihoods are being threatened by 
the illegal native lobster fishery.

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Atlantic Canadians are witnessing the Liberal government's 
failure to fully enforce the laws of the country by not putting 
an end to the illegal lobster fishing in Burnt Church and New 
Edinburgh.  This is despite the fact that the federal government 
received clarification from the supreme court in the Marshall 
decision and was the recipient of a successful federal court 
decision in Halifax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What assurances do fishermen have that designated marine 
conservation areas will not have a negative impact on their 
fishery?  Why should they expect the Department of Canadian 
Heritage to protect these areas when the Department of Fisheries 
and Oceans has shown that it is completely unable to uphold the 
laws of the country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Minister of Canadian Heritage thinks she can protect 
these designated areas then perhaps she should take over the 
responsibilities of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.  It is 
all well and good that the Minister of Canadian Heritage wants to 
create a marine conservation act.  The Progressive Conservative 
Party has continually shown support for protecting our natural 
habitat.  Our recent support of Bill C-27 is but one of the many 
examples of our commitment to protecting the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should be ashamed of itself for going ahead with 
this bill without having held extensive public consultations.  Of 
greater concern is the fact that the government is going ahead 
with this when it knows that fishermen in the Atlantic provinces 
are preoccupied with the crisis in the fishery.  This is but one 
more example of the Liberal government's insensitivity toward the 
Atlantic provinces and toward Atlantic Canadians in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was somewhat surprised by the proposed amendment to replace 
lines 3 and 4, on page 3 to read “Minister means Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans”.  I respect the hon. member for 
Dauphin—Swan River, however, does my hon. colleague, or for that 
matter the Canadian Alliance Party, really believe that the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans and his departmental officials 
are capable of protecting newly created marine conservation 
areas?  No, I do not believe they are.  I suspect most Canadians 
would not think so either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know what the member for Dauphin—Swan River was 
thinking when he introduced this amendment, but I can certainly 
tell him that we would not support that kind of amendment.  Our 
party believes that our national parks system must remain under 
the jurisdiction of the Department of Canadian Heritage.  Whether 
these parks are on land or in water, we believe that they would be 
better served if they remained under the jurisdiction of Canada's 
new parks agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have examined the other amendments grouped together at report 
stage of this bill.  Some would appear to be purely a question of 
semantics while others were introduced to raise questions about 
provincial jurisdiction.  Our party has not introduced amendments 
because we feel that the whole process for creating this 
particular piece of legislation was fundamentally flawed right 
from the outset.  Therefore, we urge the federal government to 
withdraw this bill immediately until proper consultations can 
take place with the various stakeholders who are interested in 
this.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, with the 
introduction of Bill C-8, the Canadian government is following up 
on the work done in parliament in relation to Bill C-48 on the 
creation of marine conservation areas, which was introduced last 
session.  Thus we are picking up where we left off, that is at 
the report stage.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of federal Bill C-8, which is entitled an act 
respecting marine conservation areas and was introduced by 
Heritage Canada, is to provide a legal framework for the 
creation of 28 marine conservation areas representative of each 
of Canada's ecosystems.  The 29th marine conservation area is 
the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park, but it is not covered by 
this legislation because it has its own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be voting against this bill, not as a political rant, as 
my colleague from the Canadian Alliance put it, but because we 
have major reasons, reasons relating to the jurisdictions of 
Quebec and others, the multiplication of organisms in one area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is certainly in favour of measures to protect 
the environment, and I believe that no one can teach us anything 
in that regard as we are focusing particular efforts on working 
to protect the environment, particularly in marine conservation 
areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members  will recall that our party supported the bill 
proposing legislation to create the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine 
park, as well as being involved in initiatives to protect the 
environment, the seabed in particular.  The Government of Quebec 
is also open to efforts to that same end and has, moreover, 
shown itself capable of partnership with the federal government 
as evidenced by phase III of the St. Lawrence action plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So why are we opposed to this bill?  The answer is very simple. 
First, instead of focusing on working together, as it did in the 
case of the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park, the federal 
government wants to introduce marine conservation areas with no 
regard for Quebec's jurisdiction over its territory and 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, Heritage Canada is planning to introduce a new 
structure, marine conservation areas, which will duplicate the 
marine protection zones of the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans and the protected marine areas of Environment Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-8 ignores the integrity of Quebec's territory, because one 
of the preconditions for a marine conservation area is that the 
federal government own the territory where it is to be 
established. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsection 92(5) of the Constitution Act, 1867, makes it very 
clear that the management and sale of public lands is an 
exclusively provincial jurisdiction.  When is the government 
going to abide by the constitution it has signed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, the Loi québécoise sur les terres du domaine public 
applies to all public lands belonging to Quebec, including beds 
of waterways and lakes and those parts of the bed of the St. 
Lawrence River and the Gulf of St. Lawrence which belong to 
Quebec by sovereign right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation also provides that Quebec cannot create or 
transfer its lands to the federal government.  The only thing it 
can do is to authorize, by order, the federal government to use 
them only in connection with matters under federal jurisdiction. 
Usually, the federal government reads the constitution more 
than we do, but I think it is reading it too quickly and 
misinterpreting it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Co-operative mechanisms already exist to protect ecosystems in 
the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park and in the St. Lawrence 
River under the St. Lawrence action plan, phase III, which was 
signed by all federal and Quebec departments concerned, and 
which provides for major investments in connection with the St. 
Lawrence River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are interested in protecting the environment.  We are 
interested in a partnership but we will not give up what is 
ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why then have the so far productive partnership ventures I just 
mentioned been ignored by Heritage Canada? Why is it now 
claiming exclusive ownership of the seabed?  Will the federal 
government respect the territorial claims of Quebec or ignore 
them as usual? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are precedents.  I have mentioned two of them briefly 
and I will go back to them again in more detail.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park is a fine example of 
consultation and organization with the community respecting who 
we are and protecting all our rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 the federal and Quebec governments passed legislation 
to establish the Saguenay—St. Lawrence Marine Park. This 
legislation led to the creation of Canada's first marine 
conservation area. One of the main features of this legislation 
is the fact that the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park is the 
first marine park to be created by two levels of government 
without any land changing hands. Both governments will continue 
to fulfil their respective responsibilities. The park is made up 
entirely of marine areas and covers 1,138 square kilometres. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to promote local involvement, the acts passed by 
Quebec and by Canada confirm the creation of a co-ordinating 
committee whose membership is to be determined by the federal 
and provincial ministers. The committee's mandate is to 
recommend to the ministers responsible measures to achieve the 
master plan's objectives. The plan is to be reviewed with the 
people of the community who are aware of the activities taking 
place in the marine park. This gives great pleasure to the 
people of the north shore and the south shore alike.  My 
colleague is from the north shore.  I am from the south shore 
and everyone is happy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was a first, a fine example of success, and I do not 
understand why the 28 other marine parks did not use the same 
model.  Is it because this is a Quebec model?  Are people so 
sceptical? Are they so unreasonable that they will not transpose 
a success from one place to another part of Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another interesting example is phase III of the St. Lawrence 
action plan, which was announced in June 1998 and which also 
allows for extensive work to be done in the St. Lawrence River. 
That initiative is also an unquestionable success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are two successful initiatives that should be used as 
models. Unfortunately the government is proposing an act that 
creates overlap within the federal administration because we 
will have Heritage Canada's marine conservation areas, Fisheries 
and Oceans' marine protected areas and Environment Canada's 
marine and wildlife reserves. This will generate confusion. It 
will not ensure a single management structure but rather a lot 
of discussions, opinions and ambiguity, thus adversely affecting 
the effectiveness of the decision making process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will refrain from talking about the phony and failed 
consultation process—the participation rate was 5%—about the 
concerns and the agitation in fisheries, or about the 
interference in sectors such as transportation in marine 
conservation areas, public safety and research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the future is rooted in the past. We have a 
success story, the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park, and we have 
a failure in that Heritage Canada is incapable of protecting 
ecosystems in existing national parks, according to the 1996 
report of the auditor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of this, we wonder if Parks Canada will be able to 
protect the ecological integrity of our national parks and we 
wonder why we should not follow the example of the Saguenay—St. 
Lawrence marine park.

just like to add a small point here leaving most of the time to 
my colleague, the parliamentary secretary to the minister, who 
will address the substance of the committee report to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before doing so, however, I would just like to perhaps spend a 
couple of seconds on the comments by the hon. member for 
Bas-Richelieu—Nicolet—Bécancour, who devotes his time not to 
speaking to Bill C-8 but to casting invective at several members 
of this House, myself included.  He has become a specialist in 
invective.  I will not stoop to such an approach, of slinging 
mud when one has nothing important to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only thing that I will say is that I work very often in

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spoken about the environment here in the House on a 
number of occasions, sometimes even against my party, the 
government, when my conscience dictated.  People will judge for 
themselves whether or not what he said is true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all due respect for all members of the House, I would like 
to clarify a very important issue.  It was said that Bill C-8 
interferes in provincial jurisdiction.  But this is not the 
case, and there was a debate on this in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I chaired the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage when Bill 
C-8 was being considered and this issue was debated. 
So that there would be absolutely no doubt about this important 
issue of provincial and federal jurisdiction, the government 
agreed to introduce an amendment, which is part of the report 
tabled in the House, to say that if provincial jurisdiction over 
the seabed were challenged, a federal-provincial agreement would 
then be required before there could be any action on Bill C-8. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This therefore means that each province has a veto, and if it 
does not agree that a jurisdiction is completely federal, there 
will then be no federal-provincial agreement.  There is therefore 
no possibility under Bill C-8 that any provincial jurisdiction 
will be affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that this is a fundamental point that needs to be 
cleared up, because all that I heard from Bloc Quebecois members 
was that the federal government was interfering in provincial 
jurisdiction. 
This amendment will clearly completely prevent that.  I believe 
that Bill C-8, as it stands, is a reasonable bill, and I hope 
that it will become law as soon as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, I am very happy to turn the floor over to 
my colleague, who will speak to the House about the substance of 
the report. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK97"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank 
my colleague, who was the chair of the Standing Committee on 
Canadian Heritage, for explaining the government's position with 
respect to creating marine conservation areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is about partnership. It is about consultation.  It is 
about people wanting the legislation to occur.  The important 
thing is, when our colleagues from the Bloc Quebecois spoke out 
that this was a violation of the rights of Quebecers, I would 
submit that they have not read the legislation at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As chair of the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage said, 
the standing committee discussed the concern about what would 
happen if the province owned part of the seabed.  If it does, or 
if any part of it is contested, the province must enter into an 
agreement with the federal government to actually transfer 
ownership of that area of land to the federal government before 
we can ever proceed with this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a lot of talk over the Saguenay—St. Lawrence 
Marine Park model.  That is only one model.  In that case it was 
an undisputed fact that the seabed was under provincial control. 
Where that was the case we passed two pieces of legislation. They 
were mirror legislation.  It is just another way of doing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What Bill C-8 tries to do is actually create the framework which 
would allow us to begin consultations, to work with community 
groups and coastal communities to ensure that it is in their best 
interests that these areas are created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The critic from the official opposition also noted that that 
party had some concerns about low flying aircraft and the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage imposing regulations over aircraft. 
The legislation does not allow the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
to do just anything she wants. Again if we look at the bill, this 
is a true bill about consultation and partnership. Before any 
regulation can be passed, it has to be done in conjunction with 
the Minister of Transport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were other concerns about whether this should be an act 
that is administered by the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans or 
whether it should be something the Minister of the Environment 
should administer. 
All those ministries are complementary to what this bill is 
trying to do.  We are trying to balance conservation with 
sustainability.  The Oceans Act already provides for 
conservation, as the critic from the NDP has said.  The Minister 
of the Environment is responsible for habitat but the Department 
of Canadian Heritage is responsible for preserving Canada's 
heritage.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to take this opportunity to address the 
amendments the government has proposed.  These amendments are 
essentially technical in nature.  They deal with the fact that 
the Parks Canada Agency Act has been passed. Our amendments 
reflect the passage of that bill. As well another motion reflects 
the passage of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act because 
at the time the bill was tabled, it had not yet been passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another minor technical amendment which deals with the 
recommendation brought forward by the standing committee.  I am 
specifically referring to Motion No. 15 which talks about 
including traditional aboriginal ecological knowledge in clause 8 
of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For members who are here listening, we are proposing essentially 
all technical amendments today.  I have no further comments on 
the motions in Group No. 2.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Gruending (Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to report stage of Bill 
C-8. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democratic Party wants to restate its support for the 
principle involved in the bill.  However as we have stated 
previously, we cannot support the bill in its present form.  I am 
going to make a few general comments before getting into the 
specifics of the motions moved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our repeated efforts in committee to improve Bill C-8 were 
defeated at every turn.  We think the amendments would have 
clarified protection, conservation and jurisdictional issues 
which were raised by many witnesses, communities and opposition 
parties throughout the legislative review.  However, as in many 
other times and places in the House the committee process has 
been frustrated by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We intend to fully outline our concerns at third reading.  They 
are concerns the NDP has repeatedly raised on other parks and 
environmental bills in the 36th Parliament.  These are concerns 
which all too often the Liberal and Alliance parties continue to 
ignore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I may use an analogy, the Liberal promises and talk on the 
environment are a little like the constitution of Myanmar, the 
country formerly known as Burma.  That country has a wonderful 
constitution but the government's distasteful actions are 
contrary to the fine language in that constitution.  If I may 
extend the analogy, the Liberal government makes all kinds of 
sanctimonious comments and promises about the environment, but 
its actions, or perhaps more accurately its lack of action, give 
it away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian environmental protection bill introduced in the 
last parliament was derailed by an election, and there may be a 
parallel here as well.  It died on the order paper.  In this 
current parliament a much weaker bill has been introduced. 
Similarly the species at risk act which was around in a somewhat 
different form in the last parliament died on the order paper 
when an election was called and was reintroduced into the House 
during this parliament as Bill C-33.  It is weaker legislation 
than we would have had with the previous bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a disturbing trend with the government.  It has little 
or nothing to show on its environmental record, something which I 
think must give it a bit of pause, or perhaps it will not as we 
enter the next few weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the commissioner for the environment reported last 
spring that the federal and provincial governments had an accord 
on smog abatement signed about a dozen years ago.  He said that 
nothing really has happened.  He also said that 5,000 people a 
year in Canada are dying as a result of bad air. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the general context in which I would like to address the 
specifics of the bill. 
I could do well by quoting from the newest member of the Liberal 
caucus who was once a heritage critic for our party when he spoke 
to the bill previously.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government's repeated statement to Canadians that the 
high standards of environmental protection are being met is not 
true.  There is continued devolution and abdication of 
environmental responsibilities.  This government can sign a piece 
of paper and have a photo opportunity for the news.  Then the 
government has a program review and always cuts the budget and at 
the same time says that things are going great.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a quote from the newest member of the Liberal caucus 
completely panning the record of the party which he now embraces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now speak to the motions in Group No. 2.  The NDP 
supports Motion No. 6, an effort we believe for clarification and 
continuity between relevant acts.  This is another example of 
legislation that requires improvement at this final stage of the 
legislative process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP will support Motion No. 15, an effort to clarify the 
important contribution that aboriginal ecological knowledge plays 
in the environment and ecosystem management.  The NDP has 
consistently fought for similar amendments throughout this entire 
parliament in an effort to recognize the important role that 
traditional knowledge can play to foster a greater understanding 
between cultures and the importance of respect for the land and 
nature's processes and unique relationships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP notes that the Canadian Alliance Motion No. 35 provides 
direction for increased public participation with affected 
aviation associations and provincial aviation councils.  We also 
support this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to quickly mention that the government's lack of 
consultation in air transportation matters is legendary, as was 
most obviously seen in its granting to Air Canada an effective 
monopoly over Canadian consumers without any concomitant 
regulation.  This was an abrogation of moral responsibility to 
passengers.  The government has also downloaded safety and 
operation costs on to small communities by privatizing airports. 
I might also mention the MOX shipments which have arrived in 
Canada without emergency clean-up plans when other countries such 
as the United States deem these shipments as unsafe practices. 
We point to these as other examples of where the government has 
not consulted on transportation matters, and that is true in this 
bill as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP cannot support the Alliance's motions that will open 
marine areas for various facets of development.  We believe this 
defeats the purpose of protecting marine areas for the enjoyment 
and use of future generations.  We believe, unfortunately, that 
the Alliance does not understand the basic tenet for our national 
parks, which is long term management and not off and on 
protection that suits the whims of oil or mining companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like to draw the House's attention to Alliance Motion 
No. 52 which proposes to delete the need to take measures to 
prevent environmental damage.  We cannot support this motion.  In 
fact, a precautionary approach to environmental mitigation is 
really becoming a basic international tenet.  We hope that 
someday the Alliance Party will be able to demonstrate foresight 
and support prevention measures as well.  Prevention makes a lot 
more economic and environmental sense than cleaning up after the 
fact or trying to recapture the horses once they have left the 
stall, as we used to say on the farm.  This is common sense and 
really a basic credo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alliance Motion No. 54 provides clarity on reserve scheduling. 
We think it could help to ensure the federal government continues 
to settle aboriginal land claims in a fair, just and consistent 
manner.  The NDP will support this motion.  We are pleased, in 
this case, that the Alliance recognizes the need for a timely and 
prompt settlement of aboriginal reserves, as will be outlined in 
schedule 1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned, we will be making further comments on the bill 
at third reading stage.  However, to sum up, we think the bill in 
principle is fine.  As in many pieces of environmental and other 
legislation, for that matter, the bill falls far short of what 
the Liberals say they intend to do about the environment.  They 
talk the talk but do not walk the walk.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am very pleased to speak to this bill on behalf of my party. I 
would like to take this opportunity to commend our heritage 
critic, the member for Portneuf, and our environment critic, the 
member for Jonquière, for their excellent work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the outset, I must say that even though the Bloc Quebecois 
will oppose this bill, that decision must not be taken as 
evidence that our party is against environmental protection 
measures, on the contrary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of all my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois who are 
here in the House, I want to state that we certainly can 
appreciate the work done in our regions by the hundreds of 
volunteers involved in environmental protection. My riding is 
home to the Cap-Tourmente wildlife refuge. Other areas also need 
to be protected, including the shores of Île d'Orléans, the bay 
near Beauport and the shore in the Beaupré area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take this opportunity to salute the many volunteers 
who work for an organization called Ducks Unlimited, which is 
dedicated to protecting the environment in general and waterfowl 
in particular. Ducks Unlimited raises funds privately without 
government grants, makes these funds grow and creates marshes 
for conservation purposes. 
Some members of Ducks Unlimited are hunters who are in favour of 
a reasonable, structured and controlled hunting program, to 
ensure that the resources will still be there in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to stress the fact that even though the Bloc Quebecois is 
opposed to the bill, it supports environmental protection 
measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three reasons why I oppose this bill. The Bloc 
Quebecois members who spoke before me accurately explained them. 
Let me first elaborate on one reason in particular, namely the 
fact that, with Bill C-8, Heritage Canada is proposing the 
establishment of a new structure, namely marine conservation 
areas, that will duplicate Fisheries and Oceans' marine 
protected areas and Environment Canada's marine reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this bill is passed in its present form, we will be faced 
with an incredible administrative maze with three departments 
overlapping and all the costs that such a situation involves. 
Indeed, these new structures do not appear by magic. They 
require additional human and financial resources. Now Heritage 
Canada wants to get involved in this area, even though 
Environment Canada and Fisheries and Oceans Canada are already 
present. This will create an administrative maze. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know, given the personality of the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage, that this is undoubtedly motivated by reasons of 
visibility. Let us not forget that this same minister launched a 
flag campaign that cost Canadian taxpayers tens of millions of 
dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the end, if we in the Bloc Quebecois are speaking out 
against this administrative maze, it is not because we are 
against the public servants who are part of these structures. 
This is not the point. Whenever a new structure is set up, who 
is the common denominator when it comes to paying for it? It is 
always the same one who pays, the taxpayer, who is sick and 
tired of paying taxes and believes he is not getting value for 
his money. The fact that the Minister of Finance is bragging 
about a surplus that will likely reach $157 billion over the 
next five years is proof enough that the government is taking in 
way too much in taxes. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1240"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This should not be cause for joy. It is proof that, first, the 
government is no good at forecasting and cannot count, and 
second, that it collects too much tax. It should cut taxes as 
we, in the Bloc Quebecois, have been saying for years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another reason the Bloc Quebecois is opposed to the bill is that 
instead of favouring negotiation, as was the case for the 
Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park, the federal government may now 
establish marine conservation areas regardless of Quebec's 
jurisdiction over its territory and the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I salute the work of my colleague the member for 
Jonquière, who recognized that the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine 
park was a good thing for her area, the Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean, 
because it was to be developed in partnership with the 
Government of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Chicoutimi—Le Fjord was happy too. But in the days 
when he used to sit at the left of the Bloc Quebecois members, 
on the Progressive Conservative Party benches, he used to say to 
us regularly “We Quebecers should stick together. We should not 
let the Liberal government get away with what it is doing. It 
does not make sense to be governed by such nincompoops for 
another four years”. We are far too young to have Alzheimer's 
disease; we remember well what the member for Chicoutimi—Le Fjord 
used to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now he sits by the curtains in the last row. Exactly six and a 
half weeks have passed between his resignation from the 
Progressive Conservative Party and his first visit to this 
House. I have made note of this. We have a fine motto in Quebec 
“I remember”. The hon. member for Chicoutimi—Le Fjord, who is now 
sitting by the curtains, stayed away from the House for six and 
a half weeks. Surely he was working hard to represent his 
constituents. But the people of Chicoutimi sent him to this 
parliament to defend their interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why am I talking of the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park—which 
brings me to the hon. member for Chicoutimi—Le Fjord? Because 
apparently the hon. member for Chicoutimi—Le Fjord—this was in the 
news at noon—is tempted to join the Liberal Party. 
A token investment in an aluminium processing research centre 
should be announced this weekend, followed by the announcement 
that the hon. member for Chicoutimi—Le Fjord has sold his 
allegiance for a mess of potage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to tell the hon. member for Chicoutimi—Le Fjord and the 
people of Chicoutimi who are now listening, the people of 
Ville-de-La-Baie, Chicoutimi, Saint-Honoré, l'Anse-Saint-Jean and 
Bas-Saguenay, that I hope they will remember that this turncoat 
who had their confidence to defend an allegiance let himself be 
bought to join a government he had criticized and condemned. The 
rules do not allow me to repeat here what the hon. member for 
Chicoutimi—Le Fjord said about the prime minister. The British 
tradition and our rules keep me from repeating his words, but we 
will bring them up in due course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member for Chicoutimi—Le Fjord really intends to 
do this, whether it is as an independent, a Conservative or a 
Liberal, the people of Chicoutimi will be waiting for him just 
around the corner and will have a chance to correct the error 
they made on June 2, 1997, when they elected the hon. member for 
Chicoutimi—Le Fjord. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing let me say that the third reason we from the Bloc 
Quebecois, are opposed to this bill is because Heritage Canada 
wants to establish marine conservation areas while it is unable to 
protect the ecosystems in the existing national parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat that the Bloc Quebecois is in favour of measures to 
protect the environment. That is why we supported the 
establishment of the marine park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the Bloc Quebecois is fully aware that the Government 
of Quebec is taking steps to protect the environment and, in 
particular, the seabed.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Quebec is also willing to work toward this 
goal with the federal government, as evidenced by phase III of 
the St. Lawrence action plan, and the shoreline municipalities 
in my riding of Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans can 
also appreciate this. 
<P><A NAME="LINK99"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
as a matter of fact, what I am about to say exactly matches the 
last remarks of the previous speaker, my colleague the hon. 
member for Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before becoming a member of parliament I worked in parks and 
recreation at the municipal level. I was a recreationist. I had 
studied in this field. Over the course of many years I visited 
a number of national parks in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, this summer I visited Fundy National Park. One can 
say that there are really incredible and beautiful natural 
attractions there. I do not wish, like my colleague, to say that 
the employees of Parks Canada are not doing their work properly 
and that they are not taking the time to do it right, but the 
fact is they do not have the resources they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote from the 1996 report of the auditor 
general. In chapter 31, on the management of national parks by 
Parks Canada, the auditor general makes the following statement 
after studying a sample: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the six national parks we reviewed, Parks Canada's 
biophysical information was out-of-date or incomplete except for 
La Mauricie. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that everything is fine in La Mauricie Park. Curiously, 
it is in the Prime Minister's riding. It seems that there was 
considerable effort and investment in this riding by the federal 
government; sometimes the investments are made in businesses, 
sometimes, invoices are missing, but I will not go into that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a beautiful park. 
It appears that, with the exception of this park, there are 
problems.  According to the report: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Monitoring the ecological condition of the ecosystems in 
national parks is a high priority, according to Parks Canada 
policies and guidelines. However, in many national parks, the 
ecological conditions are not monitored on a regular, continuing 
basis. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also states that management plans for 18 national parks were 
an average of 12 years old, even though they ought to be 
reviewed every five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report goes on: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The park management plans provide strategic direction for the 
protection of park ecosystems. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general added: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Delays in preparing management plans and ecosystem conservation 
plans reduce Parks Canada's ability to preserve the ecological 
integrity of national parks. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Canadian Heritage wants to create a new 
structure because Parks Canada proposes a new structure, the 
marine conservation areas, which will duplicate the Fisheries 
and Oceans Canada marine protection areas and the Environment 
Canada protected marine areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can claim some knowledge in this area, even a considerable 
amount of knowledge about parks.  I studied that field at the 
Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières.  Parks were part of the 
curriculum and we had access to data. 
I have retained my interest in this area and have continued to 
meet with experts in the field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People may wonder what the differences are between “marine 
conservation areas”, “Fisheries and Oceans marine protection 
areas”, and “protected marine areas”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Judging by what we heard from public servants, the Fisheries and 
Oceans people were getting their terminology all mixed up. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1250"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that there finally was some kind of consensus with regard to 
fisheries management plans, these people are not too happy about 
this new structure that could create duplication within the 
federal government. We in the Bloc Quebecois have often said 
that the federal government should be careful not to duplicate 
structures that already exist in Quebec, that it should work in 
partnership with us instead, as in the case of the Saguenay 
park. In that case, it was done through special legislation that 
dealt specifically with that park. It is a good example that 
should be followed more often. It is a good example of 
governments working together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of that, there is infighting in federal government. The 
right hand does not know what the left hand is doing. Three 
departments are involved. I do not know if this bodes ill or 
well for the future of fish in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought the Department of Canadian Heritage was mainly 
responsible for culture and history. I understand there is such 
a thing as a natural heritage, but structures, like those at 
Fisheries and Oceans Canada, already exist within the federal 
government to deal with the protection of wildlife. It goes 
without saying that protecting the fisheries and all marine 
species means protecting the sea floor. We must protect the 
shores and the flora of the St. Lawrence River as well as those 
of Canada's oceans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, when committee members and public servants themselves 
voice concern, we too should be concerned. These days, with the 
300% increase in the surplus announced by the Minister of 
Finance, some bills just reappear, like Bill C-8, formerly known 
as Bill C-48. We have heard about it for many years and now, 
here it is again. It suddenly becomes important to invest money 
or to promise to invest money before the election. In the end, 
they are unable to clean things up within the federal government 
and between the various departments. What a waste. What a bad 
example the federal government is giving the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government cannot respect jurisdictions and creates 
duplication, confusion or dissatisfaction, it is going against 
the principles of good business management. 
What would big business do? Some businesses merge and amalgamate 
to prevent duplication and unnecessary spending. Some experts 
even say they go too fast in some cases. The federal government 
is establishing three structures that will in essence deal with 
the same thing, plant and animal life. Now it is trying to add a 
heritage dimension on top of all that. I hope that it does not 
want to turn the fish into objects to be put in a bowl once they 
are dead. I hope this is not what they want to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the people well, but I do not want to make jokes about a 
serious matter. Environmental and wildlife protection is a very 
serious matter. 
My colleague from Jonquière keeps bringing up this issue in 
caucus meetings. Each time she rises to speak—we sometimes find 
it annoying, but we must give her credit for her strong 
commitment—she tries to drive the point across that this issue 
must be given priority. I agree with her. Members will 
understand that, as a former director of parks and recreation, I 
am very much interested in that issue.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since my time is almost up, I will conclude by saying that 
before investing in new structures, setting up new programs, 
doing new things and spending new moneys, the federal government 
should streamline and clean up its own act. It should develop 
better conservation plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should do what the auditor general said it should do in 1996. 
Four years have passed already, and it has not acted on it yet. 
People in the environment community, public servants, volunteer 
organizations, such as Ducks Unlimited Canada, and every 
environmental group in Canada, all those people are concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are more concerned about Quebec, but we think the government 
should work in closer co-operation with provincial governments, 
particularly that of Quebec. That government too has 
jurisdiction over that area, as well as programs and structures.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise today in this House to speak to Bill C-8. 
At the start of my remarks I would like to pay tribute to the 
hard work done by the member for Jonquière to protect the 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-8 concerns the creation of a network of national marine 
conservation areas, the marine equivalent of national parks. 
This network would be representative of 29 marine regions in 
Canada, covering the waters of the Great Lakes, inland waters 
including swamps, the territorial sea and the 200 mile exclusive 
economic zone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this bill, the government will set the boundaries of the 
marine conservation areas in all the regions in Canada, in 
consultation with the people of the area.  This phrase is very 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-8 gives the governor in council, on the recommendation of 
the Ministers of Fisheries and Oceans and Canadian Heritage, the 
right to limit or prohibit activities in commercial zones in 
order to protect marine resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also gives the governor in council, on the recommendation of 
the Ministers of Transport and Canadian Heritage, the right to 
limit or prohibit transportation in marine conservation areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that 1998 was set aside as the year of 
the oceans by the UN. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most important activities held to draw attention to this 
event include the world's fair in Lisbon, Portugal, and the 
adoption of the ocean charter by UNESCO in September 1997 in 
St. John's, Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government claims it is important to preserve the natural 
marine ecosystems and their balance to maintain biologic 
diversity. It says there is a need to establish a representative 
network of marine conservation areas, whose scope and features 
will ensure the maintenance of healthy marine ecosystems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois supports environmental protection measures. 
We have always given our support.  It gave its support when the 
government introduced legislation to establish the 
Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, in my riding of Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel, the 
Argenteuil Parti Quebecois and the PQ subcommittee on the 
environment for the Laurentian region submitted briefs to the 
BAPE. People wanted to show their support for the protection of 
the environment, particularly ecosystems in the groundwater, 
marine conservation areas, forests and other areas.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1986, the federal government launched the marine conservation 
area program. In 1988, the National Parks Act was amended to 
take into account the establishment of temporary protected 
marine areas. Since then, the following areas were created: 
Fathom Five National Marine Park in the Georgian Bay, the Gwaii 
Haanas marine conservation reserve in British Columbia, and, of 
course, the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The park is over 1,100 square kilometres and has a unique 
tourist component, the importance of which we are just beginning 
to grasp. This marine park was 14 years in the making. Its 
management is shared by the provincial governments and, yes, the 
federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The project began in 1985. It took quite a long time to create 
the park because of the public consultations, environmental 
studies and negotiations that were required. That precedent 
should have served as a model for the federal government in 
establishing other marine conservation areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be pointed out that co-operative mechanisms already 
exist to protect ecosystems in the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine 
park, and in the St. Lawrence River, under the agreement entitled 
“St. Lawrence action plan, phase III”, which was signed by all 
federal and provincial departments concerned and which provides 
for an investment of $250 million over five years in various 
activities relating to the St. Lawrence River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the Bloc Quebecois is opposed to this bill, first 
because it is not clear whether Quebec's territorial integrity 
will be respected. 
Second, the Bloc Quebecois is opposed to this bill because 
Heritage Canada is proposing the establishment of a new 
structure, that is the marine conservation areas, which will 
simply duplicate Fisheries and Oceans' marine protected areas 
and Environment Canada's marine wildlife reserves. There are 
many people doing the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec's jurisdiction is recognized under the British North 
America Act of 1867. So, there is overlap within the federal 
government. With the bill, the government wants to establish 
marine conservation areas under the responsibility of Heritage 
Canada, marine protection areas under the responsibility of 
Fisheries and Oceans and marine wildlife areas under the 
responsibility of Environment Canada. As I said before, three 
cooks might spoil the broth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same site could have more than one designation. It could be 
designated as a marine conservation area by Heritage Canada and 
as a marine protection area by Fisheries and Oceans. In both 
cases, it is said that the local population will have a major 
role to play in the establishment of marine protection areas. 
The Bloc is concerned about problems related to the bureaucracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same area, according to Fisheries and Oceans, could fall 
under different categories and be subject to different 
regulations. We know that when more than one department is 
involved in a project, there are difficulties and additional 
costs to the taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the government would have been better to make sure that 
ecosystems are managed by one department only. The departments 
involved should sign a framework agreement to delegate all of 
their responsibilities over ecosystems to the same department 
while respecting constitutional jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to mention the fact that the preliminary 
consultations were a failure. Furthermore, during hearings by 
the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage, almost all groups 
from coastal areas heard condemned the bill on the grounds that 
the system proposed by Heritage Canada would duplicate part of 
the work done by Fisheries and Oceans and create confusion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 11, 1999, Patrick McGuinness, vice-president of the 
Fisheries Council of Canada, told the Standing Committee on 
Canadian Heritage that it was simply inefficient, cumbersome 
public administration. I remember because I was there. In his 
view, bringing forward this marine conservation area initiative 
in its own act under the responsibility of a separate minister 
and a separate department was unacceptable. His conclusion was 
that the bill should be withdrawn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jean-Claude Grégoire, a member of the board of directors of the 
Alliance des pêcheurs professionnels du Québec, which represents 
almost 80% of all professional fishers in Quebec, also told the 
Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage that there were numerous 
problems. In his testimony, he mentioned that because such an 
area is scientifically inaccessible, you tend to work a lot more 
with unconfirmed data or assumptions of what exists than with 
actual scientific knowledge of what you are dealing with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lastly, I want to point out that the Bloc Quebecois believes 
that the consultation conducted by the Department of Fisheries 
and Oceans in Quebec with respect to the introduction of marine 
conservation areas was also a failure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the Bloc Quebecois knows that the Government of 
Quebec is also engaged in initiatives to protect the environment 
and submerged lands and water in particular. 
Bill C-8 does not respect Quebec's territorial integrity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the Bloc Quebecois is in favour of measures to 
protect the environment, but opposed to Bill C-8 for all the 
reasons I have mentioned. 
<P><A NAME="LINK105"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak to Bill C-8 at report stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sorry that this government has introduced such a bill.  In 
my opinion, it is a bill that should never have seen the light 
of day.  Why?  Because the Government of Canada and the 
Government of Quebec had finally managed to innovate with the 
Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park.  This park is located in my 
riding.  It is a very beautiful park.  I urge all Canadians to 
come and visit it.  It was through the framework agreement on 
the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park that the two levels of 
government set a precedent.  Where did this precedent come from? 
From the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For years, people in my riding worked together to really make 
something of this enchanting site. 
Everyone got together and said that they must do something. 
They called on the provincial and federal governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of the community's efforts, the two levels of 
government sat down and said “Why not do something really 
special?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was the model that the federal government should have used, 
if it wanted to create 28 new marine conservation areas. It 
could have said “We have a model, so we are going ahead”. But 
no. What did it do?  It decided to reinvent the wheel and 
introduce a new bill, even though we already had a good one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that one of my colleagues was right when he said that, 
in this government, the right hand does not know what the left 
one is doing.  I think that this government is deaf and blind, 
but not silent.  It is always reinventing the wheel.  It never 
learns.  I do not know why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that there are some very serious problems in 
Canada today requiring a major investment of funds.  There is 
poverty, and all the issues to do with young people. But the 
government wants to put millions into creating parks.  That is 
not what is needed right now.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this government is out of touch with reality. I think it 
is suffering from self-importance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my part of the country, when we say someone is self-important, 
it means that person no longer believes that he or she can trust 
other people and listen to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that, with this bill, the federal government is showing 
that it is self-important. Right now, the federal government has 
some cleaning up to do in its own backyard. This bill will allow 
the heritage minister to interfere in other departments, 
including Fisheries and Oceans Canada. 
I know that Environment Canada's staff as well as its budget 
have been cut for a number of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not take the money the government is willing to spend with 
this bill and use it to meet crucial environmental needs? We 
hear constantly that the environment has always been a low 
priority for this government. However, we know that during the 
next election campaign the Liberals will claim that the 
environment will be their second priority, after health, as the 
prime minister has already told us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians will not buy that because by bringing forward such 
bills the government is showing us that it could not care less 
about the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us just take Bill C-33 as an example. I examined the 
documents that were given to me by the Bloc Quebecois heritage 
critic. Bill C-33 is aimed at protecting species at risk. Fisheries and 
Oceans Canada already has legislative authority to act in order 
to protect species at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With Bill C-33, the government is trying to interfere in other 
federal departments and in the provinces' ministries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lack of harmony orchestrated by this government is obvious. 
When faced with such lack of harmony, one has to stop and say 
“Let us sit back and see where to invest the money that is 
needed”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a joke. The environment is an ever increasing concern in 
the heart, mind and daily life of people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As parliamentarians, for the sake our future, our children's and 
grandchildren's, we do not have the right to let the environment 
be put on the back burner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This must be a concern to us. The concern right now is to find 
money to invest to deal with our listeners' main concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It makes no sense to blow up balloons and say “Look how nice my 
balloon is”. At home we call this cellophane. I do not know if 
it is how you call it. Cellophane wrinkles easily and then it is 
ruined; however when you stretch it, it becomes smooth, and then 
there is nothing left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we must act in a responsible manner. Being responsible 
is part of what is expected of us as parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is not acting responsibly with Bill C-8. The 
parliamentary committee spent many hours studying a bill that 
should never have been introduced to begin with. We have the 
striking and magical example of the agreement on the Saguenay—St. 
Lawrence marine park. Again, we have to start with things we 
already have instead of reinventing the wheel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill deals with environment and the protection of marine 
areas. We must give Canadians and Quebecers areas of which they 
will be proud. They will then be able to say “We wanted to have 
those areas and the governments have met our expectations”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe that the consultations on this bill have 
allowed people to voice their concerns properly.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for this government to consult Ducks Unlimited 
and several other environmental groups and say to them “We will 
listen to you: what do you expect us to do for your 
environment?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they do not understand, they should come to my part of the 
country. We will show them what we have accomplished and what it 
is important to do in order to develop areas that future 
generations will be proud to have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois will vote against this bill. The environment 
must be a concern for us, but we should not spend money where it 
is not necessary.

<P><A NAME="LINK106"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have spoken to this bill before 
when it was called Bill C-48, in 1998-99.  I have attended some 
of the committee meetings where the bill was discussed.  I have 
ensured that we had some witnesses from the west coast because 
essentially their voices were not being heard and had not been 
heard in the so-called consultation process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought that somehow I could help to have their voices heard 
in the committee process, but I still have a thing or two to 
learn about the process.  Even though I had witnesses from the 
west coast at committee, they certainly were not treated with the 
deference that I thought witnesses should be treated with.  Their 
input basically was rejected as being inadequate for the process 
the government had set up, which is a ridiculous posture and a 
ridiculous point of view to take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That point of view was promoted by the chair of the committee. I 
took issue with the chair of the committee with regard to how the 
witnesses were being treated.  Rather than achieving what I 
thought was neutrality from the chair, I ended up being lectured 
as well.  I have not had happy experiences with the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last time I talked about the bill I complained about the 
fact that 29 regions in the country were going to get these 
trophy marine conservation areas under the Minister of Heritage, 
previously the environment minister.  This is an environmental 
bill, not a heritage bill.  We did not know where these 29 areas 
were. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we respond to the government?  How can industry groups 
and other groups respond to a piece of legislation without 
knowing the specifics? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I challenged the government to do that, the parliamentary 
secretary suggested that I was somehow being very controversial 
and asked if I could name a single area where I would object to a 
marine conservation area.  My response at that time was that if 
the parliamentary secretary could tell me which industry would be 
targeted by the Americans as a result of the government's then 
split run legislation which was so ill considered, I would be 
able to return in kind and that would be a good barter.  Of 
course neither myself or the parliamentary secretary were 
prepared to take that any further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point we have received a lot of information from the 
coastal perspective.  A marine conservation bill obviously has to 
consider the coastal stakeholders.  We have heard from some 
stakeholders from Nunavut, from the Atlantic provinces and from 
the Pacific coast.  Overwhelmingly they talk about the negative 
consequences of this proposed legislation.

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can talk about mining, for example.  We cannot create areas that 
restrict activity except by special permit when we have not even 
done an inventory to see what is there.  As one of the proponents 
for undersea harvesting said, if we had had this kind of 
legislation a long time ago Columbus would have never sailed to 
America, because it is so exclusionary in terms of what activities 
are allowed and what activities are not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the potential mineral resources and other 
resources on the seabed, it is not right to restrict activity. 
One of the proposals has taken some shape since the last debate 
in the House of Commons.  We are talking about 9,000 square 
kilometres of lake bed in this case, I think, in the Great Lakes. 
Without an inventory we do not even know what we are locking up. 
Locking it up pre-empts an inventory in a sense, because why 
would anyone bother?  This has been pointed out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to very quickly make reference to some of the witnesses 
we heard from in committee.  Mr. Ainsworth from the west coast is 
the one I was referring to in my Columbus point.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Columbus would never have left port if constrained by this 
principle.  We would never embark on an airplane to soar en route 
to Ottawa with ozone-eating exhaust gases, injected right into 
the base of the stratosphere, if we really believed in the 
precautionary principle. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The precautionary principle is behind the way the legislation 
has been brought forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard from the mayor of Prince Rupert at the time, who said 
that west coast residents were not aware of any areas that 
required conservation on the north coast.  He said that there was 
only consideration of an extension of South Moresby Park on the 
Queen Charlotte Islands, and that without adequate consultation 
the federal government has made north coast residents very 
suspicious.  The park the mayor mentioned was created without the 
need for proposed legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard from Pat Green, who is with the regional district in 
that area.  Despite very good intelligence in terms of what the 
government was thinking of proposing in the way of marine 
conservation areas there, despite the fact that Mr. Green tried 
to give some shape to that in the discussions, despite the fact 
that the very bureaucrats responsible for administering this were 
available to the committee, there was a complete denial that 
there was any shape or form or contemplation of a marine 
conservation area for that part of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That marine conservation area, if it proceeds in the way this 
legislation conceives of it, would pre-empt what has been a 
traditional fishery, the gillnetters and some of the other 
fishing activities in that area, without special permit.  It 
would pre-empt what is looking to be more and more like a project 
that British Columbians will decide is a viable and worthwhile 
project, that is, north coast oil and gas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is very large area of concern.  The concerns that have been 
expressed by industry, by local politicians and by the 
stakeholders really have not been brought into this whole 
discussion.  They need to be. 
Here is a statement from the testimony at committee, which 
illustrates what I am talking about.  This is from somebody with 
the International Council on Metals and the Environment: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To my knowledge, in western Canada in the industry, I'm the only 
person I've found who knows Bill C-48 [the predecessor to Bill 
C-8] in any way, shape or form.  It's interesting to note as well 
that I don't see anybody from the Maritimes here on the witness 
stand.  I don't know if that reflects the selection of witnesses 
at all, but I know there is concern in the Maritimes for the use 
of mineral potential in the offshore environment.

</I></B></P><P align=left>She said:  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to get up and carry on with 
the debate on the motions in Group No. 3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier about Group No. 2, and I think some of these 
clauses refer to that as well, Canadian Heritage does seem a bit 
puzzling.  I listened carefully to the committee chair's speech 
earlier about the fact that this is about preservation and making 
sure, for present and future generations, that this should fall 
under Canadian Parks.  Of course we want to make sure future 
generations get to enjoy these marine conservation areas, but 
again, I do not think the government has come to grips with the 
very basics of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier when I finished up my remarks, if we are 
going to look at mineral resource extraction from these areas, 
the government says now, i.e. in the future, it would make sure 
it put the boundaries of these marine conservation areas in place 
so that it did not disrupt any mineral or resource extraction. 
Yet if we talk about future generations, what is going to happen 
if in seven months, ten years or fifty-three years we come up 
with some amazing technological device that is able to find, 
harvest and extract some of these resources or minerals?  What do 
we do then? 
I believe the bill says it would be in perpetuity, that they 
would say “Sorry, we have a marine conservation area here and we 
cannot do a thing about it.  It is there forever”.

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to see the member is looking through her notes.  I 
hope she will be able to straighten that out and let us know that 
if in future years another Hibernia, for instance, were to come 
along there would be room in the bill for it.  We are all very 
familiar with that.  I think that would be a major thrill for 
everybody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me refer specifically under Group No. 3 to Motion No. 18, 
which specifies that a marine conservation area management plan 
would have to take into account not only ecosystem protection but 
also academic research, recreational use, geological surveys, 
natural resources exploitation and visitor use.  Each one of 
those would include a huge area of concern, consultation and 
advisory committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is one thing to talk about advisory committees, but it does 
seem strange sometimes that a government may be only keen to take 
one side of advice.  I mentioned earlier a couple of committees 
that were struck today, right in this place. The government gave 
its word that it would just be electing chairs, nothing more. 
Then all of a sudden, once the Liberals got to the committees 
they sat down, and I am sure were having coffee and a pleasant 
visit, and the next thing we knew they wanted to deal with a 
couple of bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does seem strange.  When someone gives their word and their 
commitment, I would like to be able to take it as such.  Surely 
it is not a good thing when people go back on their word.  We 
would want to make sure when the government says advisory 
committees would be put in place and consultations would take 
place that we would get both sides of the equation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend from northern Vancouver Island just made comments 
about some folks who came down from British Columbia as 
witnesses. Dear knows, that is a large part of the country. If we 
are talking about marine conservation, there is plenty of water 
out in B.C.  They should be given the opportunity to give their 
advice, to participate in those consultations. But what happens? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not fit with the government's little agenda.  It thanks 
them for coming in one of those big jets that gives lots of 
pollution.  It is talking about the environment now.  It thanks 
for them coming anyway and says that they can be shipped home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing the bill fails to do is strike a balance between 
environmental protection and other interests.  Of course we need 
to weigh the pros and cons.  If this is basically falling under 
national parks, surely we can look at the national parks.  My 
home province of Alberta I think has about 60% of the land mass 
of the national parks in the country.  Somewhere, somehow, we 
need to strike a balance between environmental preservation and 
human enjoyment of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the Minister of Canadian Heritage, under whose purview 
the bill falls, has made a trip to Banff, has made a trip to 
Jasper, and certainly has looked at the balance between 
environment and other interests.  I know she has certainly some 
concerns about it, as everyone does. Although she will talk about 
scheduling delays or defaults or something or other, our minister 
for tourism, the Hon. Jon Havelock, has been waiting and wanting 
to meet with the hon. minister for some time now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure if I can use the word stonewalling, but I think 
that certainly would be the sentiment he has in his desire to 
meet with the Minister of Canadian Heritage.  Even though we are 
landlocked in Alberta, if this whole marine conservation area 
goes ahead certainly Alberta would express some of those very 
same concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When talking about consultation, surely from the provincial 
level to the federal level, we should have consultations between 
ministers.  It seems to me fairly simple.  I mentioned earlier 
the struggle between federal and provincial negotiations and 
whose power supersedes whose.  The member across tried to make us 
feel better or allay the fears or concerns by saying everything 
would be up to negotiation and everyone would just sit down and 
have coffee and a happy time and come up with an agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see members from B.C. across the way.  I am dying to know if 
the member over there has felt very comfortable in the fact that 
her provincial government has worked with the federal government 
and everything is going along just tickety-boo.  I will bet 10 
bucks she would not, as a matter of fact.  When these 
negotiations are being talked about, surely my minister, the Hon. 
Jon Havelock, is not the only one being shunned when we are 
talking about federal-provincial consultations and negotiations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is great to throw around that we are to consult and have 
advisory committees, but it is a very dangerous thing just to say 
“I will consult with the people who agree with me, and I do not 
really like listening to those other guys on the other side”. 
Surely we need to make sure that does not go on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Talking about the very tenuous balance between environment and 
sustainable development, there are people who go to Jasper and 
just love to spend a night or two in Jasper Park Lodge.  I gave 
up tenting many years ago, having grown up on the west coast and 
having spent far too much time in a wet tent when I was young.  I 
am sure there are others besides me who love to go to Jasper and 
do some skiing or whatever, and who want to stay in a hotel. That 
may be terribly capitalistic, but at the same time they want to 
make sure they have a chance to wander around Jasper Park Lodge 
or some of the fine hotels in that area, or Lake Louise or Banff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also bet 10 bucks that a lot of members of the 
government have had a wonderful visit to one of the national 
parks, Banff or Jasper.  I would also bet they stayed in one of 
those capitalistic, entrepreneurial places such as a hotel and 
ate in restaurants.  I will bet they did not set up their Coleman 
stoves and just rough it, although it is a wonderful thing to do; 
it is great. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people need to realize there is a balance between 
environmental concerns and making sure that when they want to 
make use of those places or buy souvenirs for their children some 
of those places are in those parks, with a balance, of course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about present and future generations we want to 
make sure we balance these environmental concerns.  That is 
absolutely essential.  However, they must be balanced with the 
interests of those individuals affected by the creation of 
particular marine conservation areas.  People live in the area. 
People fly their float planes over this area, as we talked about 
earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the people who were giving me briefings what would 
happen with jet boats, for instance.  They said “We are not 
going to prohibit boats, but if in future times we decide jet 
boats are too noisy, or heaven forbid, Sea-Doos, we may be able 
to have the minister with the power to do so”.  Sure, she could 
work in conjunction with the Minister of Transport, the Minister 
of the Environment, and the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.  It 
all comes out of the same cat.  If on the government side they 
decide they do not like Sea-Doos and they do not like big, noisy 
jet boats, they can just put a prohibition on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are used to that lifestyle, and many of those who live in 
these proposed marine conservation areas are very responsible.  I 
do not think people want to live there or holiday there just to 
take advantage of those areas.  Many of those people are as 
environmentally concerned as any government member.  We need to 
make sure the individuals who are affected by it would be able to 
have an amazing amount of input. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is where I closed my remarks the last time I was speaking. 
There is a lack of adequate consultation with resources groups, 
aviation groups and other stakeholders.  We should be able to 
tell them we will listen to their concerns.  What about those who 
make their living by flying float planes up and down the B.C. 
coast, for instance, or the Atlantic coast? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister may all of a sudden say to them “We are going to 
consult with you.  In other words, we will sort of listen for 
five minutes, but we already have the order in council or the 
regulations drawn up, and you too will be out of business”. 
Surely that is not a good balance in making sure we can live 
harmoniously in some of these areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to the members' concerns about this and certainly 
possible solutions to the very real concerns.  These are not just 
my concerns.  As I say, I live in landlocked Alberta, and I am 
not sure we are looking at too many marine conservation areas. 
However, people from the west coast, the east coast and the Great 
Lakes will need these very real concerns addressed, and 
unfortunately I have yet to hear any of them being addressed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
happy to speak once again this afternoon to Bill C-8, an act 
respecting marine conservation areas, at report stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the motions in Group No. 3, the Bloc is proposing that clause 
9 dealing with management plans be deleted. Through this clause, 
the government will draw up a management plan five years after 
the establishment of the marine conservation area. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1345"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This does not make any sense. There will be no management plan 
beforehand, only afterwards. The government should go back to 
the agreement it signed with the Government of Quebec and all 
the stakeholders to establish the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine 
park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park was established jointly by 
the Quebec and federal governments in 1997, when they passed 
mirror legislation. I wonder if members opposite know what that 
is. Mirror legislation is passed with the support of everyone 
concerned, following extensive consultation of all the various 
stakeholders. 
These people said “This is what we want”. They wanted a plan and 
the governments told them that they would pass mirror 
legislation. Under this legislation, the Quebec and federal 
governments agreed there would not be no transfer of land. The 
two governments will continue to exercise their respective 
jurisdictions. I hope our colleagues opposite now understand 
what it means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the park is located entirely in a marine setting. We 
should not forget that. It covers 1,138 square kilometres. We 
can just imagine how huge that is. Its boundaries may be changed 
by mutual consent and following public consultation by both 
levels of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members can see, public consultation is always carried out 
because there is a management plan. 
To facilitate community involvement, Quebec and Ottawa agreed to 
create a co-ordinating committee, whose membership is determined 
by the federal minister and the provincial minister. That is 
what a management plan is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee's mandate is to make recommendations to the 
minister responsible with regard to measures which should be 
taken to meet the objectives set out in the management plan. The 
plan will be reviewed jointly by both governments at least every 
seven years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see that before the marine park was established through 
mirror legislation, there was a management plan. Under clause 9 
of Bill C-8, a management plan would be prepared five years after 
the establishment of a marine conservation area. I think this is 
absolutely ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was saying earlier, this bill should have never been 
introduced. 
We in the Bloc Quebecois also think that clause 28, which 
deals with proceedings by way of summary conviction, should be 
deleted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There should have been a management plan with specific 
benchmarks right from the start, to avoid doing everything all 
over again.  I do not know what language we have to use to talk 
to the government and tell it that enough is enough, that we 
already have mirror legislation containing a management plan. We 
have legislation on marine areas that was drafted in co-operation 
with all federal and provincial stakeholders. We already have 
that. So why is the government setting up another structure 
which will only create further confusion? 
It will be like the tower of Babel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps hon. members do not know about the tower of Babel. 
People started to talk different languages and could no longer 
understand each other. One minute they were all talking the 
same language and the next they were all talking at the same 
time in different languages and no longer understood each other. 
A self-styled responsible government should not be setting up 
such a monstrous structure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the environment is an important issue and so are the 
marine conservation areas. Before the government puts the 
bill to a vote, let it come to my riding. We will explain how to 
go about this. If it does not remember how we went about 
establishing a conservation area in 1997, which is not exactly 
the distant past, we will sit down with the government and we 
will explain it all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is a waste of members' time and a waste of money. 
Members have more important issues to discuss. We will 
support the Bloc Quebecois amendments in Group No. 5 and we will 
ask that this bill be withdrawn.

Canadians that the high standards of environmental protection are 
being met is not true.  There is continued devolution and

can sign a piece of paper and have a photo opportunity for the

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marcel Lambert may not be well known in the House now.  He was a 
soldier.  He was an economist, a lawyer and a Rhodes 
scholar.  He was a man whose talent and discipline would 
have led him to excel in any field he chose.  He chose public 
life because he had a sense of commitment to the community around 
him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marcel Lambert was born and educated in Edmonton and later was 
educated in London as a Rhodes scholar.  He was an effective 
member of the House of Commons for some 27 years, a Speaker of 
the House and a minister of the crown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Lambert served in the second world war as a lieutenant in 
the tank division of the King's Own Calgary Regiment.  He was 
part of the Dieppe raid and was feared lost and reported dead in 
that historic event.  In fact he had been captured.  He was held 
as a prisoner of war for three long years. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marcel was elected the member for Edmonton West in 1957.  He 
served Canada in the House for 27 years and is seen as one of 
the MPs who worked the hardest on behalf of their constituents. 
People lined up outside his riding office to speak to him. 
Appointed Speaker of the House in 1962, he acquired a reputation 
as a tough arbiter when debate was heated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his memoirs, Lester B. Pearson spoke of the fine job Marcel 
Lambert did as Speaker of the House.  His detention as a 
prisoner of war and his experience in combat were instrumental 
in his appointment as Minister of Veterans Affairs in 1963. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During my years in the House as leader of the official 
opposition, Mr. Lambert undertook the thankless job of leading my 
party's scrutiny of the spending estimates each year.  He held 
the government accountable for spending.  I have to say he did 
that job with relish.  Scrutiny of the estimates was much more 
intense in those days. Marcel Lambert also served the House as 
chair of the committee on miscellaneous spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If any of us sought a model as to the attributes that should 
come to the Chamber and the spirit in which Canada should be 
served here, we could do no better than to look to the example 
and experience of the late Marcel Lambert.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Glengarry—Prescott—Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians were saddened to learn this past Sunday of the death 
of a former Speaker of this House, the Hon. Marcel Lambert, a 
proud Franco-Albertan and a distinguished scholar, soldier, 
lawyer and parliamentarian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of the Canadian forces in World War II, he served at 
Dieppe and even spent close to three years as a prisoner of war. 
After the war, he continued his studies toward a degree in 
commerce from the University of Alberta.  He was awarded a 
Rhodes scholarship to Oxford University, where he earned three 
degrees in law.  He then practised law in Edmonton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was elected to the House of Commons in 1957 to represent 
Edmonton West, now in part represented by the hon. Minister of 
Justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to serve in 10 Canadian parliaments.  He was a 
parliamentary secretary.  In 1962 he was elected, unanimously—as 
if I need to point that out—Speaker of the House of Commons.  He 
also served as Minister of Veterans Affairs.  Marcel Lambert was 
the opposition critic for parliamentary procedures and finance 
and was known as one of the hardest working and best prepared 
members of the House of Commons.  He later went on to sit on the 
Canadian Transport Commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although my time as an MP started after the hon. 
Mr. Lambert had left this parliament, I have clear memories of 
him from our time together on the International Assembly of 
French-Speaking Parliamentarians.  I am proud to be able to say 
that I had the opportunity to work with him.

his grandchildren and his great-grandchildren, who have every

made to his country in war and in peace.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Canadian

acknowledge in the short time that we have the accomplishments 
of Marcel Lambert.  The passing of this veteran of Dieppe, 
prisoner of war, Rhodes scholar, member of parliament, cabinet 
minister and Speaker of the House, saddens us all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time I first arrived in the Chamber in 1972, Marcel 
Lambert had been in the House for 15 years, to which he added 
another 12 years before leaving in 1984.  This record of 27 years 
speaks highly of this gentleman's sense of public duty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, as you know, Marcel occupied your chair for a brief 
but impressive period from 1962 to 1963.  He earned a reputation 
as a tough arbiter in a rowdy Commons in those heady times. 
Following that, he was appointed minister of veterans affairs and 
served that portfolio with distinction and honour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marcel left the Chamber and the country with many things.  In 
the vicissitudes of political life, Marcel had one thing 
constant: respect and service to his constituents.

rise today to speak on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois in tribute 
to Marcel Lambert who passed away Sunday at the age of 81. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Lambert, who sat in this House and was its Speaker, was born 
in Edmonton in 1919.  He was a student at the outbreak of the 
second world war.  He joined the King's Own Calgary Regiment. 
He was taken prisoner of war in 1942 during the Dieppe raid.  At 
the end of the war, he returned to the University of Alberta and 
went on to study law at Oxford.  He returned to Edmonton and 
opened a law firm there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1957 he was elected for the first time to the House of 
Commons under the banner of the Progressive Conservative Party 
in the riding of Edmonton, which he represented until 1984. 
He served as parliamentary secretary to the minister of defence 
in 1957-58.  Re-elected in 1958, he served as the parliamentary 
secretary to the minister of national revenue until 1962. 
Following the 1962 election, he was appointed Speaker of the 
House and remained so until February 1963. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The general election brought the defeat of the Conservative 
government but not of Marcel Lambert who was re-elected.  In 
opposition, he served as defence and finance critic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Conservatives returned to office in 1979, he chaired a 
committee and was re-elected in 1980.  In 1985, when he retired 
from active political life, he was appointed the chair of the 
Canadian Transport Commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois and myself, I 
would like to offer my sincerest condolences to his family and 
friends.

like the right hon. member for Kings—Hants and the hon. member 
for West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, I too had the honour of 
serving in the House with the honourable Marcel Lambert in the 
latter five years of his parliamentary career.  I consider myself 
fortunate to have been in that position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to join with others who have already spoken and who have 
portrayed very well the details of Mr. Lambert's career as a 
parliamentarian, his service as a soldier, his sensitivity to his 
constituents and his care for others as reflected in the way in 
which his constituents repeatedly re-elected him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think particularly of his service as a soldier and his capture 
at Dieppe.  If his family might permit me, we see him as a symbol 
of a generation of young men who were in military service at the 
beginning of the war and who therefore suffered in ways that not 
everyone did by being in places like Hong Kong and, in this 
particular case, Dieppe, and who therefore had the misfortune and 
the tragedy of becoming prisoners of war.

salute to Marcel Lambert, I also want to salute that entire 
generation of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to salute his work as a Speaker and the fact that in 
the House of Commons one of the special ways in which a member of 
parliament can be honoured is to be selected as Speaker, or in 
those days, appointed as Speaker, but clearly governments 
appointed people whom they thought would have the respect of the 
House of Commons and the confidence of both sides of the House. 
Mr. Lambert fell into that category. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these things we give thanks.  We honour his life and 
work.  We honour his memory and we express our condolences to his 
family.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I reserve a 
few words for myself, and I address myself to you, Chris, who are 
representing the members of your family here in the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I knew Marcel Lambert of course, like some of the other members, 
because we served together in the House.  You will recall when 
you came to see your father that he sat in these seats over here. 
Forever the vigilant parliamentarian, yes, and forever the critic 
because that was his role at the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke with him immediately after I became Speaker in 1995.  He 
was in Ottawa and he did me the honour of coming to my chambers 
where we shared lunch together.  I asked him at that time that if he 
had advice to give to a novice speaker what would it 
be.  He told me that these were the important things of being a 
Speaker.  He said “You must respect the parliamentarians.  They 
have work to do here and you must give them as much leeway as you 
can.  You must respect the rules of parliament under which you 
operate so that you can make decisions in a fair-handed manner. 
But most of all”, he said, “you must love this place.  You must 
love parliament, this House of Commons”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is good advice that he gave to me that all Speakers 
who sit in this chair would do well to remember whenever they do 
take this awesome task of trying to bring the House to a decision 
of some kind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Your father, sir, was an intellectual, a Rhodes scholar.  He was 
a soldier and, in my view, a hero.  That has been mentioned.  He was 
a parliamentarian who served in our midst for more than a 
quarter of a century.  We who knew him held him in very great 
respect.   Canada has lost one of her sons.  In that way the 
nation is diminished by his departure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Please accept my own personal sincere condolences and the 
condolences of all members of parliament.  Some of us had 
the great honour to serve with your dad.  Thanks for coming.

concern that we have with October 16, as we have heard that date, 
is that the 17th is a very exciting day.  It is the day that the 
auditor general intends to release the report on the scandal 
plagued HRDC.  We would like some assurance that there would not 
be a mini-budget and then an election call before we had the 
great opportunity to view that particular report.

of Canada.  Can the Deputy Prime Minister give us the assurance 
one way or another, either by advancing the release of the

mini-budget from the 16th to the 17th, that an election would not 
be called before the public had the great honour and pleasure of

my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the justifications that Liberals are giving for the 
possibility of an early election is that they have a surplus and 
they do not know what to do with it.  They need a mandate.  They 
want to have a national debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the Deputy Prime Minister, why do they need to have this 
debate when they have committed to and already have a mandate to 
bring in a national pharmacare program?  This mandate was 
recommitted to by the Minister of Health this spring when he 
promised a pharmacare program.  Why not bring in the pharmacare

on that and do that before any election call?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we already indicated the way we want to help Canadians 
in the health care area with our $21 billion health accord with 
the provinces signed by the way by the NDP premier of the 
member's province. We have put billions into the national child 
care program.

the accord was the last word on health care, unless he is 
prepared to repudiate all the other things the Liberals are 
committed to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incidentally, today is the day that bill 11 is proclaimed in 
Alberta yet we hear nothing from the other side.  One would think 
that the political flags would be flying at half-mast over this 
new era in the destruction of medicare.  However, that is not the 
case because it is this government that collaborated with the 
government that the Leader of the Opposition was part of to make 
sure that this kind of privatization could happen, both in terms 
of the 12 points and the obvious deal that was cut between the 
Prime Minister and the premier of Alberta in order to get Mr. 
Klein to sign on to the accord in the first place.

what is done or not done with respect to the actual use of the

Mr. Speaker, it is fairly obvious from the documents that have 
been brought into the House that the solicitor general has a 
complete lack of confidence in the reports to him from CSIS or 
from any of the other organizations, when the government permits 
ministers to go to events such as have been described in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He does not understand that when terrorists slip into Canada, it

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada,

previously indicated, CSIS does not recommend to government who 
should or should not go to dinners, official dinners, fundraising 
dinners, heritage dinners or whatever.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, these terrorists raise funds through welfare scams,

are all international security issues which put all Canadians at 
risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking legitimate questions in the House.  We are 
answered by blusters from the frontbench and caterwauling from

Mr. Speaker, as I have explained to the House, Canada has taken a

against fundraising for terrorism.  We chaired the committee that 
put the convention together.  We have tabled the convention at 
the United Nations and we were one of the signatories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next step is to develop legislation in consultation with the

Canada consider entrusting one or more academic centres with the

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage report on Bill C-224

</I></B></P><P align=left>People in the Adams mine area do not want this project and that

dragging its heels and refusing to acknowledge the global trend

Mr. Speaker, the final phases of the Cartagena protocol were 
negotiated in Montreal in January, and I took part.  Canada 
played a very important role.  I thank my colleague, the Minister 
of Foreign Affairs, for the great work he did in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out that the standard practice of the Canadian 
government, when faced with the issue of signature and adhering 
to the protocol, is to consult with groups in Canada that may be 
affected and may have concerns.  We have virtually completed 
those consultations.  I fully expect a decision of the government 
will follow very shortly.

<P><A NAME="LINK259"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the government House leader said that at the House leaders 
meeting on Tuesday the issue of the October 17 reports did not 
come up, and that is true.  What is also true, of course, is that 
on Tuesday an election did not seem as imminent or probable as it 
does today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder whether it would be in the interest of the government 
itself and of its own reputation to dispel any perception that it 
might be contemplating an election because it does not want these 
reports to become public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the government why would it not agree, as all parties on 
this side of the House have suggested, to a procedure by which 
these reports could be made public.  Transparency could be 
preserved, accountability, freedom of information— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. government House leader. 
<P><A NAME="LINK260"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, House leaders seldom negotiate 
things like this during question period.  We have— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  You are the one that mentioned the 
House leaders meeting on the floor, not me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  No, I did not, Mr. Speaker.  I am 
sorry, it was someone across the way who expressed that House 
leaders had made such an agreement when such was not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If House leaders want to bring a suggestion to the next House 
leaders meeting, they are quite welcome to do so.  We usually 
have very constructive work in which we participate all together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate other House leaders for their usually 
constructive work.  I look forward to working with them again at 
the next House leaders meeting and at all subsequent House 
leaders meetings as well.

it, but I would encourage her to read the Employment Insurance 
Act wherein, as a result of the 1996 amendments, we made very 
effective and targeted changes.  The family supplement is there 
for low income families earning less than $26,000.  They do not 
receive the regular benefit of 55%.  As of this year, it is 80%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recommendations from that party would be to raise the 
percentages not even close to that 80%.  What would that do to 
poor families?

<P><A NAME="LINK268"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to ask the government House leader 
this very important question on the business of the House for the 
remainder of this week and for next week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, in light of the questioning during question period with 
regard to the auditor general's report, which we now know the 
minister of human resources has, would it be part of the 
government's agenda to release that prior to the imminent 
election call? 
<P><A NAME="LINK269"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me take those points in 
reverse order.  First, no one said there was an imminent election 
call.  That decision certainly has not been announced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the last point that was raised was the allegation that 
there is an auditor general's report to be tabled.  In fact that 
is not what the minister said.  The minister said that she, as 
with any government department, has been issued documentation 
from the auditor general on which to respond.  That is not an 
auditor general's report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To get back to the initial question that was asked, which was 
the weekly business statement, it is as follows.  This afternoon 
we will continue to debate the report stage of Bill C-8, the 
marine parks bill.  This will be followed by the second reading 
of Bill C-39 respecting Petro-Canada and Bill C-36 respecting the 
criminal code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Friday we will deal with second reading of Bill S-17 
respecting marine liability and, time permitting, we will then 
commence Bill C-43 which amends the Income Tax Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Monday we will debate the second reading of a new bill to 
amend the Employment Insurance Act.  If the House is so disposed, 
we would be prepared, as the Prime Minister said yesterday, to go 
through all stages of that bill in one day in order to give the 
benefit to Canadians as soon as possible.  We will see whether 
that is the wish of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will then follow on Monday, or later if we do not get to it 
on Monday, with Bill C-15 regarding the export of water.

issue.

his preambular remarks, the House leader of the government

the auditor general.  Just so the record is clear, she answered 
in the affirmative, “yes”.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>DISCLOSURE OF DOCUMENTS 
</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I will now deal with a point of privilege 
that was raised by the hon. member for Acadie—Bathurst 
yesterday.  At that time I asked the hon. member directly if he 
was alleging that the Minister of Human Resources Development 
leaked a bill or a paper.  I was referring to a bill.  He 
answered in the affirmative, “yes”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is here.  The allegation has been made.  I ask the 
hon. minister to address herself to that particular fact. 
<P><A NAME="LINK275"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have read the <I>Hansard</I> for the 
member for Acadie—Bathurst's point of privilege yesterday.  Let 
me first say that I take strong exception to his accusation that 
I have shown contempt for the House and its rules.  I respect the 
House and its practices immensely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me be very clear that I never authorized or instructed 
anyone to provide a copy of the bill to the media or to any other 
individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After making inquiries with my department, I have confirmed that 
no copies were distributed to journalists or to anyone else.  I 
can only conclude that no copies of the bill have been leaked 
and, therefore, any reporting in the media would be speculative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the member has been working very hard on this issue 
of employment insurance on behalf of many of his constituents and 
I know how seriously he takes this issue.  He is aware of the 
adjustments we introduced today and that they have been a topic 
of varied speculation and wide discussion in recent months, both 
in the media and elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I regret that he has drawn the conclusions that he has over 
media reports on this issue, but I can reassure him and this 
House that I would never condone any practice of leaking copies 
of bills prior to their introduction in this place. 
<P><A NAME="LINK276"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  We have an allegation that was made by 
the hon. member for Acadie—Bathurst.  We have a denial by the 
minister that she was involved and, evidently from an inquiry 
that she made, that no one on her staff was involved in this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This matter of leaking documents is one that continues to take 
our time in the House and, in some ways, to baffle us as to what 
we are going to do about it.  Because there were direct 
allegations with regard to the information that was released and 
that which is in the bill, I will take a couple of days to look 
at everything.  If it is necessary, I will come back to the 
House. 
What we have now is an allegation and a denial.  Until I have a 
look at it, the matter will stay there.

<P><A NAME="LINK279"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I seek your advice on this question I have for the 
government on something that I know you have addressed in the 
House before during question period, and that is a tactic by the 
government in that when the opposition parties, which have a 
limited time to keep the government accountable, do ask 
questions, often a technique is for government members to 
actually ask questions of the opposition.  I think if you check 
the record today, that happened on at least eight different 
occasions.  I am wondering what can be done in order to remedy 
this. 
<P><A NAME="LINK280"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I wish I had advice for hon. members.  I 
have found myself in the same situation in years gone by. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You as a House have agreed that you will have about 35 seconds 
for a question and about 35 seconds for a response.  We have had 
a pretty good run at it in the last three years.  We started with 
getting in 24 questions in a question period.  We have been 
averaging in excess of 35 for the last three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can deal with the quantity, that is to say the timing, but my 
dear colleague, you will forgive me for saying that I cannot deal 
with the quality of either the questions or the answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My role here is to see to it that a question is asked and that 
an answer, whatever we want to say about it, is given.  I do not 
make any judgment about the quality of the questions and I do not 
think you should ask me to make any judgment about the quality of 
the answers.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>BILL C-44 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK282"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have a point of order arising somewhat out of the 
circumstances surrounding Bill C-44, which we now have in hand. 
It concerns the practice of supplying the opposition with copies 
of the bill in a timely fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning the bill itself was tabled.  It was introduced at 
10.04 a.m. or 10.05 a.m.  Within five minutes the minister 
promptly left the House and went on television to discuss the 
bill.  Some members of the opposition who have the critic's 
responsibility for this department were not provided with copies 
of the bill until 10.40 a.m., 30 minutes later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know this may sound petty, Mr. Speaker, but it is petty on the 
part of the government not to ensure that the entire opposition, 
those critics, are given copies of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill itself was available on the media Internet site, which 
is where our critic, the member for Madawaska—Restigouche, went 
to get a copy when he was unable to obtain a copy from the 
government.  Other members, and I will not single anybody out, 
received hand delivered copies from the government House leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has to be parity.  There has to be an attempt to see to it 
that all members receive the same information at the same time so 
that they can discharge their duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the Chair to consider this in conjunction with the earlier 
complaints yesterday with respect to the government's seeming 
unwillingness to be forthcoming with this type of information. 
This place is not to be considered an afterthought.  This House 
of Parliament has to be treated equitably on both sides.  This is 
not to say that the government can give the information prior to 
the minister being prepared to do so, but we cannot be treated 
here like mongrel dogs, as an after supper thought.  This has to 
be done fairly and in a straightforward fashion so that all 
members can respond. 
<P><A NAME="LINK283"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I want to deal with this directly.  I do 
not agree with all of the words the member used, but I agree and 
I order that these copies be given to all members of parliament 
so that we have access to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know what happened such that some of the members on 
this side did not have this information but I will make 
inquiries, unless someone here can give an explanation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where these copies are distributed at a certain time for 
everyone, I believe that the copies should go to our members of 
parliament at the same time.  If they are distributed on this 
side at 11.15 or whatever it is, then they should be distributed, 
out of courtesy, to one another.  I will see to it that the 
minister is apprised that this was not done and if it is 
necessary she will come back to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with you that you should have the information to work 
with.

<P><A NAME="LINK293"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Serré (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Natural Resources, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise to address the 
House on second reading of Bill C-39, an act to amend the 
Eldorado Nuclear Limited Reorganization and Divestiture Act and 
the Petro-Canada Public Participation Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to be bringing this piece of legislation before the 
House at this time.  Canada's economy is booming, due in no small 
part to the strong performance of Canada's resource industries. 
Today the energy, mining, forestry, geomatics and related 
industries account for 11% of Canada's gross domestic product. 
They directly employ 780,000 Canadians and account for 22% of new 
capital investment in the country.  The sector had $97 billion in 
exports in 1998 and is the economic lifeblood of more than 600 
communities across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian resource companies are showing that not only can they 
succeed in the knowledge based economy, but they are a dynamic 
and vital element of the new economy.  Canadian resource 
companies are investing $35 billion per year in new capital, and 
average productivity growth is three times higher in the 
resources sector than in the rest of the economy.  The policies 
implemented by the government are helping to ensure that Canada's 
resource industries remain competitive and continue to underpin 
our economic prosperity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud of the government's record on natural resources, but 
I am also convinced that we can never take a prosperous resource 
sector for granted.  We must strive for continuous improvement. 
As we enter the new millennium, I believe Canada must become and 
remain the world's smartest natural resources steward, developer, 
user and exporter—the most high tech, the most environmentally 
friendly, the most socially responsible, the most productive and 
competitive—leading the world as a living model of sustainable 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consistent with this vision, it is important that Canadian 
resource companies have the ability to make strategic decisions 
and better position themselves in the domestic and global 
marketplace.  With that in mind, I am proposing legislative 
amendments that will allow two of our major performers in the 
natural resources sector, Cameco Corporation and Petro-Canada, to 
continue their record of economic growth and environmental 
stewardship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members are familiar with these companies.  Canada is the 
world's largest producer and exporter of uranium, and Cameco is 
the dominant Canadian company, accounting for about 25% of both 
global uranium production and the western world's uranium 
conversion services capacity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At one time both companies were crown corporations, fully owned 
by taxpayers. 
As hon. members are aware, this is no longer the case.  The 
Government of Canada sold all its shares in Cameco by 1995. 
Although the government currently holds 18% of Petro-Canada's 
shares, it does not influence the management of the company.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time of privatization certain ownership restrictions were 
placed on both companies, but the energy sector is a dynamic 
sector and the market has evolved significantly over the past 
decade.  While these restrictions were implemented for good 
reason, some have outlived their usefulness and are now 
preventing these companies from taking advantage of new business 
opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Officials of Cameco and Petro-Canada have repeatedly asked for 
changes in these ownership restrictions, which they view as 
unfair, since they do not apply to other companies in their 
respective industries.  After careful review our government has 
determined that these arguments have merit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through Bill C-39 we are taking action to give Petro-Canada and 
Cameco greater freedom to grow and compete in the global market 
on a more level playing field with their competitors, while 
ensuring decisions will still be made in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The goal of Bill C-39 is to remove unnecessary restrictions that 
are limiting the ability of these companies to attract new 
investment capital and forge new strategic alliances, good 
alliances.  Specifically the legislation proposes to modify 
existing restrictions on the ownership of shares and the disposal 
of assets in the Petro-Canada Public Participation Act.  We are 
also proposing to amend the share ownership provisions of the 
Eldorado Nuclear Limited Reorganization and Divestiture Act, 
which governs Cameco. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of Petro-Canada, Bill C-39 will increase the limit 
on the individual ownership of shares from 10% to 20%.  We are 
proposing to eliminate the 25% limit on the quantity of shares 
that can be collectively owned by non-residents of Canada.  In 
other words, there will be no foreign ownership restrictions for 
Petro-Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of Cameco, Bill C-39 will ease but not completely 
eliminate the current foreign ownership restrictions.  The limit 
on individual non-resident share ownership will be increased by 
10%, to a maximum of 15%.  The ownership limit for an individual 
Canadian shareholder will remain at 25%.  Under Bill C-39, the 
cap on total non-resident ownership of Cameco will move to 25% of 
the company's shares from the current 20%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I assure hon. members that these proposed changes are intended 
strictly to give Cameco and Petro-Canada increased agility and 
better global positioning.  Bill C-39 will not affect Canadian 
control of these companies. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said, the restrictions on foreign ownership of Cameco 
will be loosened, although not totally done away with.  The 
legislation will continue to require Cameco's head office to be 
located in Saskatchewan and for the majority of its directors to 
be Canadian residents.  This will ensure that Cameco remains 
under Canadian control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that Bill C-39 will result in the elimination of 
restrictions on foreign participation in the case of 
Petro-Canada.  A number of factors, however, will ensure that 
this major national will remain Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, the 20% limit on individual ownership of voting 
shares in Petro-Canada will prevent a takeover by a major 
multinational.  Then, as in the case of Cameco, the legislation 
will require the headquarters of Petro-Canada to be located in 
Canada—in Calgary, in this case—and the majority of its directors 
to be Canadian residents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally Petro-Canada has more or less reoriented its activities 
to concentrate on off-shore resources in the Atlantic region and 
on the oil sands, both of which are essentially Canadian 
resources.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-39 will amend the provisions of the Petro-Canada Public 
Participation Act that govern the disposal of Petro-Canada 
assets.  Specifically, the provision preventing Petro-Canada from 
disposing, particularly by sale or transfer, of all or 
substantially all of its commercial or production assets will be 
replaced by a similar one which makes no distinction between the 
two types of assets.  Petro-Canada will thus benefit from more 
latitude in administering its portfolio of assets, while not 
being allowed to wind up its activities through a pure and 
simple liquidation of its assets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed amendments are not an indication of a major change 
in the government energy policy. In fact, they confirm that we 
want to let the market forces play within reasonable and 
responsible limits. This is merely housekeeping legislation 
bringing minor changes to property rules for Cameco Corporation 
and Petro-Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure my colleagues that the proposed amendments will 
have no impact on the prices of refined petroleum products. The 
recent hikes in gasoline and diesel prices in Canada are a 
direct result of the price of crude oil worldwide, which has 
increased three times since 1998. The price of crude oil is 
established according to supply and demand on the global market 
and has nothing to do with property rules established in the 
Canadian energy industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to inform the hon. members that Bill C-39 will not 
change anything to the commitment Canada made toward 
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons or nuclear security. Also, 
it will permit Cameco to consolidate its position as a world 
leader in the mining and conversion of uranium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both companies support Bill C-39. Canadian as well as foreign 
investors will applaud this initiative, which should improve the 
long term outlook for shareholders as well as protect the 
Canadian status of Petro-Canada and Cameco. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is clearly legislation which encourages good management of 
public affairs, and that is why I would ask all members to join 
me in voting to have it referred to a committee. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK294"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the debate on Bill C-39. 
We in the Canadian Alliance support the objective of the bill and 
will be supporting it when it comes time to vote on second 
reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am certainly not about to let the government off the hook on 
the issues in the bill simply because the issue that the bill 
addresses should have been addressed a long time ago. In some 
respects the government still does not go as far as it should in 
allowing the flexibility of the two companies to compete in a 
global economic environment.  Only a Liberal in a Liberal 
government could stand in the House and say he or she is proud of 
the Liberal record when it comes to energy management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The two acts originally placed restrictions on individual and 
foreign ownership when Petro-Canada and Cameco were first 
privatized. In my view the restrictions placed on these two 
companies were too restrictive, more restrictive than necessary. 
The government some time ago should have made the move that is 
being made today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent of the bill is to increase the companies' access to 
domestic and foreign capital and enable greater flexibility in 
using share exchanges and asset pooling to make acquisitions and 
strategic alliances.  Of course, if the government would do 
something about our pathetic Canadian dollar, we would not need 
this legislation even to the degree that still remains to protect 
these Canadian companies from international takeover. 
However that is another issue and a topic for debate on another 
day.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I cannot help but wonder if the bill is to 
finally pave the way for the government to sell off its remaining 
18% ownership, or 49.4 million shares of Petro-Canada. Certainly 
that is what appears to be going on here.  Far be it from me to 
be suspect of the government's motives, but I suspect that is the 
intent of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill does a number of things to make room for the sale of 
Petro-Canada.  It raises the limit on individual ownership of 
shares from 10% to 20%. The 25% limit on shares that can be owned 
collectively by non-residents is removed.  It also provides the 
company with greater flexibility to manage its assets portfolio 
while maintaining a check against the company winding up its 
activities through an outright sale of all of its assets. What 
does all that mean? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Petro-Canada was created in 1975 as one of the mechanisms of the 
national energy program.  The feelings of western Canada and 
those of us who represent ridings in that region are well 
documented when it comes to the national energy program.  We 
never did buy the Liberal line that the national energy program 
was a vehicle for nationalist dreams and a ticket to energy 
self-sufficiency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time Canadians were told that we had less than 20 years 
worth of recoverable oil reserves and that a high gasoline tax 
burden was justifiable to guarantee our future energy needs. 
When we look at where the oil industry in Canada currently 
stands, obviously our skepticism was appropriate.  Twenty-five 
years later we know that those empty threats were little more 
than Liberal hogwash and a simple money grab and a flagrant 
breach of the principles of confederation by the federal 
government, a Liberal federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now have proven oil reserves that will supply Canada's energy 
needs well into the future. In fact, there is almost 400 years of 
recoverable reserves at current usage levels in the tar sands of 
northern Alberta alone.  The Liberal government might have 
thought that it had fooled Canadians but we knew it was the 
federal government poking its rather large and unwelcome nose 
into the oil and gas industry, an intrusion that was totally 
unasked for, unappreciated and unnecessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the national energy program was eventually dismantled, 
Petro-Canada lived on, fed by taxpayer dollars without taxpayer 
approval. I might say that even today in this Liberal government 
so many years later, the concept of a made in Canada energy 
policy still exists.  We heard reference to it just the other day 
on the debate on the reduction of gasoline taxes in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At one time perhaps it was of primary interest only in western 
Canada.  I would urge Canadians on the Atlantic coast and in 
Canada's Arctic today to be just as wary of that kind of 
discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals' presentation of the principle of a made in Canada 
energy policy perhaps had some validity when we look at the total 
context of Canada and its energy needs, but the folly and 
downfall of the program was that it was based simply on the 
resources of one or two provinces and took some $60 billion out 
of the economy of those provinces and gave nothing back in 
return. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion that is not the way to run a country. If we are 
going to depend on one part of the country for our resources and 
if we are going to take those resources in the interests of the 
whole country, then it behooves us to give back to the particular 
province or region something in return to equalize the 
contributions of the province or region.  Certainly that did not 
happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anger was a result of that program.  The injustice of the 
program has resulted now in a commitment in the North American 
Free Trade Agreement which does not allow Canada in any sense to 
set its own energy policy independent of the North American 
market. 
I think it could have been handled much better and in the 
interest of the entire country, not just a small part of it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not until after a federal election and the Liberals were 
defeated and the Tory government came to power that the national 
energy program was abandoned.  Of course by that time it did not 
matter anymore because oil prices had collapsed and the idea of 
western Canada selling its oil resources below international 
prices was not an issue.  It did not matter.  Finally the concept 
of a made in Canada energy policy was abandoned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Petro-Canada lived on after the national energy program and 
continues to live on today.  It continues to remind us of just 
how foolish and inept the government was in setting up the 
program.  Petro-Canada ended up as an oil company much like any 
other oil company in Canada, except that the taxpayers still own 
18% of the company and are the single largest holder of stock in 
the company.  No one but the government could own more than 10% 
of the company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994 I questioned why the government would not sell off its 
national oil company while the industry was strong and recoup 
some of the billions of taxpayer dollars that were used to create 
Petro-Canada in the first place. Even in 1994 I asked the 
government why it would not do something significant and use the 
revenue from the sale of Petro-Canada to reduce Canada's debt 
burden.  That debt burden was in part because of the creation of 
Petro-Canada and the money that the government took from 
taxpayers to buy Petrofina and create Petro-Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 the Liberal budget promised to totally privatize 
Petro-Canada, and we can see today how reliable Liberal budget 
promises are.  Certainly this is no different than in many other 
areas.  Indeed it is something we should consider over the coming 
weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact remains that Petro-Canada cost Canadians over $5 
billion to create.  Petro-Canada has never provided any benefit 
to Canadians that could not have been provided by the private 
sector.  When it was finally privatized, Petro-Canada started 
making a profit and competed effectively.  Until the company was 
privatized, it continued to be a drain on the taxpayers' purse 
and never did make a profit until it was privatized, even with 
the restrictions that have continued to be placed on the company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments, since Petro-Canada was established, have never had 
the courage to admit to Canadians that they will only be able to 
recover less than $2 billion of the original cost of $5 billion 
for the creation of Petro-Canada.  If this bill is indeed the 
first step in the process of the government to sell off its 
remaining shares of Petro-Canada, my first response would be it 
is about time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am curious though about the timing of the bill.  On Bay Street 
investors have driven up Petro-Canada's share prices in 
anticipation of a move by Ottawa to sell its shares. Today 
Petro-Canada shares are selling at $32.75 each. That is over a 
46% gain just this year and there is potential for the price to 
go even higher. Bill C-39 will remove foreign ownership 
restrictions, allowing for an expanded market and certainly the 
potential of increased share prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should the government sell its shares?  It could optimistically 
find itself receiving $1.6 billion. That is $3.4 billion less 
than what Canadians originally paid for Petro-Canada, a business 
transaction anyone could identify as being a disaster, let alone 
standing and saying they were proud of their record.  How could 
anyone be proud of a record like that?

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the government could find itself in possession of $1.6 
billion.  What I would like to know is what it is going to do 
with the money?  Since it was originally taxpayers' dollars that 
paid for Petro-Canada, I believe that the funds should be 
returned to the taxpayers in a direct fashion, rather than being 
dumped into the general revenue fund that the Liberal cronies can 
dip into whenever they feel inclined, whether it is for vote 
buying schemes in some parts of the country or for huge new 
national social programs that it commits to then later backs away 
from and leaves the provinces stuck with them.  No, I would like 
to see the money going to debt reduction, again to reduce the 
debt that the creation of Petro-Canada had a role in making in 
the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps it could be put into transportation improvements or 
maybe we could really be revolutionary and put the money toward 
lowering gas taxes.  Lowering gas taxes, what an original idea. 
However, we must remember that these Liberals just two days ago 
voted against such a notion so I do not suppose they would be 
interested in returning taxpayer dollars directly to the 
taxpayers.  No, in fact, that is far to clear-cut, simple, direct 
and responsible for this government to recognize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-39 does a number of things that we support.  Referring to 
Petro-Canada, it moves toward opening up ownership of the company 
to both national and international interests, while still 
ensuring that the majority of the company is still Canadian.  The 
legislation clearly states that resident Canadians must still 
make up the majority of the board of directors.  It also 
stipulates that the head office of the company must remain in 
Calgary.  That is a curious feature of a number of bills which 
privatized crown corporations.  I have always wonder why that was 
necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would only make sense for the head office of Petro-Canada to 
remain in Calgary because that is the centre of their operation. 
As the House may recall, when CN was privatized the head office 
had to remain in a certain particular city.  When Air Canada was 
privatized the head office also had to stay in a particular city. 
I have trouble understanding what the motivation for that is, 
except it has to be politically motivated.  I tend to be a bit 
cynical after awhile. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance supports the removal of restrictions upon 
Canadian businesses to allow for both domestic and foreign 
investing.  We expect to see that Petro-Canada, once it is no 
longer manipulated by government, will continue to show profits 
and growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, Bill C-39 does not only address issues surrounding 
Petro-Canada, although that is where my primary interest is, as 
members might have noticed.  It also addresses relating to the 
sale of shares in Cameco, Canada's biggest uranium producer. 
Canada's Kyoto commitments have increased the need for Canada to 
find green energy and certainly nuclear energy is one of the 
options that is being considered.  Our Prime Minister speaks of 
it often. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not wish to get into the debate at this point on the merits 
or lack thereof of nuclear energy, but the fact remains that 
uranium is a resource that should nuclear energy be a factor in 
the world's efforts to reduce CO2 levels will become a very 
important resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill raises foreign and individual ownership limits for 
Cameco.  Individual non-resident ownership will increase from 5% 
to 15% and the limit on the total amount of non-resident 
ownership of shares will increase from 20% to 25%.  I am pleased 
to see that the legislation still is mindful of the possible 
consequences of high levels of foreign ownership of uranium 
resources.  In fact, the lower limits on Cameco shares reflect 
across the board government restrictions on foreign activity in 
uranium mining.  While the Canadian Alliance is all for Canadian 
businesses having all the opportunities to succeed, we must also 
be conscious of the need to keep such potentially volatile 
resources within Canadian control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In effect, the bill allows for greater flexibility in the 
selling of shares in Canadian companies and I can certainly 
support that effort.  It allows those companies the freedom to 
raise capital and to prosper and grow to the maximum that their 
ability and their resource will allow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have already stated, if this legislation leads to the 
government finally selling off its remaining shares of 
Petro-Canada, it would be legislation that is long overdue.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess we will just have to wait and see if the sale of 
Petro-Canada becomes another pre-election goodie, and if so, 
exactly how much the Liberals think Canadians have forgotten 
regarding the original purpose of Petro-Canada and the amount of 
taxpayers' dollars that went into establishing the company which 
were never and will never be recovered from the sale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, essentially we will be supporting the bill.  It is a 
step in the right direction.  It is the right thing to do.  It is 
better late than never.  We will be voting in favour of the bill

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Serge Cardin (Sherbrooke, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, with rather 
mixed emotions, I rise to speak to Bill C-39, an act to amend the 
Eldorado Nuclear Limited Reorganization and Divestiture Act and 
the Petro-Canada Public Participation Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These days, we hear the words “snap election” or “early 
election” on everybody's lips.  In the meantime, the job of the 
MPs is to speak to certain bills, which in some cases are 
contrary to the interests of Quebec, such as the young offenders 
bill or bills I consider of relative importance, such as the one 
before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, this enactment relates to the mandatory provisions in 
the articles of Eldorado Nuclear Limited—now Cameco 
Corporation—and Petro-Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It provides that the articles of Cameco Corporation will have to 
contain a 15% individual non-resident share ownership limit for 
voting shares as well as a cap on aggregate non-resident share 
ownership voting rights of 25%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It provides that the articles of Petro-Canada will have to be 
amended to allow for a 20% individual share ownership limit 
instead of 10%, while the aggregate non-resident share ownership 
limit of 25% will be eliminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the prohibition on the sale, transfer or disposal 
of all or substantially all of Petro-Canada's upstream and 
downstream assets will be replaced with a similar prohibition on 
the sale, transfer or disposal of all or substantially all of 
its assets, without distinguishing between the upstream and 
downstream sectors of activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, before examining the reason for the bill, let me give 
you a brief overview of these two corporations, which I had to 
do to get to know them better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First Cameco.  Cameco was born in 1988 out of an amalgamation of 
two crown corporations, namely, Saskatchewan Mining Development 
Corporation and Eldorado Nuclear Limited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eldorado Nuclear Limited had been in existence for 61 years. It 
was the oldest uranium producer in the world. It was a world 
class business and a reliable supplier with many customers, both 
in Canada and abroad. The Eldorado company was Canada's only 
integrated producer, which means that it could transform uranium 
into products used not only in Canadian reactors in order to 
satisfy Canadian energy needs, but also exported in order to 
satisfy the energy needs of other countries. Modern and 
efficient plants were operated by Eldorado, and it owned in 
whole or in part the uranium mines where the ore was extracted 
at competitive costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other partner, the Saskatchewan Mining Development 
Corporation, was one of the biggest uranium suppliers in the 
world. Already, in 1986, it accounted for 7% of the total 
production in the Western world. 
As the company had been intensifying its exploration activities 
for a number of years, it owned some of the world's most 
important commercial reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1988, Cameco has made several buyouts and has extended its 
activities in several other countries. The company deals in 
uranium, gold and oil. It is worth mentioning that, in 1999, the 
company signed an agreement for the purchase of natural uranium 
extracted from highly enriched uranium coming from Russia's 
dismantled nuclear armament. I will come back to this later.

world's biggest uranium producer. Its customers are 
hydro-electric companies in 13 countries around the world. The 
uranium products they buy supply nuclear energy plants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian nuclear industry sales figure is $4.5 billion and 
it maintains 30,000 highly skilled jobs in 150 Canadian 
companies. The Canadian government brings in annually more than 
$700 million in taxes and sale taxes.

assets are worth over $1.6 billion. 
The public holds 90% of its shares, and Saskatchewan government 
holds 10%. The company's 57 million shares are traded on the 
Toronto and New York stock exchanges. Unfortunately, I cannot at 
this time say what the percentage of non-resident shareholders 
is. This is the kind of information the minister will be able to 
give us when he appears before the standing committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us now turn to Petro-Canada. Petro-Canada was established in 
1975 by the federal government as a result of the high oil 
prices and the uncertain supply we faced at the time. The 
company's initial mandate was a response to public policy needs 
in the energy sector. Canada had to establish a presence in the 
industry, stimulate exploration in frontier areas and find new 
oil resources in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The world changed a lot over the next decade. 
Ten years later, the oil crisis was over, and it was claimed 
that successful exploration and conservation measures had had a 
tremendous impact both on supply and demand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1984, Canada elected a Conservative government with a totally 
different view of government's involvement in the business 
world. This new philosophy, which meant the official end of 
Petro-Canada's public policy mandate, was the first of many steps 
toward privatization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This new approach put an end to government 
funding of Petro-Canada. However, as a crown corporation, 
Petro-Canada could not go to the market to finance its 
operations. In the mid 1980s, net receipts dropped even further 
as oil prices came down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During this time, Petro-Canada had to turn itself into a 
profitable venture; it was very difficult. Petro-Canada had a 
huge debt because of its original public policy mandate and, in 
the absence of new capital, it had to borrow more to fund its 
growth. Access to the stock market became essential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, in 1990, the government announced its intention to 
privatize Petro-Canada and the first shares were sold on the open 
market in July 1991, at $13 each. The markets were quick to pass 
judgment on Petro-Canada's financial health. During the first 
year, the value of the shares gradually dropped to $8. In 1991, 
Petro-Canada suffered a huge loss of $603 million, primarily 
because of the devaluation of some assets. Petro-Canada needed 
more than a change, it needed a miracle. It had to fundamentally 
review its business and the way it was managed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It significantly reduced the number of properties in which it 
had a direct interest. It reduced its annual operating costs by 
$300 million. It went from a staff of close to 11,000 to only 
about 5,000 employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>September 1995 was a turning point in Petro-Canada's history. 
Indeed, this is when the government disposed of most of the 70% 
of outstanding shares that it still held, keeping only a 20% 
interest. At the time, this was the largest issue of shares in 
Canada's history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 31, 1999, out of the 222.4 million public shares of 
Petro-Canada, 181.6 million common shares were held by Canadian 
residents, while 40.8 million multiple voting shares were held 
by non-residents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This completes my historical overview. 
Let us now briefly go back to Cameco.

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his press release announcing the proposed legislative 
amendments, the minister put it this way, no doubt to reassure 
the public. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed amendments are consistent with the Government of 
Canada's policy on foreign ownership in the uranium mining 
sector and do not diminish Canada's ability to meet its 
commitments with respect to nuclear non-proliferation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the attitude we saw with respect to the transportation of 
MOX, the warm and fuzzy words of the member for Wascana are 
hardly reassuring. 
I wonder about the appropriateness of such an action.  Is it 
really necessary to go after more foreign capital to mine 
uranium? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should also be pointed out that the Ontario communities of 
Clarington, Hope Township and Port Hope will have to manage more 
than one million cubic metres of low level waste produced by 
former crown corporation Eldorado Nuclear Ltd. at the Port Hope 
refinery from the 1930s on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This waste was first dumped in various sites in the city of Port 
Hope, then moved to the Welcome storage site in Hope Township, 
and finally to the Port Granby site in the Municipality of 
Clarington.  The Welcome and Port Granby storage facilities are 
authorized by the Atomic Energy Control Board and belong to 
Cameco, which runs them itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though the waste is managed safely in its present location, 
the current situation will not be acceptable in the longer term 
according to the Atomic Energy Control Board, the Government of 
Canada and the local communities. Why, while we want to attract 
more foreign capital, are we limiting foreign control? Is it to 
protect ourselves or to protect them against potential liability 
with respect to the environment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the minister will give appropriate answers to our 
questions in committee. However, I would be remiss if I failed 
to  mention that the head office of Cameco is located in the 
minister's province, Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, let us go back to Petro-Canada. Petro-Canada, whose head 
office is located in Alberta, was previously a crown 
corporation. Today, the federal government owns about one-fifth 
of the corporation's shares. 
As sovereignist Quebecers, we consider that this corporation is 
already owned, to a certain extent, by foreigners. The fact that 
the maximum percentage of shares that an individual is allowed 
to own is raised from 10% to 20% does not necessarily change the 
problem of competition on the fuel market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is surprising is that this bill is being introduced at the 
very moment when the Conference Board is studying that market. 
Would it not have been more appropriate to wait for the 
completion of the Conference Board study before introducing such 
changes to the share structure of Petro-Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also surprising is the fact that Petro-Canada contributed a 
little over $5,000 to the election fund of the Liberal Party of 
Canada in 1999. 
I suppose that when the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of 
Petro-Canada asks for changes to the Petro-Canada Public 
Participation Act, close attention is paid to what he has to 
say. All roads lead to the campaign fund of our friends across 
the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the report of the Conference Board, I want to remind the 
House that the parliamentary committee examined Petro-Canada and 
the fuel industry in 1998. In one of its recommendations, the 
committee warned us against a possible merger of Petro-Canada and 
another oil company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is another fine example of the Prime Minister ignoring the 
work of his own members. Despite all the work that was done, he 
is trying to hide the fuel issue in this report from the 
Conference Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government not only collects fuel taxes, it grabs 
part of the huge profits being registered by the oil companies 
this year. Petro-Canada's profits increased by $195 million during 
the second quarter of the year 2000. That is a 304.7% increase. 
To increase its tax revenues, the government will stop at 
nothing. During the next campaign, the Liberal Party election 
cry could very well be “We want nothing but your good, and your 
goods.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increasing the foreign ownership limit from 10% to 20% will not 
allow an individual to take control of Petro-Canada. However, 20% 
of the shares of a company can give someone a lot of power. We, 
in the Bloc, think that competition is one of the major problems 
of this industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, the 25% cap on aggregate non-resident share ownership 
voting rights would also be abolished under this bill. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1605"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Petro-Canada could very well end up under foreign control. The 
minister should explain why this should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government identified a dangerous level of 
concentration in the industry, but it decided against doing 
anything until the problem reached crisis proportions since the 
winter of 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has been demanding for some time that the 
federal government make sure there is more competition in the 
Canadian oil industry. For example, three refiners-marketers 
control 75% of the wholesale trade in Canada, which is reason 
enough to wonder if there is any real competition in this 
industry. The Competition Act should be amended to guarantee 
competitive prices for consumers. 
The House committee that has been poring over this legislation 
for a year has clearly indicated that the Competition Bureau had 
a very hard time enforcing the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two things should be done in that regard. First, there should be 
changes made to the onus of proof with respect to 
anticompetitive behaviour, and, second, the Competition Bureau 
should be given the authority to initiate investigations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another problem with the federal government in the gas issue is 
that only 17% of federal taxes on fuel are invested in the 
transportation infrastructure. The federal government then feels 
it has to set up infrastructure programs in order to gain more 
visibility. Compare this with the Quebec government, which is 
investing 71.7% of fuel taxes revenues in infrastructure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To sum up, I fail to see how this bill is relevant. 
We are not against it nor do we support it, but the minister 
will have to answer some questions. The problem I see here is 
why introduce this bill now? Is it because a foreign investor 
anxious to invest in Petro-Canada needs an increase in the 
foreign ownership limit to take over the company? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose the Minister of Natural Resources will be able to 
explain to us in committee why this bill is being introduced now 
and why the government is not dealing with the issue of 
competition in the gasoline market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I will quote an excerpt from the 1999 annual 
report of the National Energy Board: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Petroleum export revenues increased to an estimated $14.9 
billion in 1999, somewhat below the peak of $17.9 billion in 
1997. 
Spending on petroleum imports was about $9 billion, leaving 
Canada with a trade surplus in petroleum of $5.8 billion, up 
from $4.4 billion in 1998. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is strange that a country that has a trade surplus in 
petroleum cannot exert any pressure on the gasoline market. It 
is also strange that it would consider allowing foreign control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some fundamental questions which must be put to the 
minister. Therefore, I am looking forward to seeing him at a 
future meeting of the Standing Committee on Natural Resources 
and Government Operations. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK296"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of the New 
Democratic Party to say how disappointed we are with the 
government again selling off or giving away and basically 
denouncing something that we were a big part of back in 1972-74 
when there was a minority government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people say that probably the best government of that time 
was when we were assisting the Liberals and pushing them into the 
Petro-Canada act itself.  Because of the energy crisis facing our 
consumers, our industries, our businesses and the economy at that 
time, we felt that it was necessary for Canada to try to look 
internally, at its own concerns, when it came to energy pricing 
and energy supply.  Unfortunately now the government has turned 
its back on yet another Canadian corporation, one that all of us 
in Canada were very proud of and in many ways are still very 
proud of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very interesting to hear the reform members talk about how 
much it costs.  They use inflated figures and say, “This applied 
to the debt—”.  To say that because we had Petro-Canada the 
finances of the country are in terrible, dire straits is simple 
nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is, they never mention the profits that Petro-Canada 
made over those years or the number of jobs it created in Canada. 
They never mention the taxes that were paid by the employees of 
Petro-Canada, which assisted in social programs and other 
programs in Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They never mention the positive aspects of what Petro-Canada did 
for this country.  They never do.  They are in such a rush with 
their American friends to sell off anything that has the Canadian 
flag on it, almost.  In fact I will rue the day when I come into 
this House of Commons and see the stars and stripes standing 
right next to you, Mr. Speaker.  The way we are going, we are 
rushing off at a very dizzying rate and selling more of our 
assets in Canada to American and foreign control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My wife is from Montreal.  Really, she sometimes can understand 
and feel what the Bloc Quebecois is saying in the House of 
Commons and in the province of Quebec when they talk about their 
culture, their unity and being Quebecois.  Many times I sit back 
and say that sometimes they might be right in defending against 
the interests of the Americans, but separatism will not work. 
Their link to the American currency, which they would love, kind 
of blows that little touchy-feely warm feeling I have for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a long string of deregulation, of getting rid of what we 
pride ourselves on in Canada.  When this country was young, when 
it became a country with the CBC radio and television, we spoke 
to each other from coast to coast to coast through the CBC.  What 
has happened over the years?  The government has again taken away 
funding from CBC.  It has made it a shell of itself, to the point 
where I think 5% of westerners actually watch CBC.  In fact, the 
CBC's greatest strength now is in Atlantic Canada and even that 
is diminishing, to the point where eventually we will have the 
argument of whether money should go into the CBC or into health 
care.  Then people will say that health care is diminishing 
because we have the CBC, so get rid of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suspect it will not be too long before we one day sit in the 
House of Commons and the government across the way gets rid of 
the CBC, something that we cherish and value.  The string just 
goes on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had Air Canada, a proud airline at one time.  The government 
got rid of it.  It became privatized in the dog-eat-dog 
competitive world out there.  They linked with Canadian, a 
company I worked with for 18 years, and what happened?  There are 
major complaints about the service.  While competing against one 
another these two airlines were doing a great job, but what has 
the government had to do now?  It has had to get an NHL referee 
to separate all the concerns that were going on with regard to 
the complaints in the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on and on.  We sold MacMillan Bloedel.  We are getting 
rid of Petro-Canada.  Pretty soon we will be getting rid of the 
CBC.  Eventually we will be selling out everything.  This is what 
shocks me.  This shows how the Liberals are really no different 
from the Canadian Alliance or the Progressive Conservatives in 
their thinking.  They both support more privatization of our 
crown corporations, of what makes us Canadian.  It is true.  They 
support it.  Petro-Canada will eventually be controlled, if it is 
not already in the majority sense, by foreign ownership.  We will 
no longer have the ability or the access to control our own 
petroleum industry, for example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A classic example of this is that we are a net exporter of 
petroleum products in this country.  That is a fact.  Yet we do 
not have a national energy pricing commission or an energy review 
commission to protect consumers, the industry and the economy 
from inflated prices for gas or natural gas.  We cannot do 
anything about it because we do not have those controls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We continually allow government intervention or governmental 
ability to protect, such as seniors, for example.  Seniors in my 
riding this year are going to have a very difficult time heating 
their homes.  They are on fixed incomes.  They are already making 
the choice between bread and their prescriptions.  What are they 
going to do this winter if we have a very cold winter in Atlantic 
Canada?  What is going to happen to these people?  The government 
is going to do absolutely nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government may talk about a little GST credit and everything 
else, but it does not go after the root of the problem, which is, 
first, the taxation on the fuel prices and, second, the fact that 
these foreign companies can raise their oil prices without any 
regulatory aspects to it and can just get away with it 
constantly.  For example, when the price of oil went down the 
other day were there any concessions or knocking down of prices 
at the pumps?  Absolutely not.  But when they go up, all of a 
sudden, bang, they go up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A classic example of that is from the member for Labrador who so 
rightfully complained to his own government.  In September and 
early October most of the fuel for Labrador goes up there by 
barge. 
That fuel was bought at a specific price.  What happens when the 
price goes up?  The gas starts going up in Labrador if there is 
no new supply into there.  It is a major rip-off to the economy 
and to the people who live in Labrador.  What does the government do? 
Absolutely nothing.  That is the way the pickle squirts.

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government claims it cannot do anything about it.  It knows 
it has a responsibility to care for the people of this country, 
but is not doing anything because American and foreign ownership 
of our companies is much more important than the protection and 
interests of our economy and those people who live within our 
borders.  It is a sin and a real shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A publication from Natural Resources Canada says that Canadian 
control of these two enterprises will not be affected by the 
amendments.  That is simple nonsense.  Nobody in their right mind 
believes that.  In most cases, nobody believes what the natural 
resources minister says anyway.  Just because a corporation keeps 
its head office in Canada does not mean that its management is 
completely in Canadian hands.  Just because a corporation has an 
office in Calgary does not mean we have Canadian control of it. 
It is simple nonsense.  This is what this bill will do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From 1972 to 1974, Petro-Canada was pushed by the NDP so our 
interests from coast to coast to coast would be protected.  We 
were very proud of that initiative.  It allowed us to say that we 
had our own company controlling energy prices, energy flow and 
everything else.  Yet, now we are in the year 2000 and the 
government is saying get rid of it.  Let us get rid of anything 
that has a Canadian flag or a Canadian symbol on it.  Pretty soon 
we are going to see the stars and stripes up here.  I proudly 
walk into this building everyday because when I look up at the 
Peace Tower I see our Canadian flag.  Yet, every single day we 
start losing one more piece and one more brick of what is called 
Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was not born in this country.  I came to Canada in 1956 
because my mother, father and the six children decided to leave 
Holland for economic opportunities and for the opportunity to 
live in peace and freedom.  That is what Canada has given us.  We 
are very proud to be called Canadians.  I am very proud to stand 
up and say I am a Canadian and I am very proud to raise my 
children in this country.  It is disappointing to see our 
Canadian identity slowly slipping away to foreign hands and 
foreign control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When polices in the government are no longer acceptable for the 
people of Canada, we have to wait to see what the World Trade 
Organization says or we cannot do something because we have to 
see what GATT is going to do.  We cannot help our farmers because 
of certain international regulations.  Yet, France and the 
Americans do not hesitate for a second to help their farmers.  We 
sit and talk but do absolutely nothing about it.  This is a real 
sin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said before, the particular bill we have before us 
looks like a piece of legislation that came out of the south end 
of a north bound cow.  I urge the government to reconsider this 
legislation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK297"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member has repeated the disappointment of Canadians as 
gasoline and oil prices rise.  Would he not accept, what most of 
the world has come to accept, that is that these prices are 
driven by the international markets, not by what happens on 
Wellington Street?  No country in the world has the ability to 
control the prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian oil companies are not bumping up the price.  They are 
simply responding to price increases.  If the price happens to go 
down, I am sure the member and Canadians would not be so 
concerned.  I accept the fact that the increase in oil prices is 
very much an issue for Canadians.  The ripple effect in the 
marketplace for oil and gasoline is an also issue in terms of 
affordability.  The government is attempting to address that at 
this time as are most government's around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second thing the member referred to was the repeated mantra 
of foreign ownership in Canada.  Would he not acknowledge that 
Canadians directly themselves and through their pension plans are 
investing billions and billions of dollars in ownership of 
Canadian oil companies, other Canadian enterprises and in other 
enterprises around the world? 
We are no longer afraid of being owned by non-Canadians.  In 
fact, Canadians are investing their capital and buying here and 
abroad as well.  Would he acknowledge that that is going on at 
the same time as he is trying to frighten, as has been done for 
100 years, that Canada is being bought out by those nasty 
foreigners?

<A HREF="#LINKT76"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if he wants to refer to 
foreigners as nasty, I would not call them that and never did.  I 
would call them very enterprising.  Why would one not pick up a 
Canadian company for a song?  With our low dollar, why not?  It 
is an easy deal.  I would do the same thing if I had the 
opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if he firmly believes that we cannot do anything about 
oil and gas prices and if he is going to blame the oil companies 
for the rapid rises, then why does he not reduce the prices on 
taxation of the fuel right now?  Why does he not regulate the 
industry within the country in the way that P.E.I. does?  P.E.I. 
has a regulatory framework on its fuel prices and its gas is 
almost a dime cheaper than in Nova Scotia.  Why does he not do 
that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, he talked about the corporate control.  I know that the 
parliamentary secretary is an honourable man and one of the most 
intelligent people on the government side.  However, how much has 
foreign ownership gone up since 1993 when the government took 
office?  I think he would be astounded by the statistic of 
exactly how much foreign ownership has increased since the 
Liberals took power. 
<P><A NAME="LINK298"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
before I get to the heart of the matter, I would be remiss not 
to make a few comments on the speech by my colleague in the NDP. 
For a change, I have to say that I agree with some of what he 
said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it pertains to the cost of oil, gas and fuel at the present 
time and the effect it is having on a lot of people in our 
country, the hon. parliamentary secretary mentioned that we could 
not control the price of oil.  What the government can control is 
the effect it is having on the poor of the country and on the 
people who are living on fixed incomes and suffering drastically 
because of escalating prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government cannot control or lower the price of oil, it 
can certainly lower the taxes.  As the price of fuel goes up, the 
amount of money that governments make, both provincially and 
federally, increases dramatically.  If they were satisfied with a 
certain fixed income, then the balance of the amount of taxation 
which is now being charged could revert to the user and that 
would be substantial.  There are all kinds of other ways that the 
government can help the poor people of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the other items that the hon. member mentioned, which is 
an extremely important to people of Labrador, is the effect this 
is has on the people who depend on fuel in Labrador.  The fuel is 
brought in during the summer months.  Earlier this year, of 
course, fuel was at a relatively low price.  Prices escalated and 
are those people paying the earlier price at which the owners of 
the shipping companies bought the fuel?  No, they are paying the 
higher price which is now being charged.  That is extremely unfair 
to the users. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, that is probably where my agreement with my colleague 
in the NDP ends.  My feeling on the divestiture of Petro-Canada 
as such is entirely different from what the hon. member feels. 
Even though we appreciate, perhaps more in Newfoundland than 
anywhere else in the country, what Petro-Canada has done for oil 
and gas development in our province, we also must realize that to 
grow companies need investment.  We cannot restrict that 
investment or we are putting companies at a disadvantage.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Any legislation respecting ownership of Petro-Canada is bound to 
draw considerable attention in my home province of Newfoundland. 
Petro-Canada, as a crown corporation and a private company, was 
and remains a key player in the Atlantic oil and gas industry. 
Petro-Canada was a partner in the Hibernia oil discovery off 
Newfoundland in 1979, as well as in gas discoveries off Nova 
Scotia.  It now shares in substantial revenues from the very 
successful development of the Hibernia field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Tory government bought shares in Hibernia and invested 
heavily in Hibernia development, many naysayers condemned it 
for throwing money into such a development.  The Canadian 
Alliance talked about throwing money into a sinkhole.  Today, the 
Government of Canada benefits greatly from the development of 
Hibernia and will continue to profit for years to come from the 
developments off the shores of Newfoundland and Labrador. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A year later, in 1980, Petro-Canada was the operator of an oil 
and gas exploration off Labrador.  While it may be some time 
before the oil and gas from the Labrador fields hits the market, 
there is no doubt that the Petro-Canada shareholders will reap 
substantial benefits from their investment in that first class 
property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1984 Canada Petro-Canada made its first large offshore oil 
discovery as an operator at the Terra Nova oil field and is now 
just a few months away from getting first oil from that property. 
Petro-Canada is also a significant partner in the White Rose oil 
field which will likely follow Terra Nova as the third producing 
oil property in offshore Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along the way the company became a key investor and owner in 
building an oil transshipment terminal port at Whiffen Head which 
will be the storage and distribution centre for all the 
Newfoundland offshore oil.  I doubt very much that there would be 
an offshore oil industry today in Newfoundland without the 
initiative, the drive, the risk, the faith and the determination 
of Petro-Canada and its only shareholder for most of that time, 
the Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, oil exploration, development and production in offshore 
Newfoundland is one of Petro-Canada's four core businesses.  The 
others are the oil sands production and development in Alberta 
and other developments in northern Alberta, natural gas 
exploration and production in western Canada generally and 
refining and marketing of petroleum products including 
lubricants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Petro-Canada's mandate is obvious in its core businesses.  It 
was formed by the Government of Canada in 1975 to do what private 
investors were unwilling to do.  That perhaps is the greatest 
legacy that Petro-Canada leaves the country.  The public 
investment in Petro-Canada was the catalyst for drawing other 
private sector investors at that time who, perhaps because of 
exorbitant costs of development of oil fields in rough and rugged 
areas or unchartered areas in the country and perhaps because of 
the uncertainty of such developments, could not take the risk on 
its own.  It was the Government of Canada, through Petro-Canada, 
that was the catalyst to start some of the major developments in 
the country which have proven to be extremely successful and 
rewarding to the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Private companies were reluctant to take the risks or to invest 
in new technologies that would be needed to explore and develop 
these frontiers.  Petro-Canada gave Canada a presence and a voice 
in the corporate culture where attitudes were formed and 
decisions were made about potential for private sector 
investments in these areas.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It provided the government with a corporate investment that it 
could use to form partnerships with the private sector, companies 
to undertake projects such as Hibernia, which would never have 
been undertaken without the incentive that the government 
provided through Petro-Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not normally a fan of public sector competition in the 
private sector but Petro-Canada is different.  It is a case where 
the public sector attracted private sector investment in projects 
that might not have been developed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Petro-Canada is a success story.  It demonstrates how the public 
sector can open the door to new areas of investment.  Thanks in 
large measure to Petro-Canada and the former PC government, the 
Newfoundland offshore is highly profitable, although still a 
difficult area for private investment solely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everything changes.  Petro-Canada is now a private company, 
although the federal government retains 18% ownership.  It has to 
look to private investors for the capital it needs to operate and 
to expand its core business.  It must find the capital in the 
global financial markets that are increasingly attracted to the 
size of the profits that we see happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can understand that the present level of ownership 
restrictions on Petro-Canada may have a negative impact on its 
ability to raise new capital.  We had an example of that with a 
former public company in Newfoundland, Fishery Products Limited, 
which was privatized under great restrictions.  The company now 
readily admits that the limit on these restrictions have to be 
changed because in order to draw the investment that will make 
the company grow, prosper and be competitive it must be able to 
encourage investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that the private sector has experienced firsthand that the 
energy frontier in Canada is a good place to invest, it may not 
be necessary to insist that Petro-Canada be majority owned by 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to avoid a reign takeover of Petro-Canada and 
the 20% restriction on individual ownership might help do that. 
If Canadian investors continue to put their money into 
Petro-Canada so that we continue to have a primarily Canadian 
owned company playing in the major leagues of global energy 
exploration, development and production, it is worthwhile to keep 
the requirement that a majority of directors be Canadian 
citizens, but it may be more window dressing than substantial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an old saying that says, “he who pays the piper calls 
the tune”.  Undoubtedly, the investors or shareholders in any 
new company will be the ones who will direct the board of 
directors.  By having that clause in the bill, which says that 
everything will be okay because the directors will be mainly 
Canadian, it will probably be just window dressing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not against the bill.  It is something that had to come. 
Petro-Canada has played an extremely important role in the oil 
and gas development, particularly in my own area of Newfoundland 
and Labrador.  However, times change and new outside interested 
investment is required to make companies grow, prosper and be 
competitive in this global market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be supporting the bill.  However, just because we are 
opening up the country to investment, I hope it does not mean 
that we ourselves will be bought or owned by anybody else.  The 
remarks of my hon. NDP friend that one day we will see the 
American flag flying over the country, surely we as 
representatives in this great Chamber and as Canadians generally, 
know we will never let such a thing happen.  We are Canadians and 
we stand for Canada first.  Any decisions we make in this Chamber 
will be for the betterment of the country and not to weaken it or 
give it away.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (for the Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-36, an act to 
amend the Criminal Code (criminal harassment, home invasions,

criminal procedure) and to amend other acts, be read the second

<P><A NAME="LINK302"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am very pleased today to rise to introduce the debate on the 
motion to give second reading to Bill C-36, an act to amend the 
criminal code, dealing with criminal harassment, home invasions, 
applications for ministerial review, dealing with miscarriages of 
justice and criminal procedure, and to amend other acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I am sure hon. members opposite will agree, there are a 
number of outstanding criminal law policy matters that require a 
legislative response.  Bill C-36 is designed to address some of 
these matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments proposed to the bill respond to issues of public 
concern.  The proposals are as follows: first, the bill before 
you proposes to amend the criminal code that would increase the 
maximum penalty for criminal harassment from five years to ten 
years; second, make home invasions an aggravating circumstance 
for sentencing purposes; third, codify and clarify the review 
process for applications to the Minister of Justice with respect 
to allegations of miscarriage of justice or wrongful convictions; 
and fourth, reform and modernize aspects of the law of criminal 
procedure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This enactment would also amend the National Capital Act by 
increasing the maximum fine available and the National Defence 
Act by providing for fingerprinting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to outline the rationale for the proposals.  I 
would like to spend some time this afternoon setting out the 
rationale for these proposals in very clear terms.  Let me turn 
first to the proposal concerning criminal harassment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Criminal harassment, or stalking, as it is sometimes referred 
to, is a serious offence that can have a devastating effect upon 
the emotional and physical well-being of the victim.  Although 
the offence of criminal harassment is still relatively new, the 
conduct itself is not.  There are many Canadians who associate 
this type of conduct with some of the few well-known cases of 
stalking of a celebrity.  However, the reality is that in Canada 
the primary motivation for stalking another partner more 
typically relates to a desire to control a former partner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know from Statistics Canada data for 1997 that eight out of 
ten victims of police report incidents of criminal harassment 
were women.  We know that nine out of ten accused were men.  We 
know as well that two-thirds of the victims were criminally 
harassed by a current or former intimate partner or close male 
friend.  This data characterizes criminal harassment for many as 
an issue of violence against women and as an issue of family 
violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is committed to taking strong measures to ensure 
that the criminal justice system treats criminal harassment as 
the serious offence that we know it to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some time ago the federal, provincial and territorial ministers 
of justice directed senior criminal justice officials to review 
the problem of criminal harassment.  After receiving the advice 
of senior officials and after carefully considering the matter, 
the governments adopted a twofold response:  first, strengthening 
the existing legislation; and second, releasing comprehensive 
guidelines for criminal justice personnel on criminal harassment 
to enhance implementation of the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This twofold response, supported by our federal, provincial and 
territorial counterparts, with whom the minister shares a mutual 
concern that more must be done to ensure that not only the law 
itself but also the enforcement of the law, is adequately 
reflected in the serious nature of criminal harassment and its 
impact. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1640"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT81"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT81"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1640
<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT80"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-36 responds to our first commitment by proposing to 
increase the maximum penalty for criminal harassment from five to 
ten years.  By increasing the current maximum penalty for criminal 
harassment from five to ten years, we are sending a strong message 
to would be stalkers that criminal harassment is a serious 
offence and its sentence will now better reflect the serious 
nature.  It also provides criminal justice personnel with a 
stronger sentencing tool to more appropriately respond to this 
type of conduct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to our second commitment relating to enhancing the 
enforcement of the criminal harassment provisions, I am pleased 
to note that, together with our federal, provincial and 
territorial counterparts, a handbook for police and crown 
prosecutors on criminal harassment was developed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The handbook provides a practical set of guidelines for criminal 
justice personnel on all aspects of a criminal harassment case, 
including victim safety.  The Department of Justice 
released the handbook in December of 1999.  I am pleased to note 
that well over 3,500 copies of the handbook have since been 
distributed across the country and are being used to assist with 
investigations, prosecution, sentencing and victim support in 
criminal harassment cases, as well as for training of criminal 
justice personnel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to note that Bill C-36's proposal to increase 
the maximum penalty for criminal harassment is built upon the 1997 
criminal harassment reforms introduced by the government.  These 
reforms strengthen the criminal harassment provisions by making 
murder committed in the course of stalking first degree murder, 
irrespective of whether the murder was planned and deliberate, 
where the offender intended to cause the victim to fear for her 
safety.  We also made the commission of a criminal harassment in 
breach of an existing protective court order an aggravating 
factor for sentencing purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will turn now to the problem of home invasions.  Hon. members 
may be aware that this phenomenon has achieved a growing 
prominence in the news media and in the minds of the public.  The 
term home invasion is generally described as a robbery or break 
and enter of a private residence when a perpetrator forces an 
entry while the occupants are home and threatens to use or uses 
violence against the occupants.  The criminal code offences most 
commonly used to address home invasions are robbery and break and 
enter of a dwelling, both of which carry a maximum penalty of 
life imprisonment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the statistical occurrence of home invasions is still low, 
these incidents have had a significant impact upon victims and 
result in residents feeling unsafe within their own homes.  The 
proposed amendments to the criminal code would indicate that 
where the offender's conduct was in the nature of a home 
invasion, the court must consider this to be an aggravating 
factor when determining the sentence to be imposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such an amendment would provide clear direction to the courts 
and would express parliament's view that home invasions are a 
grave form of criminal conduct which must be dealt with 
appropriately during the sentencing process.  This amendment also 
acknowledges that home invasions have a devastating impact on the 
victims of this type of crime and that the safety and security of 
Canadians within their own homes must be protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to outline changes that are being proposed to 
deal more effectively with alleged wrongful convictions.  The 
efficiency of any criminal justice system depends upon its 
ability to protect the innocent while bringing those who are 
guilty of crimes to justice.  Despite all the precautions that 
our justice system takes to avoid the conviction of an innocent 
person, no system is infallible.  Wrongful convictions can and 
regrettably do occur.  I need only mention the names of Donald 
Marshall, David Milgaard and Guy Paul Morin to make my point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In such cases, our entire justice system finds itself in 
disrepute.  That is why the minister has included in Bill C-36 
some very important improvements to section 690, conviction 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For many years now there have been calls for the reform of how 
cases involving alleged miscarriages of justice in Canada are 
handled.  Advocacy groups, such as the Association for the Defence 
of the Wrongfully Convicted, have repeatedly called for the repeal 
of section 690 and its replacement with an independent agency, 
like the criminal cases review commission in Great Britain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In April of 1998 the commission on proceedings involving Guy 
Paul Morin recommended that we should study the advisability of 
creating a criminal case review board to replace or supplement 
the current system.  Even before the Hon. Mr. Justice Kaufman's 
report was completed on the Morin matter, the Minister of Justice 
instructed her department to review the section 690 process and 
to make recommendations on how to improve this very important 
component of our justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In October of 1998 a public consultation paper was released 
seeking submissions on how the conviction review process could be 
improved.  The minister was searching for a fair and an efficient 
solution that balanced the principles of fairness, timeliness, 
openness and accountability.  As part of the consultation 
process, the minister met with members of the British commission. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1645"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT82"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT82"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1645
<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The British experience was completely different from ours and 
convinced the minister that a completely arm's length commission 
is unnecessary and not the best solution for Canada.  It is 
expensive, it is cumbersome, and although it was designed to 
handle many more applications than the number we receive in 
Canada, it has not yet solved the longstanding problem of delays 
and backlogs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After extensive consultations and review of all the submissions 
received from interested parties, the minister concluded that the 
ultimate decision making authority in criminal conviction review 
should remain with the federal Minister of Justice, who is 
accountable to parliament and to the people of Canada. The 
executive role of the Minister of Justice is ideally suited to 
the task of effective gatekeeping, that is, to recognize and 
maintain the traditional jurisdiction of the courts while 
providing a fair and just remedy in those exceptional cases that 
have somehow fallen through the cracks of the conventional 
justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I must add that the consultation process also 
convinced the minister that maintaining the status quo was 
certainly not an acceptable option.  Therefore, the proposed 
amendments to section 690 will provide new investigative powers 
to those investigating cases on the minister's behalf.  This will 
allow investigators to compel witnesses to testify and documents 
to be produced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to make the conviction review process more open and 
accountable, ministers of justice will now be required to provide 
an annual report to parliament, and a website will be created to 
give applicants information on the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past, section 690 reviews have been reserved for those 
who have been convicted of a serious indictable offence.  In 
recognition of the fact that any wrongful conviction is a 
miscarriage of justice which threatens public confidence in the 
justice system, conviction reviews will be expanded to allow for 
the review of any federal conviction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To create a greater degree of independence, a senior adviser 
from outside the department will be appointed to provide advice 
exclusively on cases of alleged wrongful conviction and oversee 
the review of applications.  That person will be in charge of a 
new multidisciplinary review unit which will include 
investigators as well as counsel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government believes that these amendments are the most 
efficient and effective way to improve the conviction review 
process in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me turn to the area of criminal procedure reform.  The 
Department of Justice has been working closely with the provinces 
and territories on criminal procedure reform for some time.  This 
work is now in its third phase.  The two previous phases were 
introduced as legislation, Bill C-42 in 1994 and Bill C-17 in 
1996, and are now in effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first two phases have been successful in assisting 
jurisdictions to manage resources more effectively in the 
criminal justice system.  Jurisdictions are now pressing to have 
the third phase translated into legislation.  It is the proposals 
of this third phase that are before the House now in Bill C-36. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objectives of phase three are to simplify trial procedure; 
modernize the criminal justice system and enhance efficiency 
through the increased use of technology; protect victims and 
witnesses in criminal trials; and provide speedy trials in 
accordance with the charter requirements. We are trying to bring 
criminal procedure into the 21st century.  This phase is an 
essential instalment in our efforts to modernize our procedure 
without in any way reducing the measure of justice provided by 
the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The criminal procedure reform amendments proposed in Bill C-36 
would retain the unconditional right to a preliminary inquiry for 
indictable offences on request, while modifying some procedural 
aspects of the inquiry.  For example, the proposal would create a 
new pre-preliminary hearing for the judge and the parties to 
attempt to determine the scope of the inquiry on a consensual 
basis, and would amend the criminal code to require the justice 
to prevent inappropriate questioning of witnesses at the 
preliminary inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would also change the rules of evidence applicable at the 
preliminary inquiry to allow the admission of evidence the 
justice considers credible or trustworthy.  It would create a 
limited defence disclosure obligation with regard to expert 
reports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would also facilitate the establishment of rules of court in 
relation to case management and preliminary inquiries. It would 
also facilitate the application of new technology such as the use 
of electronic documents to render the administration of justice 
more efficient and effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would expand the potential for remote appearances.  It would 
codify a plea comprehension inquiry scheme.  It would make it 
easier for the attorneys general to carry out the duty of 
supervising private prosecutions. It would place restrictions on 
the use of agents in criminal matters and allow for the selection 
of two jury alternates who would be on hand until the start of a 
trial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said at the outset, this package of reforms was developed 
in partnership with the provinces and territories.  They support 
these reforms.  As they are responsible for the administration of 
justice, I believe that we should do our best to give them the 
tools that they need to ensure the efficient and effective 
operation of the criminal justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, Bill C-36 includes amendments to the National Capital 
Act and the National Defence Act.

<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to make the National Capital Act consistent with other 
federal legislation and regulations, it is proposed that the 
maximum fine available for offences in regulations under the act 
be increased from $500 to $2,000.  This is the maximum fine 
currently provided in the criminal code for summary conviction 
matters.  The type of offences that this proposed change would 
target are relatively serious regulatory offences such as 
poaching of large game and illegal dumping of waste. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed amendments to the National Defence Act would allow 
for the taking of fingerprints and other information from persons 
charged with or convicted by court martial of designated service 
offences.  Designated service offences would be offences that are 
identical or substantially similar to offences for which 
civilians are currently subject to fingerprinting under the 
Identification of Criminals Act. This legislative authority is 
proposed to enable police forces to have access to the full 
criminal record of persons dealt with under the code of service 
discipline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would appreciate the support of all hon. members in the House 
in bringing forward these very worthwhile reforms. 
<P><A NAME="LINK303"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, finally Bill C-36 is up for second reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was first introduced in this place back in the spring. At 
that time the present whip of the Canadian Alliance, the hon. 
member for West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, was the justice critic 
for the official opposition.  He accused the government of 
pre-election posturing with this series of proposed amendments to 
the criminal code, a sort of omnibus bill so to speak.  At that 
time he stated that the bill could be passed in a couple of days 
if the government really wanted it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know, I have been actively involved with my critic 
responsibilities on Bill C-3, the youth criminal justice act. 
Youth justice has never appeared to be much of a priority to the 
government until this past week.  It is only when an election 
looms that the government feels the necessity to act and do 
something.  The government is not too interested in governing for 
the people. It is much more interested in being re-elected and 
staying in power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bill C-3 the government absolutely bypassed any reasoned 
contribution from the justice committee and almost overnight 
forced the legislation back to the House for report stage debate. 
The government House leader has been quoted widely about the 
potential costs of overtime of the House dealing with Bill C-3. 
However, he has been conspicuously silent about the costs 
incurred by his compelling our legal staff and clerks to work 
almost around the clock this past weekend in getting 3,133 
amendments to Bill C-3 ready for debate this past Monday. Somehow 
it was a priority for the government to deal with Bill C-3 on 
Monday morning, meaning that the amendments had to be filed with 
journals branch by early Friday afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We started debate on Monday, but the priority seems to have 
disappeared as we will not be debating Bill C-3 again for the 
rest of this week.  Talk about a waste of money. I will not even 
begin to get into the waste of money expended by the justice 
committee to review the bill and prepare amendments, only to have 
the government refuse to permit the committee to debate those 
amendments and present an improved version of the legislation to 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast sure called it 
when he suggested that Bill C-36 was little more than an election 
ploy.  It is an attempt to convince Canadians that the government 
is really interested in justice issues.  We have seen this action 
with the youth justice bill. It is only back on centre stage 
because an election is looming. I suggest that Bill C-36 is only 
getting time now for the same reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are decidedly weak on their justice platform. They 
merely need to prop up their image by claiming that youth justice 
laws would have been enacted except for the tactics of the 
opposition, specifically the Bloc. I suppose they will claim that 
Bill C-36 would also have been enacted but they ran out of time 
on their mandate because of other pressing issues, whatever they 
may be.  As I have already stated, that does not hold water as 
Bill C-36 could have been passed in a couple of days last spring. 
It could surely have been passed this fall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I expect that Bill C-36 will not be passed before the Prime 
Minister awakes some morning and, as he has said himself, hears 
his wife tell him to call an election.  He will then be able to 
retire in the spring and have all of next summer to get his golf 
game back in shape.  We did not hear much about his golfing 
exploits this past summer.  Unfortunately, we did not see him do 
much for Canadians either, other than overtax them and tell 
jokes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While there is not much to get too excited about with Bill C-36, 
I will briefly make some comments and raise some concerns.  As my 
time is rather limited, I am sure there will be other 
opportunities to discuss the pros and cons of this particular 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of the proposed changes to the law concern issues 
whereby the government made earlier changes to the law but either 
forgot or failed to properly consider all the aspects of those 
previous changes. 
In effect, the government is correcting some previous screw-ups.

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, there are a number of changes to the criminal code 
to include the Nunavut courts.  There was a bill in the first 
session of this parliament, Bill C-57, to deal with the Nunavut 
courts of justice but the government seems to have forgotten to 
include these aspects of the criminal code.  It certainly makes 
us wonder how much preparation and thought goes into bills before 
they reach the floor of the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has also dealt with making stalking an 
offence in Bill C-27 in the last parliament.  At that time it 
claimed that it was getting tough with stalkers of primarily 
women, but it is only now that it is open to increasing the 
maximum sentence for this offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One troubling aspect of the bill concerns changes to preliminary 
inquiries.  There are to be additional onuses placed upon the 
defence to provide disclosure of its case in respect of expert 
evidence.  The defence will be compelled to provide the names of 
its witnesses.  That is something entirely new.  I expect the 
defence bar will have much to say about this provision.  Charter 
applications will also be an issue.  It will be interesting to 
see whether the government will be forced to withdraw from its 
stand in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen how the government pays little consideration to the 
testimony obtained by the justice committee on Bill C-3.  I do 
expect that the government will be more apt to listen to the 
lawyers. It is not so apt to listen to ordinary everyday 
Canadians who comprise the bulk of persons interested in Bill 
C-3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague from Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough pointed out 
in his comments on Bill C-3 the other day, in Bill C-36 the 
government appears to be trying to limit the use of preliminary 
inquiries while at the same time through Bill C-3, it appears to 
be introducing the whole concept into the youth justice system. 
Talk about sucking and blowing at the same time; the government 
cannot have it both ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will also attract some attention over its amendments to 
section 690 applications under the criminal code. There has been 
much discussion about setting up an independent review agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice has retained a right of final decision 
on applications of wrongful conviction and I support her in this 
regard.  The minister must be held responsible and accountable 
for these cases.  She should not and must not relegate this duty 
to an independent agency.  It will be very interesting to see how 
lobby groups, et cetera attempt to sway her from this position. 
Again, it will also be interesting to see whether the government 
listens to the lawyers and persons of influence when it was not 
too interested in listening to laypersons pursuant to Bill C-3 on 
youth justice reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two components of the bill that will attract some public 
attention are those proposals dealing with home invasions and 
stalking.  The proposal to make a home invasion offence an 
aggravating factor certainly causes me to smile.  A year and a 
half ago, I moved a motion at justice committee after the premier 
and the attorney general of British Columbia had written to the 
minister requesting action on this issue.  In that motion I 
proposed the very course of action that the minister is now 
proposing, but the government was not interested.  In fact, one 
Liberal member of the committee referred to my initiative as 
silly and nothing more than political posturing.  Now it appears 
the government is claiming credit for the idea.  Somehow I do not 
believe it will see this as political posturing now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the law currently allows for more severe sanctions, 
this change will ensure that all of our courts clearly know that 
parliament wishes home invasions to be considered as serious 
attacks on the security and the lives of our citizens.  This 
should go without saying, but it appears that some of our courts 
require an occasional tune-up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem in this area is primarily systemic.  Our whole 
justice system must be readjusted so that our courts use the full 
extent of punishments available for violent crimes.  We have 
significant maximum punishments available for most offences but 
these maximums are seldom, if ever, utilized and imposed.  This 
is one of the primary reasons Canadians have become so 
disenchanted with the criminal justice process.  It also says 
something about the Prime Minister having sole authority to 
appoint judges to our superior courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note that in the spring the Minister of Justice was quite 
quick to lay claim to the fact that she is doubling the maximum 
potential punishment for stalkers.  This is the criminal offence 
of criminal harassment.  Stalkers are primarily male so this type 
of issue is readily recognized and supported by female voters in 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fully agree that stalking is an abominable crime and that we 
must protect all victims regardless of gender.  With all due 
respect, the government is not being entirely forthright on this 
issue.  The government is still maintaining the dual procedure 
nature of this offence.  The vast majority of offences are 
proceeded with by summary conviction where the maximum sentence 
is only six months in jail, a far cry from the 10 years maximum 
if proceeded with by indictment.  If the government really wanted 
to protect victims, it would change the law to make the offence a 
strictly indictable procedure. 
It would indicate to the courts that parliament considers 
criminal harassment a serious offence.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, the government seems to be sending the message that the 
offence may be serious, but it may not be so serious.  It may be 
indictable in some circumstances, but in most cases it is merely 
a summary offence.  This type of attitude does little to protect 
our women, who are the vast majority of victims of this form of 
crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some time ago a Vancouver family came to see me in my 
constituency office.  The estranged husband and father had 
harassed them for years.  The children are now grown.  There had 
been restraining order after restraining order, which he was 
careful not to violate.  The latest order was about to expire, 
and they came to me for some help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give an example of how manipulative this man is.  The 
family lives in the central area of the city of Vancouver. 
Successive restraining orders forbade him to be within a 25 block 
zone around their home.  The supermarket where they do their 
shopping is outside that zone.  The House can probably guess 
where I am going with this.  He would regularly show up in that 
store when the family members were there to shop.  He said 
nothing to them.  He did nothing to them.  He was just there.  He 
would also show up at school or social functions. Again, he would 
say and do nothing.  He was just there.  Can one imagine trying 
to function from day to day with this going on? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the restraining orders had fixed terms of two or three 
years.  Whenever one expired, like clockwork, within 24 hours, he 
would show up at their door.  The family members would be forced 
to apply for a new order, which required them to justify time and 
time again why such an order was required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately I could not offer them much help, other than to 
encourage them to keep the restraining orders in place and 
support their requests to the police and crown to examine the 
possibility of criminal charges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They contacted my office a few weeks ago because the latest 
order, the current order, was about to expire.  They wanted to 
let me know that the crown was going to try to bring criminal 
harassment charges, stalking charges, against this man.  I do not 
know the current status, but unfortunately the legislation before 
us will be too late to be of any profit to them.  Had the 
government not chosen to introduce this harassment legislation in 
the form of an omnibus bill, thereby clouding it with other 
issues, we could have had something for these folks already. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My time is limited and, as I said earlier, there will be other 
opportunities for discussion and debate.  I am not interested in 
holding up the legislation.  I have witnessed the dilatory 
actions of the government, and it needs no lessons from me when 
it comes to stalling on justice issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to dealing with the bill at the justice 
committee, but if the rumours of a potential announcement of an 
election are accurate, it appears once again the government is 
more interested in politics than in providing security and 
protection to our citizens.  It will be months, if ever, before 
the legislation actually comes to fruition. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK304"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise to speak to this bill because it concerns 
justice and I find very interesting what the Department of 
Justice is involved with these days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I always find it a bit comical, however, when I see this type of 
omnibus bill, which seems to be a catch-all affair.  It deals 
with a number of subjects—I would not dare to say in a not 
entirely serious manner—and mixes together a number of things.  I 
believe that, overall, this bill is perhaps a bit short on 
seriousness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened earlier to the parliamentary secretary telling us 
about Bill C-36, which we are examining.  There is one section 
on which he said nothing at all. 
I will remedy that quickly at the end of my speech, since it is 
a subject close to my heart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For our audience, I should explain that when I refer to an 
omnibus bill that touches upon a lot of different subjects, as 
we will see, the bill seeks to codify and clarify the review 
process for applications to the Minister of Justice with respect 
to allegations of miscarriage of justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same bill also seeks to increase the maximum penalty for 
criminal harassment.  Then, in the same bill, there is reference 
to making home invasions an aggravating circumstance for 
sentencing purposes.  And it goes on to address the procedural 
aspects of preliminary inquiries, the disclosure of expert 
evidence, rules of court in relation to preliminary inquiries. 
It will even address electronic documents and remote 
appearances, private prosecutions and the selection of jurors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is, I think, a bill that is going to solve certain problems 
here and there, but lumping them together is not necessarily 
going to solve the problem. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1705"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT85"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is certainly not accelerating the settlement process. On 
this, I may be echoing the member for the Canadian Alliance. 
Some parts of the bill could probably have been dealt with 
outside the omnibus bill, and those matters requiring a more 
in-depth consideration could have be dealt with much more 
quickly. We would certainly have achieved much quicker results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all I have mentioned, there is one aspect missing in the 
summary. This might explain why the government member did not 
say a word about this. It has to do with Bill C-3, the young 
offenders bill. While it has yet to be passed by the House, this 
bill is already amending it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will come back to this because I find it quite exceptional. I 
do not know what kind of country this is, but where I come from, 
we would say that they are putting the cart before the horse. It 
may be necessary to dot the <I>i's</I> and cross the <I>t's</I>, and I will do 
so in my speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will first talk about the judicial errors. When reading the 
bill, we can actually notice an improvement in the review 
procedures. It is obvious. Greater openness is sought. I think 
an effort is made to speed the process. Perhaps the government 
is trying to make it more accessible. But is it trying to make 
it more transparent? I might say that I really doubt it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any case, there is evidence of openness and of the desire to 
modernize the criminal code. 
Nowadays, with the new DNA tools available, when we want to 
present evidence that could not have been gathered previously, 
we realize that the justice system is not perfect. Throughout 
the years, there were some dreadful miscarriages of justice. 
People found guilty of criminal offences spent 20 or 25 years in 
prison before their lawyers were able, thanks to modern day 
techniques, to prove their innocence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process used to be rather cumbersome. With Bill C-36, the 
government wants to improve the process and make it more 
accessible, which is a good thing and deserves to be examined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, I want to congratulate my hon. colleague from 
Repentigny, who introduced a private member's bill to speed up 
the compensation process for these people. 
I do not know if his bill is what prompted the government to 
act, but it could not have come at a better time and both pieces 
of legislation go in the same direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government would be well advised to go a little further, as 
the member for Repentigny proposes to do, to compensate these 
people as soon as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if, at first glance, no one can be against the bill 
introduced by the minister, the fact remains that the minister 
wears two hats, one as Minister of Justice and the other as 
Attorney General of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if the government understands the system as I do, 
but at first glance, there appears to be a potential for a 
conflict of interest involving the two hats on the same head. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice has a lot of power and many 
jurisdictions, but she is the protector of the Canadian Charter 
of Rights and Freedoms, among other things.  The attorney 
general has a responsibility to examine irregularities in 
proceedings.  It is sort of as if one works to condemn and the 
other to check that everything is fine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the very face of this we can see a potential conflict of 
interest.  If I were going to amend the criminal code, I would 
have done it all and set up a real independent commission, which 
would be accountable to parliament. 
Accordingly, the minister would still be wearing these two hats, 
but at least, we would ask her to try to correct an injustice 
caused by one of her hats, to put it clearly.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand the government member who said he examined 
this whole possibility, that the department existed in Great 
Britain. He mentioned Great Britain as an example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This may do 
nothing to speed things up, but at least we have the impression 
that justice has been served.  It is very important in a matter 
in which an individual did not obtain justice to have some 
procedure to follow when a request is made to have the file 
re-examined, when there is an error in law and justice is served 
the second time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Law and politics are pretty much the same thing: public 
perception is very important. 
It bothers me that the same person who sentences someone can 
also grant a pardon, or that the person who sentences can assess 
the case to determine whether there was a miscarriage of 
justice. For this alone, it would be important to send this bill 
to the justice committee. The situation would be examined, 
questions would be asked, and we would try to improve this bill 
and the amendments introduced by the minister in Bill C-36. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the whole issue of criminal harassment. The only 
solution the government has found is to increase the maximum 
penalty from five to ten years. At some point, the government 
will have to stop and look at the problem in Canada. What is the 
problem in Canada? It is not only by increasing penalties that 
the problem of crime will be solved. This is too easy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is too easy to say “We have a problem because of criminal 
harassment and we will solve it by increasing the penalty from 
five to ten years. The problem has been solved. Since the people 
sentenced for criminal harassment will spend more time in jail, 
we have solved the problem”. Well, no. The problem has not been 
solved. It has only been put off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that the Minister of Justice does not want to 
listen to a nasty separatist. In her opinion, I must be a rare 
species coming from who knows where, because what we are saying 
is never good enough for the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that she is from western Canada, that there is an 
extremely strong right wing in western Canada, and that the 
minister, who probably wants to keep her seat in an upcoming 
election, has decided to listen to this right wing from western 
Canada to reinforce any legislation at the first opportunity. 
At some point, however, we will end up with a criminal code that 
will be no fun to apply and that may become a burden for the 
state, precisely because the emphasis has been put on 
incarceration, when it is not the solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I keep repeating it in this House, I keep explaining it in every 
possible way, even with drawings, but the minister just does not 
get it. She does not want to hear any of that. She only listens 
to western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister does not want to listen to me, a Bloc Quebecois 
member, a Quebec MP, let me quote a supreme court decision, as I 
did during oral question period. I do hope that she pays a 
little more attention to what supreme court justices say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a fairly recent landmark decision, the supreme court dealt 
directly with what is going on in Canada regarding 
incarceration. Unfortunately, I do not have the specifics, but I 
can provide them later to those hon. members who are interested 
in this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a unanimous decision, the court said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a world leader in many fields, particularly in the 
areas of progressive social policy and human rights. 
</UL>
<That is the positive part.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, our country is also distinguished as being a 
world leader in putting people in prison. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not so flattering.  They go on: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the United States has by far the highest rate of 
incarceration among industrialized democracies, at over 600 
inmates per 100,000 population, Canada's rate of approximately 
130 places it second or third highest.  Moreover, the rate at 
which Canadian courts have been imprisoning offenders has risen 
sharply in recent years, although there has been a slight 
decline of late.   This record of incarceration rates obviously 
cannot instil a sense of pride. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the words, not of a separatist, but of the justices of 
the Supreme Court of Canada.  I trust the minister listens 
attentively to these justices.  She needs to listen to them, not 
just to the right in the Canadian west.  The court continues: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Notwithstanding its idealistic origins, imprisonment quickly 
came to be condemned as harsh and ineffective, not only in 
relation to its purported rehabilitative goals, but also in 
relation to its broader public goals. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They go on: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Criminal Code displays an apparent bias toward the use of 
incarceration— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stop here for an aside which is that, with all the changes by 
the government, there is no longer any doubt.  The belief is 
that there is a bias toward incarceration.  Incarceration, 
increasingly, is the favoured approach of the government as 
well.  I continue: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—since for most offences the penalty indicated is expressed in 
terms of a maximum term of imprisonment. A number of 
difficulties arise if imprisonment is perceived to be the 
preferred sanction for most offences. Perhaps most significant 
is that although we regularly impose this most onerous and 
expensive sanction, it accomplishes very little apart from 
separating offenders from society for a period of time. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister, who finds herself with a problem of criminal 
harassment, will not resolve it by increasing the sentence from 
five to ten years.  That is very clear and I hope she has got 
the message.  I see that time is running out and I will go 
immediately to my final point, which is a very important one for 
me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I saw Bill C-36, I pointed out immediately that I was not 
very fond of omnibus bills.  I do not have much use for them.  I 
think that the government is getting it off its plate quickly. 
However, I noticed that in clause 71 of the omnibus bill the 
government wanted to amend Bill C-3, a bill that has not yet 
been passed.  It wants to amend a bill with 3,133 amendments 
when we have only begun to consider the first group of 
amendments.  Worse still, a look at the background of Bill C-3 
shows that it was introduced on October 14, 1999 and that it 
contains 198 clauses to criminalize young people in conflict 
with the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 8, 2000, the government introduced Bill C-36, which 
includes amendments to Bill C-3. 
On September 25, the same minister who introduced the bill on 
October 14, 1999 and who amended the bill on June 8, 2000 
through amendments in an omnibus Bill, that is Bill C-36, tabled 
170 amendments to a bill containing 198 clauses.  There is a 
problem and the problem is the person running the Department of 
Justice.

political motives, and I am sure that that will play a trick on 
the justice minister in a very near future. I am convinced she 
will pay a heavy political price for doing what she is doing 
with legislation as important as the youth justice bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments to the bill proposed by the minister are not 
simple amendments. They are about the rights of young people, 
the right to explain to them what is a plea of guilty and a plea 
of not guilty, to inform them about their right to a trial by 
judge and jury, to inform them about adult sentences. 
Those are not minor changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, the minister wants us to pass Bill C-36 even before a 
decision is made on Bill C-3. She wants us to examine and pass 
Bill C-36, before the House has passed a single one of the 3,133 
amendments that are before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary, who has just spoken for the 
minister, strangely enough, did not speak about Bill C-3. He has 
probably not seen that in his bill. I say no. They are trying to 
hide things, hoping the opposition will not see them. But the 
opposition has seen them. They were caught red-handed.

my colleagues could say more about the minister. For my part, I 
will only say that she was caught red-handed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the bill on young offenders really all about? Why is the 
minister so determined to change the legislation? Why does she 
want to deprive Quebec of the current act, which is working 
well? Of course things can always be improved but we were able 
to do some great things in the last few years with the current 
act. Successes must be taken into account too, not only 
failures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I see a 30 year old man totally integrated into society, an 
ordinary citizen who has children, pays taxes and contributes to 
his community, and know that he committed murder when he was 
young, I think that we have succeeded. 
If we did, it is because we applied the Young Offenders Act 
correctly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the major differences between that act and Bill C-3? 
Basically, in Quebec the Young Offenders Act is applied with a 
focus on the needs of young offenders. We examine the specific 
needs of the young boy or girl who has a problem with crime, 
because we believe that by answering his or her needs with the 
help of experts, we can turn him or her into an ordinary citizen 
in a few years. That girl or boy can be rehabilitated and that 
is good for society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the Young Offenders Act, let us make no mistake, that 
focuses all the jargon, all the philosophy of the legislation on 
young people's special needs, while Bill C-3, which the minister 
is trying to ram down our throat—and fortunately the Bloc 
Quebecois was there and used every parliamentary weapon 
available to block the bill in committee and now in this House 
so it may never see the light of day—what is its focus?  It 
focuses on the severity of the offence.  A young person will be 
treated this way or that according to the severity of the 
sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the whole issue of serious crime.  Murder is 
serious, it is true.  There are always too many, but in the case 
of serious crime, as the minister's bill provides at the moment, 
a youth of 14 could be sentenced as an adult.  That means that a 
youth of 14 could go to prison for life.  That makes no sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that life imprisonment is for about 25 years.  It is 25 
years even with parole but let us say 25.  Now 25 plus 14 
makes 39.

<A HREF="#LINKT89"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this youth comes out of prison he could still be 
productive.  I do not know what he will have learned at prison 
u. Not the right things, I am sure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister wants to incarcerate 14 year old youths, to put 
children in prison.  However, on the subject of organized crime, 
the Hells Angels, the Rock Machines and all those gangs, the 
minister will not touch anything.  These people have rights. 
The minister has chosen organized crime instead of protecting 
young people, and this is a bit of a scandal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about similarity of sentences.  The minister said we 
could do whatever we want in Quebec. 
If this is true, let the minister put it in black and white in 
her Bill C-3 and we will pass it on the same day. Let the 
minister say that Quebec can continue to apply the Young 
Offenders Act as it has been doing successfully for years and 
her Bill C-3 will be passed on the same day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister knows full well that what she is saying is not 
true. It is not reflected in her bill. The harmonization of 
sentencing, among other things, is an aberration. We will not be 
able to treat our young people like we want. Western Canada will 
tell us how to raise our children in Quebec. Thanks but no, we 
are not interested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the numerous amendments that she just tabled on September 25 
and which she probably forgot to include on October 14 or June 
8, the minister tells us about the regional harmonization of 
sentences. 
What does the minister mean by region? Is my region of 
Lanaudière part of her definition of “region” when it comes to 
the harmonization of sentences? Are the maritimes a region? Is 
the centre of Quebec a region? Is British Columbia a region? The 
minister will leave that to the interpretation of the courts. It 
is as if the minister was short of ideas. We will give her ideas 
the next time. She should consult us first. Harmonizing 
sentences does not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there are the delays. If there is something that could be 
improved on in the Young Offenders Act it is this issue. I have 
always said that if we want to amend the Young Offenders 
Act—because I never said that this act was untouchable, that it 
was perfect—we should begin with the issue of delays. 
Delays must be shortened so that a young person who commits an 
offence is punished immediately, or brought into the system 
immediately.  If there is a gang or family problem, it should be 
possible to take him away from his gang or family immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the minister doing about this?  She is increasing the 
number of steps: appearances, preliminary investigations, 
discovery, selection of judge and jury, trial, decision and 
sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Someone who is a hardened criminal, who has just committed a 
rape, a serious crime, and who has opted for judge and jury, as 
any lawyer will suggest that he do, and is found guilty, will be 
sentenced after a year and a half or two years, in the best case 
scenario, so that there is zero cause and effect.  The minister 
has done nothing about this either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the complexity of the bill. 
I can understand that the minister has amended the bill three 
times in less than 12 months.  The bill is incomprehensible.  It 
is complex.  Even the experts who appeared before the committee 
have said so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, I could say a lot more.  The last time I spoke, I went 
on for 27 and a half hours.  I think that if I were to seek 
unanimous consent to continue, it would not be granted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply wish to say that, for all these reasons and many more 
as well, we will not be supporting the bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from June 9 consideration of the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Before recognizing 
the hon. member for Edmonton North, let me indicate that this is 
a votable item.  The hon. member for Kamloops, Thompson and 
Highland Valleys has asked me to advise members of the House and 
those watching these proceedings on television that the vote will 
not take place at the end of the hour of debate tonight but has 
been deferred until the end of government business on Tuesday, 
which is normally around 5.30 in the afternoon, eastern time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK308"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I know we have had a busy day talking about the Marine 
Conservation Areas Act, mines and all kinds of other things.  In 
private members' business tonight I want to address the motion of 
the member for Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, Motion 
No. 259, which reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should give 
consideration to exempting up to $30,000 of income from income 
tax as a gesture of support for those artists, writers and 
performers who work in Canada's cultural industry. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the member for bringing the motion forward.  It 
certainly bears discussion.  We need to celebrate our arts 
community in the country for sure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members of my family are artists.  As members know, I 
taught in the high school system in the department of English and 
love to see people who spend some time writing and in the 
performing arts.  It is a wonderful heritage for us as Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member's proposal that the motion would give fledgling 
artists, writers and performers a tax break to keep them in their 
chosen line of work is noble.  The reasoning is that due to the 
economically unstable nature of their profession artists often 
live at or below the poverty line.  The NDP cites the average 
income of Canadian artists as $13,000 a year.  I am not sure 
where the member gets his statistics, but I know he will 
enlighten me on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we start singling out this sector or that sector for tax 
breaks, it makes it very difficult and puts us all at different 
levels as to who pays what marginal rate of tax or what their 
personal income tax will be.  As hon. members know, we already 
have several rates as it is: 17%, 21%, 29%, and those in the 
higher income brackets pay as much as 50% in tax, which is a 
little difficult to stomach for anyone in any industry, frankly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am thrilled to say our Alliance policy would give tax breaks 
to everybody, not just the rich, whom we always get accused of 
supporting.  I would challenge any government member to stand 
here when I am finished and say I support tax cuts only for the 
rich. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me use artists as an example.  The NDP has cited that they 
make $13,000 a year.  It is scandalous that they would pay any 
federal income tax at all.  The basic exemption now is around 
$7,000, I believe.  Under our program the basic exemption to any 
taxpayer would be $10,000 and then the spousal equivalent would 
be another $10,000.  As I understand it now, $5,000 or $6,000 is 
the basic income exemption for the spousal equivalent.  Our 
program, solution 17, would up that to $10,000 and then $3,000 
per child to be exempt from that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us use the example of two kids and two adults in a family 
earning $26,000.  They would not pay a dime of federal income 
tax.  That is a marvellous release for people in the artistic 
community or anywhere else.  Hon. members can hardly say that is 
a tax break just for the rich.  I really do not think anyone in 
the Chamber would have the nerve to say $26,000 would be helping 
the rich.  Surely not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see this as a marvellous tax relief for people, and we would 
see broad based tax relief certainly for artists in our 
communities.  Moreover, for people they deal with—their family 
members, their extended family members, and those people who 
would buy their art, go see their performing art, or read their 
writings—the economic spinoff in that would be far more exciting 
than just the proposal in Motion No. 259. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should think about people who purchase art.  In fact I just 
had someone in my office who works with an arts stabilization 
program, who had great ideas of private-public funding to say we 
want stabilized programs, stabilized funding for the arts, but to 
make sure there is accountability, to make sure government money 
is not just being shovelled into whatever project it is with no 
accountability.

<A HREF="#LINKT91"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I met with the director of the Canada Council for the Arts, 
Shirley Thomson, this week in my office.  She is very keen on 
making sure any grants that go out from the Canada council are 
subject to accountability and that a small percentage of 
government funding goes into this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These artists certainly need to be celebrated for their works, 
but we cannot just say we will pay the whole shot.  It is wise 
that we look at private-public partnerships for some of that 
funding.  I am sure the member who put the motion forward would 
feel exactly the same way, that it would be only responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me again mention that people who are in the business of art 
would be able to celebrate capital gains savings through our tax 
plan.  Also, regarding business taxes such as employment 
insurance and Canada pension, if they are paying their own 
premiums or if they are working for someone else and someone is 
paying payroll taxes for them, their particular EI premiums would 
be much lower than they are now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was going to say I watch with amusement, but it is with almost 
pity and sadness that I see government members today trying to 
say they will put back all the money they stripped and slashed 
out of EI, for which they got their heads kicked in, in the 
election in 1997.  The marvel of it is that they want it through 
the House of Commons, and in one sitting day. Is it not something 
that this twinge of conscience would hit them days before a writ? 
It just has to be irony, and I find it very strange that the 
timing would be such, but what in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely we have to look at that and say we would decrease the EI 
rates to $2 from $2.40.  I know it was much higher than that. 
Yes, we do have to give government members a shred of credit and 
say they have brought it down some.  It is pretty hard to sit on 
a $12 billion egg of surplus and not be smitten by conscience for 
some of the things they did in the past.  The Prime Minister or 
anyone else on the government side would say they have a burning 
desire to help people whom they cut and kicked earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Witness the health care accord just signed a couple of weeks 
ago.  If we look at the numbers, it is a very strange thing 
again.  The government has pulled out, slashed, and burned about 
$21 billion in health care transfer payments to the provinces 
since it came in in 1993.  What do we think the health accord 
signed a couple of weeks ago said?  They are to put about $21 
billion back into the health care system.  That was just a pure 
accident as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the artists and employment insurance.  It is true 
that rates moving down to $2 would be very helpful to them.  That 
to me is exciting.  A single rate of tax would eliminate the 5% 
surtax, which would again give a tax savings of $762 million to 
all Canadians.  That would help the artistic community a whole 
lot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me also say that under the current income tax system there 
already are some tax breaks for artists.  They may deduct the 
cost of creating a work of art in the year in which the costs are 
incurred instead of when the work is sold.  Of course that is 
when the bulk of work goes into an artistic piece, when the 
artist is working on it.  The artist may be able to defer those 
costs.  Also, employed artists and musicians can deduct certain 
expenses against their employment income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could look at mechanics.  My husband Lou is a carpenter. 
Anyone who came to our shop would see how unbelievably much 
equipment goes into that industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are just begging for tax relief.  If we come up with 
broad based tax relief right across the country, to every sector, 
not just cherry-picking this sector or that sector, all of us 
will be a lot better off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are already programs funded by the taxpaying public to 
help this sector, artists, although they too are not terribly 
accountable or transparent.  I am trying to have some briefings 
and meetings with many of these groups.  Certainly there needs to 
be some overhaul, but there are granting agencies in place.  I 
mentioned earlier the Canada council, the cultural initiatives 
program and the National Film Board, just to name a few.  I am 
sure I could go through the estimates and really go at it in 
terms of government funding that goes into it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I certainly do support the artistic community and all 
the wonderful things artists do in supporting Canadian heritage, 
I think the best way to help them would be not just to have this 
particular proposal of a $30,000 exemption, but when we form 
government to have broad based tax relief.  That would help those 
people probably more than anyone else on a relative scale. 
<P><A NAME="LINK309"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Public 
Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the motion 
brought before us by the member for Kamloops, Thompson and 
Highland Valleys proposes that the first $30,000 per year earned 
by artists, writers and performers be tax exempt.  The government 
recognizes and applauds the intent behind the motion.  The motion 
underscores the importance of Canadian culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the way it shapes our lives, culture tells us who we 
were in the past and who we are in the present.  Inevitably it 
also influences who we are likely to become in the future. 
Culture is a force that drives our unique development as 
individuals and as a nation.  The government remains committed to 
providing continued support to individuals engaged in our 
cultural industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the 1950s the involvement of the federal government has 
gradually evolved to include a variety of roles in response to 
the expansion of cultural activity and its growing social and 
economic impact.  Cultural development in Canada is a partnership 
among the private sector, individuals, corporations and all 
orders of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By looking back, one can see the emergence of distinctive 
Canadian approaches to supporting culture.  In recent years it 
has been identified as the Canadian model of cultural 
affirmation.  It emphasizes partnerships with other governments, 
organizations and the private sector.  Most important it is an 
approach to government that uses a mix of the most effective 
measures available to it, recognizing that circumstances and 
situations are constantly shifting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ensuring a thriving economy in which individuals and businesses 
earn more income and keep more of the income they earn is perhaps 
the most important way to support our cultural industries.  Not 
only does such an environment provide better economic 
circumstances for artists, writers and performers directly, it 
also gives individuals and businesses more opportunities to 
support these professions by increasing their ability to acquire 
their products.  Just as important, it recognizes the partnership 
we share with other governments, organizations and the private 
sector in supporting those cultural industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The broad based tax relief provided in the 1998, 1999 and 2000 
budgets will help support economic growth and ensure that all 
Canadians keep more of the income they earn.  With the books 
balanced in 1997-98, the 1998 and 1999 federal budgets introduced 
broad based tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This tax relief was proportionately larger for low and modest 
income Canadians.  It included an increase of $675 in the amount 
that can be earned tax free for all Canadians, elimination of the 
3% general surtax and a $2 billion increase in the Canada child 
tax benefit, for a total benefit of $7 billion annually. The 
actions taken in the 1998 and 1999 federal budgets have removed 
600,000 low income Canadians from the federal tax rolls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of these actions, taxpayers including artists, 
writers and performers will have their federal income taxes 
reduced on average by about 10%.  Total personal income tax 
relief provided in the 1997, 1998 and 1999 budgets amounted to 
$7.5 billion annually or 10% of the $76.9 billion paid in 
personal income taxes in the years 1999-2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has continued to build on these important tax 
reduction efforts.  In the fall of 1999 the government promised 
Canadians in the Speech from the Throne and the economic and 
fiscal update that it would set out a multi-year plan to further 
reduce taxes. The 2000 budget set out such a plan, including the 
most important structural changes to the federal tax system in 
more than a decade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The plan will immediately restore full indexation of the 
personal income tax system to protect taxpayers against automatic 
tax increases caused by inflation.  This will benefit every 
Canadian.  It also reduces the middle income tax rate to 23% from 
26%, starting with a two point reduction to 24% in July 2000. 
This will cut taxes for nine million Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Additional key personal income tax measures of the plan will 
increase the amount that Canadians can earn tax free to at least 
$8,000, and the amount at which the middle and top tax rates 
apply to at least $35,000 and $70,000 respectively.  It will also 
enrich the Canada child tax benefit by $2.5 billion a year by 
2004 to more than $9 billion annually.  Maximum benefits will 
reach $2,400 for the first child and $2,200 for the second child.

<A HREF="#LINKT93"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This plan will also eliminate as of July 1, 2000, the 5% deficit 
surtax on middle income Canadians with incomes up to about 
$85,000 and completely eliminate it by the year 2004.  It will 
also raise to 25% for the year 2000 and to 30% for the year 2001 
the permissible foreign content of investment, registered 
retirement pension plans and registered retirement savings plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The plan will mean more money in the pockets of Canadians. Taxes 
will be reduced by a cumulative amount of at least $58 billion 
over five years.  Personal income taxes will be reduced by an 
average of 15% annually by 2004-05.  Low and middle income 
Canadians will see their personal income taxes reduced by an 
average of 18%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to these broad based measures that assist our unique 
partnership approach to supporting cultural industries, the tax 
system also features several specific measures intended to target 
support to that cultural sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, to enhance the exposure given to works by Canadian 
artists, Canadian art objects purchased by businesses for display 
purposes are eligible for a generous depreciation allowance 
notwithstanding that such art objects may retain their value over 
time or even appreciate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the designation of the national art service organization 
provides not for profit arts groups with a tax treatment 
equivalent to that of charities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, to reduce liquidity and valuation difficulties, artists 
may deduct the cost of creating work in the year incurred even 
though the work may not be sold until a later date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, to ensure that the artists are not deterred from 
donating their works to charities, museums and other public 
institutions, artists may value charitable gifts from their 
inventory at an amount up to their fair market value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, employed artists and musicians may deduct certain 
expenses against income from employment notwithstanding that most 
employment expenses are not deductible.  Specifically, employed 
artists may deduct expenses related to artistic endeavours up to 
an annual—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
hate to be picky at a time like this, but it would be possible 
for us simply not to conclude the debate on it.  The hon. 
member's item would stay on the order of precedence and come up 
again for the final portion of debate at a future date in the 
normal order, or otherwise if the parties came to an agreement on 
it.  That would be a reasonable disposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only other disposition is to allow the debate to conclude 
and go to a vote, as had been previously ordered by the House. 
Perhaps the hon. member could give us his view.  I am sure the 
rest of the House would accept the member's view on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleague's 
comments.  I know that there are others who wish to speak to this 
motion.  Rather than deny them the opportunity to speak, I would 
certainly accept the suggestion that we adjourn the debate at 
this point and pick it up at an appropriate time some time in the 
future.  I know that is probably not the correct parliamentary 
term.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  I 
would like to know exactly where we stand, because this motion 
is already deemed to have been put and the vote deferred until 
next Tuesday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is already deemed to have been put, how can we now drop it 
and resume debate?  It would be necessary to go back on an 
earlier decision.  I seek clarification, so that we 
do not get caught. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The motion being 
deemed put would only come into effect at the conclusion of 
debate.  Since it has been suggested by the hon. member for 
Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys that we adjourn the 
debate, the deemed motion would not come into effect and we would 
be okay in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there unanimous consent for the hon. member for Kamloops, 
Thompson and Highland Valleys to move a motion that the debate be 
adjourned? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed.
