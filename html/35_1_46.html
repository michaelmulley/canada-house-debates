	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should honour the 
contribution made by those who served Canada's armed forces during World 
War II at the Dieppe raid by striking a distinctive medal for Canadian veterans 
of this battle.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin this morning by 
thanking all the hon. members who formally seconded my 
motion. As you may be aware, Mr. Speaker, there is a procedure 
by which members can formally second a motion and up to 20 
members may second any motion. I had more than I needed. I 
had 20 and others who wanted to get on the list. I would also like 
to particularly thank my colleagues this morning, the member 
for Kamloops and the member for Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing 
who are here to second my motion as it got on the floor.
<P>
	The motion today is to right a wrong which has been felt by 
veterans of the Dieppe raid for a long, long time. It is the 
absence of any distinctive recognition of their participation in 
that particular raid.
<P>
	I begin by reminding the House that in the summer of 1942, 
when the Axis powers were at their peak and threatening world 
domination, 5,000 Canadian soldiers willingly participated in a 
raid on the occupied French coastal town of Dieppe, France. 
Operation Jubilee, as it was known, proved to be an allied plan 
that had catastrophic and at the same time critical results for 
future allied plans.
<P>
	The catastrophe was 959 Canadian soldiers killed, 1,200 
wounded and 1,900 more taken as prisoners. No other battle in 
the history of the second world war had similar consequences all 
in a single day: August 19, 1942.
<P>
	Despite the horrific losses there were significant lessons 
learned from the raid. This painfully gained knowledge proved 
crucial to the success of the D-Day planning in 1944. Without 
the sacrifices of August 1942 many believe that the success of 
the Normandy landings would have been in serious jeopardy.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	This year we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the D-Day 
invasion. In 1992 we celebrated the 50th anniversary of the 
Dieppe raid. At that time I had the privilege of participating in 
the pilgrimage to Dieppe, which took place alongside the 
pilgrimage to Vimy when we were celebrating the 75th 
anniversary of the battle of Vimy Ridge.
<P>
	I also had the honour, thanks to the then Minister of Veterans 
Affairs, of playing the lament at the Dieppe cemetery. The 
privilege was afforded to me by the minister as a result of my 
own service in the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders of 
Canada stationed in Winnipeg at Minto Armouries.
<P>
	I say this by way of a little personal history. I first became 
aware and conscious of the Dieppe raid when I was very young 
as a member of The Cameron Cadets in Winnipeg and later as a 
member of the militia unit, the Queen's Own Cameron 
Highlanders of Canada where I served in a pipe band for many 
years.
<P>
	One of the people who instructed me at that time, Pipe Major 
Alec Graham, was a piper at Dieppe and one of the people who 
played the pipes on the landing craft as they came into the beach 
at Pourville where The Camerons along with the South 
Saskatchewan Regiment landed.
<P>
	I have had the opportunity of being at Pourville and of seeing 
the beach and the conditions under which The Camerons and the 
South Saskatchewan landed. I also saw the main beach where the 
Essex Scottish and the Fusiliers de Mont-Royal landed and the 
beach at Puys where the Royal Regiment of Canada landed and 
took the heaviest casualties of any regiment ever in one day in 
Canadian history.
<P>
	Dieppe was a particularly tragic event, as many more 
Canadians are aware of today than they might have been just a 
while ago thanks to the television series on Dieppe. Regardless 
of what one might think of the events and the interpretation of 
events, certainly there is no question that many young 
Canadians were tragically killed, wounded or captured in that 
battle.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2824"> 2824 </A></B>
<P>
	It is only fitting at this time that the government should move 
to do what many have been asking it to do for years, to strike a 
distinctive medal for those who have participated in the Dieppe 
raid.
<P>
	I might say in anticipation of what the arguments might be 
that Canada now has the power to award its own medals even 
though at the time during the second world war and 
subsequently we were part of the Commonwealth system of 
honours and medals. Since 1968 we have had the ability to 
award our own medals as we did only recently with respect to the 
gulf war. I hope I am not going to hear from people on the other 
side that this is something beyond the capability of a sovereign 
country like Canada to do if it so chooses.
<P>
	I want to indicate at some point that I will try to seek 
unanimous consent for this motion to be voted on and agreed 
upon even though it has not been chosen as a votable motion. We 
know that the House can do this with private members' motions 
if the members so choose. I have not had anybody say to me that 
this is a bad idea. I have had nothing but letters from various 
members of Parliament from all sides of the House saying that 
the motion should pass. I have had people eager to second it.
<P>
	I hope we will not see a government member get up with notes 
prepared by the Department of Veterans Affairs or whatever to 
give the contrary argument and say no at the end when we ask for 
unanimous consent to have the motion passed.
<P>
	I remind members, particularly those on the government side 
who may have been asked to do this, this is not a binding motion. 
It is not a bill. It is a motion and if it passes it would simply give 
the government ammunition, if you like, in trying to go ahead. It 
would help to create momentum. It would give a government 
that wanted to do this the ability to say: ``We do this with the 
expressed and unanimous backing of the House of Commons''. I 
do not see any good reason, other than a sort of small 
mindedness with respect to the fact that I am not a government 
member, or whatever the case may be, for not allowing the 
motion to go ahead.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	Another argument might be advanced. I hope the argument 
will not be offered, but I have heard it in private conversation, 
that Canadian medals have tended to be awarded on the basis of 
campaigns rather than battles.
<P>
	One will find if the records and the situations are examined 
that this still leaves room and can be used to argue for a 
distinctive Dieppe medal because participants in the Dieppe raid 
did not receive, as I understand it, the campaign medal that 
many other veterans received, the France-Germany medal. This 
medal was not awarded to them because they did not participate 
in the events in France and Germany following the D-Day 
invasion.
<P>
	At one point they did receive a campaign medal which would 
have satisfied their desire to be recognized. They were awarded 
a 1939-43 star but that later was revoked for reasons that no one 
seems to be able to come up with. It was extended and made the 
1939-45 star which offers no particular recognition to those who 
participated in events like Dieppe before the Normandy 
invasion.
<P>
	All the Dieppe veterans are asking for is something which 
recognizes they were part of that campaign and in this case a 
particular event that was central to the pre-Normandy 
campaign. They do not have that. They have been asking for it 
and I simply ask how long do they have to wait? Time marches 
on, as the old hymn that is used at Remembrance Day services, 
``Abide with Me'' says: Time like an ever rolling stream bears 
all its sons away. Time is bearing all the veterans of Dieppe 
away as it will bear all of us away some day.
<P>
	Therefore, in this year of remembering when there are so 
many brochures and pamphlets from Veterans Affairs and 
elsewhere, all of which are appropriate, why today can we not do 
something concrete, not expensive and something which will 
bring Canadians together.
<P>
	One thing that struck me when I was at Dieppe and had struck 
me before at Canadian war cemeteries is that row on row, no 
distinction is made between veterans of the Fusiliers de 
Mont-Royal or the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders of 
Winnipeg. Canadians of French, British and other origins lie 
side by side in Canadian war cemeteries. It ought to be 
mandatory for every member of Parliament to visit these 
cemeteries and to get a tragic sense but nevertheless some pride 
of the unity with which Canadians have fought in World War II 
and before that in World War I.
<P>
	I know there are others eager to speak on this. I hope we can 
do this. Certainly there is precedent for motions like this passing 
which have had no expressed opposition. I have a letter from the 
minister saying the government is intent on some form of 
recognition for Dieppe veterans. I say that the form of 
recognition the Dieppe veterans want and that the Dieppe 
veterans deserve is this medal. They do not want a picnic. They 
do not want some kind of special event. They want what they are 
asking for.
<P>
	I hope the government will use this opportunity, which is 
Private Members' Business after all. We do not have on the other 
side an emissary for the government to talk this bill out or to 
deny unanimous consent. It would be a tragedy and a travesty as 
far as Private Members' Business is concerned. I have not yet 
heard a private member say he or she is opposed to this motion. I 
have had private members indicating to me that they are in 
favour of it. I would encourage the House to give unanimous 
consent when the time comes to have the motion voted on and 
passed.

<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is it the wish of the hon. member for 
Winnipeg Transcona to ask for unanimous consent that this be 
votable?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Blaikie:</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker, if this is the appropriate time 
to do so. I would like to ask that this motion with the unanimous 
consent of the House be made votable and that a vote be taken if 
need be. We might agree to pass it at the end of the hour.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member has the floor and will 
not have the floor again, as he knows. He has heard the 
comments from the other side and I take it he is not going to ask 
for unanimous consent at this point while he has the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Blaikie:</B> Mr. Speaker, I can get up on a point of order at 
the end but I might not be able to and there is no reason why, if 
the House is willing at his point, we do not pass the motion now 
by asking that the motion be made votable. Debate continues.
<P>
	I would like to ask now that the motion, by unanimous 
consent, be made votable.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> Mr. Speaker, I hope that we continue to hear from 
the hon. member opposite with whom I have had the opportunity 
to work on that side of the House.
<P>
	I respectfully suggest that the hon. member might want to 
hear first from other members in this House who may contribute 
to his debate. He might want to hear the reasoning of other 
members in this House before calling the question he might 
want to call. He can do that by calling for a point of order later on 
in the proceedings, a couple of minutes before high noon.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Blaikie:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not want to get involved in a 
procedural wrangle. On the other hand, I do not want to be 
hoodwinked either. I do not want to be trying to get up on a point 
of order at the end when somebody is talking and not be able to 
get up.
<P>
	If it would facilitate the debate and the possibility of 
unanimity I would say fine. Either I or presumably somebody 
else could do the same thing, ask on a point of order toward the 
end of the hour that the motion be made votable.
<P>
	I do not see anything wrong with asking that it be made 
votable now. It would not prevent other arguments from being 
heard. It would not prevent other points of view from being 
heard. It would just mean that would be done.
<P>
	I am not interested in picking a fight with the member at this 
point and I hope that he would be true to his word and ensure that 
I get the opportunity to do that at the end of the hour.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jean Payne (St. John's West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to say a few words regarding motion M-143 as proposed by 
the hon. member for Winnipeg Transcona. I am a great supporter 
of any honours for our veterans and I sympathize with the intent 
of the hon. member in putting this motion forward.
<P>
	I certainly commend the hon. member for bringing the issue 
to the attention of this House. In that regard the consultative 
process now under way with the interested parties is 
commendable. I am certain all hon. members trust that the 
discussions will arrive at a successful conclusion.
<P>
	I must also point out that this is a sensitive issue. It must be 
considered within the context of the protocol and traditions of 
the Commonwealth system of honours and awards to which we 
as a nation have agreed.
<P>
	The Dieppe raid was a catastrophic moment in Canadian 
history. Every Canadian was touched in some way by the 
horrifying losses Canadians suffered on that day in 1942.
<P>
	It was also of tremendous importance to the allied war effort. 
No matter how one interprets the events surrounding the plan of 
the operation, the hard lessons learned from the disaster 
contributed to the successful D-Day landings, the 50th 
anniversary of which we will mark this June.
<P>
	The veterans of the Dieppe raid have made an enormous 
contribution to our country and they should be honoured in 
every way.
<P>
	I understand the Dieppe veterans' frustrations and I sincerely 
hope their desire for further recognition can in some way be 
accommodated. I do want to remind the House that the Dieppe 
veterans have been honoured in many other ways.
<P>
	The Dieppe veterans have not been forgotten. They have been 
eligible for Canada's outstanding veterans program, including 
POW compensation, a very tangible recognition of their 
contribution to the war effort and to this country.
<P>
<B>(1120 ) </B>
<P>
	Regimental memorials have been erected along the beaches 
where the Canadians fought that day. Monuments are also 
located at Puys, Pourville and Dieppe, as the hon. member has 
already mentioned.
<P>
	These memorials pay tribute to the members of the Royal 
Regiment of Canada, the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry, Les 
Fusiliers Mont Royal, the Calgary Regiment, the South 
Saskatchewan Regiment and the Queen's Own Cameron 
Highlanders of Canada who gave their lives in the raid. These 
regiments also proudly display the Dieppe battle honour on their 
regimental colours.
<P>
	The town of Dieppe has also created a small park where it has 
erected a monument of its own recounting the long relationship 
between Canadians and the people of Normandy, 
commemorating the raid on Dieppe.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2826"> 2826 </A></B>
<P>
	At war's end Dieppe veterans also received a number of war 
service medals, including the 1939-45 star, the Canadian 
volunteer service medal, the war medal of 1939-45 and in many 
cases the defence medal. Many Dieppe veterans have also 
received individual awards for personal valour.
<P>
	Perhaps best known among them are Charles Cecil Ingersoll 
Merritt and John Weir Foote, recipients of the Victoria Cross.
<P>
	Lieutenant-Colonel Cecil Merritt landed that day at 
Pourville. As the men struggled to cross the bridge over the river 
Scie he walked calmly into the storm of enemy fire on the bridge 
and led party after party across the bridge with his example.
<P>
	Despite their best efforts, however, the Canadians were forced 
to withdraw and again Cecil Merritt displayed his courage. 
Twice wounded, he led a vigorous rear guard action that enabled 
many men to reach the landing craft that waited to rescue them. 
Lieutenant-Colonel Merritt and his men were unfortunately not 
lucky. They could not reach the craft and were captured and 
taken prisoners of war.
<P>
	Similar courage was shown by Reverend Foote that day. 
Through eight hours of fighting John Foote repeatedly exposed 
himself to enemy fire as he worked again and again to move the 
injured to an aid post. He saved many lives with his selfless 
effort.
<P>
	Then at the end of the battle when he could have sailed away 
safely, he climbed back down from the landing craft and walked 
toward the enemy lines to be taken prisoner. In this way he made 
himself available to minister to his fellow Canadians as they 
were held prisoners of war. Foote and his comrades were held 
captive for the next three years.
<P>
	Cecil Merritt and John Weir Foote were most deserving 
recipients of the Commonwealth's highest military decoration 
for bravery. Their stories of courage deserve to be told again and 
again, as do many others.
<P>
	For this reason, I am glad this issue has come to public 
attention. I am very pleased the story of Dieppe presented on 
national television not long ago has been brought to our 
attention. It is fitting that Canadians be reminded of the courage 
and valour displayed by their countrymen at Dieppe more than 
50 years ago. We must never forget this chapter in our history.
<P>
	That is why I heartily support a new commemorative program 
called Canada Remembers. Over the next one and a half years 
the Canada Remembers program will mark the 50th 
anniversaries of the final events of the second world war. It will 
honour the contributions of the Canadians who served overseas 
during wartime and the millions of Canadians who supported 
them back home.
<P>
	I am particularly excited that this program will reach out to 
younger Canadians, providing them with an opportunity to learn 
more about the sacrifices made by a  whole generation of 
Canadians to secure peace and freedom for all of us.
<P>
	Initiatives such as these are important if we are to maintain an 
understanding of the impact of the second world war on the 
development of this country and if we are going to keep a sense 
of our military history alive.
<P>
	Canada Remembers is for all of our veterans, the Dieppe 
veterans included. I hope they will attend the many national and 
local events being planned for them. The honours and tributes 
they receive will be well deserved. They have earned them many 
times over.
<P>
	In response to the hon. member's motion I would like to 
recommend that the motion be amended in view of the remarks I 
have just made.
<P>
<B>(1125 ) </B>
<P>
	I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by deleting the words ``striking a distinctive 
medal'' and substituting therefor the words ``establishing an appropriate 
decoration''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I am sure the hon. member is aware of the reasons for this 
amendment. I thank him once again for the motion.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The amendment is in order.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome this opportunity to take part in the debate on the 
motion presented by the hon. member for Winnipeg Transcona. I 
agree with the hon. member and with the hon. member for the 
Liberal Party that the veterans of the Dieppe raid deserve our 
gratitude for their courage and, unfortunately, their 
determination in circumstances in which it was very difficult to 
survive. We know that nearly 5,000 Canadians took part in the 
Dieppe raid in 1942. More than 907 died. The operation was 
unsuccessful and one could practically call it a massacre.
<P>
	However, according to some experts and the hon. member for 
Winnipeg Transcona, this operation probably helped pave the 
way for the D-Day Invasion in 1944, whose fiftieth anniversary 
we will soon be celebrating.
<P>
	Perhaps I may depart somewhat from the position taken by the 
hon. member who moved the motion and say that I am rather 
intrigued that the hon. member has almost made this a personal 
crusade. Since 1983, he has been trying to put a motion through 
the House to strike a special medal for Dieppe 1942. There have 
been varying responses to this proposal over the years. It was 
repeated in June 1983 and September 1983 by the hon. member 
for Bow River at the time, with the same request to strike a 
medal for Dieppe. All sides of the question were discussed but 
the medal was never struck.
<P>
	When the hon. member mentioned earlier that he had never 
heard anyone say they were against striking a medal in 
recognition of the courage and efforts of those who took part in 
this raid, he is perfectly right, except that in 1951, it was agreed 
by members of the Commonwealth, by Canada and Great 
Britain, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2827"> 2827 </A></B>
<P>
that  medals would be struck only for campaigns and not for 
specific places, because otherwise, medals could be struck for 
all the beaches where an invasion took place, whether it was in 
1942 or 1944. There was also the battle of Vimy Ridge, where 
nearly 50,000 Canadians were either killed or wounded during 
World War I. A whole series of medals might have to be struck.
<P>
	What bothers me is that whether a veteran defended his own 
country or other countries in this place or that, against German 
or other invasions, I do not think we can strike medals for 
specific places, as if it were a distinction to have fought in such 
or such a place, as though one battle were worth more than 
another. I think that in a way, this discriminates against those 
veterans who did not fight at Dieppe but on Juno Beach or at 
Falaise or Caen. Why should they not also receive a 
commemorative medal? Perhaps I am playing devil's advocate 
because I realize that, in moving this motion, the hon. member 
for Winnipeg Transcona means well, but I have a hard time 
understanding the very specific reasons for striking this kind of 
medal.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	As a member of the Standing Committee on Defence, I would 
argue-and I think that this is what veterans want-that we have 
received requests from veterans and also from veterans of the 
merchant marine. My sense is that they do not necessarily want 
to be awarded a medal, but would rather receive some financial 
assistance and help in their lives today. We have received 
requests of this nature. Instead of debating whether or not to 
strike a new medal, the Standing Committee on Defence should 
proceed quickly to review specific requests from Dieppe 
veterans. Since the Dieppe Raid took place 52 years ago, there 
are not many survivors left and it is therefore important to move 
quickly on this matter.
<P>
	In conclusion, since the hon. member for Winnipeg Transcona 
has sought unanimous consent for the striking of a new 
distinctive medal, I would like to point out that throughout 
Canada's history, no special medal has been struck to 
specifically commemorate a given place or battle in a given war, 
with the possible exception of the Gulf War medal.
<P>
	To commemorate a special battle, a distinctive ribbon has 
until now been affixed to a medal or star. You may recall having 
read about the battle of Inkerman which resulted in numerous 
Canadian and British casualties. A distinctive ribbon 
commemorating this engagement was issued.
<P>
	Instead of striking a new medal, perhaps a distinctive ribbon 
or decoration could be issued, as my colleague from the Liberal 
Party suggested. And perhaps the debate should focus more on 
responding more quickly to the requests of veterans, regardless 
of where or when they fought.
<P>
	I have some difficulty with the idea of commemorating a 
specific engagement or battle when throughout Canadian 
history, countless Canadians and Quebecers have taken part in 
different engagements and have bravely defended their country 
and others as well. Why single out the Dieppe Raid, even if this 
massacre unfortunately resulted in the loss of many lives and 
affected many Canadians? To agree to this would be somewhat 
discriminatory toward those veterans who participated in other 
campaigns. For these reasons, I propose that this motion not be 
adopted.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
although it may be a trifle repetitive, my speech will deal with a 
historical aspect of Dieppe. I think this is not inappropriate 
when one considers the importance of what happened at Dieppe 
and the impact it had on Canadians.
<P>
	Just before dawn on August 19, 1942 a swarm of landing craft 
approached the coast around the French town of Dieppe on the 
English Channel. The largest raid in history, code named 
Jubilee, was on. A flotilla of 250 small naval craft was engaged 
and overhead the largest single air battle of the war was about to 
commence.
<P>
	The attack on Dieppe was planned as a reconnaissance in 
force ostensibly to assist the capability of the allies to launch 
large scale amphibious assaults against German defences in 
Festung Fortress Europe. Notwithstanding their lack of combat 
experience, almost 5,000 Canadian troops conducted the frontal 
assault on Dieppe. Supporting their efforts were battle hardened 
British commandos assigned to attack and subdue German 
coastal batteries to the east and west of the town. Their attack on 
the guns at Varengeville-sur-Mer to the west was completely 
successful. But at Berneval to the east they were not.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	The town of Dieppe in peacetime, a pleasant minor resort, had 
in war become a fortress. Though the town itself was of slight 
importance, the Germans saw in Dieppe an obvious point for a 
British attack. It was within range of RAF support and it was 
familiar as the terminal of the Dieppe-Newhaven ferry.
<P>
	The two storey casino fronting the beach had been heavily 
fortified. The beach itself was covered by machine gun points 
along the housefronts and at the ends by pillboxes and a tank set 
in concrete.
<P>
	These strong points together with guns sited in caves on both 
headlands of the horseshoe shaped harbour permitted raking fire 
right across the beach. While the British commandos achieved 
partial success, overall Dieppe has been assessed as a major 
disaster.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2828"> 2828 </A></B>
<P>
	My purpose today is to speak in support of the proposal to 
honour those who fought at Dieppe, not to cast blame on the 
planners of Operation Jubilee.
<P>
	Notwithstanding, it is worth noting that Lord Lovat, leader of 
the successful British commando group at Dieppe, later 
commented: ``Only a foolhardy commander launches a frontal 
attack with untried troops, unsupported, in daylight, against 
veterans dug in and prepared, behind concrete, wired and mined 
approaches, an enemy with every psychological advantage''.
<P>
	The raid on Dieppe lasted only nine hours but of the nearly 
5,000 Canadians involved more than 900 were killed, 1,900 
were captured and of those more than 600 were wounded. As 
prisoners of war they would spend the next three years in 
captivity.
<P>
	Dieppe accounted for more casualties than Canada sustained 
in the 11 months between the D-Day landings at Normandy in 
June 1944 and the German surrender in May 1945.
<P>
	The assault on Dieppe also became the scene of the largest air 
battle of World War II. Sixty-six squadrons, Spitfires, Hawker 
Typhoons and Hurricanes, about 730 single-seat fighters, flew 
2,111 sorties in which 88 aircraft were lost.
<P>
	Dual purpose aircraft and light bombers, Bostons and 
Blenheims, also supported the operations, losing 18 aircraft in 
the effort. In all 106 aircraft and 81 airmen were lost. Included 
were 13 Canadian aircraft and 10 pilots. German losses were 48 
aircraft.
<P>
	Assessing losses, the pilot casualties were considered 
moderate, the sailors, heavy. But for the soldiers and marines 
where the casualty rate reached nearly 60 percent, they were 
devastating. Overall, the casualty rate averaged more than 40 
per cent, the highest in the war for any major offensive involving 
the three services. Many units were decimated beyond their 
ability to function as recognizable entities.
<P>
	In the assault at Puys east of Dieppe, of the 500 men of the 
Royal Regiment of Canada and the Black Watch Royal 
Highlanders of Canada who landed, only six returned without 
wounds. Many landing craft never reached the beach and of the 
27 tanks landed, only half managed to cross the sea wall and 
none penetrated the tank barriers protecting the town itself. 
Eventually all 27 had to be abandoned.
<P>
	Two Canadians, Honorary Captain J. W. Foote of the Royal 
Hamilton Light Infantry and Lieutenant Colonel C. C. Merritt, 
commanding officer of the South Saskatchewan regiment, 
received the Victoria Cross for their actions at Dieppe. 
Lieutenant Colonel Dollard Menard, commanding officer of the 
Fusiliers de Mont-Royal, was badly wounded and decorated 
with the Distinguished Service Order for his gallant leadership.
<P>
	Lord Mountbatten, commander of the combined operations 
headquarters which planned Operation Jubilee said Canadians 
``paved an example of courage, and everything they possibly 
could be called upon to do, they did''.
<P>
<B>(1140 ) </B>
<P>
	Another planner and Jubilee's naval force commander, 
Captain Hughes-Hallett, said: ``The thing to remember was that 
they,'' the Canadians, ``did the operation and that is more than 
can be said for some of the crack formations which had been 
selected for earlier operations. The great thing was that 
Canadians were not only brave but they were bold as well. They 
were prepared to chance their arm and it was that that made the 
Dieppe operation possible''.
<P>
	The assault on Dieppe has been described in many ways. The 
Encyclopaedia Britannica states: ``It furnished useful lessons 
for the future in the problem of invading a well-defended coast. 
Although the cost was very high it showed the possibility of 
achieving a large-scale landing under modern conditions while 
bringing out mistakes that were to be avoided''.
<P>
	General Dwight Eisenhower credited Dieppe with ``having 
provided many useful lessons''.
<P>
	Just a few months after the raid Lord Beaverbrook confronted 
Mountbatten at a dinner party saying: ``You have murdered 
thousands of my countrymen. You took those unfortunate 
Canadian soldiers. They have been mown down in their 
thousands and their blood is on your hands''.
<P>
	The Canadian Encyclopaedia says of Dieppe: ``The raid did 
provide valuable experience for subsequent amphibious assaults 
in North Africa, Italy and most notably Normandy of 6 June, 
1944''. It then goes on to say it was a major disaster.
<P>
	Brian Loring Villa in his book <I>Unauthorized Action</I> classifies 
Dieppe as a historical tragedy.
<P>
	Accepting all these viewpoints and after the fact assessments 
of the raid, we should remember that at Dieppe Canadian troops, 
fighting in their first major action of the second world war, 
acquitted themselves with determination, bravery and honour. 
Under the conditions imposed they were involved in an 
impossible task. This fact should be registered, regretted and not 
forgotten.
<P>
	The Canadians who participated in Operation Jubilee deserve 
our respect, our admiration and our proud recognition. If ever a 
battle has been worthy of commemoration by presentation of a 
medal to those who took part, Dieppe is such a battle.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2829"> 2829 </A></B>
<P>
	I urge this House to give unanimous support to private 
member's motion No. 143 so that Canada can at long last 
provide tangible recognition of a sad but proud day in our 
history.
<P>
	In just four months it will have been 52 years since the assault 
on Dieppe. Even the youngest participants who survived are now 
in their seventies. It is long past time for Canada to officially 
recognize the Canadians who fought at Dieppe.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mark Assad (Gatineau-La Lièvre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to deal with the motion in which the hon. member for 
Winnipeg Transcona proposes that the federal government 
strike an honorary medal for Dieppe veterans.
<P>
	Like all Canadians, we have great admiration for Canada's 
veterans. No one has been more devoted to our country than 
these brave men and women, and I am still in favour of giving 
the greatest recognition for the services they rendered.
<P>
	Of course we support the intent of the hon. member in 
presenting this motion, but I believe, as the hon. member for 
Charlesbourg said a moment ago, that other Canadians 
sacrificed their lives in the Second World War. We would not 
want to give the impression that we are overlooking not only 
those who sacrificed their lives but also those who were injured 
or marked for the rest of their days. That is not our intention, far 
from it.
<P>
	Under the circumstances, and I believe that the hon. member 
for Charlesbourg was right to raise this issue, I feel that there is 
certainly another way to proceed. I believe that discussions on 
this matter should continue with the association of Dieppe 
veterans and prisoners of war-that would be a step in the right 
direction. I sincerely believe that the process of consultation 
should be given a chance before asking the House to act. Above 
all, we want to show that everyone who fought in the Second 
World War is on an equal footing.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	Nothing can diminish the heroism of the Canadians who took 
part in the Dieppe Battle. They showed incredible courage and a 
great deal of determination on that truly memorable day of 
World War Two. Because of their bravery, these Canadians will 
always have a special place in the history of this country.
<P>
	On August 19, 1942, at daybreak, a little under 5,000 
Canadians were in position off the coast of Normandy, prepared 
to risk their lives to break through Hitler's defences, known as 
Fortress Europe, and to open the way toward liberation. 
However, as soon as they set foot on the beaches in Dieppe, they 
realized that theirs was a totally impossible mission. What lay 
ahead was an absolute nightmare. Hundreds of young Canadians 
were killed by enemy snipers shooting from positions on top of 
the cliffs.
<P>
	We know now that they had been assigned an impossible 
mission. The surprise effect was ruined. Small groups did 
manage to approach their objectives, but most of the soldiers 
were easy targets on the beaches, as tanks got stuck in gravel and 
could go no further. For many of our men, attempts to make it 
back to the landing craft proved futile. Finally, fewer than half 
of the Canadians, many of whom seriously wounded, managed 
to escape this hell and return to England.
<P>
	Losses were extremely high. Some 2,000 became prisoners of 
war and 907 were killed that day. News of this tragedy caused 
consternation from coast to coast.
<P>
	I have known many veterans in my riding as well as in my 
home town, and I have heard quite a few stories about the Dieppe 
Raid. It is obvious that we are indebted to these men and women 
for their self-sacrifice; some gave their lives and lie buried in 
Normandy.
<P>
	The hon. member's initiative cannot go unnoticed. It is up to 
us, on this 50th anniversary of that battle, to remind the people 
of Canada of the great sacrifices that were made for our country. 
If we have enjoyed unprecedented prosperity and peace after the 
war, it is thanks to these people. It is our duty here to express our 
gratitude for it is the highest form of justice on this earth.
<P>
	I am convinced that these veterans will realize that Canadians 
never forgot what they did for their country. So, we should 
support our colleague's motion, which proposes changes 
designed to pay tribute to these people.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Hamilton West):</B> Mr. Speaker, at first 
glance I applaud and totally agree with motion No. 143 moved 
by the hon. member for Winnipeg Transcona. It urges the 
government to strike a distinctive medal for the veterans of the 
Dieppe raid during the second world war. I have always 
favoured actions which pay tribute to Canada's veterans and 
which benefit these exemplary citizens.
<P>
	With the amendment proposed by my colleague from St. 
John's West and with the acceptance of my friend from 
Winnipeg Transcona the government will have taken a giant 
step, along with that hon. member, in a process that will resolve 
the issue.
<P>
	I am persuaded that members of the House ought to give the 
amended motion a chance to succeed. In the meantime the 
government is working with the veterans associations, including 
the Dieppe Veterans and Prisoners of War Association, the 
Department of National Defence and Government House to 
resolve the issue. They are exploring a number of options in 
order to find an approach that would satisfy Dieppe veterans 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2830"> 2830 </A></B>
<P>
while honouring the traditions and upholding the integrity of the 
Commonwealth system of awards and medals. I am confident 
that by working together they will reach a solution soon.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	I have the privilege of being a member of Ontario's largest 
Royal Canadian Legion, branch 163 in Hamilton. It boasts a 
membership of 2,500. Who better to spend some time with, so I 
did just that last week. I asked the veterans what they thought of 
the special Dieppe medal.
<P>
	Veteran Pat Gallacher is the president of branch 163. His first 
vice-president is Neil Murray, foreman of signals, who over his 
heart proudly wears the France and Germany star, the D-Day 
medal, the war medal and the 1939-45 star. On the other side of 
Mr. Murray's blue blazer is a host of legion medals. Both Mr. 
Gallacher and Mr. Murray told me that it was a good idea first to 
hear and consult with everyone involved in the matter of special 
recognition for Dieppe veterans.
<P>
	They reminded me that the men who made up the Canadian 
assault force for Dieppe came from all corners of this country. 
``The boys were willing to serve their country'', they said. They 
waited a long time to see action; while the Royal Canadian Navy 
and the Royal Canadian Air Force had been busy defending 
Britain the ground forces had to wait. For months they trained 
for the time when they would spearhead an attack on occupied 
Europe. When the call finally came they were anxious to do their 
best, but the Dieppe raid was not destined to be a victorious 
moment. It was a disaster. In the words of Gallacher and Murray, 
it was the worst thing they ever did, a big blunder.
<P>
	In the end, pinned on the beach, the survivors were forced to 
surrender. These men spent three long years behind barbed wire. 
The legacy of Dieppe has been controversial. My vets say that it 
was a useless slaughter. Others claim it was a valuable if costly 
experience that enabled the allies to plan so well the much larger 
successful D-Day landings. I do not want to add to that debate 
today.
<P>
	In Canada, Dieppe casts a long shadow in households from 
coast to coast. Canadians know why men like Neil Murray wear 
their military medals with such pride, but for many years they 
have been bothered by the fact they did not receive a medal that 
specifically recognized their efforts at Dieppe.
<P>
	The France and Germany campaign medal was only awarded 
to those who took part in the D-Day landings in 1944 and the 
subsequent operations that retook Europe. This meant the men 
who were killed, who were badly wounded or who were taken 
prisoner never received a European campaign medal. In the end 
they had fewer medals than veterans who had faced similar 
circumstances, despite the fact that those men played a special 
role in the effort to free Europe.
<P>
	Both Mr. Gallacher, president of the legion, and Mr. Murray, 
first vice-president, asked me to consider the American 
experience, all those American medals from campaigns to 
sharpshooting to attendance. ``Is that what we want'', they 
asked, ``will we be striking more medals, beginning to diminish 
the importance of each of  the medals we have now?''. Mr. 
Murray said that they should have struck a medal for Dieppe a 
long time ago and that maybe now it is too late.
<P>
	We should give them a bar to recognize their participation at 
Dieppe to put on any war medal. After all we must respect the 
protocol and tradition of the Commonwealth system of honours 
and awards. In seeking to satisfy the interests of the Dieppe 
veterans we must heed the concerns of all our vets. I am 
confident we will do just that. Canadians realize they owe the 
veterans of Dieppe an incredible debt. It is a debt that is in many 
ways unpayable.
<P>
	In closing, we want to ensure that veterans have been 
thoroughly consulted on the matter of recognition for Dieppe 
veterans. We must be reminded of the courage displayed by 
them more than half a century ago. We must not forget. I ask my 
colleagues in the House to support the amended motion put 
forward by the hon. member for Winnipeg Transcona.
<P>
<B>(1155 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Iftody (Provencher):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise in the 
House today to speak on motion No. 143 put forward by the hon. 
member for Winnipeg Transcona.
<P>
	The hon. member has suggested the government should 
honour the veterans of the Dieppe raid by striking a distinctive 
medal for these former members of the Canadian forces. I share 
the hon. member's desire and would like to add my personal 
commitment to see Canada's Dieppe veterans given proper 
recognition for their part in the ill-fated attack on Dieppe. These 
Canadians deserve every expression of our gratitude. However, 
as I will explain, there is already a process under way to resolve 
the issue and I feel the process deserves at least a chance to 
succeed. All Canadians would undoubtedly agree that Dieppe 
veterans should hold a special place in our history.
<P>
	All members of the naval, ground and air forces that took part 
in the raid on the coast of France in 1942 exhibited great courage 
and bravery in the face of formidable circumstances. This is 
especially true of the members of the Second Canadian Infantry 
Division who disembarked on the beaches of Dieppe. These 
Canadians were proud to have been selected to breach Hitler's 
so-called Fortress of Europe but on that fateful day things went 
terribly wrong.
<P>
	For our nation August 19, 1942 was one of the costliest days 
of the second world war. Of the almost 5,000 Canadians who 
embarked on the operation more than two-thirds suffered 
casualties. This included 907 Canadians who lost their lives and 
1,946 Canadians who were taken as prisoners of war. Little more 
than 2,000 returned to England, many of whom were wounded. 
<P>

<B><A NAME="2831"> 2831 </A></B>
<P>
Dieppe therefore took a terrible toll on our wartime forces that 
Canadians have not and will not forget.
<P>
	In recent months interested Canadians have been taking up the 
cause of Dieppe veterans. Aware that many of the Dieppe 
veterans did not receive as many medals as their comrades, these 
Canadians find it difficult to understand why Dieppe veterans 
have not been given greater recognition for their participation in 
the battle. Their concern is legitimate and understandable. In 
point of fact Dieppe veterans definitely appear to have been 
short-changed.
<P>
	On the other hand, we must respect that during the second 
world war Canada and other Commonwealth countries agreed to 
a unified system of military medals. Since the battle of Dieppe 
was a separate military activity outside any particular 
campaign, the efforts of veterans were not recognized by a 
campaign medal. There is the source of this unfortunate 
discrepancy. Furthermore Dieppe veterans were eligible for 
personal awards for acts of valour. Two veterans, Cecil Merritt 
and John Weir Foote, received the Victoria Cross for their 
actions that day.
<P>
	This is why I am prepared to support the amended motion that 
would read ``a distinctive decoration'' instead of ``a distinctive 
medal''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Blaikie:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I would 
like to indicate my support for the amendment. Like many 
amendments it is not always exactly what we asked for, but I 
appreciate the willingness on the other side to make some 
progress here, to have the motion go forward and hopefully to 
create the kind of momentum I was talking about before.
<P>
	I would ask, Mr. Speaker, that you seek unanimous consent to 
have the amendment adopted and then to have the main motion 
made votable so that we could proceed to pass the motion as 
amended.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The Chair senses that there is 
unanimous consent to pass both the amendment and the motion 
as amended.
<P>
	Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment, by 
unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	(Amendment agreed to.)
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Transferring the main motion as 
amended into a votable motion today, is the main motion as 
amended agreeable by unanimous consent to all members of the 
House?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Shall the motion as amended carry?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	(Motion, as amended, agreed to.)

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="BUDGETIMPLEMENTATIONACT,1994">BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 1994</A></H3>
	The House resumed from March 25 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-17, an act to amend certain statutes to 
implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament 
on February 22, 1994, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee; and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance):</B> Mr. Speaker, as we resume debate today on Bill C-17 
I welcome the opportunity to join my government colleagues in 
supporting this very important piece of legislation.
<P>
	When passed, this bill will implement key aspects of the 
February budget plan, a plan for action in three core areas on 
behalf of all Canadians living in all regions. It is a plan to spur 
job creation and economic growth.
<P>
	That is one reason Bill C-17 revamps the UI entitlements. 
These savings will allow us to reduce the payroll taxes identified 
by business, especially small business, as one of the major 
barriers to new employment.
<P>
	It is a plan to get the deficit down and to set the foundations 
for a balanced budget because we have to stop mortgaging our 
children's future and pushing taxes eternally higher. This bill is 
a critical step in meeting this goal by restraining parliamentary 
and public service salaries and by reducing business subsidies 
for transportation and energy.
<P>
	Let me emphasize that the fiscal action we are taking will not 
jeopardize the work that must be done to make the economy 
stronger and create opportunity. Losing jobs is no way to pay off 
debts, not for individuals and not for Canada as a nation.
<P>
	It is also a budget plan to reform social security so we can 
boost economic opportunity while ensuring we can sustain the 
cost of Canada's social safety net. Here again Bill C-17 plays a 
vital role.
<P>
	It does this not only through the actions on unemployment 
insurance but by providing the provinces with two years of 
certainty on federal transfers under the Canada assistance plan. 
This will help create the stable window of opportunity and 
co-operative environment that will allow the two levels of 
government to work together on this critical task.
<P>
	More important, the critics and the cynics are absolutely 
wrong in assuming that this government's commitment to 
delivering on our deficit reduction pledge was mere political 
coin. Our government's goal is to restore federal economic 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2832"> 2832 </A></B>
<P>
credibility, not continue to debase it. The fundamental fact is 
with the February  budget we have taken unparalleled action to 
meet the fiscal challenge and that is no exaggeration.
<P>
	Measures in the budget result in gross savings of $3.7 billion 
in this fiscal year, rising to $13.6 billion in 1996-97. Over the 
three year forecast period of the budget gross savings total $28.6 
billion.
<P>
	We have also taken action to encourage growth and job 
creation, action targeted at enhancing our economic muscle and 
confidence in the evolving global economy. We have done this 
in part because restored growth is an essential element of the 
deficit reduction strategy.
<P>
	Even with the investments such as the infrastructure program 
and support for R and D, net savings in the budget total $20.4 
billion over three years. They deliver $5 worth of spending cuts 
for every $1 of revenue. These spending cuts are the most 
significant of any budget in the past 10 years.
<P>
	Such measures are not a conclusion. They are simply a 
foundation. Let me echo what the Minister of Finance has said 
repeatedly, including at a meeting with major European 
investors today. The message of our government is very clear. 
The ultimate goal of this government is to eliminate the deficit.
<P>
	The deficit ratio of 3 per cent of GDP by 1996-97 is exactly 
what we have always said it was, an interim target, one that has 
not been met for 10 years. We are going to meet it through the 
spending cuts implemented in this year's budget, not a 
subsequent budget.
<P>
	The results of a major program review launched in February 
which should identify further opportunities for savings will be 
included in the 1995 budget. The goal here and in subsequent 
budgets will be to take us beyond our interim target on our way 
to balancing the books of this nation.
<P>
	Some argue that our deficit action is too little, too slow. We 
believe, and many Canadians understand, that more drastic 
action could jeopardize Canada's return to economic health. 
That would ultimately sabotage our ability to sustain consistent 
fiscal improvement.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	We also believe that restoring budget credibility means 
looking both beyond and beneath the numbers. Our budget puts 
an end to many of the practices of the past. We have provided 
full accounting of all program costs. Nothing is hidden.
<P>
	We built in substantial reserves to allow us to handle 
unforeseen contingencies without letting our fiscal objectives 
suffer. Just as important, we reversed the budget's bias in favour 
of optimistic, politically correct economic forecasts. As we all 
recognized in previous years, governments would set targets 
based on rosy projections in order to look good initially, only to 
fail eventually.
<P>
	We believe it is more important to meet a target than to 
promote a wish list and then fall far short. It is crucial to 
re-establish the credibility of the government's economic 
projections. Therefore when we put together our budget we use 
prudent assumptions drawn from the pessimistic range of 
private sector forecasters. We believe that is a responsible way 
for this government to act.
<P>
	Canada as elsewhere has recently witnessed some volatility in 
interest rates. That volatility makes the case for the prudent 
assumptions and contingency reserves built into our budget. We 
have ensured substantial room for manoeuvre. Interest rate 
fluctuations are not going to knock us off course. We remain 
confident that we will hit our targets.
<P>
	I am glad to see that this confidence is shared by the Royal 
Bank's Ed Neufeld, the executive vice-president of economic 
affairs. I understand that at the Royal Bank's annual spring 
briefing on the economy last week he shared his view that we, 
the Government of Canada, are on track this year to reach our 
deficit reduction target.
<P>
	At the same briefing the Royal Bank also forecasted that 
Canadian growth will accelerate to 3.5 per cent this year and 4.3 
per cent in 1995. It is worth noting that this 1994 forecast is in 
complete harmony with preliminary reports on the upcoming 
IMF forecasts for Canadian growth this year.
<P>
	These forecasts exceed the prudent projections on which our 
1994 budget was based. They reflect what I believe was an 
objective assessment of the growing strength of our economic 
fundamentals, strength that the budget and other federal actions 
have contributed to.
<P>
	Canada is now one of the lowest inflation countries in the 
world. We are going to stay that way. Last December the 
Governor of the Bank of Canada and the finance minister 
announced that the inflation targets which anchor our monetary 
policy, among the toughest in the world, will continue through 
1998.
<P>
	Another key fundamental is restoring fiscal responsibility to 
our public finances, a major goal of this legislation, Bill C-17. 
Let me again emphasize that we are working with the provinces 
to improve the national debt situation because this truly is a 
national problem. There are real grounds for renewed national 
confidence that this challenge can and will be met. It is clear that 
across Canada governments are applying themselves steadily to 
the course of fiscal discipline.
<P>
	Let us remember that fiscal action by governments is only 
part of the answer for long term balanced budgets. A growing 
economy is also essential if our debt build-up is to be reversed. 
Here again there are real grounds for confidence. The economy 
is starting to grow more firmly. Growth was 3.8 per cent in the 
last quarter of last year based on solid exports and investment 
performance.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2833"> 2833 </A></B>
<P>
	Surveys for 1994 indicate that public and private sector 
investment will be up an impressive 4.2 per cent over 1993. 
Strong gains and competitiveness are behind the firming of 
economic growth and they too augur well for the future.
<P>
	Unit labour costs are down and productivity is up. The big unit 
cost gap that opened up between Canada and the United States 
has essentially been closed. Our record export growth is the 
result.
<P>
<B>(1210 ) </B>
<P>
	Those facts paint a picture of a competitive economy moving 
in the right direction. This was further confirmed by the March 
labour force numbers that came out last Friday. The 
unemployment rate dropped a full half percentage point, the 
largest contraction in 10 years since June 1984, and 114,000 new 
jobs have been created over the last two months, the strongest 
two month gain in almost five years. I welcome such news and 
all Canadians welcome this type of news.
<P>
	There is no question we continue to face challenges and 
uncertainties. Dislocations can always emerge, sapping public 
confidence. That is why good news is never an excuse for 
complacency. That is why we will forge ahead with our strategy 
of re-engineering the way government operates and the 
programs it provides. These contribute to a stronger, more 
flexible Canadian economy.
<P>
	Our action on unemployment insurance is an excellent 
example. We reduce spending on UI, something that will save us 
money. That also means we can roll back payroll taxes that have 
cost jobs across this country.
<P>
	Looking at Europe anyone can see the cost of rigid labour 
market policies. We in Canada were close to developing a 
similar rigidity. We have now begun to move toward a more 
flexible system.
<P>
	The redesign of unemployment insurance with greater 
emphasis on training to reintegrate the jobless and to discourage 
habitual dependence will make Canada's labour market much 
more flexible and efficient than is currently the case. The 
ultimate result will be a greater national capability to generate 
growth and, most important, jobs.
<P>
	I have highlighted areas where our government is committed 
to fundamental, forward looking change, deficit reduction, 
support for job creation, social program reform, the process of 
budget making.
<P>
	In closing, there is another area of change I want to 
emphasize. In our endeavour we are taking a new approach to 
the work of government. It is an approach based on openness, 
consultation and communication. That is why we framed the 
1994 budget as the first part of a two stage process. It took 
immediate action to meet vital immediate goals but also 
launched the process of policy review and public debate that will 
lead to further action in time.
<P>
	Such an approach is not a case of deferring action or evading 
responsibility and leadership. Rather, it addresses a 
fundamental fact in Canadian life, a fact that impacts directly on 
economic relations. That fact, most important to this 
government, is that without reasonable consensus and a real 
sense of public participation and public ownership dramatic 
change can become a disastrous failure. We do not intend to 
create this type of failure because Canadians deserve success.
<P>
	This budget was developed in the most open process we have 
seen in Canadian political history. It involved meetings across 
the country and involved an opportunity for Canadians to write 
the minister, participate in meetings and make their views 
known.
<P>
	This process of openness will continue. We have evolved an 
open process on the budget in which we gave people in different 
cities a chance to set out the parameters for the expansion of the 
economy, for assisting the unemployed, for creating jobs and at 
the same time to begin to deal with the deficit which is a very 
real burden for all Canadians.
<P>
	We will continue this process through the House of Commons, 
through the committee on finance this fall in which we 
anticipate the 1995 budget process will be even more open and 
more visible and more transparent so that Canadians can begin 
to understand and feel part of a process that spends billions of 
their dollars each year.
<P>
	This bill will help achieve that success by moving us to real 
bottom line fiscal improvement and renewed business and 
investor confidence.
<P>
	For this reason I have no hesitation in encouraging all 
members here today to pass this legislation so that we can 
continue to move ahead with vigour and vision.
<P>

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened attentively to the hon. member's remarks and I feel that 
they represent the views of the Liberal Party. He is content with 
the budget initiatives put forward by the federal government and 
I find his speech extremely dangerous, despite his eloquence. He 
may be trying to lull people into a false sense of security. You 
know about the current crisis in Canada. I saw the poverty in my 
riding two weeks ago. One does not have to look very far to see 
that poverty is widespread; unemployment is very serious and 
people are concerned about the confidence they placed in the 
current government because they know that it did not do much in 
its last budget. It tried lukewarm measures that lack conviction, 
that lack direction.
<P>
	For example, to reduce the deficit, the hon. member seems 
content with the deficit reduction that was announced and with 
the fact that the goal may be achieved, but I feel that several 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2834"> 2834 </A></B>
<P>
other measures could have been proposed to reduce this 
extremely alarming  deficit that shook the stock market and sent 
the dollar tumbling.
<P>
	We in the Bloc Quebecois have proposed several measures to 
bring down the deficit, including cutting the fat from the federal 
government. There are hardly any measures in the budget to 
reduce waste in the federal government.
<P>
	Would the hon. member agree to help reduce Canada's 
deficit? Would he agree to set up a parliamentary committee to 
examine spending and waste in government?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
questions. Poverty in this country is a very important issue to me 
because my riding is among the poorest in the country. In 
addition, in this budget, we tried to cover these issues of poverty 
and the deficit. We will ask the finance committee to discuss 
these questions in detail.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I think that the balance of trying to deal with questions of 
poverty, whether it be in Montreal or Winnipeg, is the question 
that haunts this whole country, This government does not for one 
minute take lightly the limitations it has in dealing with 
questions of poverty.
<P>
	As a former critic on social policy for this caucus in 
opposition, I know we were very critical of the last government 
for not addressing questions of poverty. That is why we 
stabilized equalization payments and why in this particular act 
we have stabilized the Canada assistance plan. We have moved 
away from the war against the poor and moved toward 
supporting initiatives that can help them.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development is very 
active. In fact he participated in a meeting this morning dealing 
with questions of income security and reforms to unemployment 
insurance to ensure they do not turn out to be an attack on those 
who are in need.
<P>
	The President of the Treasury Board is addressing the 
questions of waste and the budget not only on an annual basis but 
I would say on a weekly basis. Great progress is being made to 
overcome questions of waste in individual programs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with 
interest to the comments of my hon. friend from Winnipeg North 
Centre in terms of the legislation before us.
<P>
	I have a question for him dealing with the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police and the problems faced by new constables. 
When they leave Regina, for the first three years of their service 
as new constables they receive six month pay increments to 
bring them up to a reasonable level of income. This legislation 
not only freezes the level of pay but freezes any increment 
initiative as well.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	Young constables coming out of training are being asked to 
serve in cities like Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. They 
simply cannot live on their stipend. It is impossible. These are 
bright, young, interested and aggressive young constables who 
want to serve their country at a time, I think we would all agree, 
when the need has never been greater and yet they cannot serve 
in at least some of these urban areas because of this freeze.
<P>
	The hon. member will know that when the government 
changed the unemployment insurance program, which he 
referred to here, there was some acknowledgement that low 
income Canadians, particularly those with children, should 
receive some recognition for the changes in the economic plight 
that they face. Why would the government not do the same for 
these new constables?
<P>
	I know that the commissioner has met with the government on 
this and has pleaded their case. Could my hon. friend shed some 
light on why the government at least to this point has not made 
any announcement that there will be some changes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
Kamloops for his question.
<P>
	The broad brushes of the changes and the freezes and the 
extension of the freeze on public service salaries have obviously 
been of great hardship to the tens of thousands of people who 
work for us. It is something we take very seriously. The 
particular case of the constables is an example of the difficulties 
in which people find themselves at a particular point in their 
careers when the next move is out of the question because of 
some restraints on their compensation package.
<P>
	I will undertake, as the member has, to raise it with the 
Treasury Board minister and the Solicitor General to ensure that 
as the salary freeze on public servants is extended for two more 
years, as it is in Bill C-17 to obtain the savings that Canadians 
are looking for, individual cases of hardship are brought to their 
attention.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a short question for the hon. parliamentary secretary. I 
listened to the stats on unemployment. I also heard that there are 
28,000 people who have given up looking for jobs. This is a big 
concern in Manitoba, especially on the farm scene.
<P>
	Coming back from there, realizing what the transportation 
system is for grain and that the terminal operations cannot go to 
a seven day cycle to start moving grain faster, would the hon. 
member look at that and initiate some opportunities for people 
to be employed in that industry in order to give western 
Canadians a break so that they can really make and fulfil 
commitments with regard to foreign grain sales?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2835"> 2835 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member from my 
province.
<P>
	I do not think this government in any way, shape or form takes 
any solace in the figures that were released last Friday, except as 
an indication that perhaps things are getting better in some parts 
of the country.
<P>
	We want to see several months of improvement. When one 
sees a rate of unemployment across this country that high, one 
cannot take any satisfaction from it. The member from 
Manitoba and the member sitting behind him from Winnipeg 
know full well that this situation is going to require a lot more 
intervention. It affects not only the city of Winnipeg and other 
cities across this county, but also the farm industry.
<P>
	Any ways that the member can suggest to improve the 
efficiency of the grain industry, which is so important to the 
west and to places like Thunder Bay, Montreal, Vancouver and 
other ports, will be taken under advisement and discussed with 
the minister of agriculture.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona):</B> Mr. Speaker, while 
we are on the topic of grain cars I would like to suggest to the 
government member and also to my Reform Party colleague 
from Manitoba that one of the problems is the fact that we have 
grain cars sitting all across the country. Many of them are in 
Manitoba, the old boxcar type grain cars, and they are not being 
used.
<P>
	The reason they are not being used is not because of 
railroaders, the government or anybody else. As I understand it, 
it is because the pools do not want to hire people to man the 
elevators in order to use the old boxcars. They have cut staff at 
the elevators.
<P>
	We have the grain cars to move the grain but the people who 
are responsible for employment at the elevators will not make it 
possible to use these cars. That is only one dimension of the 
problem but I think it is something that should be put on the 
record.
<P>
<B>(1225 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> Mr. Speaker, as the member for Winnipeg 
Transcona knows, the question of grain cars and the use of those 
cars is also tied into the Churchill route. As he knows, the 
member for Churchill has been very active in promoting the 
interest of that route and has been helped by the member for St. 
Boniface in whose riding the yards are located.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Secretary of State 
(Multiculturalism) (Status of Women)):</B> Mr. Speaker, I found 
my hon. colleague's speech most interesting. I hope everyone 
will read it to get a clarification of the wonderful role that has 
been played to date.
<P>
	In his next series of consultations, I would ask that the 
minister please ensure that more women's groups, more older 
citizens and ethnocultural communities are consulted. I know 
we did a fair job but not a good enough job in their view. I would 
hope that some commitment would be made as we go across the 
country on the next round.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the minister for her 
comments. I just met on her behalf with a group of women from 
Winnipeg, a black women's coalition, who brought these types 
of questions to my attention. They are very much on my mind.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat):</B> Mr. Speaker, before I 
get into the content of what I wish to discuss, I would like to 
touch for a moment on the remarks of the previous speaker, the 
hon. parliamentary secretary for finance.
<P>
	He painted a very rosy picture about the future of the 
Canadian economy. I would like for the sake of balance to point 
out some of the other opinions on where the economy is heading 
in the next little while.
<P>
	First, over the last week we have seen a very volatile stock 
market. The dollar continues to be extremely volatile. Interest 
rates have been hiked in the last little while.
<P>
	When economists comment on this, most often they point out 
two factors that contribute to this volatility. The first is 
continued high deficit and debt figures and a lack of confidence 
in the ability of the government to get a handle on the deficit and 
debt. The second thing they point to is the situation in Quebec 
and the possibility of Quebec's separation.
<P>
	I urge the government to do whatever it has to do to get the 
debt and deficit problem under control. Though the minister 
waxes eloquent about the intent to get the deficit and the debt 
under control, so far the government has not convinced the 
markets it is going to do this. That is why we continue to have all 
kinds of uncertainty. It certainly hurts business and the economy 
in general in this country when there is that lack of confidence.
<P>
	I will be addressing this bill with respect to the request for 
borrowing authority for the CBC. The rationale behind that 
request would give the CBC the ability to invest in systems and 
equipment that would make it more efficient down the road.
<P>
	This request begs many questions. The first and most 
important question is the timing of this request. Right now the 
government is embarking on a management and funding review 
of the CBC. This request for borrowing authority presumes the 
outcome of that review. It is assuming the review will find that 
the CBC is a good steward of money and that it is a good 
manager with a solid management team.
<P>
	I would argue that the facts really do not bear that out. I would 
point to the fact that the CBC has lost several senior managers in 
recent weeks. That leaves it weakened  in terms of having the 
expertise to use that money wisely.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2836"> 2836 </A></B>
<P>
	The second is the argument that the CBC in spending the 
money it gets from the government, about $1.1 billion a year, 
uses it wisely. I would beg to differ that it does.
<P>
<B>(1230 ) </B>
<P>
	Over the last few years the CBC has actually seen its revenues 
drop. That reflects two things. It reflects the lack of confidence 
advertisers have in the CBC to generate viewers, and also the 
programming of the CBC obviously is left wanting.
<P>
	We have the CRTC commissioner recently criticising the 
CBC, pointing out that its share of viewership has dropped to 
13.3 per cent, despite the fact that it has a virtual monopoly on 
Canadian programming and is rewarded every year with the $1.1 
billion subsidy.
<P>
	The first thing that really must be addressed when the 
government brings this bill forward, at least with respect to the 
CBC, is the timing. Why are we doing this now when there is a 
funding review about to take place?
<P>
	It may, and I would suggest it will, find that the CBC is very 
weak in terms of its management because of the loss of so much 
of the management team and also in how it has spent money in 
the past. The Fraser Institute recently suggested that on average 
a CBC station spends over twice what its private sector 
counterpart spends on administration and programming. That 
does not bode well for taxpayers if we are preparing to give the 
CBC the authority to borrow money.
<P>
	The CBC has a $40 million deficit on its operating budget this 
year on revenues of $1.4 billion. Allowing an indebted company 
to accumulate further debts at the public's expense is poor 
management and morally irresponsible.
<P>
	We were talking a minute ago about the tremendous debt and 
deficit problems that we have in this country. Now we are 
proposing to allow the CBC to go ahead and borrow more 
money. Who is going to pay for that debt if the CBC cannot meet 
its financial obligations? It will be the Canadian taxpayers as 
usual. We will be picking up the bill for the CBC spending.
<P>
	The other thing that really concerns me about this is who is 
going to be directly accountable to Parliament for this 
borrowing authority. It is true that the money will have to be 
approved by the finance department before the CBC gets it. I am 
not convinced because the CBC is a crown corporation and does 
not really depend on profits to keep it disciplined, to keep its 
expenses in line and does not have a bottom line like a private 
sector company. We really do not have those market disciplines 
to make the management in CBC accountable for that $25 
million.
<P>
	The budget document also suggests that the public 
broadcaster may be allowed to borrow an amount greater than 
$25 million with parliamentary approval. In effect  the ceiling of 
$25 million is a decoy. How did the government arrive at that 
figure? What measures will keep it from becoming $50 million 
or $100 million? Until we have this management and funding 
review completed how will we know whether the CBC is capable 
of managing even higher levels of indebtedness? How will we 
know that it can repay $50 million or $100 million? Again, the 
question has to be who will get it off the hook if it is unable to 
repay that $100 million. Naturally the CBC will come looking to 
Canadian taxpayers for a greater subsidy.
<P>
	The rationale behind this new borrowing power is supposed to 
allow the corporation to make investments in systems and 
equipment that will result in long term savings. What we have 
here in effect is a perpetuation of waste and inefficiency since 
the new Liberal government has given the CBC a $100 million 
reprieve on cuts announced by the previous Conservative 
administration and a further deferral of $150 million over five 
years. In effect, the government is to a degree reversing that. 
Until this review is undertaken it seems entirely premature.
<P>
<B>(1235 ) </B>
<P>
	The CBC has not demonstrated it can be financially 
responsible. While private broadcasters will send one camera 
crew to do the job, we can almost always count on the CBC 
sending three. It is a standing joke among private broadcasters 
how much money, how many reporters, how many camera 
crews, how many technicians the CBC has to devote to a single 
news conference in order to get the story that private 
broadcasters could get with one camera crew.
<P>
	One of our concerns is that this crown corporation really has 
the best of both worlds. It has its feet in both the private sector 
and the public sector. It has its feet in the public sector purse to 
the tune of $1.1 billion. It also competes in the private sector 
with private sector broadcasters. Because of its huge subsidy 
and now a request for $25 million in borrowing authority it will 
also have the ability to further undercut advertising rates in the 
markets in which it competes with private sector broadcasters.
<P>
	This is a concern to private sector broadcasters. They have 
raised this before and this issue is not going away. At a time 
when many private sector broadcasters are suffering-many of 
them are operating in the red-how can we not only give our 
support to this idea but why are we not going the other way and 
saying it is time to give private broadcasters a break by reining 
in the CBC a bit?
<P>
	Perhaps we should be giving some consideration to making 
the CBC a little like public broadcasting in the United States 
where they depend a lot more on contributions from viewers. 
Many Canadian viewers send their contributions down to PBS in 
the United States. If I am not mistaken and memory serves me 
correctly, the majority of funds for those border stations comes 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2837"> 2837 </A></B>
<P>
from Canadian viewers. That should set off alarm bells 
everywhere.
<P>
	We have to ask ourselves in light of the decline in viewership 
for the CBC and in light of this request for more money why in 
the world is this happening. Why are we allowing this debate to 
even happen when we see all this money going south of the 
border? Should we not be trying to repatriate this money? 
Should the CBC be more dependent on viewer support than it 
already is?
<P>
	With the CBC's tacit application for a new arts channel, the 
festival channel, will some of this money end up supporting this 
new application? The festival channel really is in competition 
again with the private sector. We have a very strong private 
sector application for an arts channel but it seems the CBC feels 
it has to justify its existence by applying for that new arts 
channel as well.
<P>
	I have to wonder if this $25 million going to the CBC will end 
up in some way, shape or form being shuffled over toward the 
festival channel to help that channel get off the ground. The 
CBC has no mandate to be involved in this arts channel. 
Nonetheless it has found a very sneaky way to go in the back 
door to push for an arts channel to fall under the CBC purview. 
We have to ask ourselves whether the intent of the department is 
to shuffle some of that $25 million into the newly proposed 
festival channel.
<P>
	We also have to ask what guidelines has the government 
established to the exercising of this borrowing authority. This 
has not been made clear. The government has basically said it 
will decide when the CBC comes to it whether the CBC's 
application for funds has merit. We are talking about a 
government that wants politicians and government to be more 
accountable.
<P>
<B>(1240 ) </B>
<P>
	We need to know before we approve this what kind of 
measures will be put in place to ensure this money is not wasted, 
that this money does get a return on investment because that is 
what they say will happen. We have to make sure it does not go 
into a festival channel to compete against private sector 
broadcasters. It is not at all clear that will not happen.
<P>
	Those are the types of questions this government has to 
answer before we can go ahead and give any kind of support for 
allowing the CBC to have borrowing authority.
<P>
	This really represents the opening of a Pandora's box. We 
wonder whether there will be an increase now among crown 
corporations coming forward to ask for borrowing authority. I 
would argue that is a very scary prospect.
<P>
	Too often these different crown corporations do not have the 
private sector to compete with and keep them in line and they do 
not have a bottom line to address. Often they do not have to 
worry about what the shareholders will say and therefore very 
often can spend money very unwisely with impunity. That is a 
scary prospect when we have a $45 billion or $46 billion deficit 
this year entering into a new year when we may have a deficit in 
excess of $40 billion.
<P>
	I will conclude by saying it is crystal clear that any attempt to 
revitalize the CBC using measures normally reserved for 
companies competing in a private marketplace undermines its 
integrity as a public broadcaster.
<P>
	Any special measures designed to raise capital for the CBC 
such as loans, subscriber fees or licence fees would be an unfair 
advantage if the CBC underbids its private counterparts for any 
services which it offers given its heavy state sanctioned 
financing.
<P>
	For that reason I urge the members of this House to oppose 
this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened attentively to the member 
opposite from the Reform Party. I feel his analysis of the CBC 
has been very narrow.
<P>
	When I look at the CBC I do not see it just as a broadcaster. I 
see the CBC as an instrument to pull this country together. When 
we think of the CBC we do not just think about CBC television, 
but of CBC radio, of CBC Newsworld, probably one of the most 
efficiently run organizations in the broadcast industry anywhere 
in North America.
<P>
	When we see the way it pulls this country together, whether it 
be in the arts, in current affairs in French and English, I do not 
know what other galvanizing instrument we have out there that 
can provide that type of service and support in this country.
<P>
	There is another aspect of the CBC and we talk about 
accounting measures. My background is in business and I 
believe that it is very important to have full accountability of the 
CBC.
<P>
	However, I do not think we are putting on the asset side of the 
sheet the great contribution the CBC has made in terms of 
training writers, producers, camera operators and technology 
wizards recognized all over the world. This is training support 
the private sector has been able to pull from to move into its own 
private broadcast units without having to fund any of that 
training and support. That is not just in television, it is also in 
radio technology, talent and service support.
<P>
	Look at what the CBC has done in terms of the north. What 
person in Canada would not agree with the fact that the CBC has 
made a contribution in the north? What private broadcaster is 
even going to go there to help pull that part of our country into 
the mainstream?
<P>
<B>(1245 ) </B>
<P>
	I support the approach of the Reform Party to having 
accountability, but I wish the Reform Party would support our 
approach. We should look at all assets, all strengths, not just at 
one or two particular weaknesses. If the Reform Party were to 
put into its accounting analysis all other contributions the CBC 
has been 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2838"> 2838 </A></B>
<P>
making, is making and hopefully will make in the future, it 
might think we are getting good value for taxpayers' money.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate very much the 
suggestions of the hon. member. However I think there is a 
consensus in the country that the CBC has to change.
<P>
	The hon. member mentioned CBC Newsworld and how 
efficient it is. Within a year of applying for and getting its 
licence the CBC had to come back and ask for higher subscriber 
fees because it could not make it on what it was bringing in. 
Despite the fact it said it would not do so, the CBC came back 
and did exactly that. I would suggest that in terms of efficiency 
the CBC obviously did not look very far ahead.
<P>
	When it comes to bringing the country together I very much 
appreciate what the CBC has done in the past with respect to 
that, but I point out that many private sector broadcasters do the 
same sorts of things. The CTV network brings the country 
together through its programming. It provides all kinds of 
programming that people across the county appreciate, not the 
least of which is its news and public affairs programming.
<P>
	I point to the new specialty channel applications, for instance 
the proposed Bravo channel that would bring Canadian arts 
programming to the entire country at a much lower cost to 
subscribers than the CBC application. There are other ways of 
looking at it. There are other ways of bringing the country 
together that may not involve the CBC, or it may involve the 
CBC but a drastically reformed CBC.
<P>
	Since 1987 there has been a decline in arts and children's 
programming on CBC. We have seen all kinds of soap operas in 
the afternoon and sitcoms in the evening in an attempt to bring 
back viewers. That is redundant. That is ridiculous actually, 
when we think about it. CBC receives $1.1 billion to provide 
Canadian programming and we have these American sitcoms 
coming in on all kinds of other channels. I do not think it is the 
role of the CBC to be replaying American sitcoms. We have to 
get away from that. The CBC has to change.
<P>
	With respect to the hon. member, I think he is out of the loop if 
he does not recognize that the CBC has to change. I am not 
arguing that it should disappear, but it has to change. The friends 
of the CBC even point that out. It is time to bring some change to 
the CBC to try to make it more efficient and to respect the fact 
there are new forces in the country that will allow us to come 
together. We do not necessarily have to do it through the state 
sanctioned CBC.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I found absolutely dreadful the speech of the Reform 
Party member attacking one of our great institutions, the CBC, 
Radio-Canada in French. Being unilingual, he only mentioned 
the CBC and not Radio-Canada, but I imagine he meant both. I 
have a question for him.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	Does the member sincerely agree that we must have a united 
Canada, coast to coast, from North to South and East to West, a 
bilingual Canada with two official languages, a united country 
where the Canadian culture can progress and where we can 
create jobs or does he believe the only important thing for the 
CBC and Radio-Canada is the bottom line? Does he not see in 
the CBC and Radio-Canada a human asset, a window on the 
Canadian nation?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, in my vision of Canada I do not see 
it as a country that draws its culture from institutions. I do not 
think Canadian culture is a bureaucratic institution. Canadian 
culture is something that flows from the creative impulses of 
creative people.
<P>
	Whether those impulses are channelled through the CBC, a 
private broadcaster, a private art gallery or whatever is not 
important. What is important is that these people go out and do 
their thing. If it can happen more efficiently through the private 
sector or if it can happen through a reformed CBC-and I 
remind hon. members that their own government has called for 
the review of the CBC-that is what should happen.
<P>
	To hold on to some old, solid institution simply because it has 
been there for 50 years and not change it at all is absolutely 
ridiculous. It does not recognize that the world is changing and 
that Canadian artists and creators need all kinds of outlets to get 
their messages out. We should not necessarily have it flow 
mostly or completely through the state. That is a very bad idea. 
It is time to look at some new alternatives and it is probably the 
most human way to look at Canada's cultural industry.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the bill is a key element in a much larger process. Canadians told 
us they wanted a government that treated jobs as a priority. We 
have taken action on job creation through the infrastructure 
program and measures in the budget.
<P>
	The government has begun to address fundamental issues 
facing our social security system. We agree we need a system 
that encourages participation and gives people incentives to 
contribute to Canadian society.
<P>
	The current patchwork of programs no longer addresses the 
needs of Canadians. The bill underscores our commitment to 
Canadians that in two years we will be at the threshold of a new 
system. New ideas in social programs are being developed 
everywhere as part of the reform process. We have set aside 
funds to start work on some projects. The budget provides $800 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2839"> 2839 </A></B>
<P>
million for two years for joint strategic initiatives with 
provincial and territorial governments.
<P>
	The same search for innovation has shaped the design of the 
program we are establishing to assist people affected by the 
closure of the Atlantic fishery. The bill provides $1.7 billion of 
new money over the next five years through an Atlantic 
groundfish industry renewal and adjustment strategy to be 
developed in consultation with the public and private sectors.
<P>
	We are discussing with our partners the development of a 
number of new jobs through such initiatives as expansion of the 
eco-tourism industry and aquaculture industry and development 
of new energy sources or the development of rural amenities.
<P>
<B>(1255 ) </B>
<P>
	Our changes to unemployment insurance are good examples 
of real effort to find balance and create jobs. We have proposed 
four areas of change to the UI act.
<P>
	First, we will drop the 1995 premium rate to $3 and freeze or 
lower it for 1996, which businesses have assured us will create 
jobs. This premium rate will be 10 per cent lower than the $3.30 
rate that would otherwise be required under the UI act. Second, 
we will strengthen the link between work history and UI 
benefits. Third, we will increase benefits payable to low income 
beneficiaries with dependants. Fourth, we will improve the 
fairness of the UI program by amending and clarifying how the 
voluntary quit and misconduct measures are applied.
<P>
	Small business told us that any real effort to encourage job 
creation must look at the impact of payroll taxes such as UI. By 
reducing premiums we reduce the cost of employing people. For 
example, our premium cut and the subsequent freeze will save a 
business with 50 employees $15,000 during 1995 and 1996.
<P>
	How will we improve the linkages between work history and 
UI benefits? One would be by increasing the value we place on 
long term attachment to work and the other by raising the 
minimum entrance requirement to 12 from 10. The new rules 
recognize that no one has really gained from a system in which 
UI became a regular part of income instead of temporary support 
during unavoidable job losses.
<P>
	Leaders in Atlantic Canada have told us the 10-42 system has 
done more harm than good for their economies. With their help 
our social security reform will create a more effective system.
<P>
	It is not just in Atlantic Canada where this attitude of UI as a 
regular income is considered a problem. We have received 
letters from across the country telling us that UI should be 
available to help those in difficult situations and not be a way of 
life. We need something to break the cycle.
<P>
	I also take this opportunity to ensure that adequate support 
will be available to those most in need. The changes to UI 
increase the level of support for those with low income and 
dependants.
<P>
	As we begin to shift from our current set of programs to 
something more comprehensive, we have decided to reintroduce 
a principle that was part of UI for 30 years. To help reduce the 
incidence of 1.2 million children living in poverty we have 
established a benefit rate at 60 per cent for those with both low 
income and dependants. For other claimants the rate will be set 
at 55 per cent. Those with low insured earnings of $390 per week 
or less in 1994 and who have dependants will qualify for the 60 
per cent benefit rate.
<P>
	We have also taken action to reintroduce an element of 
fairness that was lost in changes regarding suspensions, leaves 
of absence and when a person quits shortly before a known 
layoff.
<P>
	First, if a worker is suspended from a job for more than a week 
the worker is considered to have been fired for misconduct. As a 
result the time worked before the suspension is not counted if 
the worker has to apply for UI benefits any time after the 
suspension is over.
<P>
	Second, if a worker takes a leave of absence from work the 
leave is considered to be voluntary separation from 
employment. As a result if the worker is subsequently laid off 
after returning to work he or she may have to requalify to receive 
UI benefits.
<P>
<B>(1300 ) </B>
<P>
	Third, if a worker quits a job one or two weeks before it would 
have ended anyway then the worker may be denied all UI 
benefits. These measures are unfair.
<P>
	We proposed that a period of suspension should not be treated 
as a loss of employment owing to misconduct. We propose that 
rules for leaves of absence be clarified so that workers who 
return to the workplace are not penalized.
<P>
	We propose that legislation be amended to provide greater 
flexibility in the rules for workers who leave a job that would 
have ended anyway.
<P>
	Another concern about the Unemployment Insurance Act is 
that too much pressure is placed on the worker claiming benefits 
to prove just cause for leaving employment. We propose that in 
cases in which information from both parties, the employer and 
the employee, is equally balanced that the legislation be 
amended to give the claimant the benefit of the doubt.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2840"> 2840 </A></B>
<P>
	Overall these changes to the UI program will be reducing 
program expenditures by $2.4 billion per year once phased in. 
This reduction is necessary to offset the loss in premium 
revenue as a result of rolling back the premium rate of $3. The 
changes also begin the process of reform.
<P>
	The bill provides the legislative flexibility needed to 
undertake a number of pilot projects aimed at improving the 
administrative efficiency of the UI program. The UI program 
contains several provisions introduced in the 1970s that 
arguably no longer fulfil the original purpose and only impose a 
heavy paper burden on employers and clients.
<P>
	The complexity of the current system has effects on 
employers, claimants and the government in the areas of cost, 
accuracy and levels of service. These pilot projects will test 
alternative methodologies to demonstrate that costs could be 
decreased, accuracy increased and service improved.
<P>
	There will be effects on UI claimants. This is a significant 
package of changes. Even now fully three-quarters of UI 
claimants return to work before their claims run out. The 
minister, members of the government and I want to work with 
the provinces to develop a common understanding of the 
implication of UI changes for provincial social assistance 
programs.
<P>
	Preliminary estimates of the potential effects for provincial 
social assistance costs are small but we are proposing that 
officials from both levels of government meet to refine these 
estimates.
<P>
	We would use some of the funds that have been made 
available for the joint strategic initiatives to help address the 
potential effect of the changes to the UI program. The 
government remains committed to preserving an unemployment 
insurance system that provides protection for Canadians who 
have lost their jobs and are seeking work, one that operates with 
financial integrity.
<P>
	Any substantial change to UI as part of the social security 
reform will happen only after Canadians have had a chance to 
think about their priorities. We recognize the concerns 
Canadians may have about our decisions but we have pursued a 
balanced approach to interim change. Canadians understand that 
unemployment insurance must evolve in concert with the rest of 
the social security system. However, UI is only one aspect of 
that system.
<P>
	To stabilize planning for both levels of government we have 
taken measures in this bill for other elements of the system, the 
Canada assistance plan and established programs financing. The 
cap on EPF for post-secondary education represents an 
important piece of the intergovernmental social policy 
framework. This bill stabilizes the planning framework for 
provinces and territories while we build a new system. CAP 
transfers will grow by about 5.4 per cent in 1994-95 and remain 
at that level until a new system is in place.
<P>
<B>(1305 ) </B>
<P>
	The joint strategic initiatives I discussed earlier will 
contribute additional funding to help provinces and territories to 
get started on testing new approaches and social security ideas.
<P>
	EPF is a core of federal support that benefits Canada's youth 
through the slightly more than $6 billion per year we provide for 
post-secondary education. The budget provides for modest 
growth in our transfers under this program.
<P>
	Funding for post-secondary education is only one aspect of 
our support for youth. We will pursue new approaches to 
internship, innovative alternatives that help young people with 
the transition from school to work. We are launching Youth 
Service Canada and will have program participants contributing 
to their communities and helping to protect our environment by 
this autumn.
<P>
	Mutual responsibility is a key principle driving our 
discussions about social security reform. The government will 
invest in people, but people must also make a contribution to 
society.
<P>
	Let me conclude by saying the government is committed to 
the issue of jobs and hope for Canada. It was our number one 
objective during the election and has been ever since. With this 
bill we have taken action. We have dropped payroll taxes to 
create a climate for job creation. At the same time we have 
created a stable planning framework for the period of change 
that lies ahead.
<P>
	During that time we will build a system which helps 
Canadians find jobs, skills and the sense of dignity they have so 
clearly requested.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the parliamentary secretary's comments. I know 
unemployment is a big problem.
<P>
	I hate to always bring up the subject of agriculture, but being 
from Manitoba it is very important to me. I wonder if the Liberal 
government would take into account that there are 
approximately 240,000 farmers in western Canada. According 
to Stats Canada's latest figures, these farmers earned an average 
of $16,000 a year before depreciation. It also showed that these 
farmers earned $32,000 a year from off farm jobs. If we could 
put agriculture back on a profitable basis there would be 
240,000 jobs available to somebody else.
<P>
	We have lost sight of the fact that agriculture is still the basic 
industry in western Canada. We have to make this industry 
profitable in order to provide other jobs.
<P>
	Looking into the agriculture industry, we see that 500,000 
jobs are created in the processing and retailing of agricultural 
foods. It is very important we make this industry viable again.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2841"> 2841 </A></B>
<P>
	I would appreciate the parliamentary secretary's comments 
on this.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bevilacqua:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. 
member for his question.
<P>
	As a government we are concerned about agriculture and the 
benefits which we draw as a nation from the production and sale 
of agricultural products. There is a great willingness in the 
government to bring about positive change to the lives of 
Canadians, whether they are affected by agriculture or the 
deindustrialization of the manufacturing base in Ontario.
<P>
	On October 25 we received a mandate for change. People were 
tired of working harder and earning less money. Our young 
people were tired and feeling really hopeless about their 
prospects. That is true whether they lived on a farm or in a city. 
People felt that the rules for membership in our society had 
changed. Basically they were asking for vehicles of opportunity, 
a way once again to participate fully in the life of the nation.
<P>
<B>(1310 ) </B>
<P>
	In the last budget and in the throne speech we began a process 
as a government in co-operation with the people of Canada to 
redesign a new vision for the nation. That is why we entered into 
the very extensive process of reforming Canada's social 
programs.
<P>
	Many governments in the past shied away from that. They 
were afraid, perhaps of the misunderstandings, of the code 
words. They were afraid to face the challenge of saying to 
people that the systems were no longer working and new ways of 
giving Canada a better social security system should be looked 
at.
<P>
	We have accepted the challenge. We have said that 
unemployment insurance as it exists today simply does not 
reflect contemporary reality. Young people have asked for a 
vehicle of opportunity, something to have during the transition 
period between school and work. Therefore we are looking at 
internship and apprenticeship training programs, the Canadian 
youth corps.
<P>
	We have told small business we understand when they say too 
much stress is placed on them. We therefore have decreased 
payroll taxes, the UI premiums.
<P>
	We are doing many things to make people come together 
rather than split apart. That was the legacy of 10 years under the 
Conservatives where we saw polarization of classes and people 
really losing hope in our country. It is our number one challenge.
<P>
	A very important part of this new vision we speak and act 
upon every day since the October 25 election is the people who 
are involved in the agricultural sector of Canada. We value the 
commitment and dedication they have made to developing a 
better society for all Canadians. The challenges are great. There 
is no question about that.
<P>
	The measures we have taken in the budget set a direction but 
they are interim measures. There is much work to do. We have 
seen that we need to modernize and restructure our economy. We 
have to give Canadians tools to become productive, to share in 
the national vision that speaks to regaining the values that made 
this country a great nation.
<P>
	I am, as you are, extremely tired of going into cities and towns 
where people are lining up at food banks, where we have the 
problems of latchkey kids, where our young students are not 
looking to the future in a positive way.
<P>
	Our mission is to take back our communities. Our mission is 
to take back our nation, to give it back to the people. Together 
there is great potential to increase the quality of life for 
everyone who resides here.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with 
much attention to my hon. friend and his very thoughtful 
presentation.
<P>
	Many questions could be asked but I want to take advantage of 
the fact that he represents a Toronto constituency. As such he 
knows the special burdens someone from our large urban areas 
has to face.
<P>
	I notice that when this bill was first introduced the President 
of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for 
Infrastructure drew attention to the Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police and the tremendous contribution they make to our 
country, and their international reputation.
<P>
<B>(1315 ) </B>
<P>
	The freeze that was applied to the members of the RCMP 
along with others and the fact that no increments are allowed for 
two years place tremendous pressure on new constables as they 
leave the training facilities in Regina to go out and assume 
responsible positions around the country.
<P>
	Their take home pay is about $1,800 a month. Even in 
Kamloops which is a lot smaller than Toronto I have had 
constables come to me with a breakdown of their monthly 
expenses. Living incredibly modestly they cannot live on 
$1,800 a month. That is in Kamloops. I can only imagine how 
much more of a problem that would be in a city like Toronto.
<P>
	Would my hon. colleague consider taking back this kind of 
concern to the President of the Treasury Board. When one makes 
a freeze across a whole spectrum it might not have much of an 
effect on a public servant making $120,000 a year but it 
certainly will impact seriously on someone who brings home 
$1,800 a month and expects to raise a family on that.
<P>
	Could I get some response from my friend. Will he raise with 
the President of the Treasury Board the plight that these new 
constables face in the RCMP when they are unable to have any 
increments when normally they would expect six increments-

<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order please. The time is up. Please be 
brief in reply.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bevilacqua:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be extremely brief in 
giving my assurances to the hon. member that I will bring his 
concerns to the attention of the President of the Treasury Board.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne):</B> Mr. Speaker, today we 
have an opportunity to speak on Bill C-17. This five-part 
omnibus bill makes major changes to unemployment insurance.
<P>
	The minister presents us with a bill, let me point out, dealing 
with compensation in the public sector, the Canada Assistance 
Plan, public utilities income tax transfers, various 
transportation subsidies, the CBC's borrowing authority and 
finally changes to the Unemployment Insurance Plan. Once 
again, it is quite a hodgepodge. The more things change, the 
more they are the same.
<P>
	Radical changes are put in a bill without any specific 
orientation and we are told to take the whole thing as is. I will 
remind the Liberals, in case they no longer remember, that they 
were elected with a clear objective, supposedly to create jobs. 
But again, nothing, I repeat, nothing, has been done to achieve 
this objective.
<P>
	A catch-all infrastructure program will create barely 40,000 
temporary jobs, at an astronomical cost. I give you the figures 
quoted by the Liberals themselves; 40,000 new jobs is very nice, 
but if they achieve 100 per cent of their objective, they will not 
even have reached 10 per cent of the unemployed young people 
in this country. According to Statistics Canada, in February 
1994, 428,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were collecting 
unemployment insurance, and the Liberals are proud that they 
may create 40,000 temporary jobs in a few years.
<P>
	This government really shows disrespect for the people. If the 
Liberals cannot take significant action, even for the 15-24 age 
group, we can well wonder when people, seeing construction 
trucks driving around, as the Prime Minister said, will regain 
confidence in the economy, confidence in the government and 
confidence in general. So, as my fellow member from Mercier 
proposes, we should amend Bill C-17 so that it contains specific 
measures to reduce youth unemployment.
<P>
	Furthermore, how can the minister bring in such a bill 
considerably modifying unemployment insurance while at the 
same time he is launching a Canada-wide consultation on how 
UI works? Strange. We can well wonder about this consultation 
or these consultations. In fact, what have the Liberals done since 
they came to power?
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	In finance, Canada-wide consultations, and bogus ones at 
that, as confirmed by the budget. In defence, they have struck a 
joint committee, with senators. Nothing but the best. Again, 
consultations. In foreign affairs, another joint  committee. We 
really have to thank our senators for their contribution. 
Consultation again. In social programs, consultation. How 
wonderful!
<P>
	A question comes to mind. I would like to know-and I would 
like comments on that later, please-if Liberals are totally 
devoid of ideas and opinions after nine years in opposition and, 
if so, how does it feel coming in from the cold after nine years? 
It was a rude awakening, was it not? One can certainly wonder, 
seeing that nearly six months into their mandate, the Liberals 
remain incapable of making decisions or making sensible ones 
when they do.
<P>
	Through UI cuts, the Liberals hoped to save $5.5 billion 
dollars, over three years that is, and in a clearly inequitable 
fashion, as Atlantic Canada and Quebec will bear the brunt of 
the cuts. In fact, Atlantic Canada will suffer a shortfall of about 
$630 million, while Quebec will lose some $735 million a year 
in revenue. With 25 per cent of the population of Canada, 
Quebec will actually foot 31 per cent of the cuts announced by 
the minister. So, as you pointed out, and rightly so, it does 
happen that people get more than their fair share from the 
federal government. But in this case, it is at our expense.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I would like to read you a quote from the red 
book that I have used in a previous speech: ``-cynicism about 
public institutions, governments, politicians, and the political 
process is at an all-time high. If government is to play a positive 
role in society, as it must, honesty and integrity in our political 
institutions must be restored.'' I agree with that statement. I 
agree with the Liberals on that. I do not agree on everything but 
on that, I do. I will be bringing this up often because they are not 
acting accordingly and it is true that we must all work together 
to restore confidence in this place.
<P>
	But what kind of cry from the heart will it take to make our 
friends opposite show a little good faith in their 
decision-making? In examining the budget papers, we see that 
this year's budget for the Governor General's office is $10 
million. Ten million! One hundred million will be spent over 
five years for educational videos. One hundred million over five 
years, while the provinces and the unemployed have to shoulder 
$5.5 billion! And this is supposed to restore some confidence in 
our institutions.
<P>
	If we are to make any headway at all in resolving the 
unemployment problem in Canada and Quebec, we have to 
consider occupational training. I would like the minister to 
explain to us how responsibility for occupational training is to 
be shared and what his position on this issue is. Under the 
Constitution, occupational training is a provincial matter, one 
which falls, therefore, in Quebec's jurisdiction. It arises from 
the province's exclusive jurisdiction over education. In 1942, 
Ottawa encroached on this and several others fields by virtue of 
its jurisdiction over unemployment insurance and its spending 
power. Increasingly, the  federal government has meddled in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2843"> 2843 </A></B>
<P>
fields such as worker placement and the funding of occupational 
training.
<P>
	Since the unemployment insurance reform of 1989, the 
federal government has used the Unemployment Insurance 
Account for training purposes. At the same time, it has 
considerably expanded its field of intervention to include 
helping labour markets adjust to the opening up of markets and 
free trade.
<P>
	A total of some thirty initiatives have been grouped into four 
major programs, namely Labour Market Information, 
Community Futures, Employability Improvement and Labour 
Market Adjustment. The last two programs offer services to 
individuals and businesses, respectively. At the same time, 
Quebec adopted a similar program structure as recently as 1992. 
It entrusted its management to the Société québécoise de 
développement de la main-d'oeuvre or SQDM, a partnership 
between the private and public sectors.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	To finance these services, the federal government's 
contribution to labour force training and adjustment in Quebec 
amounts to a little over $900 million for 1993-94. Of this 
amount, $320 million comes from the Consolidated Revenue 
Fund, or $150 million less than three years ago.
<P>
	As for administration at the federal level, the Quebec region, 
which is described as one region among many others, is divided 
into ten networks roughly equivalent to the Quebec 
administrative division. About 100 Canada Employment 
Centres are responsible for administering unemployment 
insurance and managing manpower programs in their respective 
areas.
<P>
	Each of these employment and immigration centres has its 
own local planning strategy or LPS. It includes some degree of 
co-operation with Quebec.
<P>
	Last April, the job training centre network in Quebec was 
converted into 10 regional branches of the SQDM. In 
association with local partners, each of them is responsible for 
the management of Quebec manpower programs. Their action 
largely depends on federal funds and is often incompatible with 
the LPS, and federal priorities are applied to the regions.
<P>
	Through its spending power and its jurisdiction over 
unemployment insurance, the federal government's power on 
job training in Quebec is practically absolute. This power was 
reinforced with unemployment insurance reform in 1989 when 
it became the federal government's favoured intervention tool in 
labour force adjustment and free trade.
<P>
	Quebec's role has been reduced to that of a mere manager of 
some federal programs, as demonstrated by the January 1993 
conference of federal and provincial employment ministers. 
Despite unanimous support by Quebec labour market partners 
and the creation of an administrative structure adapted to its 
needs, the SQDM, the federal government refuses to withdraw 
from this  area and to transfer the allocated funds. It has kept its 
network of Canada Employment Centres despite Quebec's 
decisions.
<P>
	At the federal level, manpower adjustment services offered by 
the federal government are divided into four main programs and 
27 components. The result is something that can be a real 
headache for clients.
<P>
	There are over 100 criteria, depending on the type of client, 
available resources and also on the region and local CECs. There 
should be three sets of priorities: national, regional and local. 
However, under this system, the needs of Quebec and local 
organizations are ignored. The result: unemployed workers who 
are wasting their time and courses for which there is no demand.
<P>
	Quebec has two sets of programs administered by two 
separate networks: the manpower development corporations or 
SQDM, as I said earlier, and the Quebec labour centres. The first 
set of programs has 15 components and is aimed at people on 
welfare. The other set consists of ten operations which, since 
last year, have been regrouped in three main programs intended 
for businesses, individuals and victims of mass lay-offs, 
respectively. This adds up to a total of 25 programs.
<P>
	The cost of operating all these programs is about $580 million 
for the federal government and about $70 million for Quebec, 
with $62 million being spent on the SQDM, the Quebec 
manpower development corporation.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	My point is that it is high time we patriated this sector and put 
it under Quebec control. Another aspect of this bill seems rather 
absurd. I am referring to the premium rate of $3.07 for every 
$100 of insurable earnings which in January 1995 will be rolled 
back to $3. Remember, it was the Liberals who raised the rate 
from $3 to $3.07.
<P>
	According to the Liberals, the roll-back planned for next year 
will help create 40,000 new jobs in 1996.
<P>
	We will try to give a brief analysis of the Liberal approach to 
this question. It may seem complicated, but we will give it a try. 
Our conclusion will be somewhat Kafkaesque, to use a favourite 
expression of the hon. member for Verchères. Let me explain.
<P>
	According to the old formula, unemployment insurance 
premiums would be as follows: in 1993, $3 for every $100 of 
insurable earnings; in 1994, $3.07, which is what we have now; 
and in 1995, premiums were to be raised to $3.30 per $100 of 
insurable earnings. According to the government's proposal, 
premiums which were at $3 per $100 of insurable earnings in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2844"> 2844 </A></B>
<P>
1993 will be raised to $3.07 as of January, which is the case now, 
but the rate will be reduced to $3 in 1995.
<P>
	Let us see what happens if we pursue this scenario.
<P>
	If the Liberals had maintained the old premium formula, we 
would have lost 9,000 jobs in 1994 and 31,000 jobs the year 
after. By raising premiums to $3.07, the Liberals get the 
following result: 9,000 jobs lost in 1994 they realize that, they 
said so themselves and 9,000 jobs gained in 1995, which means 
a grand total of zero. We lose 9,000 this year, we create 9,000 the 
year after, and the result is zilch. Wow, that is really something. 
Or so they say.
<P>
	Actually we are not talking about 40,000 new jobs but 31,000 
jobs saved and 9,000 new jobs after losing 9,000. Obviously, the 
end result of their excellent theory is zero.
<P>
	We must conclude that once again, the government is trying to 
fool the public, but today's public is better informed and no 
longer prepared to swallow this kind of proposal.
<P>
	In any event, it is clear that the previous government was a 
failure and that the Liberals will not be an improvement. The 
government should no longer play a leading role in creating 
jobs. Recent figures have shown that small businesses have been 
the main source of new jobs during the past few years and will 
continue to play that role. The Liberals realize that. Give credit 
where credit is due.
<P>
	Today, for investors and small businesses, the government's 
role should be to protect public finances. A good government 
should control its spending. A good government should control 
the deficit, and by the same token, a good government will 
restore a climate of confidence.
<P>
	The economy is based on confidence, and governments-I 
said governments-undermine that confidence by being 
inconsistent and have done so for far too long. To create 
employment we do not need construction equipment, as the 
Prime Minister seems to think. We need to restore a healthy 
climate of confidence that will encourage genuine economic 
recovery, which in turn will attract investment and by the same 
token create jobs, durable jobs.
<P>
	However, we are convinced that because of overlapping 
programs and interdepartmental duplication, the federal 
government will never manage to meet this very simple 
objective. However, a sovereign Quebec that is master of its own 
destiny and controls the levers of its economy and 
decision-making processes will be able to meet this immense 
challenge. There is no doubt about that. We know, as Félix told 
us, that the best way to kill a man is to keep him from working.

<P>

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. Clair):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise today in this debate to speak to the 
government's proposed changes to the unemployment insurance 
program and in particular those changes that address the 
problems of low income Canadians and their dependants.
<P>
	These changes to unemployment insurance are the first step 
toward a reform of our social security programs. They are the 
first step toward making these programs more responsive to the 
needs of Canadians as this country enters the 21st century.
<P>
	The government is not taking this step unilaterally. The 
Minister of Finance engaged in extensive discussions with 
Canadians before bringing down the 1994 budget. The Minister 
of Human Resources Development has consulted and will 
continue to consult with business, labour and Canadians from 
every walk of life about social security reform.
<P>
	This government knows that the life of every Canadian will be 
affected for many years to come by the results of this reform. 
That is why we are taking steps to ensure that Canadians will 
receive maximum benefits from these changes.
<P>
	We have also taken special measures in our proposed changes 
to the unemployment insurance plan to protect those Canadians 
who are most vulnerable, those with low incomes who support 
children, aged parents or other dependants.
<P>
	Under the current unemployment insurance rules, people who 
claim unemployment receive a benefit rate of 57 per cent no 
matter what their circumstances. Under our proposed changes 
there would be a two part benefit rate, 60 per cent for those with 
lower incomes who have dependants and 55 per cent for all 
others.
<P>
	To qualify for the higher benefit rate a claimant must have 
insurable earnings of $390 per week or less and have 
dependants. This would entitle the claimant to $234 weekly in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2845"> 2845 </A></B>
<P>
unemployment insurance benefits. However, this government 
does not want rigid rules regarding  eligibility to hurt those in 
need whose weekly incomes may be slightly more than $390.
<P>
	Accordingly, we have also proposed that all claimants with 
insurable earnings between $390 and $425 receive the same 
weekly benefit of $234. All those with insurable earnings over 
$425 will receive 55 per cent of their earnings as benefits. We 
estimate that this will improve benefits for 15 per cent of 
unemployment insurance claimants or about 250,000 Canadians 
and their families.
<P>
	The economic restructuring of our country owing to the forces 
of globalization and technology is creating a society 
increasingly divided between those who have well paying, 
secure, skilled jobs and those who are doing part time, low paid 
temporary work without the benefit or hope of advancement.
<P>
	The segment of our population that has been hardest hit by 
this trend is women, in particular women with children. 
Women's roles in our society have undergone enormous changes 
since the social security system was first established.
<P>
	Thirty years ago Canadians believed that most women would 
get married, have children and stay home to take care of their 
families. That was in the days when one wage earner could 
easily feed and care for a family and still put money aside for a 
holiday. Times have certainly changed. Today it takes two wage 
earners for most families to keep their heads above the poverty 
line.
<P>
<B>(1340 ) </B>
<P>
	Women now represent 45 per cent of the Canadian workforce. 
Unfortunately most of these women work for low wages. On 
average a Canadian woman working full time today earns just 72 
cents for every dollar earned by a man. Those statistics say it all.
<P>
	In 1990 about 5.4 million working Canadians received a total 
income of less than $10,000. Of these, 64 per cent were women. 
At the other end of this scale the picture is entirely different. In 
1990, 3.3 million working Canadians received a total income of 
$40,000 or more. Of these, only 22 per cent were women.
<P>
	Most working women in Canada have children. Many of these 
women are single parents bearing full responsibility for their 
children. The result is one of the most unacceptable facts of life 
in Canada: We still have 1.5 million children living in poverty. 
This is an unacceptable situation for one of the wealthiest 
nations on earth.
<P>
	Our proposal to provide greater unemployment insurance 
assistance to those with low incomes and dependants will have 
an immediate impact on those Canadians most in need: the 
women and children of this country who are having trouble 
making ends meet.
<P>
	Providing greater unemployment insurance assistance to low 
income Canadians with dependants is a signal to all Canadians 
that this government believes in equity and fairness. We want to 
make sure that if we have fewer unemployment insurance 
dollars that those dollars we do have will go to the people whose 
need is greater.
<P>
	The proposals set out in the 1994 budget to change the 
unemployment insurance program are important first steps but 
they are only interim measures.
<P>
	The reform of social security programs is essential if we are to 
meet head on the challenges of the 1990s and beyond. We can no 
longer use an outdated system to solve modern problems. It just 
is not working. We have too many people without jobs, too many 
families under stress, too many young people who have given up 
hope and too many Canadians who have lost their confidence in 
the future.
<P>
	We cannot achieve change unless we shed the policies of the 
past that simply are not doing the job that they are supposed to 
do. We cannot achieve change if we try to cut and paste 
programs, patching something here and adding something there. 
We cannot achieve change unless we are willing to lay the 
system bare, putting every component under scrutiny.
<P>
	This government believes we have to start with a clean slate 
and create a new framework for our social safety net. That is 
why this government is undertaking the most significant and 
wide ranging review of our social security programs in Canada's 
history.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I think it is understood that the member 
is dividing her time with a colleague. Nobody is standing on 
questions or comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rex Crawford (Kent):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives me great 
pleasure to rise today on behalf of my constituents and speak 
about Bill C-17, an act to implement the first Liberal budget in 
10 years.
<P>
	The budget shows we have a game plan and that we are going 
to stick to it. We are delivering on our commitments, funding 
every key initiative in the red book. With our top priorities of 
jobs and growth, we are offering a balanced approach with 
emphasis on economic renewal, deficit reduction and social 
reform.
<P>
	As represented by Bill C-17 presented by my friend and 
colleague the Minister of Finance, we are renewing our 
commitment to economic justice for a fair and lasting prosperity 
that can put Canadians back to work.
<P>
	We have all come through a vigorous election campaign. 
Everyone had their losses, but the pain of our defeats is far less 
than the pain of the people I have met.
<P>
<B>(1345 ) </B>
<P>
	We have learned it is important to take issues seriously but 
never to take ourselves too seriously. I am sure we share the 
same cause, the cause of the common man and the common 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2846"> 2846 </A></B>
<P>
woman. Since the days of Laurier, King, St. Laurent, Trudeau, 
Turner and now Chrétien, our commitment has always been to 
those humble people of  our society, the farmers, the labourers 
and all others who work day in and day out to provide a better 
life for their families.
<P>
	This budget continues that firm commitment, clearly 
establishing a framework for economic renewal and investing in 
the skills of Canadians. We support job creation with the 
national infrastructure program, youth internship and 
apprenticeship programs.
<P>
	Unlike the previous Conservative government the new 
Liberal government has pledged that we will never misuse 
unemployment, high interest rates and human misery as false 
weapons against inflation.
<P>
	We have pledged that employment is the first priority of our 
economic policy. A rollback of the unemployment insurance 
premium rate to the 1993 level of $3 for 1995 and 1996 saves 
businesses over $300 million a year which can be reinvested in 
new jobs. A Canada investment fund to provide venture capital 
for innovative companies and a Canadian technology network to 
help small business to get access to new technology are just two 
examples.
<P>
	Small business is the backbone of the economy and that is 
where we have placed our emphasis. These are not simplistic 
pledges; they are the heart of our tradition. They have been the 
soul of our party across generations. It is the glory and the 
greatness of our Liberal tradition to speak for those who have no 
voice, to remember those who are forgotten, to respond to the 
frustrations and fulfil the aspirations of all Canadians seeking a 
better life in a better land.
<P>
	Programs may sometimes become obsolete but the idea of 
fairness always endures. Circumstances may change but the 
work of compassion must continue. It is correct we cannot solve 
problems by throwing money at them, but it is also correct that 
we dare not throw our national problems on to the scrap heap of 
inattention and indifference.
<P>
	The poor may be out of political fashion but they are not 
without human needs. The middle class may be angry but they 
have not lost the dream that all Canadians can advance together. 
Canadians are tired of changes that merely nibble at the edges. 
We will implement bold, sweeping reforms that will ensure 
Canadians can adapt to the challenges of the new economy. We 
need to build bridges to work, to independence, not dependence. 
We must better deliver to those in need and at the same time 
make sure the social safety net remains affordable.
<P>
	We will overhaul these programs to help Canadians move into 
the workforce. The demand of our people in 1994 is definitely 
not for bigger government but for better government. Some say 
government is always bad and that spending for basic social 
programs is the root of our economic evil, but the present 
recession and unemployment rates cost our economy billions of 
dollars every year. Unemployment and recession are the biggest 
spenders of all.
<P>
	We are the party that brought the Canada pension plan and 
medicare to the nation. We have always been the party of hope. 
With the budget of my friend and colleague, the Minister of 
Finance, we are offering new hope to a Canada uncertain about 
the present but unsurpassed in its potential for the future.
<P>
	To all those overburdened by an unfair tax structure let us 
provide new hope for real tax reform. Instead of shutting down 
hospital wings let us shut off tax shelters. The budget closes 
loopholes and brings greater fairness to the tax system.
<P>
	During the recent election campaign I listened and learned 
from the people of my riding of Kent, the heart of southwestern 
Ontario.
<P>
<B>(1350 ) </B>
<P>
	I listened to a factory worker in Chatham, Ontario who had six 
children to support and was going to her factory shift. I listened 
to a Motor Wheel employee with four kids and many bills who 
lost his job after 25 years at the plant. It is now an empty shell of 
a building, shut down, throwing hundreds on the unemployment 
lines. I listened to a farm family in Howard township who 
wonder whether they can pass the good life and the good earth on 
to their children. I listened to a grandmother in a seniors home in 
Dresden who has only the old age pension to make ends meet and 
wants her remaining years to be dignified and decent. I listened 
to a 23-year old out of work, to students without the tuition for 
university or college and to families without the chance to own a 
home.
<P>
	In my riding especially I have seen the closed factories and 
the stalled assembly lines of Chatham and Kent county. I have 
seen far too many idle men and women desperate for work. I 
have seen far too many working families desperate to put food 
on the table, to make the hydro, mortgage and car payments with 
one parent either working or laid off while being taxed to the 
hilt.
<P>
	As I arrived at 4.30 every morning at the plant gates during the 
election, I also sensed a yearning for new hope among the people 
at every factory and every corner store. I felt it in their 
handshakes. I saw it in their faces. I shall never forget the 
mothers who had to work on the 5 a.m. shift to earn enough 
money to feed their children.
<P>
	I shall always remember the veterans in the Royal Canadian 
Legions and the seniors in nursing homes who have lived in a 
Canada of high purpose and who believe it can all happen again. 
They are all optimistic. If only they had a government that was 
on their side, a government that spoke out for the little guy.
<P>
	I believe we are that government. Today in their name, for the 
people of Kent, I am here to speak for them. It is an honour and a 
privilege to be a member of Parliament, but our highest duty, our 
overriding passion is to stand with our constituents to express 
the thoughts and concerns of those who do not have paid 
<P>

<B><A NAME="2847"> 2847 </A></B>
<P>
lobbyists to do their bidding or special interest groups to fax 
dozens of pages of information across the country.
<P>
	My special interest group is my constituents and I will fight 
for them every day. I am proud to support the government and 
Bill C-17.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate the member opposite for his comments.
<P>
	I wonder if the hon. member would expand on one thing he 
touched on in his speech. It was also in the presentation of the 
Liberal member who preceded him. It is the effect of part-time 
employment on a community. In particular, I wonder if the 
member opposite has given any thought to extending benefits to 
part-time employees. As many members are aware, a very high 
percentage of people are in our workforce now only because 
they are consistently able to get part-time employment and they 
have two or three part-time jobs.
<P>
	I wonder if the member opposite could comment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crawford:</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank the hon. member 
for his question.
<P>
	In my riding of Kent, which is the most depressed area in 
Ontario at the present time, part-time work is about the only 
type of job people can get.
<P>
	Personally, I support benefits for part-time workers. I also 
feel that people who are on welfare should be allowed to work to 
top up their benefits without penalty. If people do find part-time 
work, as soon as they are laid off, which is usually within a few 
short weeks, then it is another battle to get back on the rolls 
again.
<P>
	We have been promoting, and I think we have the hon. 
member's support, an ethanol plant in the city of Chatham. This 
$170 million plant will employ only 90 to 100 people within the 
plant. Outside the plant over 400 will benefit from it. It is 
something I have been trying to get through the government with 
the help of the opposition parties. I hope the hon. member will 
support it because I certainly support his views to a great extent.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with great interest to both the previous presentations. I wonder 
if the member would care to comment on the situation of 
students.
<P>
	At the present time young people are having a particularly 
difficult existence. We are encouraging them to stay in school. 
We are encouraging them to get training. However the costs of 
school and the costs of training become more and more arduous.
<P>
	We really must look at different ways for students to pay back 
their loans, in particular ways which mean that graduating 
students who get very low paying jobs do not have to pay their 
student loan immediately. Later those loans could be paid back 
in proportion to the money they earn, in proportion to the tax 
they pay, rather than in a very fixed period of time which really 
works against those who cannot early on in their careers obtain 
well paying jobs.
<P>
	I wonder if the member would care to comment on that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crawford:</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank the hon. member 
for his question pertaining to students and repaying their loans.
<P>
	I have had many students come to my office, especially over 
the last two weeks when we had a break, who are worried about 
this. They are now being billed by the banks and they do not have 
jobs.
<P>
	The government through supporting job creation, youth 
internship and apprenticeship programs will certainly help to 
alleviate their problems.
<P>
	I cannot give a figure on how much money right now, but I was 
talking to UIC and it is putting quite a few students back to work 
right now. UIC is giving them the opportunity to carry on their 
education or to be able to pay off the money they owe. The 
government is on the right track in helping these students and I 
certainly support it 100 per cent.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Kootenay West. The hon. 
member will note the time. Perhaps he would like to begin his 
statement but I would be interrupting him. If not, I could go to 
Statements by Members.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> Mr. Speaker, with all due respect, if I may make 
my full speech immediately after I would much prefer that.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Is it agreed then?
<P>

	It being two o'clock, pursuant to Standing Order 30(5), the

	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
following Montreal's selection as the host community for the

been described by some as an island in the middle of an open 
dump, as the worst city from an environmental standpoint not 
only in

deep-seated contempt and are cause for indignation.
<P>
	The Mayor of Montreal, Mr. Jean Doré, has reacted to these 
comments and has issued an update on the major achievements 
of the Montreal Urban Community in the field of sewage 
treatment. A number of important sewage treatment projects are 
in the works. In truth, Montreal has nothing to learn from other 
Canadian cities as far as this or any other field is concerned.
<P>
	In our opinion, this kind of thinly veiled insult directed at 
Montreal only serves once again to tarnish the image of this city 
and of Quebec. It is an instance of provocation which must be 
denounced.

winter. One was the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, 
also known as GATT. The other was Vince Gatt, president of the 
greater Peterborough Chamber of Commerce.
<P>
	Mr. Gatt and I do not always see eye to eye but I was delighted 
to see the Peterborough Chamber of Commerce wholeheartedly 
endorsing the National Chamber of Commerce program called 
Aim for a Million. This is a plan to create a million new jobs 
across Canada. Peterborough's share of this target is in the 
thousands.
<P>
	Although the government can play key roles in job creation 
such as stimulating the economy, creating short term jobs and 
ensuring we have a trained workforce, in the end jobs are created 
by businesses. Many of those businesses belong to our 
Chambers of Commerce. I welcome the chamber's initiative in 
setting its sights on job creation. We need partners of this type.

<P>
	The Bank of Montreal is the first company outside of the 
United States to receive the Catalyst award. This award 
recognizes companies that implement successful and 
meaningful employment programs.
<P>
	The bank has made big strides in a short period of time to 
bring job equity to the workplace. It has increased its number of 
female executives from 9 per cent to 13 per cent. It has also 
increased the number of females in senior management from 13 
per cent to 17 per cent.
<P>
	What is remarkable is that this has been done without reverse 
discrimination or affirmative action programs. It adopted 
flexible work programs to meet the personal and professional 
needs of all its employees.

	The Bank of Montreal has shown how fair mindedness when 
offering opportunity results in competent and committed

	<B>Mrs. Jean Payne (St. John's West):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is an 
old Chinese proverb which says that a long journey starts with 
the first step.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate and thank 
my colleague, the Minister of Finance, because his budget is a 
giant step toward the journey back to fiscal stability in Canada.
<P>
	His budget is a realistic approach to the problems that have 
plagued our nation for a long time. The measures the budget 
proposes will allow us to both provide the jobs people need and 
gradually reduce the deficit in a sensible manner.
<P>
	The provision of employment is especially important in the 
riding of St. John's West which I have the honour to represent. It 
is especially important to the province of Newfoundland and 
Labrador. It is also important to Atlantic Canada where 
unemployment has been unacceptably high for as long as 
anybody can remember.
<P>
	The benefits of this budget have already been seen. Recent 
unemployment figures are down nationally and in 
Newfoundland. We should continue our efforts to reduce those 
figures and that is going to be the goal of this government.
<P>
	It is encouraging to note the extremely strong commitment 
this government has demonstrated toward the survival of the 
fishing industry in Newfoundland and Labrador and in the riding 
of St. John's West. During the next five years the government 
has committed $1.9 billion in assistance to Atlantic Canadian 
fisherpeople and plant workers. The government is putting the 
money where it is really needed.
<P>
	It should be noted well that this long term approach is a vote 
of confidence in the fishing industry that is so vital to the people 
of St. John's West and to the entire province.

	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Dartmouth):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to express grave concern about published reports in today's

on black civil rights leaders in the province of Nova Scotia 
during the 1960s and 1970s.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
	The documents were released only after an access to 
information request by a Nova Scotia newspaper. Although 
highly censored they still contain unacceptable racial 
stereotypical references to blacks such as portraying black 
women as prolific child bearers and black men as layabouts and 
thieves.
<P>

<P>
	This whole episode would be disturbing enough if these 
reports were written by any RCMP surveillance officer. 
However some of the most racially insensitive comments were 
in reports by Mr. William Higgitt who went on to become the 
commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
<P>
	I ask the Solicitor General today to personally undertake a 
review of all of the uncensored documentation relating to this 
issue in an effort to search out and if found, stamp out any 
institutionalized racism in Canada's federal forces, the RCMP 
and CSIS.

<P>
	In the time it takes to read this statement over 200 children

	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday 
the NDP member for Kamloops stated that his friends in Quebec 
should shut up and stop talking about sovereignty because that 
implies the destruction of Canada and makes international 
lending agencies uneasy.
<P>
	Such a statement calls for an indignant reaction. Markets are 
soft because of the pitiful state of Canada's public finances, 
which is the making of the federal system and should not be 
blamed on the people of Quebec. As it is, this uncertainty is a 
sure sign of the failure of this system.
<P>
	Furthermore, the process the people of Quebec have 
embarked upon is legitimate; they want to assert themselves as a 
nation. They are not trying to destroy Canada, but rather to build 
their own country.

which stated Revenue Canada was about to garnishee his income 
tax refund to pay off an outstanding student loan.
<P>
	However, Mr. McIntosh has no outstanding student loan. In 
1972 he paid it off in full. Now, 22 years later the government 
claims he still owes 75 cents principal and $39 in interest 
accrued. The error is with the government that delayed the 
processing of the payment 22 years ago. This is ridiculous.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="THEBUDGET">THE BUDGET</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, my question is directed to the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Economists and financial analysts are practically unanimous 
in saying that the falling dollar and the increased spread between 
American and Canadian interest rates are mainly due to the 
federal budget's lack of credibility. The government has failed 
to convince financial markets that it is determined to fight the 
deficit and put public finances on a sound footing, and taxpayers 
are paying for this with increased interest rates.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister agree that the rise in interest rates as 
a result of the Bank of Canada's decision to stop the dollar from 
sliding further is mainly the result of a negative assessment by 
financial markets which are disappointed in the deficit 
reduction measures proposed in the budget?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
disagree with the hon. member's hypothesis. The budget we 
brought down in this House in February was well received. I 
agree there was some movement in the markets last week, but 
everyone agrees these fluctuations were caused by a very 
volatile situation on the international scene, and everything 
seems to be back to normal.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance and I have made it clear that the 
government's plan is straightforward: we want to meet our 
objective to reduce the deficit to 3 per cent of GDP by the end of 
our third year, and we are convinced that we will meet our 
objectives.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister forgot to mention that most 
economists and financial analysts who examined what caused 
the financial instability of the past few weeks referred to the 
Budget and the concern shown by financial markets about the 
govern-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2852"> 2852 </A></B>
<P>
ment's failure to cut where it should cut, in other words, public 
spending.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister agree that the negative assessment of 
the financial community will add another $3 billion to his deficit 
and that rising interest rates will compromise economic 
recovery and job creation as a result of a lack of confidence 
among consumers and investors?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we are certainly not satisfied with the situation, but I think 
everyone will agree that we have made considerable progress on 
the employment side, because 114,000 new jobs were created in 
February and March of this year alone and the unemployment 
rate went down from 11.6 per cent to 10.6 per cent, between the 
time this government was formed and the end of last month.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	We are on the right track. We must keep calm and keep going. 
When you know you have a good plan, you have to stick to it. I 
agree there is some instability, but part of that instability is 
caused by the political option of the Leader of the Opposition.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is unfortunate to see a government so irresponsible in 
the way it interprets the negative movements of financial 
markets.
<P>
	For instance, Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister sees an 
improvement where there has been deterioration. Fewer people 
are unemployed because more people are on welfare. When 
people go on welfare, they are no longer included in the 
unemployment statistics, and so the government is satisfied. 
This does not make sense. And the few jobs that were created are 
not durable jobs.
<P>
	I want to ask the Prime Minister whether he will let his 
government review its deficit reduction strategy to restore its 
credibility with the financial markets. Is he prepared to 
immediately implement measures to cut government spending?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
what the financial markets need is a government with a plan, a 
government that intends to stick to its plan, a government that 
does not lose its cool, a competent government that is consistent 
in its policies. It would be a disaster to have as the leader of this 
government a political leader who has changed parties five 
times.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
in his budget, instead of proposing a real plan to cut spending, 
the Minister of Finance attacked the most disadvantaged people 
by making substantial cuts to unemployment insurance benefits 
in particular. With the recent instability in the markets, which 
seems likely to continue, given what the Canadian dollar did this 
morning, the federal government's interest charges have already 
increased by $3 billion.
<P>
	How will the Prime Minister explain to the unemployed and to 
seniors that the sacrifices imposed on them will be pointless and 
that the loss of his budget's credibility in the financial markets 
will by itself wipe out the billions of dollars that his government 
wrung from the disadvantaged to reduce its deficit?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the fact that the economy has produced 114,000 new jobs in the 
last two months is a sign that we are on the right track.
<P>
	We are not satisfied with that. We know that when we started 
unemployment was 11.6 per cent. We want to reduce it. We want 
to create jobs. This is the program of this government. This is 
the goal of this government.
<P>
	The infrastructure programs will start to produce jobs in the 
coming weeks because the agreement has been signed with 
everybody. We are very hopeful that it will continue creating 
more jobs, that there will be more jobs in the ridings of every 
member of Parliament because of the program.
<P>
	Of course the rest of the economy will produce other private 
sector jobs. We are on the right track. We should not lose our 
cool because there are some fluctuations in the market. I have 
been Minister of Finance before and I have learned that it is 
serving-
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
their irresponsibility is endangering the employment recovery.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister not agree that he must in the short 
term review his deficit-fighting strategy and undertake a review 
of all budget and fiscal expenditures by setting up the 
parliamentary committee to review public spending that the 
Official Opposition has been demanding from the beginning and 
that the financial community now supports, Mr. Speaker?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the opposition members will have to make up their minds one 
day. We presented a budget and made cuts. They criticized us for 
the cuts we made. They should start by accepting these cuts and 
then we will accept their suggestions.

	Every time we do something, they just criticize and of course 
that is why they will never form the Government of Canada.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	While the House was recessed Statistics Canada announced 
the combined federal and provincial debt to be $660 billion. 
That is 93 per cent of GDP or $23,000 worth of debt for every 
man, woman and child in the country.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister today acknowledge-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I know we have all missed the House and we 
are anxious to be back. I also know all hon. members would want 
to listen to the question by the hon. member for Calgary 
Southwest.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> I make reference to the record level of debt. 
Will the Prime Minister today acknowledge that this debt level 
is unacceptable to the government and that extraordinary 
measures beyond those contained in the budget must now be 
considered to combat it?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would agree with the hon. member that we are not happy at all 
and we do not find having this big debt very easy.
<P>
	We only formed the government six months ago, but when we 
have a problem like this one we have to be rational and make 
sure we are managing it in a way that would not cause a 
recession. That would compound the problem.
<P>
	That is why we have a very balanced approach. Sometimes the 
opposition parties criticized us for some cuts and some would 
like to have more. However we know that if we go too deeply 
into debt we will compound the problem by having more 
unemployed people. When people are unemployed in Canada, 
being a civilized society we do not let them starve. We help them 
through these difficult periods.
<P>
	This is why we think that our balanced approach is the best 
one. We made some very difficult cuts but at the same time we 
have kept our priority to ensure that new jobs are created in 
Canada. I hope the hon. member will recognize that in the last 
two months the economy created 114,000 new jobs. That is not 
too bad.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
find the Prime Minister's answer incredible. All members of the 
House had better recognize that the government is spending 
$110 million more per day than it takes in. We are sleepwalking 
toward a fiscal crisis.
<P>
	I have a question for the Prime Minister. Will the Prime 
Minister today acknowledge that this spending rate simply 
cannot continue and that the government will have to consider 
extraordinary measures not contained in the red book, the throne 
speech or the budget to bring this spending rate under control?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we have cut quite substantially in the last budget. It was not easy 
to do. We have some problems to cope with and we think we 
have managed the situation quite reasonably.
<P>
	We have a goal that is achievable: to reduce the deficit in 
relation to GDP to 3 per cent per year. This goal is very 
reasonable because 3 per cent of the GDP is the requirement for 
any country to qualify in Europe to use the new currency called 
the ECU. If it is good enough for all countries of Europe to have 
that goal, it should be good enough for Canada. I am saying that 
is a commitment in the red book and we will achieve that goal.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the countries that are part of the European Community are 
running debt to GDP ratios of about 60 per cent. This 
government is running a debt to GDP ratio of 93 per cent. We 
could not even get into that community.
<P>
	I have a supplementary question. If the Prime Minister is not 
prepared to give convincing answers to this side of the House, 
surely he recognizes that he has to be convincing to investors 
and lenders of private sector job creation.
<P>
<B>(1430 ) </B>
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister today acknowledge that Canadians 
want a clear signal, not from the Minister of Finance and not 
from the Minister of Human Resources Development, but from 
the Prime Minister that he is personally prepared to consider 
extraordinary measures to control the overspending of his 
government?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have given my commitment to controlling spending. This is why 
we have had so many cuts for which we have been blamed by the 
opposition.
<P>
	We have a program that we want to keep. We are not about to 
change suits every day. We will stick to the plans we have made. 
The markets know we have a very good Minister of Finance. He 
has my full support and full confidence. The Minister of Human 
Resources Development is a man of experience and quality. He 
is an excellent minister.
<P>

in this team.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, while the 
government is trying to take credit for a drop in the 
unemployment rate, more than 20,000 young people are said to 
not even bother stating that they are looking for work. They are 
disillusioned with the job market and the government's apathy.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister face reality and recognize that, at a 
time when some 200,000 jobs are needed in Quebec to return to 
pre-recession levels, the drop in the unemployment rate is 
largely due to the fact that young people are disillusioned and 
have given up looking for work?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
believe that the employment situation has improved but we are 
extremely concerned with the unemployment rate among young 
people. This is why the Minister of Human Resources 
Development is working with the Secretary of State for Youth to 
set up a special program to create jobs for young people. I hope 
that we will be in a position to make an announcement on this 
program in the next few weeks.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, how can the 
Prime Minister keep defending his job-creation strategy when 
the bad reaction to his budget in the financial community, as 
well as the loss of credibility of both his finance minister and his 
government, are the main causes and obstacles to job creation in 
Canada?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we have a program to stimulate employment. This program was 
the main element of our election platform in 1993. We clearly 
stated what we intended to do. We are following our agenda. We 
are on the right track. So far, results are rather positive, but it 
will take time. We started off with an unemployment rate of 11.6 
per cent. We do not think we can turn the situation around in just 
a few weeks or even a few months. We must continue to work; 
we have a well-thought-out plan which Canadians have 
accepted, and we need everyone's support if we are to succeed. 
The hon. member could also help. Indeed, if he talked about 
employment instead of always discussing separation, our

question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	During last fall's election campaign any suggestion that a 
reformed UI program should be jointly funded by employers and 
employees and should be run like a  genuine insurance program 
was greeted with ridicule by Liberals.
<P>

on the backs of workers?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, by this time members of the 
Reform Party should learn not to trust everything that is printed 
because it comes from somewhat dubious sources.
<P>
	In this case the story the hon. member is alluding to was a 
rumour that was apparently put forward by some bureaucrats 
from a couple of provincial governments. I do not think that is 
the most authentic source for proposals for changes in the 
federal UI program. I would suggest that once the hon. member 
gets his sources straight he may get his questions straight. Then 
I will be prepared to answer them.
<P>
<B>(1435) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat):</B> Mr. Speaker, it was a 
pretty straightforward question. I suggest the minister learn a 
little humility lest he end up unemployed as well.
<P>
	Government reports over the last several years have 
recommended that the government move away from control of 
the UI program. Will the minister heed this advice and let 
employers and employees administer their own programs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member knows we 
are presently engaged in a very major undertaking to look at a 
variety of the programs run by the government in order to 
achieve higher levels of employment.
<P>
	We made some changes in the last budget which reduced UI 
premiums. That has been one of the contributing reasons there is 
a new sense of confidence in the economy, especially among 
small businesses.
<P>
	I met with them and they told me that they feel this 
government is on the right track for job creation. We have 
consulted with business, labour and community interest groups, 
all of which have made various comments about the way in 
which we can apply a more effective unemployment insurance 
program.

	I want to make one thing very clear. The unemployment 
insurance program does provide a very important service to 
millions of Canadians. We will protect the integrity of that

not the interest of the hon. member who wants to take the

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	It is not some provincial bureaucrats who made a surprising 
statement last week but the Minister of Finance himself who 
suggested that unemployment insurance would be funded only 
by workers' contributions. Furthermore, the amount of 
contribution could be set according to each worker's own 
situation.
<P>
	My question is this: Is the minister, given his previous answer, 
prepared to promise that unemployment insurance reform will 
not make workers the only ones to pay for unemployment 
insurance?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, we obviously are committed to 
major reform and improvement of the program.
<P>
	I must confess to my great disappointment that when I looked 
at the House of Commons committee report and looked at the 
special report submitted by the Bloc Quebecois, I found 
absolutely no constructive proposals, no interesting 
suggestions, no ways of making the reform.
<P>
	I would suggest if the hon. member wants to make 
recommendations on how to reform, we are prepared to listen. 
Certainly, they refused to do it in their committee report.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
mandate of the committee and of minority members on the 
committee was to consult Canadians and not to submit the 
opinion of the party.
<P>
	Will the minister, since he is in charge and he is the one who 
prepares the action plan which will be known as soon as possible 
so that everyone can really be consulted, confirm that he is 
preparing to modify unemployment insurance in such a way that 
the premium rate will depend on each worker's risk of job loss, 
so that those who hold insecure jobs will be hit harder?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to correct one 
statement by the hon. member which I am sure she made 
inadvertently.
<P>
	This proposal for reform is not something I initiate alone. I do 
it as part of a government, as part of a caucus. We are working 
with the provinces, business and labour. This will be a point of 
view expressed by all Canadians, except for a certain group in 
the House that does not want to participate in the process.
<P>
	We have not been able to get this co-operative view as to how 
we can change the program. As to the specific point raised by the 
member, I have said to this Parliament many many times that we 
are engaged in a very open and honest program to ensure that all 
views are considered. If that is the point of view of the hon. 
member, I will take that representation. If the Bloc Quebecois 
wants to reduce the premium rate and wants to simply have the 
employees pay it, that it is not the point of view represented by 
the minister. It is not the point of view that I share personally. It 
is a point of view that I will bring to this House as soon as I can 
and will represent the point of view of all Canadians.

	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, here 
we are just seven weeks since the budget and today's <I>Financial 
Post</I> paints a vastly different economic climate from what was 
predicted in the Liberal budget.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Short term interest 
rates for 1994 are up a full percentage point from February and 
growth is down. For 1995 it is the same picture, interest rates up 
and growth down, according to 12 leading Canadian firms.
<P>
	Using the government's own method of analysis, I wish to ask 
the following question. We all know the Prime Minister said that 
he has the people and he has the plan. What is the plan now that 
his people have been proven wrong?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions)):</B> Mr. Speaker, the forecasts mentioned 
are just some of the ones I would like to mention to the hon. 
member. The Conference Board's forecast has been revised 
downward but it is still well above the numbers we used in our 
very prudent forecast in our budget.
<P>
	The Royal Bank of Canada last week came out with a brand 
new forecast. Those numbers show 3.5 per cent real growth this 
year and 4.3 per cent next year, well above the rates that were 
used in our budget numbers.
<P>
	I remind the hon. member that there are some people out there 
with substantial confidence in the economy and our employment 
numbers in the last two months show that confidence. The rise in 
consumer confidence and business confidence is there as well 
and the private sector forecasts are still well above those used in 
our budget.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do 
not know who the hon. minister has been talking to, but if you 
look at the economic forecasts in the <I>Financial Post</I> or you ask

<P>
the private businessmen or investors in this country you will get

<P>
	I would like to know if the Prime Minister still believes that 
further cuts are not necessary or should we wait until the 
Minister of Finance is back in this House to get a second 
opinion?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions)):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not think that the 
hon. member has looked at our budget carefully enough.
<P>
	If he had read the budget carefully and looked at the very 
prudent forecast numbers we used, he would see that our target 
of 3 per cent of GDP is well within grasp and well within those 
budget numbers.
<P>
	If he would like to know to whom we were listening, I was 
listening to the Royal Bank of Canada's forecast last week and 
the Conference Board of Canada's forecast last week. I know 
most of those forecasters personally.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Perhaps it slipped our minds while we were 
away, but we would prefer that there not be any documents or 
books waved in the House. It takes a little bit away from the 
decorum and I would ask all hon. members to please adhere to 
this request.

Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	In an interview with the daily <I>Le Devoir</I>, the Quebec Premier 
reiterated his desire to patriate federal responsibilities for 
manpower training, saying: ``Quebec has always done a better 
job than the federal government with vocational training 
activities, and I will not settle for less''.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister agree to this renewed request made by 
the Quebec government and will he transfer to that province full 
federal responsibilities for manpower training, as well as the 
funds to go with it?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, we have had and we continue to have discussions with 
the province of Quebec regarding manpower training. So far, we 
have agreed on some points, including the single-window 
concept, which a number of provinces also approved at the 
recent meeting held in Toronto with the Minister of Human 
Resources Development, I believe.
<P>
<B>(1445) </B>
<P>
	Indeed, the Quebec Premier has indicated that he wants to 
keep negotiating on manpower training. We have taken his 
arguments into consideration and we will continue discussions 
with the province.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I ask the minister, who seems to be participating in a lot 
of discussions, if he will keep discussing until the election 
campaign gets under way in Quebec and then propose to 
Quebecers an agreement such as the Bourassa-Campbell one, 
that is another smoke screen?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs

Speaker, it is not for me to say whether the Bourassa-Campbell 
agreement was a smoke screen. I imagine that the people have 
already rendered their verdict on that.
<P>
	Generally speaking, we will first undertake the income 
security reform and future agreements with any province,

future reforms.

Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources 
Development.
<P>
	The government has said again and again that it attaches the 
highest priority to job creation. To that end the minister has 
lowered UI premium rates and will soon announce the 
government's strategy on youth.
<P>
	What other results can the minister point to that really show 
Canadians particularly those in Nova Scotia that the 
government's job creation policies are working?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, perhaps the most important 
demonstration of a new sense of confidence in the country are 
the figures we released last week that show there was a very 
substantial drop in the unemployment rate.
<P>
	In particular, I would like to say there is .7 per cent, almost 
10,000 new jobs created in the province of Nova Scotia alone. It 
demonstrates that three-quarters of the new jobs created were 
full-time permanent jobs and not the part time jobs of the past.
<P>
	I agree with the hon. member it is very important that we take 
a special look at those who still have very strong needs in the 
labour market. Young people must be the priority of all members 
of Parliament because they are the ones who still need the 
greatest assistance from all of us to get back to work.

	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of the Environment.
<P>
	On January 24 the minister stated in the House that selection 
of the host city for the NAFTA commission of the environment 
would be ``open, transparent, public and objective, a process 
free of politics. The selection will be made based on 
environmental performance of these cities. Montreal along with 
others will be considered in a non-partisan fashion''. The end 
result was that Montreal, a city that dumps half of its sewage 
untreated into the St. Lawrence River, was chosen as the host 
city.
<P>
	My question for the minister is this. Why did she mislead this 
House and 24 potential host cities-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Order, order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilmour:</B> I will rephrase that, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	Why did she advise the House and 24 potential host cities 
when she knew that the selection process was fixed in favour of 
Montreal?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, the selection process was 
never fixed in favour of any city.
<P>
	I have brought with me today a copy of the report from 
KPMG. I would be very happy to provide the member and all 
other members with an opportunity to review every single 
proposal. I will say to the hon. member that environmental 
considerations were certainly one of the key considerations.
<P>
	When he starts pointing the finger at cities that spew sewage, 
unfortunately there are a number of cities across the country that 
spew raw sewage into the ocean, including several in his own 
province. What the member should bear in mind is that Montreal 
has a plan in place right now to deal with the problem. It will be 
operational by the end of next year. I only wish that every one of 
the other 25 applicant cities had as significant a reputation when 
it came to actually dealing with the problems of raw sewage.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
supplemental is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
<B>(1450 ) </B>
<P>
	Contrary to the environment minister's supposed criteria the 
Prime Minister now states that Montreal was awarded the 
environmental secretariat because it has the highest jobless rate.
<P>
	Given these inconsistencies which hardly justify such 
patronage, has the government adopted the policies of the 
previous Conservative government of showing favouritism to 
the Prime Minister's home province?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have nothing to add to what the Minister of the Environment 
mentioned a minute ago. She did very objective work. Many 
cities qualified. One of the factors that attracted my attention 
and which she did not even  use was the fact that of all these 
cities, Montreal was unfortunately the city with the highest 
unemployment.
<P>
	All the other factors have been well balanced by the minister. 
She asked for applications and so on. But when you are the 
government you have to make a decision eventually. We made a 
decision and we will not apologize to anybody for exercising our 
responsibilities.

received assurances from Hyundai officials that the Bromont 
plant would be re-opened. Since then, the company has 
indicated that it has no business plan for this plant and that 
despite wanting to keep the facility in operation, Hyundai was 
still not certain if it would re-open it. The company has even 
requested that its employees sign waivers.

Bromont plant is concerned?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
obviously discussions have taken place between the Minister for 
International Trade and Quebec's Industry Minister, Mr. 
Tremblay. He did visit Hyundai and rather frank discussions 
took place. Clearly, Hyundai is having trouble finding a product 
to manufacture in Bromont. Our government and the Quebec 
government want to help Hyundai, if at all possible, to find some 
way to get the Bromont plant back in operation as soon as 
possible.
<P>

statement, his Minister for International Trade is making fun of

when in fact no real guarantees have been received?

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands):</B> Mr. Speaker,

Bosnia are adequately authorized, prepared and equipped to

learn that there will be no new employability development 
programs or EDPs in most regions. It seems there is no more

regarding omnibus bills.
<P>
	I would like to thank the hon. member and also the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Government House Leader and 
the hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell for the 
contributions to the discussion.
<P>
	In his presentation the hon. member for Calgary West 
contended that Bill C-17, an act to amend certain statutes to 
implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament 
on February 22, 1994, is an omnibus bill and as such should be 
ruled out of order and should not be considered by the House in 
its present form.
<P>
	He also maintained there is no unifying principle contained in 
the bill, that the omnibus bill attempts to amend several 
different existing laws, that such a bill forces members to take 
one decision applicable to several different issues and finally 
that the variety of issues contained in the bill may cause 
difficulties for the committee charged to study it.
<P>
	The hon. member also cited the January 26, 1971 ruling of 
Speaker Lamoureux as well as citation 626.1 of Beauchesne's 
sixth edition in supporting his argument.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>]

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2860"> 2860 </A></B>
<P>
	For the benefit of all members, I should start by giving out the 
definition of an omnibus bill as found in the House of 
Commons' <I>Glossary of Parliamentary Procedure</I>. An omnibus 
bill is defined as: ``A bill consisting of a number of related but 
separate parts which seek to amend and/or repeal one or several 
existing Acts and/or to enact one or several new Acts.''
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The hon. member is correct when he points out that Bill C-17 
is an omnibus bill. However, as has been noted in numerous 
rulings by previous Speakers and most recently in a ruling by 
Speaker Fraser on April 1, 1992, procedurally there is nothing in 
our rules and practices which prohibits the government from 
introducing omnibus bills.
<P>
<B>(1505) </B>
<P>
	In his ruling Speaker Fraser, quoting the hon. member for 
Windsor West, the current government House leader, described 
omnibus bills in this way:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The essential defence of an omnibus procedure is that the bill in question, 
although it may seem to create or to amend many disparate statutes, in effect has 
one basic principle or purpose which ties together all the proposed enactments 
and thereby renders the bill intelligible for parliamentary purposes.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This can be found on page 9147 of the <I>Debates</I> for April 1, 
1992.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	One of the reasons omnibus bills are introduced by the 
government is to aid parliamentary discussion by grouping all 
statutory amendments for the implementation of a policy in the 
same bill. As Speaker Jerome noted on May 11, 1977, at page 
5522 of the <I>Debates</I>, the use of omnibus bills was at that time a 
well established practice in the Canadian House. This is still the 
case. In fact, there are numerous examples where legislation to 
implement budgetary provisions have taken the form of 
omnibus bills.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Often confusion arises between the Chair's power to divide 
complicated motions and the Chair's past decisions not to divide 
omnibus bills. Part of the confusion is attributable to our 
concept of what it means to adopt a motion for second reading of 
a bill.
<P>
	Debate at second reading relates to the principle of the bill 
and not to its specific clauses. The principle may be very simple 
or quite complex. Since there is not necessarily a unique section 
of a bill which defines its principle the debate is understood to 
be general at this stage with detailed consideration at later 
stages.
<P>
	However, the question before the House is very simple. It is 
that the bill be now read a second time and referred to a 
committee, and not that certain sections of the bill be dealt with 
in a certain manner. The decision of the House, therefore, is 
whether to send a bill for further consideration to a committee. 
The question of the  principle of a bill is obviously closely 
linked to the second reading motion.
<P>
	The argument presented by the hon. member for Calgary West 
is: ``That the subject matter of the bill is so diverse that a single 
vote on the content would put members in conflict with their 
own principles''.
<P>
	However, it is the view of the Chair that in the adoption of a 
second reading motion the House gives approval in principle to 
a bill and then moves on to the consideration of its specific 
provisions in subsequent stages.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It must also be remembered that the Chair has ruled that there 
is nothing procedurally objectionable to a bill containing more 
than one principle. Speaker Sauvé expressed this in a ruling 
given on June 20, 1983, and I refer hon. members to page 26538 
of the <I>Debates</I>. She stated at that time:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-although some occupants of the Chair have expressed concern about the 
practice of incorporating several distinct principles in a single bill, they have 
consistently found that such bills are procedurally in order and properly before 
the House.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Bearing directly on this matter, the hon. member from 
Calgary West quoted Beauchesne's Sixth Edition, citation 
626(1). I will read the citation for the benefit of the House. It 
states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Although there is no specific set of rules or guidelines governing the content 
of a bill, there should be a theme of relevancy amongst the contents of a bill. 
They must be relevant to and subject to the umbrella which is raised by the 
terminology of the long title of the bill.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The hon. member has argued that the House is being asked to 
take one decision on a number of unrelated items. However, in 
the Chair's opinion a common thread does run throughout Bill 
C-17; namely, the government's intention to enact the 
provisions in the recent budget, including measures to extend 
the fiscal restraint measures currently in place.
<P>
	In their remarks both the parliamentary secretary and the hon. 
member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell also pointed out that 
the provisions in the bill had arisen out of the budget presented 
by the Minister of Finance which had already been debated by 
the House.
<P>
	As was underlined by the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Government House Leader and the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, the House heard the Minister of 
Finance make a statement on the budgetary policy of the 
government on February 22, 1994. The House subsequently 
debated the budgetary motion for several days and adopted it on 
a recorded division on March 23, 1994.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="2861"> 2861 </A></B>
<P>
	The title of Bill C-17 clearly refers to the original budgetary 
statement and the bill will simply enact certain provisions 
contained in that statement.
<P>
	Bill C-17 is an omnibus bill but it has a common thread 
through it and in my view a unitary purpose.
<P>
	In conclusion, it is procedurally correct and common practice 
for a bill to amend, repeal or enact several statutes. There are 
numerous rulings in which Speakers have declined to intervene 
simply because a bill was complex and permitted omnibus 
legislation to proceed.
<P>
	Hence, while I cannot accept the hon. member's request to 
divide or set aside Bill C-17, I can suggest to him and to other 
members that should they so wish they may propose 
amendments to the bill in committee or at report stage and in so 
doing have an opportunity to express their views and vote on the 
specific sections of the bill.
<P>
	I thank all hon. members for their contributions.

	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
having just tabled the third public report of the director of the 
Canadian Security Intelligence Service, I am now pleased to rise 
as Solicitor General to deliver the annual national security 
statement.
<P>
	Taken together, this statement and the public report are 
intended to provide Canadians with an assessment of the current 
security intelligence environment and information about the 
government's efforts to ensure our national security.
<P>
	It is my pleasure to continue this practice because I believe it 
is essential in a democratic society that Parliament and citizens 
have this information and that elected representatives are heard 
on the crucial issues of security intelligence, security 
enforcement and protective security.
<P>
	Ten years ago with the passage of the CSIS Act and the 
Security Offences Act in 1984 a previous Liberal administration 
laid the foundation for a new national security system.
<P>
<B>(1515 ) </B>
<P>
	The goal was to create an effective national security system 
within which there would be a carefully controlled civilian 
security intelligence agency. This agency would work closely 
and effectively with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police as well 
as with other government agencies such as Transport Canada, 
Foreign Affairs, National Defence and Citizenship and 
Immigration.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Service's first years of operation were marked by intense 
scrutiny of how it went about its business. Concerns about the 
Service's operational focus led to the creation in 1987 of an 
independent advisory team to advise the government on how to 
realign the Service's operational priorities and strengthen its 
management.
<P>
	On the advice of the team the government disbanded the 
counter-subversion branch of CSIS and the Service's use of 
intrusive investigative techniques was circumscribed to ensure 
that Canadians engaged in legitimate dissent were not caught up 
in the security intelligence net.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2862"> 2862 </A></B>
<P>
	The CSIS Act's provision for an external Security 
Intelligence Review Committee, the SIRC, reporting directly to 
Parliament and the Office of the Inspector General reporting 
internally to the Minister, were key innovations in Canadian 
security intelligence.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	SIRC with its annual reports to Parliament and the Office of 
the Inspector General with its annual certificates to the minister 
played an essential role in helping successive solicitors general 
exercise their control and accountability for CSIS. Five years 
after the legislation came into force, a special parliamentary 
committee examined the operation of the CSIS and security 
offences acts.
<P>
	In 1991 in ``On Course'', the then government's response to 
the committee's report, the then government committed itself to 
making an annual statement to Parliament on national security 
and the tabling of a public report from the director of CSIS. Our 
system of review and control with its built in checks and 
balances involving the executive, the judicial and legislative 
components of government are working well.
<P>
	In effect, the service has been under constant review and 
adjustment since inception and this should be reassuring to all 
Canadians. Indeed in its annual report for 1992-93 which I 
tabled in this House soon after becoming Solicitor General, 
SIRC concluded that CSIS ``is working within the law and 
operating effectively''.
<P>
	Today we see a service faced with constant and at times 
dramatic change in the global security environment. Most 
notably, I speak of the collapse of the Soviet Union and of the 
classic cold war model of east versus west that was the 
overriding preoccupation of the national security system.
<P>
	Members might well ask whether we are reorienting and 
streamlining our activities in step with today's security 
intelligence environment. Yes, we certainly are. Two years ago 
my predecessor asked the CSIS director to prepare for him an 
assessment of how the evolving security environment might 
affect the services mandate over time.
<P>
	The director was also asked to consider how the service 
should be structured as a consequence and to determine the 
resource implications of his recommendations. In his report last 
year the director concluded that although the bipolar tensions of 
the cold war, which were terrifying but at the same time 
reassuring because they were known, had largely dissipated, a 
multiplicity of new threats and tensions has emerged.
<P>
	The collapse of the Warsaw pact has been a major factor in 
allowing the government to judiciously prune the services 
resources. The services position complement has dropped from 
a peak of 2,760 in 1992 to 2,366 today, a reduction of 394 
positions.
<P>
	As the spending estimates for the fiscal year 1994-95 show, 
the CSIS budget is $206.8 million, down from $228.7 million 
last year. In terms of reorientation, the director's review 
confirmed the course of continuing to reduce the proportion of 
resources specifically dedicated to counter-intelligence while 
increasing resources directed to counter-terrorism.
<P>
<B>(1520 ) </B>
<P>
	Allow me also to note what the SIRC said on this issue in its 
annual report and again I quote: ``We believe that CSIS is 
reorienting its activities in a sensible prudent fashion and the 
result will be a service that acts effectively against the modern 
terrorist threat to vulnerable highly interdependent 
post-industrial societies such as their own and which cost the 
nation less''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Our approach must continue to be prudent and steady. Mr. 
Speaker.
<P>
	We have to be deliberate and measured in any change in the 
apportioning of our security intelligence resources and tough 
and adaptable in how we target them.
<P>
	I say this because while the Cold War may well be over, the 
global situation does not warrant complacency.
<P>
	Witness the conclusions of the Director in the public report: 
The member of foreign intelligence services operating against 
Canadian interests in Canada or abroad remains substantial.
<P>
	The activities of former Cold War adversaries have generally 
been reduced, he notes, but they have by no means been 
eliminated. The recent arrest of a senior employee of the CIA for 
allegedly selling his country's secrets seems to bear this out.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The primary threat to Canada is international terrorism and 
the bulk of CSIS operational resources is dedicated to counter 
terrorism.
<P>
	The conspiracy to bomb a Hindu temple in Toronto, the 
bombing of the World Trade Centre in New York, and the recent 
terrorist attack against Heathrow Airport in the United Kingdom 
bring home the point dramatically that open democratic 
societies offer vulnerable and attractive targets. Members 
should also know that terrorists are known to plan and raise 
funds for their operations elsewhere.
<P>
	The conclusion of the CSIS threat assessment is both sobering 
and instructive. Terrorists will continue to avail themselves of 
the latest technology and to feed on the discontent of extremism 
both from the right and the left.
<P>
	As the number of flash points grows around the world so do 
the potential number of threats. For this reason it is incumbent 
upon us to ensure CSIS has the ability to investigate and analyse 
threats and to advise the government so that it can take 
appropriate action.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2863"> 2863 </A></B>
<P>
	To counter terrorism CSIS works with other government 
departments and agencies to deny entry into Canada of known 
and suspected terrorists. It also maintains liaison with foreign 
intelligence services and here at home with various 
communities and groups to identify emerging threats.
<P>
	In this regard I would like to note that this government is 
concerned that recent arrivals to Canada not be victimized or 
manipulated by homeland governments or extremist groups. 
These recent arrivals have come to a new land to escape such 
conflict.
<P>
	The disintegration of the Soviet Union has lifted the lid on a 
cauldron of ethnic nationalism. Disruption is rife and the waves 
caused are already lapping at our shores. The disruption of 
governments in some countries is making the work at CSIS and 
its allied counterparts around the world ever more difficult.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A mixture of ethnic, religious, ideological, economic and 
territorial pressures has increased instability in many regions 
around the world. The proliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction, especially nuclear weapons, continues to be 
worrisome. The increased availability of nuclear technology 
and the aspirations of some countries to acquire nuclear 
bomb-making capability are profoundly disturbing.
<P>
	And as the nature of power changes, many countries are 
turning their intelligence services to the business of economic 
espionage, primarily in the developed Western world.
<P>
	The Director underlines the Service's concern for the 
protection of Canada's economic security from disruption due to 
foreign intelligence services.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A key element of the CSIS mandate is to advise law 
enforcement agencies of terrorist threats thereby allowing 
police to take preventive action or arrest perpetrators.
<P>
	The Royal Canadian Mounted Police is an essential part of our 
national security system, being responsible for protective 
security and for investigating security offences.
<P>
<B>(1525 ) </B>
<P>
	In addition to its responsibilities under the Security Offences 
Act it also provides security for VIPs, federal properties, 
including some airports and for foreign embassies and missions 
here on our soil. CSIS and the RCMP work closely together and 
it is my role as Solicitor General to work to ensure that the two 
agencies do not fail in their work to provide effective protection 
for Canadians and Canadian interests.
<P>
	For example, CSIS provides security and threat assessments 
and the RCMP provides protective security for major events 
which have the potential to attract terrorists and extremists.
<P>
	By way of conclusion, I want to say that this government in 
the speech from the throne committed itself to playing an active 
internationalist role in the global arena. As the speech said, in 
the light of the radical changes which have occurred in 
international affairs in the last few years, the government has 
asked parliamentary committees to review Canada's foreign and 
defence policies and priorities.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, we will want to follow these reviews closely and 
analyze the results for possible implications for our national 
security system.
<P>
	Clearly, we should be prepared to make necessary 
adjustments in light of changing national security interests and 
realignment of foreign and defence priorities.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As I have just discussed, our orientation and national security 
is influenced considerably by the global security environment. 
Just as our national security system has undergone adjustment 
and reorientation over the last 10 years, so must we be ready to 
adapt and reorient in the coming years. I say this because 
Canadians are concerned about their sense of security in the 
world, a world that is ever more influencing our conduct at home 
in terms of the economy, jobs and protecting the environment 
and protecting our democratic institutions.
<P>
	I believe that Canadians want an effective national security 
system. Therefore our government intends to pay close attention 
to national security issues but in a manner consistent with our 
democratic institutions and with our Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms. I have no doubt that hon. members expect no less.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, to begin, I would like to thank the Solicitor General of 
Canada for letting me see and read his statement, his press 
release and the report he quoted. We were able to become 
acquainted with it all before he read it and I thank him for that.
<P>
	That will be the only thanks I extend to the Solicitor General 
of Canada and to the government in general today, since we were 
read a statement that I think is completely empty and contains 
nothing instructive on this area of the jurisdiction of the 
Solicitor General of Canada.
<P>
	I think that it raises many more questions than it answers. The 
Solicitor General acted like his predecessors; that is, he very 
solemnly read an annual statement. I think that Canadians and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2864"> 2864 </A></B>
<P>
Quebecers want to have more than this very broad information. 
We want to  know to what use the money we give this 
government and this agency in particular is put.
<P>
	If the real purpose of this statement and the public report was 
to provide Canadians with an assessment of the present 
intelligence and security environment and especially to inform 
them about what is being done to protect the security of the 
country, I think that they have missed the boat again; we learn 
absolutely nothing. A lot of information is scattered left and 
right as a diversion but there is nothing substantial to show the 
real value obtained from the $228.7 million spent by the 
Canadian Security Intelligence Service last year. That is not 
peanuts-it is a quarter of a billion dollars.
<P>
	I am sure that the Solicitor General of Canada will answer me 
that for reasons of national security, the government cannot 
reveal more.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	But would it affect national security to know in which 
province CSIS spent the most or which province benefited the 
most from the $228.7 million spent last year?
<P>
	Would it affect national security to know about inactive 
files-I hope that CSIS has closed a few files in its ten years of 
existence-so that we have tangible evidence of what this 
service has accomplished, in what areas it has conducted 
investigations? Would it affect national security to know that 
Quebecers and Canadians have in their hands something 
tangible to check whether or not they do a good job?
<P>
	Would it affect national security to know which investigations 
saved lives or prevented attacks or disasters? Unfortunately, 
what we now see in the newspapers is only the negative side. I 
am quite willing to offer constructive criticism but I am not 
provided with the arguments, the files or anything else I need to 
do so. We now hear about things like Air India that are not too 
flattering to CSIS, or about terrorists entering Canada. But if we 
had something more constructive, more positive in the reports, 
we could present different arguments.
<P>
	In ten years of existence, as I was saying earlier, and three 
public reports, I feel that something more concrete could be said 
to increase transparency without threatening national security. I 
think that if the government wants to be more transparent, it 
should apply this philosophy in these reports.
<P>
	True, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service itself is 
watched by the Security Intelligence Review Committee or 
SIRC, as the Solicitor General said earlier. It is reassuring to 
know that, Mr. Speaker. I feel comforted by the fact that the 
Solicitor General of Canada is reassured by SIRC's last report 
saying that CSIS operations were legal and effective.
<P>
	But who are the wise people who wrote this report and came to 
this conclusion? I am going to name them because I think that 
some members of this hon. House do not know them.
<P>
	They are Jacques Courtois, a 73-year-old lawyer; Rosemary 
Brown, a 63-year-old social worker and the first Black woman 
to be elected in British Columbia; Edwin Goodman, a 
75-year-old lawyer; George Vari, 70; and Michel Robert, whose 
age I do not know, a former national president of the Liberal 
Party of Canada.
<P>
	When we see who is overseeing this committee, we may 
wonder. I am not saying this is not a good group whose members 
are not qualified, but what right have these people to monitor an 
organization that we in this House cannot monitor? I think that 
we must be even more suspicious of and look more closely at an 
organization such as CSIS. And I think that the recently elected 
35th Parliament has the mandate and the capacity to determine if 
this $228.7 million is well spent. On the contrary, this job has 
been given to a committee where the average age is about 70. 
These people are probably friends of the government but are 
they qualified to present such a report and say that yes, 
everything is consistent with the law? I have my doubts and that 
is why I cannot present a very positive report, because we were 
given a statement almost impossible to verify, general 
principles, wishful thinking, but nothing more tangible. When 
we see who monitors CSIS, we realize there may be a problem 
there also.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, as I said earlier, the friends of the government 
who sit on the external review committee may have a definition 
which is different from that of the legitimate elected members of 
the 35th Parliament on what the protection of Canadians and 
Quebecers' lives, as well as of the country's interests, entails.
<P>
	As for the legitimate Official Opposition, I can tell you that 
we surely have a definition which is different from that of the 
Security Intelligence Review Committee. Since the Solicitor 
General of Canada quoted an excerpt of the report in his 
statement, I will also refer to a part of this report which raises 
questions in my mind on just what the protection of life means.
<P>
	In its report, the committee notes that in a small number of 
recent cases-identified by the five people I referred to earlier, 
whose average age is 70-, the intelligence gathered by the 
Service during these investigations on certain individuals 
seemed unrelated to the issue of national security. The 
committee is also of the opinion that even though some 
investigations were related to law enforcement issues regarding 
legal protest activities or the expression of dissent, no 
intelligence information leads it to conclude that activities 
described in paragraph (c) of the definition of threats to the 
security of Canada, in section 2 of the Canadian Security 
Intelligence Service Act had occured.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2865"> 2865 </A></B>
<P>
	I wonder about this excerpt. Are we going back to the good old 
seventies? This could well be the case. I would have liked to 
know when these investigations were conducted, who was 
targeted, and in what province they took place. What legitimate 
protest triggered these investigations?
<P>
	As long as we have an external review committee with no 
democratic control over targeted intelligence activities, the risk 
of bias will always exist.
<P>
	Members of the external committee are not elected. There is 
no parliamentary control over intelligence activities and, in 
spite of what the Solicitor General said earlier in his speech, I 
find this situation extremely dangerous.
<P>
	When we have a real report, a report with real questions and 
real answers, then we may be able to make more constructive 
criticism. What we have right now is an extremely important 
organization, important enough not to have to come before 
elected representatives. We were elected and these people do not 
even have to come before us to explain what they do exactly. 
Moreover, in these difficult times when the government keeps 
saying that we must tighten our belt, it spends $228.7 million 
and we cannot even see how the money was used.
<P>
	Until we have a real report with real answers, it will be very 
difficult for the opposition and for democracy in Canada to 
come to a conclusion on this.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as a member of the Standing Committee on Justice and 
Legal Affairs I am pleased to respond to the minister's statement 
on the tabling of the annual report of the Canadian Security 
Intelligence Service.
<P>
	In the public's view of CSIS there exists an inordinate secrecy 
about its general operations and an apparent lack of 
accountability to the government and the Canadian community 
it serves. This report tabled today does not assuage legitimate 
public concerns about the underlying assumptions of the 
existence and the operational philosophy of CSIS.
<P>
	We are in a time for governments when business as usual is 
not good enough. The government of the day is being forced to 
recognize that basic reviews of social programs and general 
priority setting of departments will happen one way or another.
<P>
	It can be done in a rational way or by disjointed 
incrementalism. It is like rushing, putting out fires so to speak, 
when the crisis of finance and popular political support 
implodes upon the sleepwalking government as it stumbles 
along toward a new Canada of new international, fiscal and 
democratic realities.
<P>
<B>(1540 ) </B>
<P>
	When we come back to look at CSIS from this side of the 
House there is an increasing uneasiness about the aspects of a 
government bureau that spends a fair amount of public resources 
to in effect maintain an  image while at the same time satisfying 
the self-serving interests of insular survival at a time when all 
else in government is under fundamental review.
<P>
	We are in social service review and, more closely to CSIS, the 
military establishment will be undergoing a white paper review 
process. Certainly it is also time to ask this government about 
CSIS, its mission statement, its performance results measured 
against its own goals and mandate laid out in the previous annual 
reports and the legislation.
<P>
	There has been fundamental review before but we need more 
than the current committee oversight process and annual 
reports.
<P>
	I have been 21 years in provincial public service and I have 
come to appreciate how government bureaucracy can become 
focused on its self-importance and develop a driving agenda 
that is so right for those on the inside while it is losing the proper 
connections with those it was originally created to serve.
<P>
	From the opposition chairs, from this side of the House, from 
Her Majesty's loyal constructive alternative, I want to ring the 
bell of this government again on the community accountability 
issue for CSIS. Members of the Liberal cabinet may think it is 
business as usual, they may think they have the traditional 
Canadian divine right to govern, for after all they are the 
Liberals. It is a new Canada of more open and accountable 
government that is the standard required.
<P>
	The pre-Confederation reformers' agenda of responsible and 
accountable government beyond mere representative 
government has finally come of age and is represented by a new 
wave of Reformers in this House. We question the business as 
usual attitude, the annual report of CSIS which really tells this 
House nothing much about what goes on there. The public report 
is a good press release but justifies nothing.
<P>
	I am quite aware of the difference between the operational 
confidentiality required for the organization to be effective and 
the new higher level of ongoing accountability that citizens are 
coming to demand of government which in so many areas this 
government has not comprehended, being stuck as it is in old 
Canada thinking.
<P>
	CSIS is said to look after security intelligence, national 
security enforcement and national protective security. The 1994 
report is said to provide a window on security intelligence. I 
think it is a very small window and not large enough to let the 
light in of effective accountability.
<P>
	CSIS is mandated to perform a difficult job, formerly done by 
the RCMP which led to a national scandal and the resultant 
creation of CSIS as a solution. One wonders what the 1994 
scandal will be-cigarettes? I do not have any alternatives to 
present today.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2866"> 2866 </A></B>
<P>
	We have CSIS. We need such an organization. It has 
legislation, resources and about 2,500 people involved. That is 
no small change. Daily in the media Canadians hear from around 
the world reports of war, political unrest and intrigue and a 
changing geopolitical landscape. Canadians want to be assured 
that someone is minding the store and tracking world events 
specifically in a Canadian security sense in view of vital 
Canadian interests.
<P>
	The cold war is over. The western alliance intelligence 
systems have had to re-examine operations, assumptions and 
priorities. Despite the reports that are annually tabled and the 
current review and accountability structure, how is CSIS really? 
How is it moving to respond to rapidly changing world 
circumstances and the emerging new risks?
<P>
	Specifically, despite what we have all heard about CSIS has it 
been able at this point to become truly proactive and predictive 
or is it still largely reactive or, in the vernacular, functioning 
``catch as catch can''.
<P>
	Issues of espionage, foreign influence, illegal activities in 
Canada and politically motivated violence are of grave concern. 
The world is a less predictable place. Canada is an international 
player and cannot isolate itself.
<P>
	Hostile intelligence services of other governments, 
transnational corporations, which often are larger than many 
countries in resources and capabilities and are accountable to no 
one, these are issues for CSIS. As the number of global power 
centres grows so does the potential for threat.
<P>
	As Canada becomes a seller and inventor of high value added 
technologies, both Canadian law and our international trade 
agreements may be broken by both the Canadian criminal 
element and underground operatives in the nations with which 
we trade.
<P>
<B>(1545 ) </B>
<P>
	Economic espionage is not new but it is a major issue for 
CSIS. This activity disrupts the level playing field which is a 
principle of international trade agreements. Yet there is a 
doubtful priority given to it. Accordingly, last year there was a 
liaison program from CSIS to the private business sector to 
enhance understanding of vulnerabilities.
<P>
	Unfortunately the marching orders for CSIS' role in economic 
security was defensive, only advisory and precautionary. 
Canadian law could be broken. International conventions could 
be violated, our trade agreements subverted yet in economic 
espionage CSIS was again to be passive, reactive rather than 
proactive.
<P>
	What about specific training and research done jointly with 
manufacturing associations or other national trade and financial 
organizations? It is community policing at a national level, 
block watch in the industrial, technological and financial 
sectors. I doubt from what I have heard that CSIS has anywhere 
near that kind of  preventive, predictive level of operation, yet 
that is the best kind of law enforcement.
<P>
	To say that private sector industrial espionage is strictly the 
responsibility of the private sector is like standing guard at the 
front door while the thieves come and go at will through the back 
door.
<P>
	Monitoring and intercepting the deadly traffic of weapons and 
their associated technologies is a CSIS role. Terrorism is active 
in the world. Canada has been used for fund raising for foreign 
weapons buying and sometimes as a safe haven for numbers of 
extremist groups. CSIS, the RCMP, the military, Immigration 
and so on have overlapping roles to control criminal acts from 
these sources.
<P>
	Global trends of ethnic nationalism, fanatic types of religious 
fundamentalism and other forms of destabilizing ideological 
extremism warrant vigilance. The immigrants to this country 
and the millions who have come since the 1970s must be 
protected from foreign influenced activities and be dissociated 
from former homeland quarrels, violence and extortion. These 
immigrants must not be exploited by homeland interests. Old 
disputes from offshore must not continue in and through 
Canada.
<P>
	The sources of terrorism remain strong. Nationalism, 
separatism, ideological extremism are I am sure some of the 
things that CSIS touches as it works to ensure the safety, 
security and integrity of our society within the context of a 
national security system.
<P>
	The task of monitoring our national security agency is not one 
that parliamentary systems handle very well. With CSIS, we pay 
the piper but we never hear the tune or have much knowledge 
about what instrument is being played. We invest large sums of 
money in gathering security intelligence. I am not too sure we 
know what to do with a lot of what is gathered.
<P>
	CSIS is something like a national insurance policy or a 
security alarm in the night to protect the public and national 
interest. Value for money then is an issue. How do we know the 
alarm works or if it is even turned on. We see the CSIS budget 
stay about the same despite changing realities. They are coming 
together in one building, organizing and reorganizing. I 
certainly hope that by now the internal turf wars are over 
between the grandfathered RCMP types and the other 
technocrats.
<P>
	Reputation has it that for the past while much of CSIS' 
resources have been used up by itself for itself with infighting, 
reorganization upon reorganization with not much of real 
product or results for the national interest, the basic reasons why 
CSIS exists. This gets back to the basic issue of accountability.
<P>
	Although I am sure we have people there who see themselves 
as dedicated and hardworking, secret unaccountable 
organizations, like governments that behave that way, very soon 
get completely off the rails. There must be an ongoing tension 
for an 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2867"> 2867 </A></B>
<P>
efficacious  result as the blank check of power is very corrupting 
to those within the system.
<P>
	As a final suggestion, it is often the lowest level operatives in 
the system who actually deliver the service, the ones who 
actually do the work that are the best source for renewal, new 
and better accountability and a help for a mission statement. 
They usually are never asked or seriously considered.
<P>
	In summary, CSIS must be accountable, not in just that it 
spent its money within the allowable vote and its accounts are 
correct. Canadians have a right to know that the existence of 
CSIS is worth it. My opening remarks related to a change in 
community attitude against top-down, we know best 
government activity.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	I thank the minister for his report. I make the point for the 
need of better, broad based accountability. Increased public 
confidence in CSIS can only strengthen its role. I close by 
saying we hope against hope that CSIS can truly deliver a degree 
of security that places our nation in the ranks of the more 
fortunate few nations that have peace, order and good and honest 
government.

Speaker, on March 24 I responded to the hon. member for 
Comox-Alberni on a question concerning the registered 
charity status of Greenpeace Canada.
<P>
	I looked into the situation as promised. I wish to inform the 
member that Greenpeace Canada was formerly a registered 
charity but this status was revoked in June 1989 by Revenue 
Canada at the request of Greenpeace itself.
<P>
	The Greenpeace Canada Charitable Foundation is however a 
registered charity and it is quite distinct, I am told, from 
Greenpeace Canada.
<P>
	With respect to advocacy, political advocacy is permitted to a

information that this provision is being abused of course 
Revenue Canada carries out investigations.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="BUDGETIMPLEMENTATIONACT,1994">BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 1994</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-17, an act to amend certain statutes to implement certain 
provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on February 22, 
1994 be read the second time and referred to a committee; and of 
the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the omnibus nature of this bill makes it very awkward to deal 
with the component parts contained in it. Some of the items are 
realistic and reasonable. Some are not.
<P>
	In normal circumstances one studies a bill and then makes an 
informed decision whether or not that bill should be supported. 
In the case of Bill C-17 that decision is not so easy to make.
<P>
	One of the great political red herrings of the past Parliament 
was the Charlottetown accord. It too was omnibus in nature. 
There was something in it which almost everybody could accept 
collectively and there were areas which almost no one could 
accept as well. On the whole the majority of the Canadian 
population rejected the accord because in an all or nothing 
arrangement there were too many areas that were not acceptable. 
Therein lies the problem.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	Since the rejection of the Charlottetown accord the past and 
present government have used the rejection to throw back in the 
faces of people advocating such timely reforms as an elected 
Senate the fact that such a reform was offered and rejected.
<P>
	At the same time the government seems able to proceed with 
such constitutional items as official bilingualism for another 
province, changes in wording of an agreement which allow a 
bridge to replace a ferry system and negotiations on aboriginal 
self-government.
<P>
	Thus is the problem associated with omnibus type bills which 
have in the past created a lose-lose situation for many of those 
involved in the process. It is with this obstacle in mind that I 
have prepared my position on transportation subsidies.
<P>
	The prairie grain farmer has many problems in attempting to 
operate a successful and very necessary business in Canada. For 
years grain farmers have been receiving freight subsidies to 
offset the cost of grain transportation. There is in this subsidy a 
bit of a misconception. The farmers do not receive the subsidy 
directly. It is paid to the railway and there many unresolved 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2869"> 2869 </A></B>
<P>
problems with the rail system which I believe are further 
complicated by the manner in which the subsidy is paid.
<P>
	By paying the railroad directly one would assume that they 
ship all the grain and the overall cost of the freight is reduced by 
the subsidy amount. This is not the case. Many grain elevators 
are full to capacity and have been for quite some time. Some of 
these elevators have not seen a rail car in over two months.
<P>
	A further complication to this is the spring road weight 
restrictions which are now in place which make it even harder 
for farmers to move their grain when elevators space does 
become available. Grain farmers are not paid for their harvest 
until it is sold and shipped to the purchaser. In the interim period 
grain farmers are not only not paid for their work and expenses, 
they also incur further costs which are often the difference 
between making a decent return on their labour and investment 
or going broke.
<P>
	Some of these include the cost of storage of grain, interest 
charges on debts which should have been reduced or paid off 
from the proceeds of the grain sale, lost sales as a result of 
failure to deliver the product on time and demurrage charges 
levied by ships sitting in Vancouver harbour empty, waiting on 
grain to be delivered by the railway. These demurrage charges 
run up to $20,000 a day and some ships have left the harbour 
empty after collecting as much as $350,000 in demurrage 
charges.
<P>
	The total crop transportation subsidy last year was about $36 
million. Western grain farmers have lost approximately $200 
million in grain sales and demurrage charges alone since the 
beginning of the Vancouver port labour dispute which the 
government was so reluctant to end.
<P>
	Since the 1970s provincial and federal governments and the 
Canadian Wheat Board have supplied thousands of hopper cars 
to the railway. The Western Grain Transportation Act pays a 
transportation subsidy directly to the railway. In doing so there 
seems to be a loss of accountability which can be addressed very 
easily.
<P>
	Paying the subsidy directly to the grain farmer on a pro rata 
basis will allow the farmers to have more control over the 
method of shipment and provide more incentive to the rail lines 
to move the grain more effectively and efficiently. The concept 
of a reduction in the amount of the subsidy paid is not where my 
concern lies. I know costs have to be cut and this is an area that 
has potential for reduction. These cuts however must not be 
solely on the backs of the grain farmers who are already in a very 
insecure financial position.
<P>
	In normal business practices one looks at a rate of return on an 
investment. A return of 10 per cent is not considered particularly 
high, especially if there is an element of risk involved.
<P>
	In addition, one normally and reasonably expects to be paid 
something for one's labours. Many grain farmers are currently 
paid less than one-quarter of the normal return on their 
investment that they hold. If we look at their total income in 
light of that small investment return they are paid nothing at all 
for their labours.
<P>
	These farmers are not growing coloured TVs or fancy 
furniture. They are growing the food we need to produce in this 
country to maintain our independence for this vital commodity 
and an extremely important export product which helps 
maintain the economic viability of our country in an 
international global market.
<P>
<B>(1605 ) </B>
<P>
	We cannot simply turn our backs on the needs of the farmer. 
We must find a way to reduce expenses like the grain 
transportation subsidy without creating further economic 
hardships on people who are a vital part of our food chain and 
economic well-being.
<P>
	The changing of the payment of the subsidy directly to the 
grain farmer is the first step. This step however must be 
accompanied by further changes to reduce unnecessary loss of 
income caused by the current transportation problems.
<P>
	Subsidy reductions contained in the 1994 Liberal budget 
would result in a saving of approximately $5 million.
<P>
	If the government were prepared to take some initiative in 
ending the unnecessary loss of income through the current 
transportation problems, not only would the subsidy reduction 
not create a further hardship, it would open up the potential for 
further reductions without hardships at all.
<P>
	In short, there is a potential in this small portion of a great 
all-encompassing bill for savings in the area of grain 
transportation subsidies, but the government must do its 
homework first. In this draft that homework has not been done.
<P>
	I trust the government will accept these remarks as items to 
consider and modify this entire section before it is brought 
before the House again.
<P>
	I now turn my attention to the Atlantic region transportation 
subsidies. The Atlantic region consists of New Brunswick, Nova 
Scotia, Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, Labrador and the 
eastern portion of Quebec. The purpose of these subsidies is to 
promote and encourage the transport of goods within the 
Atlantic region.
<P>
	There are three different components to these subsidies under 
the Maritime Freight Rates Act. The first is a basic westbound 
subsidy on virtually all commodities travelling from inside the 
region to territories outside the region.
<P>
	In 1992 this totalled $38.4 million, $9.6 million for rail 
transport and $28.8 million for truck transportation; a separate 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2870"> 2870 </A></B>
<P>
westbound selective subsidy of 20 per cent on  selected goods 
which were actually manufactured inside the region as opposed 
to simply passing through.
<P>
	In 1992 this totalled $13.7 million, $3.7 million for rail 
transport and $10 million for truck transportation.
<P>
	In addition, there was an internal regional 10 per cent subsidy 
which was reduced to 9 per cent in the budget of April 1993 on a 
selected list of commodities. In 1992 this totalled $57.7 million, 
$9.5 million for rail transport, $47.5 million for truck 
transportation and $.7 million for marine transportation.
<P>
	The combined total of all Atlantic subsidies for 1992 was 
$109.8 million.
<P>
	In the budget of April 1993 this $109.8 million subsidy was 
reduced by 10 per cent. To achieve this cut the overall 
westbound rail shipment subsidy was cut from 30 per cent to 
28.5 per cent.
<P>
	Other reductions in costs were made through general 
administration and internal cutbacks across the board.
<P>
	This year's budget calls for another 5 per cent cut in the total 
Atlantic shipping subsidy, which now sits between $100 million 
and $105 million, commencing April 1994.
<P>
	Once again I find myself in a mix of support and opposition. 
On the one hand we have the continuing problem of the needs of 
government to reduce expenditures. On the other hand I find the 
government has once again not done its homework.
<P>
	The general economy of the maritimes is fragile at best and 
the government while recognizing the need to reduce its 
spending must also be mindful of the need to examine all areas 
of savings before taking any arbitrary action.
<P>
	The reduction of the Atlantic shipping subsidies as proposed 
is not unreasonable. The reality is these subsidies could 
probably be reduced considerably more but not without 
coupling these reductions with other changes.
<P>
	One of these changes is the removal of interprovincial trade 
barriers in the region. These barriers already cost the Atlantic 
region more than the total value of the regional development 
grants. As in the case of western grain farmers, subsidy 
reduction would be a lot more palatable if it were coupled with 
reductions of other costs of doing business.
<P>
	Another area that should also have been considered is the cost 
of keeping the port of Montreal open in the winter months. 
Currently icebreaking services are provided by the coast guard 
at no cost to the shippers or ships that the goods travel on. This 
creates two problems. First, this service costs the federal 
government about $33 million a year. To be sure some of this, 
about a third, is spent on flood control work. The rest amounts to 
yet another transportation subsidy costing the Canadian 
taxpayer four times the amount of saving in the Atlantic regional 
freight subsidy reductions proposed.
<P>
<B>(1610 ) </B>
<P>
	Second, this free service actually works against the Atlantic 
region by subsidizing the movement of goods through the 
maritimes in the winter instead of utilizing the ice free ports in 
Halifax and St. John's. It is well and good to have this service 
available for ships wishing to utilize this service, but it should 
be user pay. This would result in savings far in excess of the 
current amount targeted by the government and at the same time 
likely produce some economic benefit for the Atlantic ports.
<P>
	To put it mildly, the St. Lawrence icebreaker issue certainly 
seems ironic considering the large degree of difficulty the 
Atlantic shipping industry is presently going through. The 
disorganized, self-defeating government policy in subsidy 
fields does not end there.
<P>
	To add further fuel to the fire I must also express some sincere 
concerns regarding the proportion of truck subsidies received in 
the Atlantic region when compared with the alternate subsidies 
received by rail and marine transportation sectors. I am a bit 
perplexed as to why the government would provide such a 
proportionately huge subsidy for the very industry that is 
supposedly bringing about the untimely demise of our nation's 
rail system.
<P>
	This is particularly true in the case of Atlantic Canada which 
has been suffering a great deal in recent years and has suffered 
deep cuts by both Canadian National Rail and Canadian Pacific 
Rail as a result.
<P>
	Although there is certainly an argument that is to be made that 
Canada's railroads are not competitive enough to go head to 
head with trucking firms in the ongoing quest for this market 
share, I am not sure that I am prepared to accept this argument at 
full face value. The fact that major trucking companies are being 
so well subsidized by the government is bound to have a 
negative effect on our important rail system, something that will 
only hasten the demise of the rail lines in the Atlantic region.
<P>
	Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland in particular have 
already felt the sting of line closures, a predicament that strikes 
at the very heart of interprovincial arrangements which were 
made with the east at the time of Confederation. This relatively 
heavy subsidization of truck transportation in Atlantic 
provinces is a double pronged blow to our nation's railroads.
<P>
	The reason for this is simple. The disproportionate amount of 
direct subsidy money received by trucking firms amounts to a 
second major subsidy for this industry which already receives a 
major indirect subsidy in the form of government paid highway 
construction and repair. Whereas railway companies like CN 
and CP are obliged to basically pay their own way for the upkeep 
and maintenance of their expensive rail lines, trucking 
companies are under no such obligation when it comes to 
Canada's roads. Yes, there are fuel taxes paid by trucks that 
travel down

our highways but trains are also obligated to pay these same 
taxes.
<P>
	The result of this scenario is that trucking firms are being 
assisted in their transportation responsibilities to double and 
triple the tune of what our railways are receiving on a per capita 
basis.
<P>
	While all this is happening our essential highways, 
particularly the Trans-Canada, are crumbling beneath the 
weight of heavy 18 wheel vehicles that are not required to pay 
their full share of much needed repairs. At this point it seems 
unlikely the federal government would be willing to put any 
more money into expensive highway renovations. This has not 
been done for years and the present deficit mess certainly does 
not lend itself to alleviating the often dangerous conditions 
drivers must deal with.
<P>
	Nevertheless, the fact remains that the present subsidy system 
in the Atlantic region as it now operates is obviously geared to 
work against railways that might not be so indebted at present if 
it were not for unfair government policies.
<P>
	I am not arguing that the subsidy systems provided to Atlantic 
Canada are too high, although it is good to see small cuts have 
been made by the government in this sector. What I am arguing 
is that subsidies are being unevenly, unfairly, unwisely spread 
throughout the transportation sector.
<P>
	This is what I mean by the government not having done its 
homework or having the courage to alter and improve what is 
clearly an very inequitable subsidy system. I would hope and 
expect that the Minister of Transport will give some serious 
consideration to the revamping of its funding allocations in the 
weeks and months to come. There are clearly much greater 
potential savings than those proposed by the government and 
without serious effect on either group or region involved.
<P>
	Beyond the fact of subsidy issues we are now talking 
transportation matters and none of this has come before the 
transportation committee.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	I generally support both subsidy reductions proposed by the 
government although I cannot support the overall bill because of 
clauses that have nothing to do with the subsidies. I suggest the 
government now commence to complete its overdue 
assignments: government cost reductions coupled with 
economic benefits to these regions.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
have a comment to make on the extremely well-thought-out 
speech by the hon. member who just spoke. At the beginning of 
his speech, he talked about subsidies which should be paid 
directly to the farmers instead of to the railway to ship wheat, for 
example, from the West to the East. This battle has been going 
on for years and is known as the Crow's Nest Pass battle. That 
debate reflects the conflicting philosophies of agricultural 
development in Eastern Canada and Western Canada.
<P>
	If the hon. member thinks that these subsidies should be paid 
directly to western farmers, you will understand that eastern 
Canada, Quebec in particular, is dead against it because this 
freight assistance was intended to allow all regions of Canada to 
be supplied with wheat, and not to provide the grower with a 
subsidy he could then use as he wishes, to pay for shipping 
wheat, raising cattle or operating a slaughterhouse. In other 
words, to use this money to increase his personal wealth without 
necessarily supplying regions where wheat is less plentiful. 
That is why this assistance was applied directly to 
transportation, to ensure supply.
<P>
	If we, in Quebec, object to it being any other way, it is because 
we believe that, if the province of Quebec-with about 25 per 
cent of the total population of Canada-were assigned 25 per 
cent of the overall budget for agriculture, it would be receiving 
$800 millions more every year and could easily use this extra 
money to diversify its agricultural production.
<P>
	On the other hand, if the assistance went directly to the 
grower, then the money which was intended to be applied 
directly to transportation would be directed to that region of the 
country where it would be put to a use that differs from the very 
objective, the very principle of Crow's Nest, as it was called, 
which would destabilize the entire Canadian farming industry. 
We have always been opposed to this direct subsidy concept in 
the East, that is to say in Quebec as well as in eastern Canada.
<P>
	You may remember that there was a report tabled by the 
previous government. In 1983, the Liberal government had 
considered subsidizing growers directly, but the idea was 
rejected. Later on, following an extensive Canada-wide debate, 
the Conservative government also held an inquiry into the 
Crow's Nest problem, which concluded that things should 
remain as they were. The very fact that the hon. member raises 
this issue again today goes to show that a block really exists and 
how different both sides' philosophies are.
<P>
	As for his remark on transportation in the East, it goes without 
saying that we too, in Quebec, are not clear on a certain number 
of things. But one must bear in mind that in that case, we are 
dealing with a common household commodity like potatoes. If a 
potato grower from Prince Edward Island or New Brunswick 
receives federal freight assistance, that will cause some inequity 
vis-à-vis growers from other regions, like Ontario and Quebec, 
who have started to grow this product. For example, the grower 
from Pierreville, in my riding, who wants to sell his potatoes in 
Chicoutimi receives no freight assistance, while potato growers 
from New Brunswick or Prince Edward Island do.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2872"> 2872 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	So, that is somewhat unfair. However, we recognize that this 
legislation to help the Eastern provinces is still worth something 
and we think the freeze will be extremely hard on these regions 
which are going through tough economic times. The 10 per cent 
freeze stipulated in the legislation is a very harsh measure.
<P>
	As for the 10 to 15 per cent increase in the West, it is also a 
tough decision which brings into question the supply process we 
had in the East for crops coming from western regions. Finally, 
the hon. member wondered about the port of Montreal and 
mentioned that the use of ice-breakers was extremely costly. 
Personally, I think the port of Montreal was one of the most 
profitable ports in Canada and was affected by the opening of the 
St. Lawrence Seaway. If you want to maintain the seaway, which 
does not serve only Montreal, but links the city to other parts of 
Canada, you need to keep the port of Montreal open in the winter 
months. That seems as obvious to me as it was to the 
Government of Canada when it decided to build the Seaway.
<P>
	Although I understand very well the issues raised by the hon. 
member, I want to tell him that I do not agree at all with him 
about wheat production in western Canada and the subsidies 
going directly to the farmers instead of the shippers. Above all, I 
do not agree with his view on keeping the port of Montreal open 
in the winter months, even though it costs money. We have 
gained some expertise in the area of ice-control throughout 
Canada and the Coast Guard is renowned throughout the world. 
We could even export our expertise, make it some kind of know 
how, as you say in English, knowledge we could export.
<P>
	That is all I had to say following the brilliant speech made by 
the Reform member, even though I do not agree with him.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
comments and questions.
<P>
	With regard to prairie grain subsidies I would point out that if 
they go to the farmers they still have to transport their grain. It is 
not a question that they are going to pocket that money, use it for 
other things, and not bother to ship their grain because there is 
no way to get paid until they ship it.
<P>
	The point I was trying to make during my presentation was 
that these subsidies to western grain farmers could be reduced 
or, for that matter, virtually eliminated if we also eliminated the 
other unnecessary expenditures they are burdened with right 
now because of the problems with shipping grain other than the 
cost factors.
<P>
	With regard to the port of Montreal the hon. member seemed 
to indicate that it should be kept open because it was a decision 
made by the Canadian government. It was also a decision made 
by the Canadian government that put us over $500 billion in 
debt. I do not think the hon.  member likes that decision. Many 
decisions made in the past have to be questioned.
<P>
	I am not questioning whether we should be keeping the port of 
Montreal open. To suggest that we shut down the port would be 
ridiculous. In my speech I said that I had no objection to the 
icebreaking service being made available to ships, but let them 
pay the cost of having this service provided to them. It otherwise 
forms an extremely expensive offset subsidy in direct 
disproportion to all other subsidies for the service.
<P>
	We have to look at ways of cutting all costs right across the 
country in virtually every area the government does business. 
This is just another way of addressing the problem.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Albina Guarnieri (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Canadian Heritage):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives me 
great pleasure to join today's debate. I am rising to speak in 
support of Bill C-17 and to address more particularly clause 18 
which introduces an amendment to the Broadcasting Act. This 
amendment will allow the CBC a greater measure of financial 
flexibility.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	I would like first to convey my appreciation to the Minister of 
Finance faced with the difficult task of balancing so many 
competing priorities. His support for the CBC has been most 
gratifying. I know the employees of the CBC, including very 
many talented Canadian artists along with millions of loyal CBC 
viewers, also join me in expressing their appreciation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The importance of public broadcasting in Canada fully 
justifies such a commitment. Thanks to public broadcasting, 
Canadians remain in touch with one another locally and 
nationally scene and with the whole world. Public broadcasting 
also gives all communities across this vast country of ours a 
chance to define and articulate their own vision of the world. 
Public broadcasting plays a decisive role in reaffirming our 
national identity.
<P>
	That is why annual budget funding for the Canadian 
Broadcasting Corporation totals about $1 billion. This is 62 per 
cent of all federal funding for cultural agencies reporting to the 
Department of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	However, the financial situation of the CBC has deteriorated 
in recent years. Since 1984, its budget has been cut by over $200 
million, which has had the effect of increasing its dependence on 
advertising revenue. In 1984, this source of financing made up 
21 per cent of the CBC's total budget. Today, it is 36 per cent of 
the CBC's total budget, an increase of 15 per cent, although this 
has not been enough to turn around a very serious deficit. Its 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2873"> 2873 </A></B>
<P>
dependence on advertising revenue calls into question the role 
of the CBC as public broadcaster.
<P>
	Furthermore, the 1993 budget inflicted cuts totalling $100 
million, effective in 1996. The CBC has already told us that if its 
financial situation is not turned around, it will have to proceed 
with further cuts in operations.
<P>
	However, the problems of the CBC are not only due to budget 
cutbacks, a structural deficit and the impact of the recession on 
advertising revenue. The Canadian broadcasting industry has 
changed considerably in recent years. New and specialized 
services obtained operating licences in the eighties.
<P>
	Canadians now enjoy a wider range of programming and 
services than ever before. Although these changes are 
significant, they are only a preview of what we can expect in the 
broadcasting industry. In radio and television, technological 
progress will generate even greater diversity. It is expected that 
this diversity will lead to increased competition, fragmented 
audiences and major investments in technology, and will 
increase the cost of Canadian programming.
<P>
	In television, the advent of direct satellite broadcasting and 
the ability of cable companies to increase the number of 
channels they offer mean that 200 or even 500 channels will be 
available before the end of the century. New American direct 
satellite broadcasting services will be extended to Canada in the 
next few months. Cable companies will add a number of new 
services, including a number of specialized services which the 
CRTC is expected to authorize this year.
<P>
	This new competition will further fragment the audiences and 
advertising revenue of Canadian broadcasters, including the 
CBC.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	Radio is also facing a number of changes. A few years from 
now, we will probably be seeing new radio services and digital 
technology adopted by existing services.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Our government has an historical tradition of supporting 
CBC, of supporting Canadian culture.
<P>
	Our electoral platform was clearly outlined in the red book. In 
that document we stated that culture is the very essence of our 
national identity, the bedrock of national sovereignty and 
national pride.
<P>
	At a time when globalization and information and 
communications revolution is erasing national borders Canada 
needs more than ever to commit itself to cultural development.
<P>
	There is no single instrument more important to the 
development of our national cultural identity than the CBC. This 
belief was the basis for our electoral pledge to provide the 
corporation with stable, multi-year financing. It is a key 
element in our plan to strengthen the CBC's ability to adapt to 
the new communications universe.
<P>
	On February 3 of this year the Prime Minister announced the 
appointment of Mr. Anthony Manera as president of the CBC. 
Mr. Manera has enjoyed a distinguished career both within and 
outside the CBC. His commitment to the ideals of public 
broadcasting and his understanding of the corporation are deep 
indeed. The government is confident that under the capable 
leadership of Mr. Manera and the direction of the board of 
directors the corporation will meet its many challenges.
<P>
	The government recognizes the enormity of the task before 
the CBC. In asking itself how the CBC can continue to reflect 
our fundamental values that project an image of Canada in 
which all Canadians recognize themselves the government 
understands that it must provide some measures of assistance to 
the corporation.
<P>
	As a first step the government has committed not to impose 
new reductions on the CBC over the next five years subject to 
annual parliamentary approval of appropriations.
<P>
	In addition, the government agreed to reprofile the cuts 
announced by the last government in order to ease their 
integration by the CBC. This measure comes in cost of $100 
million in foregone savings to the consolidated revenue fund. It 
is a sure sign of this government's commitment to the CBC that 
this decision was made in the context of severe financial 
constraints.
<P>
	These measures, the appointment of a strong new president, 
our agreement not to impose new reductions on the CBC and the 
reprofiling of previous cuts will give the corporation both the 
leadership and the clear picture of its financial future for the 
next five years it needs to plan for the longer term with 
confidence.
<P>
	The next step in our campaign to help the CBC has been our 
agreement to grant the corporation's longstanding request for a 
borrowing authority. This measure will permit the CBC to 
become more efficient in its operations and allow it to enter into 
other ventures acceptable to the government that provide a 
return on investment.
<P>
	The proposed legislative amendment to the Broadcasting Act 
would authorize the CBC to borrow from the consolidated 
revenue fund and from Canadian banking institutions through 
lines of credit, commercial loans and issuing bonds or 
commercial paper.
<P>
	These borrowed funds would be used only to generate 
operating savings or for venture investments. The operating 
savings would accrue from investments in small and medium 
capital equipment and projects which have a payback of four 
years or less.
<P>
	At the present time the corporation is unable to take 
advantage of such opportunities due to its shortage of capital re-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2874"> 2874 </A></B>
<P>
sources and the immediate need of addressing physical 
obsolescence in plants and equipment across the country.
<P>
	Although the CBC can currently request an advance from the 
government this can be obtained only in exceptional 
circumstances.
<P>
	The present situation is inadequate for two reasons. Requests 
must be evaluated in competition with other government 
priorities and the outcome of a request is directly dependent on 
the availability of operational reserves.
<P>
	An obvious example of how this initiative could generate 
operational savings would be the purchase of capital equipment 
to replace leased equipment.
<P>
	The operational savings would first serve to repay the capital 
investment over a period of three to four years and then further 
be applied against the corporation's operational shortfall. The 
authority to borrow would also facilitate the corporation's 
undertaking of large scale initiatives that further the 
achievement of the CBC's mandate and yield significant returns 
for a relatively small investment.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	A good example of an initiative of this magnitude is the recent 
arrangement reached by the CBC to establish its owned and 
operated stated in New Brunswick. If the CBC had taken out a 
loan of $9.5 million for the purchase of the station, the 
advertising revenues from this new station would have allowed 
the CBC to repay the loan over a shorter timeframe than the life 
of the current agreement. The ability to borrow would have 
improved the CBC's financial position over the term of the 
agreement by over $3 million.
<P>
	At this juncture I would like to assure the House that under no 
circumstances would the CBC be permitted to use these 
borrowed funds to address an operational shortfall and thereby 
operate on deficit financing. The CBC would be responsible for 
raising all the borrowed funds and ensuring that all procedures 
are followed in full compliance with the guidelines for market 
borrowings by crown corporations issued by the Department of 
Finance. The cash flows from the projects in question would 
remain with the CBC with their first priority being to service the 
debt.
<P>
	The CBC's borrowing ceiling would be $25 million. A 
memorandum of understanding between the CBC and the 
Department of Finance would set out the terms and conditions 
governing the borrowing authority. Foremost among these 
conditions is that the CBC would require the approval of the 
Minister of Finance for each case in which borrowed funds were 
required.
<P>
	In my opinion granting this long standing request for the 
borrowing authority is an important initiative in fostering the 
business like flexibility that is required for a $1 billion 
corporation with commercial objectives like the CBC.
<P>
	No other corporation operating such a large enterprise would 
wish to operate without at least some such ability to borrow for 
viable investment opportunities.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The government and the CBC have taken a joint approach to 
resolving the corporation's problems. In addition to these 
measures, the minister has resolved to consult with his Cabinet 
colleagues, with other broadcasting industry stakeholders and 
with the corporation itself with a view to finding other ways of 
generating revenues in the public broadcasting field which 
would reduce the CBC's dependence on advertising revenues.
<P>
	For its part, the CBC is expected to eliminate structural 
deficits and to absorb inflation costs as well as operating costs.
<P>
	Mindful of the unique and highly enviable reputation enjoyed 
by the CBC's radio broadcasting services as well as the vital role 
that regional services play in helping the corporation serve the 
regions and introduce them to audiences nationwide, we have 
asked that current radio services and a regional presence be 
maintained.
<P>
	The challenge is formidable. The move to grant the CBC 
limited borrowing authority will be one important component of 
the new strategy which the corporation will need to embrace if it 
is to meet the challenge.
<P>
	Clearly, what we want is a renewed CBC.
<P>
	Canada needs an effective public broadcaster as a front-line 
weapon in the battle to defend our cultural sovereignty against 
the influences of globalization.
<P>
	To wage this battle effectively, the CBC must do the 
following: it must be the perfect reflection of regional 
perspectives across the network; it must help English-speaking 
Canadians and French-speaking Canadians gain a better 
understanding of the other group's culture by exposing them to 
programs produced by the other group; it must contribute to the 
common understanding of the multicultural or multiracial 
makeup of our population; it must adopt the strictest standards 
of journalistic responsibility; finally, it must co-operate with 
the rest of the broadcasting industry in an effort to come up with 
new markets for Canadian programs and sound recordings.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	If we really want the CBC to be the typically Canadian voice 
that will shape our national identity in a multichannel 
environment, we must give it the necessary tools with which to 
confidently plan its future.
<P>
	I call upon my hon. colleagues in the House to support the 
passage of Bill C-17 which, among other very commendable 
things, will amend the Broadcasting Act so as to grant the CBC 
limited borrowing authority. Recourse to this mechanism under 
the stringently controlled circumstances described above will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2875"> 2875 </A></B>
<P>
give the CBC considerable commercial flexibility. In turn, this 
flexibility will result in operating savings in the long run.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
wish to congratulate the member opposite for her spirited 
defence of mother corporation.
<P>
	I think most Canadians grew up with CBC and view it as an 
integral part of our lives. However, I have a problem with CBC 
particularly over the last few years. I also have a problem with 
CBC as a purchaser of advertising from CBC, but that is another 
story.
<P>
	I wonder if the member opposite would comment on this 
question and I will phrase it this way. The CBC is neither fish 
nor fowl. It tries to be a private broadcaster but it is a public 
broadcaster. It tries to be a public broadcaster and it is caught up 
in being a private broadcaster.
<P>
	I wonder if the member opposite has given any thought to the 
CBC's paring itself down to a more affordable operation or a 
model, striving for excellence using the BBC as a model, BBC-1 
or BBC-2, running a commercial free network but not in 
competition with the private broadcasting networks.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Guarnieri:</B> Mr. Speaker, the Reformer is on record as 
wanting to privatize part or all of CBC. I thank the hon. member 
for his question.
<P>
	As some make this recommendation they also claim that 
Canadians would be better served by the privatization of CBC. 
All they would succeed in doing by imprudent budget cuts is 
waste much of the money that remains spent on the CBC because 
it will not be commercially viable and its product would 
deteriorate to irrelevance.
<P>
	Closing the CBC or severely cutting funding would be to dam 
the last river of Canadian culture and leave it in effect as a 
stagnant pool. Certainly if the hon. member has suggestions to 
make he may wish to make representation before the CRTC.
<P>
	The hon. member also said that all Canadians recognize the 
importance of CBC as a refuge from the mainstream of 
American sitcoms and documentaries about the civil war or the 
FBI. As the principal carrier of Canadian content, the CBC does 
prevent Canadians from being completely culturally 
disenfranchised.
<P>
	Regrettably, though, the CBC must continue to suffer the 
slings and arrows of Reform MPs who were advocating its 
demise, unfortunately with a very narrow view of what 
constitutes Canadian culture.
<P>
<B>(1645 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not think the hon. member 
opposite heard what I said when I asked the question. My point 
was this. Would the CBC not better serve the people of Canada if 
it were to become a true public broadcaster rather than trying to 
be a private broadcaster and a public broadcaster? It may 
necessitate scaling down so that it could go into a commercial 
free broadcasting mode similar to the BBC. The BBC is world 
recognized for the quality of its programming.
<P>
	The point that I would ask the hon. member to consider is that 
perhaps Access TV for instance in Alberta may be shut down. 
Why could the programming on Access or TVO not all be put 
into CBC and CBC become truly a public broadcaster?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Guarnieri:</B> Mr. Speaker, perhaps the hon. member would 
like to elaborate, when he says that there should be substantial 
cuts, where these cuts should be made.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have been sort of struggling with a comment made by 
the chairman of the CBC on a panel show I watched a few weeks 
ago.
<P>
	He made a statement which I believe was just incredible. He 
said that the CBC should not concern itself with economic 
viability but rather with delivering a Canadian culture to the 
Canadian people.
<P>
	While that may be barely acceptable in traditional economic 
good times, I hardly think that this is a traditional economic 
atmosphere that we are enjoying right now. It may be tradition 
given the history over the last 15 years. It is all very nice to have 
an outlet or a means of conveying Canadian culture but when the 
government is borrowing well over $100 million a day to stay in 
business, I would ask the minister whether she thinks this is the 
time to separate our wants from our needs. To have this 
expensive albatross around our necks at this time is sort of like 
going downtown to buy a new television set when one does not 
have any food in the cupboard.
<P>
	What does the government have in mind in trying to get the 
CBC on an economically viable basis rather than just a black 
hole in which to throw money?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Guarnieri:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the 
instant promotion but I am a mere parliamentary secretary and 
not a minister. Thank you anyway.
<P>
	The hon. member makes the point that there should be more 
food in the cupboard but to many people culture is a form of food 
and sustenance. It is the unifying link that binds this country 
together. The measure that the government has proposed and put 
on the table before members is very responsible. It is done with a 
view to ensuring that we are fiscally responsible. The money 
that we are proposing is money well spent.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
Friday, March 25, my colleague, the hon. member for Mercier, 
addressed this House on Bill C-17. She asked members to adopt 
the following amendment: ``That this House refuse to proceed 
with the second reading of Bill C-17, an Act to amend certain 
statutes to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in 
Parliament on February 22, 1994; 1) given that the amendments 
to the Unemployment Insurance Act do not reduce the inequities 
between have and have-not regions in the country and contain 
no specific measures to reduce youth unemployment; 2) given 
that the amendments to the Unemployment Insurance Act do not 
cancel the increase in premiums paid by workers and employers 
in effect since January 1, 1994.''
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	Today is the period allocated to ask the House to adopt this 
amendment. The reasons that led my colleague to present her 
amendment are increasingly relevant, and the population, 
particularly in Eastern Canada, clearly supports our demands. It 
is unacceptable to ask Atlantic and Quebec recipients to become 
scapegoats so that the current government can satisfy its 
appetite for rationalization in unemployment insurance as 
impartially as it does in this bill.
<P>
	As my colleague from Mercier clearly stated in this House, we 
cannot ask Atlantic Canadians, who account for 8.5 per cent of 
the Canadian population, to accept cuts of 26 per cent of the 
unemployment insurance budget. We have the same problem in 
Quebec, where 25 per cent of the Canadian population will be hit 
by cuts of 31 per cent.
<P>
	Quebec has known for a long time that the Liberal Party of 
Canada was going to impose such economic losses on Quebec if 
it came to power. It knew that the Liberal government would 
present bills allowing it to save $5.5 billion over three years and 
that the bill would be split inequitably among the provinces. In 
the proposals contained in Bill C-17, Quebec and the Maritimes 
end up with a large portion of the bill while western Canada and 
Ontario are much less affected.
<P>
	Quebec knew that one of the first measures taken by the 
Liberal government would be to approve an increase of 7 cents 
in unemployment insurance premium rates, which it did on 
January 1, 1994, nine weeks after being elected. Quebec knew 
that this increase would eliminate 9,000 jobs. And to look good, 
this same government proposes to re-create these same 9,000 
jobs in 1995 and 1996 by bringing premiums down to their 1993 
levels.
<P>
	The government gives with one hand what it took with the 
other and expects to be taken seriously. Quebecers were not 
fooled. They elected 54 members of the Bloc Quebecois to 
defend their interests, and that is what we intend to do here until 
Quebec becomes a separate country, and we demand that the 
redistribution of  wealth, whether through unemployment 
insurance or any other social benefit, be fair until Quebecers 
hold all the levers of economic control and are masters in their 
own country, Quebec.
<P>
	If Bill C-17 extends for two years the freeze on compensation 
for federally appointed judges, Parliamentary agents, the 
Governor General, the Lieutenant Governors and 
parliamentarians, fine, but it is not all right if it raises the 
premiums of workers whose buying power is already lower and 
the premiums of companies that already have trouble competing 
in a world of global markets; that is unacceptable.
<P>
	However, the Minister of Finance had the opportunity on 
February 22 to present a budget for a fair redistribution of 
wealth by taxing the richest individuals and sparing the poorest. 
That is not what the Minister of Finance did. He presented a 
budget in which he projected a deficit of $39.7 billion for 
1994-95, when the total debt has already exceeded $500 billion.
<P>
	On March 7, I asked this House to fight the deficit and waste. I 
suggested to this House some ways to create permanent jobs and 
to improve Canada's finances. Today I would like to add some 
ways to reduce the deficit, improve our economy and make our 
people more secure, while redistributing our wealth fairly and 
equitably.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	Let us look at water transportation. In his budget speech, the 
finance minister mentions the upgrading of ground 
transportation but fails to specify how it will be done.
<P>
	Well before the advent of rail and air transportation or 
trucking, waterways were used by the early settlers. Canada 
goes from sea to sea and holds the largest bodies of fresh water 
in the world. A majestic river flows through it. Canadian 
harbours played a critical role in the development of Canada and 
Quebec. However, in recent years, the majority of ports have 
been experiencing serious problems.
<P>
	And yet, waterways provide the most economical and the least 
polluting means of transportation. Our merchant marine has 
been all but abandoned and our shipyards are facing great 
difficulties, especially in Quebec. It is not a question of building 
ships just for the sake of it; indeed, we can and must build ships 
to lower transportation costs and preserve the environment we 
live in.
<P>
	The development of Quebec City's harbour and most ports 
along the St. Lawrence Seaway is based mainly on grain 
transportation. Whereas western ports see their share of grain 
shipments increased, St. Lawrence Seaway harbours are nearly 
at a standstill. The problem is compounded by a drop in Russia's 
grain purchases due to an excellent wheat crop in that country. 
What are we to do in such a situation? We must find another 
vocation for our majestic river and our fresh water bodies. For 
example, cruises are an ever-expanding sector both in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2877"> 2877 </A></B>
<P>
United States and in Canada. Some 7,500 people went on  
cruises ending in Quebec City this year compared to 4,300 last 
year. Is this not an exciting new niche for a country like ours? 
We could at the same time develop our merchant marine and 
give work to our shipyards such as MIL Davie, in Lauzon, which 
are world-renowned in their field.
<P>
	I am making these constructive suggestions to the House 
because they were ignored in the budget speech.
<P>
	Let us now look at duplication. Is it not time that agencies, 
departments and other government bodies be carefully reviewed 
to determine if they really offer an essential service? Is it not 
time for the various government levels to communicate with 
each other and put an end to duplication? Our party has been 
bringing tax shelters to the attention of this government for 
some time now, but they did not have the courage to abolish the 
real tax shelters of the rich, family trusts, for example. They 
prefer to postpone such decisions and let a committee study the 
question. However, the government did not ask a committee to 
examine the question when it decided to cut the tax credit for 
those 65 and over. They certainly know how to make decisions 
when attacking the have-nots! They knew very well how to go 
about it when they decided to cut UI benefits through bill C-17.
<P>
	Canadians need reassurance. A country's economy grows out 
of its resources and Canada's most important resource is its 
population. Even though we make use of our human resources 
we are not making the most out of them, mainly because they are 
insecure. Our population feels insecure in areas like education, 
unemployment, health services, social housing, violence 
against women, the uncertainty of our future, legislation and 
governmental programs; it feels insecure about the leaders of 
this country. People worry when they see UI benefits shrink 
from year to year.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	What will happen to this program in ten years? Will it be 
gone? Canadians are concerned when they hear about user fees 
in the health sector. Will they be able to get medical attention 
when they need it? Canadians are worried when they see that the 
budgets allocated to education and health care are being reduced 
all the time. They are concerned about the future. Will there still 
be work tomorrow, in spite of the promises made by some 
federal and provincial Liberal politicians?
<P>
	Finally, Mr. Speaker, Canadians are worried because of their 
leaders' lack of concern for current problems. Let me give you 
two specific examples. Some 30 farmers in my riding incurred 
substantial losses in the production of potato chips. A request 
for financial help was made to the previous government. The 
request was rejected. Yet, some farmers from the Atlantic 
provinces who suffered similar losses were compensated. The 
farmers and their MPs made a request to the government in 
office. After two months, the government acknowledged receipt 
of their request, but took no concrete action.
<P>
	Another group of individuals in my riding who are 
disillusioned with our leaders are those who were affected by the 
urea-formaldehyde foam insulation scandal. This tragedy 
occurred under the former Liberal government, of which some 
prominent members are still here. Let us not forget that the 
current Minister of Foreign Affairs was one of the key players in 
this episode.
<P>
	Once again, I transmitted a request to the government in 
office asking it to take its responsibilities, instead of delegating 
them to the judicial process. The government acknowledged 
receipt of the request but did nothing else.
<P>
	Throughout the debates in this House, we will have to keep in 
mind that all regions of Canada and all classes of citizens have 
to be treated equally. Is it right that, in Canada, 63,000 
profitable companies do not pay taxes? Is it right that, in 
Canada, some millionaires manage to only pay a few hundred 
dollars in taxes every year? Is it right that, in Canada, powerful 
families can avoid paying taxes on billions of dollars through 
family trusts?
<P>
	Middle-class workers know that the first penny they earn is 
taxed and that the government takes half of it.
<P>
	In conclusion, if we want to balance our profits and 
expenditures, if we want to absorb our deficit, if we want our 
economy to resume its former role at the international level, if 
we want our wealth to be redistributed fairly, we have to restore 
confidence among Canadians. We have to meet their 
expectations and we have to answer their questions. We have to 
give back to Canadians the place that should always have been 
theirs: in other words, we have to realize that they are the 
number one resource in our economy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to ask two questions. When we came into 
office, we were faced, and everybody agrees on that, with a 
deficit of about $45 billion and an accumulated debt of about 
$500 billion. My colleague said that there were a number of 
things he would have done, supposedly, if he had been in power 
to try to control the deficit and the debt.
<P>
	He forgot to tell us how much he would have saved on each of 
his initiatives. Moreover, he said-and he will correct me if I am 
wrong-that he would have spent more. He said three things: 
Here is what I would have done, but without telling us how much 
he would have saved; here is what I would not have done, 
although some cuts have saved money and he did not say what 
would have replaced them. And finally, he said: Here is what I 
would have spent over and above what is already being spent.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2878"> 2878 </A></B>
<P>
	If I am not mistaken, there was a deficit of $45 billion and a 
debt of $550 billion, and I believe he would make things worse. 
If I misunderstood, I am waiting to be corrected.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	The second thing he mentioned that I object to are user fees. I 
never heard anyone on this side of the House mention such a 
thing. Why scare people? Why does he pretend that we are 
studying the matter? In fact, the Minister of Health has said 
repeatedly ``no user fees'', so why does he make such a 
comment? Does he not feel that it is unjust, cruel, maybe a bit 
dishonest?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond:</B> Mr. Speaker, listening to the hon. member for 
St. Boniface, I am pleased to learn that we are allowed to accuse 
one another of making dishonest comments. I wonder if the hon. 
member heard the first part of my speech. I think he may have 
come in partway through. I will nonetheless answer his two 
belated questions.
<P>
	First, what we blame the present Liberal government for is 
that in its February 22 budget it came up with nothing more than 
a national infrastructure program which will cost $2 billion in 
federal taxes, $2 billion in provincial taxes and $2 billion in 
municipal taxes, after running its campaign on a platform of 
jobs, jobs, jobs. This program will create 45,000 jobs per year, 
but just temporary ones. When Metropolitan Boulevard in 
Montreal and Saint-Jean Street in Quebec City have been 
upgraded, and the sidewalks redone, what other structural 
projects will there be to create permanent employment?
<P>
	We, in the Bloc Quebecois, have suggested innovative job 
creation projects. A project like the high speed train would 
create 120,000 work-years of employment for the duration of 
the construction phase as well as 40,000 permanent jobs to 
operate the Quebec-Windsor corridor. It would also be possible 
to export Bombardier technology under North American licence 
for use in ten upcoming HST projects. Two hundred billion in 
investments over the next 12 years, that is what infrastructure 
programs, programs that create permanent jobs and high-tech 
jobs are about. That is my position with regard to the national 
debt and the deficit.
<P>
	I will also remind the hon. member for St. Boniface that, had 
Quebec said yes in the 1980 referendum, the accumulated 
federal deficit was $75 billion at the time, compared to over 
$500 billion today. At this rate, what we are going to tell the 
people of Quebec next time around is that we can no longer 
afford to remain part of this country; we must get out because it 
is headed for a $600-billion or $700-billion deficit. That will be 
one of the arguments in the next referendum campaign.
<P>
	As for deterrent fees, it is true that, since January 17, I have 
never heard the Minister of Health, or anyone else for that 
matter, say there would be any. I must admit that is true. Yet, 
with regard to the provinces' finances, the danger is that all of 
them end up facing cash flow  difficulties and that the have-not 
provinces can no longer afford providing health care services 
because of cuts in federal transfer payments.
<P>
	In Quebec, we are facing a real danger of finding ourselves 
back, like in the 1950s, with two types of medical practices: one 
for the rich and another one for the poor. With sickness striking 
without distinction of social status, race, language, and so on, 
there is a danger that the only way some Quebecers will be able 
to afford treatment will be to mortgage their home and 
belongings or to sell everything. That is the danger. It is true that 
the federal government never talked about imposing deterrent 
fees, but it does put the provinces in a situation where they could 
well experience cash flow and public finance problems that may 
divide people into two classes for health care.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to the comments of the hon. member of the 
Bloc. He talked about ways to create permanent jobs.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	I have a question for him. He mentioned three particular 
projects: the TGV high speed rail line, the Quebec to Windsor 
corridor and the exporting of Bombardier technology to 
different parts of the world.
<P>
	As I am sure most economists and the Bloc will acknowledge, 
real permanent jobs must come from the private sector. 
Although the current government disagrees with the Reform 
position on how to create real jobs and pushes ahead with credit 
card infrastructure programs to create temporary jobs, does the 
Bloc agree that the source of real permanent jobs is from the 
private sector? If so, is the hon. member talking about total 
private sector investment in the three particular megaprojects he 
has suggested? Or, is this another request for more government 
subsidies and more government money to be poured into the 
province of Quebec?
<P>
	I find absolutely incredible that day after day we come to the 
House and hear the Bloc party talking about wanting to leave our 
country, wanting to separate. Yet day after day the Bloc sits in 
the House and continually asks for more money. Indeed this is a 
contrast in thought.
<P>
	I want to ask the hon. member about these three projects. Is he 
simply looking for more government money to be poured into 
Quebec? I noticed this morning the Liberal government 
authorized some $575,000 going to the Montreal Symphony 
Orchestra and the Quebec Ballet going on a European tour. 
Earlier I talked about not having any food in the cupboard and 
buying a television set. This is just another case of money going 
into the province of Quebec that we just do not have.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2879"> 2879 </A></B>
<P>
	Would the hon. member advise me whether he is talking about 
total private sector investment in the three projects, or is he 
simply looking for another handout?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond:</B> Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member for the 
Reform Party sees a contradiction between statements by 
members of the Bloc and what we receive from the federal 
government, I want to make it clear that every year, Quebecers 
pay $28 billion in taxes to Ottawa. I hope that when the federal 
government invests in Quebec, no one here thinks the 
government is doing us a favour. It is our money, because we pay 
$28 billion in taxes.
<P>
	As long as we are part of this system, and until such time as 
Quebecers say they really want to form a country, and in any 
event, Reform Party members who keep presenting petitions 
against official languages in Canada won't have a problem any 
more with what happens in Quebec. Quebec will be a French 
nation. You won't have to present any more petitions to 
complain about federal investment in Quebec, because Quebec 
will manage its own taxes, both federal taxes and provincial 
taxes.
<P>
	So there is no contradiction involved in claiming our due 
while we are part of this system. The federal government is not 
doing us a favour.
<P>
	Regarding investments in a high-speed train service, a task 
force including representatives from the Government of Ontario 
and the Government of Quebec and chaired by the hon. Rémi 
Bujold, former M.P. for Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, 
has shown that a Quebec-Windsor high-speed train could be 70 
per cent financed by the private sector, while the government 
could inject 30 per cent, which would represent investments 
totalling about $2.3 billion. The revenue generated by 120,000 
person-years of work during construction and 40,000 
person-years when a high-speed train is in operation would 
total $1.8 billion, which means that the difference between $2.3 
billion and what the federal government would contribute with 
$1.8 billion in tax revenues would be $500 million.
<P>
	We voted in favour of a project worth several billion dollars to 
build a fixed link between Prince Edward Island and New 
Brunswick, because we felt it was a good project. We are 
convinced that if this proposal is debated in this House, a project 
that would create jobs, export technology, and nevertheless have 
a limited impact on the public purse, with 70 per cent 
participation by the private sector, it would be a very attractive 
proposition for Canada and Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1715 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin my remarks 
by-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I apologize for interrupting the hon. 
member but, before I give him the floor, it is my duty, pursuant 
to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the question to be 
raised tonight at the time of the adjournment is as follows: the 
hon. member for Laurier-Sainte-Marie-Average income of 
Francophones.
<P>
	My apologies to the hon. member for 
Broadview-Greenwood. Resuming debate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin my remarks by 
continuing on the theme that the member for the Reform Party 
discussed. It had to do with the contradiction of the Bloc 
Quebecois coming into the House and constantly talking about 
separation, yet at the same time asking for more support for 
megaprojects.
<P>
	I have absolutely no problem with the members from Quebec 
fighting for their constituents, for their community and for 
projects that will help revitalize the city of Montreal and the 
province of Quebec. If we can get the economies of Montreal 
and Toronto going again it will go a long way in affecting all 
parts of the country.
<P>
	What bothers me is the fact that the members from the Bloc 
never talk about the announcement that the Minister of Finance 
made on January 21 when he stated the terms of the five year 
equalization renewal, the equalization entitlement. As you 
know, Mr. Speaker, because of our Constitution we have an 
equalization formula. It is a complex formula where the 
provinces of British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario, which are 
the wealthier provinces, are contributing to those provinces in 
our Confederation that do not have the same resources.
<P>
	On January 21 the Minister of Finance announced a $70 
billion package for the province of Quebec. Over the next five 
years there will be a transfer of funds that will go to the province 
of Quebec, unfettered, no strings attached. I have yet to hear a 
member of the Bloc acknowledge that the $70 billion transfer 
under the equalization entitlement to the people of Quebec is a 
good thing. They seem to pretend it is not happening, that it does 
not go on.
<P>
	I am not begrudging this transfer in any way. It is part of our 
contract to keep Confederation together. But when they stand in 
the House and talk about some of the difficulties we are having 
collectively in trying to get our economy going again, I wish in 
fairness that they would acknowledge the fact that for the last 
five years on equalization the province of Quebec received 
$50.2 billion and for the next five years it will receive an 
additional $70 billion.
<P>
	The people in my community in Toronto cannot figure out 
transferring $130 billion to a community that is talking about 
separation. I am waiting for the day when the Bloc members 
start speaking publicly about the  equalization entitlements and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2880"> 2880 </A></B>
<P>
the amounts that the people of Quebec will be receiving over the 
next five years.
<P>
<B>(1720 ) </B>
<P>
	They should not confuse their constituents by saying, as the 
member of the Bloc stated earlier, that they pay so much in 
income taxes to the federal treasury. I think the member said $28 
billion or something and that they should have all of that back. 
They get all of that back and more under equalization.
<P>
	Therefore, do not link the income tax being paid to the 
equalization entitlement. They are two separate issues. The 
equalization transfer is over and above all the other programs, 
services and fundings that are transferred to the province of 
Quebec.
<P>
	I want to say, as someone from downtown Toronto, that to 
spend $100 billion over the next five years to keep Quebec 
feeling that it is part of Confederation, I personally would have 
absolutely no problem.
<P>
	It was a very rough week for us in Toronto. We thought we 
were going to receive the centre for NAFTA for the 
environmental studies. We did not receive it but that is the game. 
You win some and you lose some. I guess my point is that I wish 
the members of the Bloc would show some of appreciation, not 
just to their constituents but to the people of Canada.
<P>
	I realize that is just a little bit off topic from the budget 
amendment that we are discussing today but I thought it was 
relevant to the debate.
<P>
	The part of the bill I would like to speak specifically to has to 
do with part IV, the borrowing authority of C-17. This is the 
section in the bill where-and I can see my friends in the Reform 
Party getting twitchy already-through the approval of the 
Minister of Finance, we are authorizing the Canadian 
Broadcasting Corporation, Radio-Canada, to a further 
borrowing power of $25 million.
<P>
	I know that the members of the Reform Party have great 
difficulty with how we, when we are in such difficult times, 
could authorize for the CBC a further indebtedness or a further 
support of $25 million. I want to say to members on the other 
side that this is the right thing to do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Say that with a straight face.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> I do say it with a 
straight face. As I was saying to one of our colleagues this 
morning, the CBC is really not like any other business in the 
country.
<P>
	I do not know why I am defending the CBC because it has 
never been particularly good to me or for that matter to any other 
politician. It is one of those rare situations where we are 
defending an organization that is constantly attacking us. That is 
what makes this country so interesting.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you signalled that I have only a couple of 
minutes. As we head into this very sensitive period where once 
again we will all be required to make sure that in the interest of 
national unity we bring our best foot forward, I really feel that it 
is important that the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, 
Radio-Canada-radio, television, Newsworld-have a solid 
footing and a solid organization. This is an institution, as I am 
sure most people in Canada would agree, that is probably the 
best binding agent we have in a communications instrument.
<P>
	We hear from musicians in every region who might otherwise 
not get the opportunity to be heard on a national basis. As I 
mentioned earlier today in debate it is a high quality 
organization for communication and production. It is also a 
tremendous training ground.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	This is one area where, when we analyse the balance sheet of 
the CBC, we have not given it proper credit. This has been an 
area where it has trained people who ultimately have gone on to 
produce on other TV networks and in the motion picture 
industry. They are high quality technicians. Many of them now 
are creating product that we are exporting around the world. It is 
giving us not only a presence in North America but a Canadian 
presence all over the world. For that reason I would urge all 
members to support this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I really 
appreciated hearing the comments of the hon. member across 
the floor, especially when he talks about the have provinces of 
Canada and telling everyone here today that Alberta is one of 
those.
<P>
	It is wonderful to come from a have province. But we are 
going through one of the most painful periods in our history 
right now as we have a deficit reduction program that affects 
every man, woman and child in Alberta.
<P>
	I am very concerned about the fact that feel good money is 
going to a province such as Quebec. There is no vision within 
that province that includes all of Canada. It is very well defined 
within their own borders for them.
<P>
	It was interesting for the hon. member to have drawn an 
analogy between this feel good money that will be going to 
Quebec at all costs just to keep them and embrace them. I would 
love it if they could make the choice for themselves to stay in 
this wonderful country of ours.
<P>
	I am totally opposed to that $25 million support for the CBC. I 
would like the hon. member to explain to me how he can in all 
good faith support the spending authority when there is 
basically no plan attached to it. It is just a carte blanche gift of 
spending. I really would like him to comment on that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2881"> 2881 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to begin my remarks by saying to the member that in no way 
do I consider the equalization money being transferred as feel 
good money.
<P>
	I do not believe that the Bloc Quebecois are the only people 
who speak for the province of Quebec. We have a provincial 
Liberal government right now in Quebec. The money, I believe 
and hope, goes into responsible publicly accounted for projects, 
such as retraining, education, et cetera. Please, let us not call 
this money feel good.
<P>
	I want to say to the hon. member who comes from the 
province of Alberta that I realize her province is going through 
deep pain. So is my city and my province. However having said 
all of that, Quebec and some of our Atlantic provinces are even 
much worse off than the member's province and my province. 
That is something we have to realize.
<P>
	As far as the $25 million for the CBC goes, and I do not think 
it is receiving this money and just going out and buying 
frivolous things, this money goes through a very rigorous 
process and goes into Canadian content and new production. The 
hon. member talked this morning about the CBC getting more 
revenue.
<P>
	One of the reasons why the CBC is short on revenue is that it is 
competing with the CTVs of the world that have much more 
American content. The content in terms of Canadian budget and 
Canadian productions is not anywhere near the budgets of 
programming on other networks, CTV, which basically rents its 
finished product from abroad. The money will be going to 
enhance the production of CBC programming which hopefully 
will raise its quality and which will ultimately make it as 
productive as other networks.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	I think the member has to realize and have the good faith that 
the new administration of the CBC, not putting down the 
previous one, has assured the CRTC and members of this House 
that, as all of us in this country are undergoing restructuring and 
renewal, it does not feel that it is exempt. It is going to do its best 
to make sure that this money is used efficiently.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Fundy-Royal):</B> Mr. Speaker, through the 
course of today's debate much has been said about specific 
elements of this budget. I would like to take a few moments to 
put our discussion into context by reminding hon. members that 
the broad direction of the budget is one that has been described 
by the president of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce as 
headed in the right direction and very specific about how to get 
there.
<P>
	This budget addresses three vital challenges. The first is to 
build a framework for economic renewal. The second is to 
restore fiscal responsibility and the third, to ensure long term 
viability of our social programs.
<P>
	The budget takes a balanced approach to these goals because 
they are the foundations for what Canada needs most, growth 
and jobs. This budget is the first stage in a two stage process. 
The direct actions taken today will be followed by extensive 
policy reviews leading to further action in the future.
<P>
	The government has taken concrete action to meet the urgent 
need of creating jobs and revitalizing our economy. Canada as 
we all know has just passed through a difficult recession. That is 
why we are taking immediate action to restore consumer 
confidence and spur growth, action such as our national 
infrastructure program.
<P>
	Currently in New Brunswick as in other provinces we are 
determining the first projects to receive funding from the $153 
million to be spent in our province over the next three years. 
This government has also announced strategic measures to help 
Canada compete and prosper in the new economy. This budget, 
for example, takes action to assist small and medium sized 
businesses, the driving force behind job creation in our fast 
evolving economy. Measures including reduction of regulatory 
and payroll tax burdens as well as improved access to capital and 
new technology are essential for continued growth and job 
creation in the new economy.
<P>
	In keeping with the vision of this budget the standing 
committee on industry has begun a study on the access by small 
and medium sized business to new and traditional sources of 
financing. In the past weeks this committee in keeping with the 
government's pledge to consult with Canadians has heard 
testimony from small and medium sized business owners from 
across the country.
<P>
	I am pleased to note that a number of Atlantic Canadian 
business people have come forward to give excellent testimony 
on this very important subject. Small business people know how 
hard it is to get a modest loan and this committee wants to see 
how the government can help.
<P>
	The budget takes decisive action to bring the deficit down 
now and set the country on a realistic path toward a responsible 
target of 3 per cent of the GDP in three years, a target that no 
Canadian government has reached for 20 years. We will 
accomplish this mainly from expenditure reductions. In this 
area this government is leading by example.
<P>
	Bill C-17, for example, freezes the salaries of members of 
Parliament. Over the next three years net savings from all 
spending cuts will reach $17 billion. This represents the most 
extensive program of net spending reduction of any budget in 
more than a decade.
<P>
<B>(1735 ) </B>
<P>
	We still have work to do. Even with last week's encouraging 
news of the largest monthly decline in the unemployment rate in 
10 years, we still have too many Canadians out of work. We have 
an economy where one in six children lives in poverty and where 
social programs that were once the envy of the world no longer 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2882"> 2882 </A></B>
<P>
meet our  different needs and have outrun our ability to pay for 
them.
<P>
	This budget sets the stage for a historic modernization and 
restructuring of Canada's social safety net over the next two 
years. The goal of this reform is to provide modern and 
sustainable programs that respond to contemporary needs like 
skills training and incentives to work.
<P>
	The budget takes a critical first step toward this broad goal by 
initiating concrete action in two major expenditure areas: 
unemployment insurance and federal transfer payments to 
provinces in support of social programs.
<P>
	Rising unemployment insurance premiums for business are a 
major obstacle to job creation. The changes to UI announced in 
the budget will lower premiums and provide the creation of 
more jobs. As the president of the Canadian Federation of 
Independent Business said: ``It is a huge incentive for small 
business to create business''.
<P>
	In the recent past federal action toward the provinces 
appeared to be based on a strategy of sneak attacks, 
confrontation and denunciation. This led to federal-provincial 
relations increasingly charged with tension. This budget rejects 
this approach. Instead it provides for predictability and modest 
growth in equalization transfers during the timeframe for social 
program reform.
<P>
	Throughout the course of the reform process the federal 
government will work with all of the provinces to redesign our 
social programs. We will co-operate in studying reforms and 
testing new approaches with extensive consultations with the 
public to receive their input along the way.
<P>
	In the province of New Brunswick we recently announced 
co-operation agreements between the federal and provincial 
ministers to find new ways for making a better Canada: a youth 
jobs strategy program at CFB Gagetown to allow young people 
between the ages of 17 and 24 to receive skills training in 
different trades; the New Brunswick job corps program which 
provides a guaranteed income for participants in return for 
volunteer services. This program is targeted at individuals over 
the age of 50.
<P>
	As the finance minister for Newfoundland said recently, all of 
us and every province in this country have to be part of the 
solution to the Canadian problem.
<P>
	The spirit of federal-provincial co-operation I have 
described extends beyond the budget measures relating to social 
security transfers. Despite the co-operative and constructive 
approach this budget takes toward the provinces, some hon. 
members have expressed concern about the regional impact of 
specific measures. As a member of Parliament from Atlantic 
Canada, I believe I can bring an important and constructive 
perspective to this critical issue. I say this because we in 
Atlantic Canada realize the scope of the national problem and 
we know that to correct it, tough decisions have to be made.
<P>
	We know we must look forward to the new opportunities 
provided for in this budget, opportunities like the infrastructure 
program and our experimental job corps, opportunities that get 
business working in the proper climate to create the jobs and 
economic security we need for the 21st century.
<P>
	We in Atlantic Canada recognize the importance of taking 
control of our own destiny. We are spearheading the move to 
lower interprovincial trade barriers and have truly free trade 
Canada within Canada.
<P>
	In concluding, I would say that this budget has been described 
as a road map to the future. It takes measurable, bottom line 
action to help build the future opportunity and solid growth. It 
does so with rigour but also with compassion and creativity. 
Therefore I urge all hon. members to support this bill.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I was disappointed I did not get to make some 
comments to the hon. member across the way. I know he was 
looking forward to that.
<P>
	I just heard the hon. member for Fundy-Royal talking about 
the merits of the budget. There were a couple of things that sort 
of struck me which I have discussed with other members in these 
debates.
<P>
	First of all I would like to say the statement made by the 
president of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, as the 
member pointed out, rang about the same bell as that of the 
chairman of one of the major banks during the referendum 
debate when he said that in essence the world is going to end if 
the Charlottetown accord did not pass. Of course we saw that did 
not come about exactly.
<P>
	The member is saying that this gentleman has said that the 
Liberal budget is on the right track. I wonder just exactly where 
that track leads to. There are a couple of inconsistencies. The 
member talks about all the different job creation programs that 
the budget is going to bring about. I wonder if the answer to the 
unemployment problem in Canada to the Liberal government is 
simply to put everyone who is unemployed on a government 
program.
<P>
	I am sure those people would rather have real jobs. I go back 
to my earlier comments about where real jobs come from. They 
come from the private sector industry that has confidence in the 
fiscal responsibility of the government.
<P>
	That is what this government has to show and it has to show it 
by cutting spending in real and positive terms. This has not 
happened.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2883"> 2883 </A></B>
<P>
	The actual spending has increased by $3 billion this year. The 
member said they had made significant cuts in spending. That 
may be quite true but this is in proposed spending and projected 
spending not in real spending.
<P>
	I can say I am going to spend $50,000 next week on something 
and then cut it back to $2,000. Can I take credit for saving 
$48,000? This is the same type of accounting that the previous 
administration used and the Liberal government before that.
<P>
	We have to start talking in real terms about what it is going to 
take to get this economy going again. It is not going to be credit 
card infrastructure programs. It is not going to be job creation 
programs for which there are no jobs once the people graduate 
from those programs or attain their apprenticeships.
<P>
	It is going to come from private sector confidence and private 
investor confidence when they start investing in this country and 
expanding their business. That is where it is going to come from.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Zed:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member's 
comments. In fact in as many days as I have spoken in this House 
the Reform Party has raised the issue of the infrastructure 
program. I would remind the hon. member that it is the 
infrastructure program that is in fact giving Canadians 
confidence. It is the package, if you will. That infrastructure 
program is what is spurring the confidence.
<P>
	I agree with the hon. member that small and medium sized 
businesses create 80 per cent of the new jobs that are created in 
this economy. But if the government does nothing but cut 
without stimulating I would suggest to the hon. member that we 
are going to be mired in a deeper recession than the one we are 
getting out of.
<P>
	It is a balance. That is what has impressed me the most about 
this Minister of Finance and about our government, that there 
has been a balanced realistic approach. The cuts represent $17 
billion.
<P>
	I am one member who would have liked deeper cuts, faster 
cuts, but I have been convinced that this is a balanced approach 
and over the next three years we will be within 3 per cent of the 
GDP which I believe is responsible.
<P>
	I would urge the hon. member, if he has some suggestion 
about what is wrong with our infrastructure program, to let us 
hear it. However I know a lot of people and a lot of 
municipalities are enjoying the benefits of the infrastructure 
program.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi): </B>Mr. Speaker, I would 
simply like to make a comment about the programs which my 
colleague mentioned and that are presently considered in his 
province of New Brunswick.
<P>
	I do not know if the hon. member has read <I>La Presse</I> this 
morning, because one headline says: ``New Brunswick wants to 
force single mothers to identify the father of their child'', and I 
have followed the experiments that are being done in this field, 
``Those who will refuse will lose access to welfare''. Is that the 
kind of model we want to give Canada?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Zed:</B> Mr. Speaker, that is not the program I am referring 
to. The one I am referring to is an opportunity for young people 
to be trained in a specific area: perhaps an environmental 
project, a silviculture program as the lifeblood of New 
Brunswick is the wood industry, or some community based 
program. A program was recently announced for people over 50 
years of age who would only be making about $8,000 on welfare. 
In this pilot program 1,000 individuals will be eligible to receive 
$12,000.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my comments in these short 10 minutes were to be on the 
omnibus bill, a bit about UI reform and, if there were time, on 
the wage freeze. However the eloquent, noble and spirited 
defence of members opposite of the mother corporation CBC 
drove me to buy a newspaper to find out what the oracle of 
Canadian culture had in store for us tonight.
<P>
	For the edification of members opposite and for those in 
television land, they can want see ``All in the Family'' at seven 
o'clock, ``Blossom'' at 7.30, ``Fresh Prince of Bel-Air'' at eight 
o'clock or at 8.30 ``Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Part II''. Is the 
oracle of Canadian culture worthy of the money we are going to 
be borrowing from our children to pay for it? Does it need more 
money? Should we give it $25 million so that it can get capital?
<P>
	Let me deal, folks, with the Canada assistance plan because it 
is fairly serious.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That is the Canada assistance plan.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Yes, it is.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> First, it would be very much 
appreciated if the member would put his remarks to the Chair. It 
is a long established tradition. Second, the member actually has 
a 20-minute slot.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> I could go on at more length about the 
mother corporation in that case.
<P>
	In any event, this omnibus bill in support of the budget is of 
great importance to our nation. As other members have said, it 
sets the stage for what is likely to happen over the next few 
years.
<P>
	Under the Canada assistance plan, as members know, the 
Government of Canada was to fund generally speaking 50 per 
cent of the money the provinces must spend in the welfare 
programs they administered. A few years ago this was changed. 
The Canada assistance plan payments by the federal government 
to the three provinces of Ontario, British Columbia and Alberta 
were  capped. The net result was that these provinces were 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2884"> 2884 </A></B>
<P>
frozen into a situation whereby they were getting less money 
transferred from the federal government but were really having 
more demands put on their resources.
<P>
<B>(1750 ) </B>
<P>
	The real problem is that we as a nation will go through the 
trials and tribulations of living within our means. This will 
inevitably mean cutbacks. Unless these cutbacks are done fairly 
across the nation and in all sectors of our economy tremendous 
resentment will be built up.
<P>
	Let me give an example of what is likely to happen or what is 
happening with the capping of transfer payments. <I>Maclean's</I> 
magazine of April 4 speaks to the problems Ontario is going to 
face because of the Canada assistance plan being capped: 
``Through the Canada assistance plan Ottawa paid 50 per cent of 
the welfare costs of the seven poorer provinces but picked up 
only 29 per cent of Ontario's 1993-94 tab of $6.3 billion. 
Quebec got 10 per cent more funds with 43 per cent fewer 
beneficiaries''.
<P>
	Let us think about that. If a Canadian is on welfare or in need 
of funds from the government and lives in Ottawa or anywhere 
else in Ontario, the federal government pays 29 cents of every 
dollar of those costs. However, if he or she lives across the river 
in Hull five minutes from here, the federal government pays 50 
per cent of the cost. Is that fair? That might have been fair 
because of an extenuating circumstance that might last for a year 
or two, but let us remember that the budget locked in the 
inequity until 1998. What strains will that put on the budgets of 
Ontario, British Columbia and Alberta?
<P>
	There is a solution. The federal government could increase 
the payments to the three have provinces or it could reduce the 
payments to the three have not provinces to bring them all into 
line so there is balance and equity.
<P>
	A further example from <I>Maclean's</I> magazine indicated: ``In 
1992 Ontario employers and employees paid $1.67 billion more 
into the unemployment insurance fund than they drew out in 
benefits. The province blames UI rules that allow workers in 
areas of higher unemployment to work for shorter periods for 
longer benefits''.
<P>
	Several members mentioned earlier that this was an 
appropriate means of transferring funds into very depressed 
areas of the country, that it recognized some parts of our nation 
were in worse shape than others. Unemployment insurance 
should be unemployment insurance. When unemployment 
insurance was brought into being it was not determined at that 
time that it was to be a wealth transfer. It was to cushion 
employees who lost their jobs for one reason or another until 
they found another one.
<P>
	From that aspect the budget goes a long way in eliminating or 
at least ameliorating the problem. The government is to be 
commended for recognizing that unemployment insurance 
continually taxes those who are working. It really is a tax on jobs 
and is going to do more harm than good in the long run.
<P>
	As well, if the words we hear from the task force looking at 
unemployment insurance are true, that unemployment insurance 
may in the future be determined as an insurance program paid by 
employees, it will be another big step to reforming 
unemployment insurance. It is just blowing the dust off the 
Forget commission report and implementing it 15 years or so 
after it was written.
<P>
	What do we do in the areas of Canada that need the transfer of 
UI funds so that people can exist? We need to look at it as two 
separate entities. Unemployment insurance should be 
unemployment insurance, the purpose for which it was intended. 
Income supplements should come through some other 
government function but be accountable. If it ends up being a 
guaranteed annual income or whatever it might be, so be it, but 
let us not confuse the two issues so that we end up with nothing.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	I would like to give a personal example of how unemployment 
insurance as it is used today is a disincentive to employment and 
costs far more than it should. Without the permission of my son I 
will use him as an example. He is a very fine young man who 
quit his job just before he was going to get fired because he was 
not doing a very good job. It was a fairly well paid job. He 
thought he would not have any trouble going out and finding 
another one. It turned out that he was wrong. He had a great deal 
of trouble finding another one.
<P>
	Every two weeks he got a cheque in the mail for over $600. 
When the time came for me to say to him ``Marry, go out and get 
a job'', he would go out looking but none of the jobs would pay 
anything like the amount of money he was getting for doing 
nothing. Unemployment insurance was not tiding him over until 
he could get a new job. Unemployment insurance at that level 
was robbing him of the initiative to go out and get a job.
<P>
	He grew up in a home where industry and initiative were the 
bywords and the watchwords. Let us just imagine what the 
richness of the program has done all across the nation to 
hundreds of thousands of people who are milking the system, 
who are using the system as it was never intended to be used.
<P>
	The steps the government is taking with regard to UI are in the 
right direction. However it must be coupled with some other 
program to ensure that people on the bottom end of the totem 
pole are able to exist and move themselves out of poverty, 
recurring poverty.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2885"> 2885 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to spend a few minutes talking about the wage 
freeze which is a good idea. It is a particularly good idea in the 
House because we are the leaders of our country. The people at 
the top of the heap in any circumstance, especially a difficult 
one, should be the first to take a hit. A wage freeze in the House 
is entirely appropriate. It is entirely appropriate in the upper 
echelons of the public service.
<P>
	However we have to do more than just say we are going to 
freeze the wages. We have to look at how we could get the most 
efficiency out of the money we are spending. We can bet that 
people in any organization including the Public Service of 
Canada lay awake at night trying to figure out how they can get 
around whatever particular obstacles are in their path and make 
a few more bucks.
<P>
	If we were to look at it we would see that the only people who 
are really suffering a wage freeze are the people who are on the 
bottom rung of the ladder in the public service because they 
cannot reclassify their jobs.
<P>
	For example, right here on Parliament Hill employees of the 
lowest order of employment had to restructure their 
employment base, come in on weekends and change things 
around so that they could no longer make overtime because there 
was no more overtime. They cannot come in and work on a 
weekend and get paid overtime. Yet other people in the 
hierarchy here have reclassified their jobs so that they can then 
get an increase by reclassification.
<P>
<B>(1800 ) </B>
<P>
	Another example that was brought to my attention during the 
recess was in the weather stations across the nation. A person 
from the public service brought to my attention the fact that we 
have replaced weather recorders who used to be paid in the 
region of $30,000 with a machine that costs about $250,000.
<P>
	These machines have a life of about five years and require one 
person to maintain them and travel around. Bonuses are paid in 
the public service for anyone who is able to reduce the person 
years of employment in their sphere of influence. What happens 
is that if one gets rid of five weather observers and replace them 
with a machine, one would get the bonus for reducing one's 
payroll. However, the expense of the five machines goes to one 
ledger and the expense of the maintenance person goes on 
another ledger. We still have to pay it but we are really no better 
off than we were when we started or perhaps a little further away 
from where we wanted to be.
<P>
	It also does not do any good in terms of employment. What we 
have to do as a country is not just say we are going to have a 
wage freeze, but we have to go through our books line by line 
just as we would in the private sector and ask how we can make 
everything that we do more effective, more efficient and work 
better rather than just saying willy-nilly, we are going to put a 
freeze  on this or we are going to put a freeze on that. While it 
sounds good, it really does not accomplish anything.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to spend just a couple of minutes 
addressing the question of Quebec and the fact that this has 
come up for those who have been following this debate. Every 
time a member of the Bloc stands in this House, at least in my 
experience, it has been to cry how badly off the Bloc is treated 
financially by the rest of Canada and yet it is to request more 
money from the Government of Canada.
<P>
	I hope that when this great national debate takes place in this 
House and in the rest of the country we talk honestly and openly 
and fairly about who gets what out of Confederation. Speaking 
for myself and for many of my colleagues here, speaking for the 
people I represent in Edmonton Southwest we do not mind 
because we recognize that we are better off than most paying 
money into Canada that is used as equalization going to other 
regions of Canada to help them along.
<P>
	However, we really resent it when we are paying this money 
into an equalization pool and the people who are on the 
receiving end of it just ask for more and never say thanks. As 
this debate over the next few months unfolds, I hope we will talk 
honestly about whether we are together as a nation because we 
want to be together or because we are together as a nation only 
because we continually pull out the wallet and throw money at 
the problem. I can guarantee that if that is the only reason that 
we are together as a nation it will not last.
<P>
	This budget in some aspects is a step in the right direction. 
Certainly to be fair it is better than anything the Conservative 
government came up with over many years. Let us not kid 
ourselves, it is merely the first tentative step. The very difficult 
and hard decisions are yet to come. They must come because not 
one person here, not one Canadian anywhere in this land has 
ever spent their way into prosperity.
<P>
	The only way that we as a nation can make our futures better is 
if we live within our means. It is not morally right for our 
generation or the generation that preceded ours to live beyond 
our means at the expense of generations of Canadians yet 
unborn. We are going to have to bite the bullet, live within our 
means and make the tough decisions necessary.
<P>
<B>(1805 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Beryl Gaffney (Nepean):</B> Mr. Speaker, at the outset I 
thought that the member from the Reform Party was going to be 
talking about the CBC. He started talking about the CBC in his 
initial comments and started quoting on the program that we 
could watch with great anticipation and delight this evening.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2886"> 2886 </A></B>
<P>
	I do not know whether he had the occasion to watch <I>Venture</I> 
last night. It was talking about the BBC and the types of 
programming that the British Broadcasting Corporation has.
<P>
	When watching the breadth, the depth and the scope of what is 
allowed to be broadcast in the UK as opposed to what our CBC is 
allowed to broadcast here in this country I felt slightly ashamed. 
Here we have a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that we are 
literally starving to death and not allowing it to use any amount 
of intellect as to the type of broadcasting that it can show us.
<P>
	I had to stop and think that it probably had to do with money. It 
had to do with the amount of money that we were giving it. If we 
are going to starve it to death then we might as well put it out of 
existence. We might as well not have a CBC as to allow it to 
slowly starve as to what it is allowed to show us.
<P>
	I think we are being very shortsighted and I would like to hear 
the comments of the member opposite on this. I think that the 
CBC was created the same way as our railway system was 
created in this country because we are such a vast country. We 
need to know what is happening in Northwest Territories and in 
Yukon or even in Alberta for the information of the Reform 
member.
<P>
	There is nothing more enjoyable to me than driving home at 
night, I live in the nation's capital, listening to that program 
broadcast from coast to coast and I can hear what is happening in 
Newfoundland or I can hear what is happening in British 
Columbia. I can find out what is happening in this wonderful 
country.
<P>
	My question to this member is does he really believe that the 
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation has a role in this country in 
broadcasting? If he does, how does he expect it to accommodate 
what we as Canadians would like to see on its programming with 
the type of money that we are allowing?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, to the hon. member opposite, 
the program that we were both watching last night was <I>60 
Minutes</I>, another American program.
<P>
	When the hon. member mentioned driving along she was 
talking about the CBC radio program <I>As it Happens</I> that I think 
many Canadians listen to regularly.
<P>
	I think if we were to say what model would we have for CBC 
television it would be CBC radio because we have to make 
distinction between CBC radio and CBC television. If I were 
looking for a model it would be CBC radio on television.
<P>
	How would we go about achieving that? All across this fine 
nation we have public television. We have Access in Alberta and 
whatever it is B.C. and we have TVO in Ontario and in Quebec 
and in the maritimes. They are the educational television 
networks. They are all struggling for money. They can barely 
survive.
<P>
	Would it not make sense for the CBC rather than to be 
telecasting the dribble that it is telecasting tonight in prime time 
to be taking some of the programs that are on Access and start 
working toward that?
<P>
	The CBC last year started to sell itself as ``flash, the public 
broadcaster''. In my view what it is trying to do is live off PBS. 
It is trying to be a Canadian PBS but it is not.
<P>
	Let the CBC become a public broadcaster. Let the CBC 
broadcast BBC type programming and get out of commercial 
programming. Why is CBC competing with CTV for the 
broadcast rights of the Olympics?
<P>
<B>(1810 ) </B>
<P>
	It has to be either fish or fowl and if it is going to compete in 
the private sector then let it compete in the private sector on a 
level playing field and not get one cent from the public purse. If 
it is going to get money from the public purse and call itself a 
public broadcaster then stop telecasting this dribble and become 
a public broadcaster and that is all I am suggesting.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Comuzzi (Thunder Bay-Nipigon):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise after my friend who talked about <I>60 Minutes</I> and <I>As It 
Happens</I>. There is some confusion here.
<P>
	I am wondering if my colleague and friend from Edmonton 
Southwest would mind if I would change channels for a moment 
and talk about something he discussed about unemployment 
insurance.
<P>
	His comments were, and I am sure my hon. colleague would 
like to correct this, that hundreds of thousands of people are 
milking the system in Canada who are on UI. I am sure he would 
like to rephrase that statement because although we 
acknowledge that there are some abuses in the UI system and 
there are ways we should correct the UI system, when we have 
the number of people we have in this country collecting UI while 
they are looking for other jobs they are very honourable and very 
fine Canadians who are out looking for work.
<P>
	I enjoyed very much the personal experience that my 
colleague had the opportunity to bring to the attention of this 
House but I would like him to correct if he would the 
misconception that there are hundreds of thousands of people in 
Canada who are milking the UI system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a tragic number. There are 
over 1.5 million people in Canada today who are out of work. 
There are social costs in being out of work. It is not just the 
financial costs, it is the lack of self-respect, the lack of 
self-worth experienced when people are unable to get that job. I 
know very closely from personal experience that the sense of 
self-worth and self-confidence really starts to go.
<P>
	At the same time, while certainly there may not be hundreds 
of thousands, there are many thousands. We all remember the 
UIC ski team. We all know of circumstances in which people are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2887"> 2887 </A></B>
<P>
using the system. The  system allows itself to be used that way 
and people are not stupid.
<P>
	If our largesse has the built-in ability for people to use it, it 
also has the built-in ability for people to abuse it and 
unfortunately we have become for one reason or another a nation 
that does not look askance at people who abuse the system.
<P>
	If people cheated on their taxes they were considered to be 
criminals. Every day now people are avoiding taxes, the GST. 
People are using the unemployment insurance or other welfare 
entitlement programs and feel they are entitled to them.
<P>
	I think we have really lost something in our country when we 
became a nation of entitlements or benefits or rights rather than 
responsibilities.
<P>
	I think the germ of the same thing is there that we as a nation 
have forgotten the fact that we are a people with responsibility to 
the nation. Every word we ever hear is about the rights that we as 
individuals have from the nation. We have to turn that around 
somewhere and I think it starts right here in this House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Winnipeg St. James):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to offer one observation as a result of the remarks of 
the hon. gentleman pursuant to the CBC.
<P>
	He may or may not know that I spent 18 years at the CBC and 
so I know a little about that corporation.
<P>
<B>(1815 ) </B>
<P>
	What he neglects to say is that the Canadian Broadcasting 
Corporation finds itself in a catch-22. Those of us who are what 
you might call purists and who defend public broadcasting 
would be more than delighted to see the CBC get out of 
commercial broadcasting completely. I really think that a public 
broadcaster has no business being in the commercial business.
<P>
	As the hon. member should know, there is a refusal on the part 
of a lot of Canadians, probably himself, to fully fund a public 
broadcast network, and so the corporation over the last many 
years has felt the need to get into commercials even in a larger 
way.
<P>
	Then when the corporation does resort to gaining commercial 
revenues a gentleman like him comes along and complains 
about the CBC in broadcasting sports events. Sports events in 
our culture attract large audiences and when we attract large 
audiences that is how we attract commercial dollars or first of 
all how we attract advertisers and that attracts commercial 
dollars. That is the catch-22 or the vicious circle that the CBC 
finds itself in.
<P>
	Do not complain about the CBC's involvement in 
commercials. It is forced to because of the refusal to support it 
well as a public broadcaster. That is the catch-22 the 
corporation is in.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, I certainly do acknowledge 
the fact that the CBC is in a catch-22 position. In my comments I 
think I made it very clear that it is trying to be fish or fowl and 
cannot be both.
<P>
	I have looked at the CBC, as we all have, for many years. The 
CBC is going to have to define its mandate and decide what its 
going to be and how its going to do it and then come to the 
government and say this is what it wants to be or this is what it 
can afford to be.
<P>
	We cannot keep on going as we are going today. The hon. 
member is right, if I had a choice between the CBC as it is today, 
CBC television, and continuing to throw more money at it, I 
would say absolutely not, not another nickel. If we could have a 
CBC, a la CBC Radio, a la the hon. member's intention, then I 
say it is worth contributing to and it is worth supporting. In its 
present state I do not think it is worth supporting.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to take this opportunity to change direction slightly 
in this debate and talk for a moment about infrastructure. That is 
a keystone part of this government's budget and I would like to 
give the very narrow example of what that infrastructure 
program is already doing for my riding.
<P>
	Before I go into that detail I would like to put a little anecdote 
together. Some 10 years ago I had the occasion to go on a 
courtesy flight in an aircraft of the Canadian War Plane Heritage 
Museum. The Canadian War Plane Heritage Museum operates 
from Hamilton civic airport in my riding and had at that time a 
collection of some 40 World War II vintage aircraft, that is 
pre-war and immediately post-war. I had the happy occasion to 
go up in an aircraft called the TBA Avenger. It was a torpedo 
bomber used in the second world war, chiefly in the Pacific, and 
this particular bomber was flown by the Canadian air force 
during the second world war.
<P>
	I flew in the rear gunner position. The airplane was used in 
mock manoeuvres and it was quite an incredible airplane. The 
Canadian War Plane Heritage Museum also had a Hurricane and 
did mock dog fights and there I was. The airplane was diving and 
climbing and it was quite an exciting experience. It was a very 
daunting experience, I have to say.
<P>
	While I was on that flight I could not help but realize that this 
was the real point of this museum. This airplane that I was in, 
this World War II airplane, was a full working airplane. It was 
not just a museum piece. It was something that had been 
restored, lovingly restored, and was in full flying condition even 
though it was almost 50 years old.
<P>
	I have to tell the House a sad thing about that aircraft. A little 
more than a year ago it was destroyed in a fire in a hangar at the 
Canadian War Plane Heritage Museum at Hamilton airport, 
along with a Hurricane from that same vintage. This was a 
terrible disaster to the museum which has become in the 
Hamilton region one of the stellar attractions. The museum had 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2888"> 2888 </A></B>
<P>
at that time about 40  aircraft and attracts about 80,000 visitors a 
year. In that fire five aircraft were destroyed and it was a very 
sad thing.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	I wish to report however that the War Plane Heritage Museum 
which is chiefly staffed by volunteers, with over 6,000 
members, has risen from the ashes. It has done more than that. 
Not only has it embarked on a very aggressive program to 
replace the aircraft that were destroyed, it has also put forward a 
proposal to build a brand new museum on the Hamilton airport 
property as part of the infrastructure program. It has actually put 
a proposal forward.
<P>
	This proposal has gone before the Hamilton-Wentworth 
regional council and it has basically agreed to partial funding. 
The council is going to put up $1 million and the museum is 
going to come up with the other $3 million through donations 
and various other means and then we hope to have matching 
grants from the province and the federal government to bring the 
total cost of the museum to $12 million.
<P>
	The plan is a beautiful one. They want to put up a museum 
which will be right next to the airport terminal. It is going to 
shaped like the fin on the tail end of an airplane and there will be 
two large hangers on either side in which to keep the restored 
aircraft. There will be a viewing area and all that kind of thing. It 
is going to be fairly close to where they are going put the new 
highway 6 bypass. It is going to be a very attractive project.
<P>
	This seems to be a rather odd thing to be a candidate for an 
infrastructure program because we think more in terms of roads 
and bridges. The region is using much of its $53 million 
allocation for just that purpose. This project incredibly fits right 
into the infrastructure mandate as laid out in this program. It is 
going to create jobs and it is going to be operated by the people 
who have put it together.
<P>
	The thing that makes this project so exciting is not only is it 
going to create jobs, it is going to create enormous attention for 
the War Plane Heritage Museum which as I explained already 
attracts 80,000 visitors a year and we can expect it to attract 
160,000 visitors a year when this is completed. Therefore, we 
will see jobs created.
<P>
	The thing that is so delightful about this project is that it really 
is a project that celebrates our past and our identity as 
Canadians, even though it is an infrastucture project. This is the 
thing that is so beautiful about it.
<P>
	For instance, one the the most stellar aircraft in the collection 
is a Lancaster bomber which is one of only two Lancaster 
bombers in the entire world that will still fly. That is the kind of 
object that is in this museum.
<P>
	The reason I bring this up is that to my mind it just shows how 
a program like the infrastructure program that has been 
presented by this government can be taken by regional 
politicians and by ordinary people and be  made into something 
that can inspire our fellow Canadians, can celebrate our past and 
be a very fine thing for everyone involved.
<P>
	I think that other communities will take this program and do 
many things similar to this. It is a very fine program and a very 
fine budget.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I understand that the member is 
dividing his time. The hon. deputy whip to the government, the 
hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell on debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to participate in 
this debate.
<P>
	I want to start by congratulating the Minister of Finance for 
having brought forward such a balanced budget for our country. 
Mr. Speaker, lest you think that I am partisan when I make these 
remarks, which is probably the furthest thing from your mind at 
this point, let me tell you what others have said about the budget.
<P>
<B>(1825 ) </B>
<P>
	John Reid of the Canadian Advanced Technology Association 
says that the budget sends a good message for the economy and 
our rapidly changing job structure. Is that not great?
<P>
	Ted Bryk, president of the Canadian Home Builders 
Association-an appropriate name for a job like that-said: ``I 
think it is fantastic. I see it as a really positive move that will 
encourage young buyers into the housing market''. This is in 
reference to the extension of the RRSP Home Buyers Program.
<P>
	``It is a huge incentive for small business to create business. 
You take a tax off jobs, you get more jobs''. This is in reference 
to the cut in UI premiums by John Bulloch, president of the 
Canadian Federation of Independent Business.
<P>
	Even bankers have said that this is in bankers' language a 
good budget. Mike Chandler of the Royal Bank says that the 
market seems to have given the budget a passing to good grade. 
Considering bankers' compliments as they are, I consider this to 
be pretty complimentary.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	So, as you noted, Canadians agree that this budget is good for 
the future of our country. It is not only commentators who made 
comments on this; we have already seen the effects of this 
budget, and also the effects of having a government that we can 
trust, and we see it in the reduction of the unemployment rate 
since the Liberal government took office.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2889"> 2889 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	What has this meant? It has meant that in March the 
unemployment rate had fallen to 10.6 per cent. Of course that is 
still way too high but we have only just begun. We have reduced 
it from 11.1 per cent in February and the month of February had 
a huge increase in the number of jobs. I say to all hon. members 
that this is good news for Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	So, the infrastructure program is not even implemented yet 
we are receiving bids and we award contracts.
<P>
	The other day, I heard the Minister of Finance tell us that, at 
first, we thought that the infrastructure program would create 
60,000 jobs. Well, we were wrong. It will create 90,000 jobs, 
according to the most recent estimates. And it is not even in 
place yet.
<P>
	So, you see, this government is here to serve the Canadian 
people and to serve them well. We are here, of course, to make 
sure that Canada will prosper. It is useless to preach despair, as 
some of our colleagues opposite do, or as those who like to say 
that we should cut everything and that perhaps the economy will 
work by itself. No. The government is here to govern. It is here, 
of course, to have its say for the good of the Canadian people and 
for the good of our economy.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As a father of two adolescents, I cannot wait for the economy 
to improve. I have a son of 22 years who is just completing his 
fourth year of university this year. I want him to be able to have a 
job, yes, but a good job even more so. I say that we must move 
now to do these things. Every day we wait to pass Bill C-17 is 
costly.
<P>
	For instance, I say this to my colleagues from the Reform 
Party, if the bill is not passed by June 16 in all stages, the Senate, 
royal assent and so on, it would cost $34 million more pursuant 
to the Western Grain Transportation Act. If changes to the 
Unemployment Insurance Act are not made by the first week of 
July, a one month delay would cost $175 million more. The 
people opposite say they are in favour of saving money. This 
would rise to $350 million after three months. That being said, 
we have waited long enough. Therefore, pursuant to Standing 
Order 26(1), I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the House continue to sit beyond the ordinary time of adjournment for 
the purposes of considering the second reading of Bill C-17, an act to amend 
certain statutes to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in 
Parliament on February 22, 1994.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	<I>And fewer than 15 members having risen:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Pursuant to Standing Order 26(2) the 
motion is adopted.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to.)
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would simply like to say that 
as for the House's cooperation, if the government keeps on 
moving such motions without any warning, the Official 
Opposition will put an end to the exceptional cooperation it has 
offered up till now.
<P>
	We had an understanding concerning that bill; we would 
discuss it until 7.10 p.m. in accordance with the Standing 
Orders. But they underhandedly propose continuing the debate 
this evening without giving us advance warning for our 
speakers. We refuse to agree to such methods and if that is the 
kind of game the government wants to play in the coming weeks, 
I can tell you the Official Opposition will not behave as before.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is now time for comments or 
questions on the last speaker's intervention. Are there any 
comments or questions? The member for Richelieu.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu):</B> Mr. Speaker, during the 
five minutes I have left, I would like to make a few comments on 
the speech by the member who just spoke.
<P>
	It is rather surprising to hear him make such remarks when we 
know what he used to say when he was in the opposition. How 
dare he come and tell us with a straight face that unemployment 
has dropped when it has only fallen by one point and only 
because unemployed workers are now on social assistance. 
There is nothing to rejoice about.
<P>
	What I cannot understand is that the member, instead of being 
ashamed of his government's performance, and trying to put a 
good face on a ridiculous budget, is boasting about it. He is 
boasting about his government's performance. He claims that 
his government has created 100,000 jobs, but with what 
projects? With what? With what vision? With what 
performance? This government has no economic vision.
<P>
	Speaking of the last budget, what did it amount to? It amounts 
to the creation of 32 or 33 committees of all kinds to consult 
people, whereas before the elections, they were brandishing 
their red book saying that they had solutions for everything. 
They had solutions for everything but when the time came to 
table the budget, the only solution they had was the same disease 
the Tories suffered from, which is to consult the people. We have 
consultations on defence policy, consultations on economic 
matters, consultations regarding social programs, but no 
decisions.
<P>
	And the member opposite dares come here and boast about his 
government's performance! There is a total lack of vision in the 
bills this government has presented since it came to power. They 
have no vision and they come and tell us that everything is fine. 
They talk about infrastructure, temporary jobs, jobs created 
with borrowed money. They say they will create 90,000 jobs, 
60,000 jobs or maybe 45,000 jobs, none of them long-term. Is it 
the only thing you have to offer your son  who is graduating after 
four years in university? What is he supposed to do? Work for a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2890"> 2890 </A></B>
<P>
few months at a job provided by the infrastructure program? Is 
this the best you have to offer your son, sir? Mr. Speaker, 
through you, I am talking to the member and I think I am getting 
him upset.
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	Well, this government, which has no vision, has decided to 
consult the people instead of making decisions. Consultations 
like people in bars would have held. You only have to listen to 
open-line shows to know that people are fed up, that they want 
decisions, cuts, changes and a fairer tax system.
<P>
	Why not do something about family trusts? About tax havens? 
Because the people who benefit from them are the same people 
who finance your party. Now that you are in office, you do 
exactly what the Conservatives did. It is your turn to enjoy 
pork-barrelling. Instead of saying ``We will not do as the 
Conservatives did'', as you promised to do while in opposition, 
you have not changed a thing. You come up with the same kind 
of budget, the same kind of statements. You brag about 
decreasing the unemployment rate, when you had nothing to do 
with it. You brag about creating jobs, even though not one 
program has been set up since you came to office, and no 
economic direction has been given. You are behaving exactly 
like the Conservatives did in 1984.
<P>
	You had five months to answer my questions, dear colleague. 
Five months to let me know of your government's intentions 
through statements by ministers and a budget that holds up. But 
no, we got nothing at all.
<P>
	I would be pleased if the hon. member could give me an 
answer, albeit a short one. You have already talked too much, 
that is why I did not leave you much time to reply. I would like 
the hon. member to tell me how he can be proud of what his 
government has done, since the unemployed have seen their 
benefits reduced, as of April 1, and have lost $1 billion-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not sure if that was a question 
or a litany. I thought it would never end.
<P>
	The hon. member asks us why we are in favour of 
consultations with regard to family trusts. Does he not 
remember that it was his own colleague, the opposition finance 
critic, who called for consultations? You see, we are so receptive 
that we are even willing to take advice- not too often, of 
course-from a member opposite.
<P>
	The hon. member questions us about the budget, claiming that 
the general public does not like it. I will read you a quote: ``The 
federal Finance Minister's first budget is modest but true to 
what the Liberal Party told Canadians during the last election 
campaign. It will not please those who, like the Reform Party, 
want to slash spending across the board. But, for once, it spares 
the vast majority of taxpayers who already shoulder a heavy 
burden.'' That quote is from <I>Le Devoir</I>.
<P>
	Would you like to hear another one, Mr. Speaker? Here is what 
the <I>Vancouver Sun</I> had to say: ``Mr. Martin kept his word. He 
gave us a combination of tax increases and spending cuts that 
will reduce the deficit a little without compromising a fragile 
recovery.'' Canadians across the country are saying 
unanimously that it is a good budget.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (Lotbinière):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
express to this House my support for the amendment moved on 
March 25 by my colleague, the hon. member for Mercier, 
respecting Bill C-17, an Act to amend certain statutes to 
implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament 
on February 22, 1994.
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
	How can we endorse these amendments to the Unemployment 
Insurance Act? How could we support this government, even for 
one minute? Do you think we were elected to help the 
government swap its promise of jobs, jobs, jobs for bang, bang, 
bang? That is the sound of unemployment insurance reform 
crashing down on the heads of the unemployed if we allow the 
government to come down hard on them, because that it what it 
intends to do, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	In moving her amendment, my colleague gave two reasons 
why this House should refuse to proceed with the second reading 
of this bill. I fully agree with them. How will the proposed 
amendments to the Unemployment Insurance Act redress the 
imbalance between have and have-not regions? Where are the 
measures to reduce youth unemployment? How does the 
government explain its pursuit of a conservative policy and the 
finance minister's refusal to cancel this year's increase in 
unemployment insurance premiums?
<P>
	These are all questions that I have been hearing from my 
constituents and that are being asked across Canada. Is the 
government deaf? I hope that it is not and that it will take these 
concerns into account. The people deserve more than recycled 
conservative policy.
<P>
	There is nothing in this bill that leads us to expect that the 
inequities between the provinces will be eliminated. Who will 
be affected by the amendments to the unemployment insurance 
system? Quebec and the Maritimes. Increasing the number of 
weeks needed to qualify for benefits affects mainly the 
Maritime provinces and Quebec. In the regions hardest hit by 
unemployment, people will have to work two weeks more to 
obtain benefits, that is in regions where unemployment is over 
16 per cent.
<P>
	Let us suppose, an unpleasant hypothesis, that this measure 
had applied in the past few months. Seven of thirteen regions 
would have been affected in the Maritimes and six out of 
thirteen in Quebec. In real terms, we are talking about 277,000 
<P>

<B><A NAME="2891"> 2891 </A></B>
<P>
unemployed people in Canada, of whom nearly 210,000 live in 
these regions suffering from the economic climate.
<P>
	Many young people who have to rely more and more on 
insecure employment will be victims of these measures. They 
will not collect UI, no, they will have to live on welfare. What a 
program, Mr. Speaker!
<P>
	We learned some good news last week: unemployment had 
declined. Bravo! But that is mainly thanks to the economic 
recovery in the United States, so the government should not 
boast. Nothing in its budget has helped the economy recover in 
this country, Canada. But at least, if the economy is recovering, 
the government should not put obstacles in the way of those who 
want to participate in this economic recovery.
<P>
	When I hear the Minister of Human Resources Development 
say that he wants to require beneficiaries to work for longer 
periods to qualify for the same number of weeks of benefits, my 
hair stands on end! As if the unemployed chose to be out of 
work. That is not the problem, Mr. Speaker. Unemployment in 
our area is due to the lack of jobs and to the fact that more and 
more people have to go from one temporary job to another.
<P>
	Do not mention the infrastructure program to me; it only 
creates temporary jobs, not real permanent jobs. There is 
nothing to give confidence back to the 1.5 million unemployed 
people throughout Canada and the 428,000 in Quebec. No. The 
eligibility conditions will not be tightened and the number of 
weeks of benefits will not be reduced. It is a big deal.
<P>
	As I just said, the result will be to shift claimants from 
unemployment insurance to welfare. This passing the buck to 
the provinces, which is what it is, Mr. Speaker, will cost the 
provinces at least $1 billion, of which $280 million is for 
Quebec, according to the figures put forward by three 
economists from the Université du Québec à Montréal. The 
government, more generous, no doubt, estimates the costs at 
between $64 and $135 million only.
<P>
<B>(1845) </B>
<P>
	Clause 28, Part V, of Bill C-17 is complete nonsense. This 
clause modifies the number of weeks of benefit entitlement and 
abolishes the qualifying salary range for UI. As I have just 
demonstrated, these measures affect areas with the greatest 
needs. Again, the unemployed do not choose their situation, no 
matter what certain dinosaurs seem to think in Canada.
<P>
	Still, according to the previously mentioned study conducted 
by three economists from the University of Quebec in Montreal, 
90 percent of the unemployed in Quebec did not voluntarily quit 
their jobs. We are talking here about lay-offs, job losses, 
illnesses or buy-outs. Others are looking for a first job, but are 
not receiving any UI benefits. Job security is practically 
non-existent. We have no control over the length of 
employment. Workers accept casual, precarious or seasonal 
jobs. Not by choice. It is not that they refuse stable jobs and 
decent salaries, but rather that only these types of jobs are 
available. I cannot believe that we must still explain that to the 
government.
<P>
	Another point which supports our case for amending this bill 
is the government's decision not to lower immediately the UI 
premium rate from $3.07 to $3 for employees, and from $4.30 to 
$4.20 for employers. The Minister of Finance decided to 
postpone this move until 1995. I think the good news from last 
week concerning the reviving economy should prompt the 
government to reinstate the $3 rate as soon as possible. You 
know as well as I do how fragile an economic recovery can be.
<P>
	Cavemen did not spit on the fire they wanted to light. Rather, 
they blew carefully on it to make it brighter. It is that kind of 
care that is needed to ensure economic recovery. Why 
jeopardize the recovery when one could have frozen the rates in 
January and could still do it with an amendment to the bill?
<P>
	Not later than last week, the minister of Finance recognized in 
an interview with Canadian journalists that, considering their 
current levels, U.I. premiums killed jobs. The Minister of 
Finance said and I quote: ``The problem today is not that we 
must take fiscal measures to encourage job creation. Rather, we 
have to eliminate fiscal measures that deter employers from 
hiring people. That is the real problem.''
<P>
	I am glad to see that the minister has identified the problem. 
Now he only has to take action. Why was Bill C-17 not brought 
in with that in view? When a job is botched, there is no shame to 
do it again. When the government brings in the House a bill 
which will reduce iniquities between richer and poorer 
provinces, measures which will create jobs for the young and 
cancel the raise in both employers' and workers' premiums, it 
will have done a real good job.
<P>
	As the slogan of a well-known Quebec humorous magazine 
says, it is not because we laugh that it is funny. Yet, I feel that 
this is the reaction of Canadians to the government's promises. 
The government claims that the reduction in the unemployment 
insurance premiums in 1995-96 will create 40,000 jobs by 1996. 
Those who prepared the budget have taught us a few things. 
Every 1 per cent reduction creates some 1,300 jobs. One does 
not have to be a rocket scientist to figure out that any increase 
leads to a loss of jobs in the same proportion. The government 
talks about 40,000 jobs that were eliminated in its last budget. 
Where will the government re-create these 9,000 lost jobs? In 
its budget, the Liberal government proposes to re-create these 
same 9,000 jobs by lowering premiums to their 1993 levels. 
There is the catch! The government will re-create what it had 
eliminated. The remaining 31,000 jobs will not appear as if by 
magic.

	I think these 3,000 workers could return to the labour market; 
is it not the wish of all members of this House to see these 3,000 
people regain their pride? This country needs more people 
working to turn the economy around, but under the current 
system every time you hire someone, you get hit by a whole lot 
of new taxes.
<P>
	The government must be consistent. Yet, it hopes that this 
House will pass its bills without reacting. It should listen to the 
Canadian people expressing themselves through us: let 
businesses and the unemployed breathe; do not stand in the way 
of the economic recovery; refuse to proceed with second reading 
of this bill before it is too late.
