<A NAME="LINK3">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (for the Minister of Finance, Lib.)</B> 
moved that Bill C-11, an act respecting the imposition of duties 
of customs and other charges, to give effect to the International 
Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding 
System, to provide relief against the imposition of certain 
duties of customs or other charges, to provide for other related 
matters and to amend or repeal certain acts in consequence 
thereof, be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, this is one of those occasions which 
rarely arises in this Chamber when all party consent, quickly 
given, is in the interests of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By simplifying the customs tariff, the bill will result in duty 
savings next year for Canadian businesses and consumers of $90 
million and will eliminate red tape.  It will lower the 
production costs for Canadian firms, increase competitiveness in 
domestic and global markets and create more jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of us know that Canada's prosperity depends on trade. 
Exports account for 33% of the gross domestic product and 29% of 
GDP consists of imports.  If the costs of tariffs can be lowered 
for Canadian businesses and administrative burden can be 
lessened, we will have a more competitive job creating economy. 
This is why the government has worked closely with Canadian 
businesses to design a more simple, cost effective customs 
tariff.

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consultations were extensive.  Letters were sent to the leaders 
of the parties opposite from the heads of Canadian businesses and 
business organizations throughout Canada asking for their 
unanimous support for these measures.  They have asked that 
priority be given by Parliament to passage of this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind my colleagues that on January 1 next year, just a 
couple of months off, under the North American free trade 
agreement, tariffs with the United States will be eliminated. On 
this side we share the concerns of business that a simplified 
customs tariff be ready for implementation on that date. Of 
course, this implies that business too must be ready. We have to 
preclude economic disruption, allow for automated systems to be 
adapted and employees to be educated to the new tariff structure. 
This is why government has been working very closely with 
business to ensure that they are ready. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since April Revenue Canada and StatsCan have undertaken ongoing, 
extensive outreach programs with those affected. Officials of the 
finance department have met with businesses and trade 
organizations and participated in conferences to inform 
interested parties.  Obviously, early passage would enable the 
government to provide the information necessary regarding what is 
needed in terms of certainty, clarity and timeliness to the 
business community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quick passage will also demonstrate to Canadian industry that 
Parliament is not only aware of market realities, but is also 
able to respond quickly and effectively to industry calls for 
legislation.  Put simply, it is timely that Bill C-11 be enacted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why?  Because the current customs tariff represents a highly 
unnecessary hurdle to doing business.  It is complex and 
outdated.  It is time consuming and its redundant compliance 
requirements represent both a financial and opportunity cost to 
industry, not to mention government and bureaucracy. We have to 
streamline it, simplify it and update it to make Canadians 
competitive at home and abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With rates of duty on all trade with our largest partner ending 
on January 1, 1998, coupled with other real rate reductions and 
eliminations flowing from the Uruguay round of the World Trade 
Organization, it is important to simplify our regime by 
eliminating complex and redundant mechanisms and ensuring that 
the tariff is responsive to competitive pressures facing Canadian 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our regime has become truly complex.  In all there are now 13 
tariff treatments, 7 schedules, about 8,500 tariff items and 
2,500 concessionary provisions or regulations and over 200 
different rates of duty. The system is complicated, lacks 
transparency and leads, because of its complexity, to great 
uncertainty. This has been noted in many reports by the World 
Trade Organization.  It is imperative to minimize these costs to 
industry. Let us recognize that it is not only in Canada but all 
around the world that tariff rates are going down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Uruguay round, the FTA and the NAFTA have resulted in an 
almost 60% trade weighted reduction in average Canadian tariffs. 
The tariff system must be better adapted to the competitive 
Canadian industrial economy. In the context of an increasingly 
open economy, we have to have dynamic linkages between exports 
and imports, meaning declining rates of duty. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons, the February 1994 budget announced a 
thorough review of the Canadian tariff system over a three-year 
period.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main objectives were to ensure that the Customs Tariff and its 
regulations better reflect the pressures of international competition 
and also to reduce the regulatory burden and all the related costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, a working group was set up within the Department of 
Finance and was mandated to achieve the objectives within three years. 
One of the key points of this review was its consultation of all the 
parties concerned to ensure that the results of the review were in line 
with the objectives set. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meetings were held in order to inform those involved of the 
measures planned and to seek their views. Following public 
consultations, a draft version of the simplified Customs Tariff 
reflecting public comments was issued in March 1996 to give everyone an 
opportunity to prepare their final comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, in order to reach the greatest number of interested parties, 
ads were published in a number of major Canadian papers, and the 
provisional version was displayed on the Internet site. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed legislation and letters of support from industry 
leaders received by the leaders of the opposition parties indicate that 
the consultation process was a success, since business supports the bill 
and is getting ready for its application. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious the bill is based on the measures the current 
government has taken up until now to restructure and modernize the 
Customs Tariff. We hope in this way to help our businesses become more 
competitive and prosperous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In June 1995, Bill C-102 lowered tariffs on a broad range of 
manufacturing inputs, so as to reduce the pressure exerted by the 
competition on Canadian industry as a result of the amendments to the 
drawback program affecting exports to the United States. These 
amendments were necessitated by NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This initiative was the first legislative measure taken to simplify 
tariff provisions. I am very happy to say that it enabled business and 
consumers in Canada to save some $60 million a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The planned tariff reductions will benefit Canadian producers. 
What's more, the administrative burden will be lighter—and related 
costs lower—for both government and business. Finally, the Customs 
Tariff will become easier to implement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will replace the seven existing schedules with a single 
one, simplify the tariff structure and greatly reduce the number of 
provisions in the Customs Tariff. The number of provisions will be 
reduced from 11,000 to 8,000. Moreover, obsolete or unnecessary tariff 
regulations and administrative procedures will be eliminated.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new Customs Tariff will also have a broader application and 
permit unilateral tariff reductions for manufacturing inputs and the 
application of similar measures to the service sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like, in this regard, to remind my colleagues of the 
importance of ensuring that the Canadian service sector is as 
competitive as possible, especially in light of the international 
lifting of trade barriers in the service sector. We all know that the 
service sector is one of the most important ones in our country. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until now I have spoken only in general terms concerning the 
overall economic benefits of simplifying our tariff structure. To 
illustrate these benefits allow me to turn briefly to several 
measures in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have already talked about the duty saving on a wide range of 
manufacturing products.  The legislation will make further 
reductions in this direction, including the acceleration of most 
final Uruguay round reductions currently scheduled for the next 
two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, we are going to get rid of nuisance rates.  Rates under 
2% will be eliminated.  We are going to round other rates to the 
nearest half per cent.  These will be permanent features of our 
tariff system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rate reductions which affect goods coming into Canada that are 
used as inputs for manufacturing are very important.  These will 
reduce the cost to Canadian manufacturers.  It will make them 
more competitive and better able to take advantage of the growing 
regime of free trade.  In short, our industries will be better 
able to compete for jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government red tape also stands in the way of our 
competitiveness.  A case in point is the remaining not made in 
Canada provisions in the tariff to which I referred earlier. 
Under these provisions duty free entry is provided for specific 
goods, mostly manufacturing inputs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While these provisions once provided flexibility to take into 
account the needs of Canadian manufacturers and producers, they 
have now been rendered redundant by the openness of our Canadian 
economy resulting from freer trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, they give rise to inconsistencies in the tariff 
treatment of goods, impose administrative costs to industry and 
the government and create uncertainty over what is dutiable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore we are now converting the remaining not made in Canada 
provisions to duty free items in the tariff schedule without the 
not made condition.  This, again, will improve our 
competitiveness, particularly in our manufacturing sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concerning concessionary codes in the current tariff, these 
provide for reduced rates or free entry for a wide range of goods 
that are not really part of the main tariff. With freer trade 
generally and with the United States in particular, changes in 
trade patterns and technology and other factors, many of these 
provisions are no longer justified.  This is why we have proposed 
to eliminate about 1,000 of these codes.  Another 1,000 or so 
codes remain relevant, since the amount of imports under them 
from non-U.S. sources is significant.  These codes have been 
converted to tariff provisions at concessionary rates in a single 
tariff schedule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To further reduce costs to industry we are terminating the 
machinery program and replacing it with duty free or dutiable 
tariff provisions for unavailable equipment or available 
equipment, respectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently duties on a broad range of machinery from all sources 
are remitted to applicants if reasonable equivalents are not 
available from Canadian production.  Again, however, this program 
has been rendered largely irrelevant, or less relevant, by tariff 
reductions. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1025"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT5"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT5"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1025
<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Implementing tariff items will not eliminate inconsistencies and 
uncertainty, it will alleviate the administrative requirements of 
the former remission process.  Under the proposed legislation 
virtually all machinery production parts and most other parts 
under the program will come in duty free. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the remaining dutiable production machinery under the 
existing program, industry will continue to be able to seek and 
obtain relief under the proposed broadened order in council 
authority to reduce tariffs on inputs.  Any relief granted will 
be implemented by means of amendments to the schedule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to note that following consultations with industry and a 
transitional period of three years, the sole criterion to be 
assessed in considering these applications for relief from the 
tariff will be whether the equipment is available from domestic 
production.  This program will lower costs to machinery users, 
provide greater transparency and predictability and help make us 
more competitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, the regulatory burden will also be reduced by revoking 
an additional 300 duty remission orders that are no longer 
needed.  Yet another 70 regulations will be replaced with simpler 
provisions in the schedule.  For example, for customs duty 
purposes, 12 regulations and 13 provisions that provide fuller 
partial tariff relief on certain temporarily imported goods will 
be replaced by one single tariff item, an item that allows 
conditional duty free entry for virtually all goods that are 
imported on a temporary basis, again to help make us more 
competitive in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Turning to the legislative provisions of the customs tariff 
there are a number of proposed changes in the bill.  Many current 
provisions are not continued in the new tariff because they are 
no longer justified because of free trade.  Others such as the 
machinery program are not continued due to the simplification 
that we have brought about.  Perhaps the most striking change is 
the way the new single consolidated tariff schedule will look. It 
has a revised format with two columns pertaining to tariff 
treatments, reduced from the current five. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government also proposes to eliminate the British 
preferential tariff.  The reductions in most favoured nations 
rates of duty over the years have significantly eroded or, in 
most instances, completely eliminated the preferences under the 
BPT on most imports from developing commonwealth countries. 
Over the years this treatment has been overtaken in many 
instances by other preferential tariff treatments for developing 
countries and has become largely redundant.  The British 
preferential tariff is therefore not in the proposed legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important change to the legislation, which I briefly 
mention, is the broadened order in council authority to reduce 
duties on all imports including production machinery used by 
manufactures and service providers.  It will ensure that the 
government has sufficient flexibility to respond efficiently to 
competitive pressures facing our industries.  It also provides a 
new three year authority for the Minister of Finance in light of 
the experience over that time to rectify errors that we find in 
consultation with our private sector partners.  This provision is 
considered particularly important by the business community in 
view of the wide ranging changes that this bill envisages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given these and other changes to the customs tariff, which my 
colleagues will address during this debate, we proposed to repeal 
the current customs tariff and replace it with an entirely new 
act.  Substantive amendments are also being made to the Customs 
Act including provisions to harmonize the time limits for 
claiming duty refunds and providing for adjustments to tariff 
classifications, origin or value for duty determinations without 
the requirement for a formal appeal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will also provide for a single level of administrative appeal 
in Revenue Canada.  These will simplify the appeal process and 
facilitate a focus on those issues where Revenue Canada and the 
importer may have disagreements. 
Overall we will have a much more simplified, transparent and 
predictable administration and regime.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion this bill and the measures I have detailed here 
today have three overriding results.  First, they will help make 
Canadian industry far more competitive within a much freer global 
trading environment.  Second, they will make our tariff system 
more transparent, more predictable and simpler.  Third, they will 
reduce greatly the regulatory burden and the associated costs of 
that for both business and government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Industry, as it has contacted members on all sides of this 
House, has indicated that it is anxious to see this legislation 
in place for the January 1, 1998 debut.   I am confident that 
members of this House will accede to the needs of industry and 
allow us to pass without undue delay these measures in order that 
uncertainties will not apply throughout our business community.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will be speaking of course to Bill C-11 this morning, the 
simplified customs tariff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes a low profile bill like this does not get a lot of 
attention.  It is not front and centre in the media.  It does not 
get all the excitement around it that some of the other bills do. 
But I want to say this morning how important this bill is because 
of its very significance around what it represents. Bureaucracies 
in general have a tendency to grow and if left unchecked, they 
just grow and grow and grow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This particular piece of legislation that is being proposed is 
counter to that bureaucratic current of continual growth.  I am 
going to come back to that concept later but I would like first 
of all to go through some of the highlights of this particular 
piece of legislation.  I may touch on some of the notes of the 
previous speaker but as I go through these highlights I would ask 
members of the House to focus on the efficiencies and the 
countercurrent to bureaucratic growth that is inherent in this 
piece of legislation and consider applying this same kind of 
approach to other pieces of legislation and other parts of the 
bureaucracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, this particular piece of legislation focused on reducing 
the custom duties on the goods that are used in the manufacturing 
process in Canada, allowing Canadian businesses to better compete 
in the international marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, this piece of legislation totally eliminated some of the 
tariffs and duties for products in a not made in Canada category. 
This allowed Canadian businesses to improve their competitiveness 
on a broader range of duty free imports, but maybe even more 
important is the sea of red tape that that one change allowed. No 
longer do we have to go through an onerous process of determining 
what is a not made in Canada product and trying to track that as 
the situation changes in Canada both by government and industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to also mention the clean-up that was done on the 
concessionary tariff codes.  Many of these concessionary codes, 
as the previous member mentioned, had become obsolete.  Two 
thousand of them in total were either eliminated or restructured 
and put in place as regular tariff schedule items.  There are 
great gains in efficiency there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition we had the elimination of the machinery remission 
program, duties remitted on machinery that was not available in 
Canada. This program had a huge administrative cost both for the 
private sector and for government in the determination of what is 
the machinery that is not available in Canada and how do we track 
it as the situation changes, applying for the remission and then 
tracking to make sure one actually got the remission cheque. 
Then there was all the discussion around whether or not it 
applied to the legislation that was in place.  This was a great 
simplification of the tariff that is inherent in this new 
legislation which we fully endorse.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was also the clean-up and elimination of those duties that 
were expressed in dollars and cents numbers rather than a 
percentage.  The majority of tariffs are in a percentage but 
there were some that were still expressed in dollars and cents. 
It was much more appropriate to move them all into the one common 
format of percentage.  It allows for much greater ease of use. It 
is also more appropriate as the price of the tariff item changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition some of the trade developments that have occurred in 
Canada made some of the regulations obsolete.  Three hundred 
different remission orders and regulations were revoked.  Seventy 
others were replaced with simple tariff items.  Again all of this 
reduced the regulatory burden. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition there was a rationalization of the tariff schedule 
which was terrifically unwieldy the way it was before.  There was 
the elimination of nuisance rates.  Anything that was less than 
2% tariff was eliminated.  There was a rounding off of numbers to 
make it easier to apply the tariff.  There was a harmonization of 
rates on like products.  There was an amalgamation and a fixing 
of anomalies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>None of this is particular earth shaking.  None of it is 
particularly difficult to do.  It just took work.  But the 
benefits to Canadian business and the Canadian government are 
substantial. The cumulative effect is a more predictable, 
simplified tariff legislation with less regulatory burden and 
increased competitive strength.  Some aspects of Canadian 
business I would suggest are even ready for a lot more of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After touching on the highlights of this particular piece of 
legislation, let us go back to the significance of this kind of 
work and take the success of this particular initiative and apply 
it to the broader range of government legislation and bureaucracy 
that is out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, bureaucracies have a tendency to grow.  Why is that? 
It is largely due to their reward structure.  In a bureaucracy 
the way one gets ahead personally is to build the bureaucracy 
underneath oneself.  Always spend all your budget plus a little 
bit more.  Launch new ideas and try to win support for your 
ideas.  Get more people motivated around your good idea with very 
little accountability to what is actually being provided in the 
way of service and the value of that service evaluated through an 
impartial third party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This particular piece of legislation goes counter to that kind 
of bureaucratic tendency in that it serves to shrink the 
bureaucracy and add efficiency.  Those who are involved in this 
type of work are usually within bureaucracies and their efforts 
go unrewarded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to suggest that the Reform Party from the very 
inception recognized this tendency within bureaucracies to grow 
and grow.  Within our policy and platform books it is clear that 
we have called for a simplification of the regulation, a 
rationalization of the redundancies of the processes within 
government, adding to the efficiency and quality of the service 
provided by government but doing it in a way that downsizes the 
extent of the bureaucracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform has recognized the need for this type of initiative from 
the very inception.  In fact within our policy documents it is 
clear that we have also recognized the need for a change in the 
reward structure around bureaucracies.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are calling for within our government is a recognition 
for those people and those individuals who can demonstrably 
deliver a higher quality of service at lower cost. These kinds of 
efficiency gains are usually brought about by individuals within 
the government at the front line or at the first level of 
management who are aware of the waste and aware of where the 
problems are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem today is if those people do take the initiative to 
increase efficiency, they are not rewarded.  In fact they can 
even encounter some very significant resistance.  Our policy 
calls on that type of initiative to be rewarded. If we are to 
really see the bureaucracies in our government begin to shrink 
and become more effective, we need to recognize individuals and 
groups of people who are focused on providing a higher quality of 
service at a lower cost to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to commend the individuals who were involved in 
this project. They consulted with industry.  I am sure there were 
many hours spent poring over this piece of legislation to come up 
with something that is refreshing and is counter to the usual 
growth we see in the bureaucracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With those comments, I would like to say that this is the kind 
of legislation that is a step in the right direction.  It is 
consistent with what Reform has been calling for. Would it not be 
refreshing to apply this kind of approach to other pieces of 
government legislation, perhaps the Income Tax Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people do not realize that the Income Tax Act was 
implemented as a temporary measure to fund the war effort.  It 
was actually 36 pages at that time. Now it is over 600 pages of 
legalese and another 700 pages of special interpretations and 
guidelines.  It is almost twice as thick as the yellow pages in 
my own home city of Calgary.  And Canadians are supposed to 
somehow figure all of it out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we need to apply the same kind of rationalization and 
simplification that we are seeing in this bill to a number of 
areas within our government.  That is why this bill is so 
significant for what it represents here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform caucus and I believe all my colleagues are in support 
of this bill.  Therefore it can be anticipated that there is 
support from this side of the House on this bill this morning.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased 
to rise in the House today to state the Bloc Quebecois position on 
Bill C-11 on the customs tariff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is in favour of expansion of the free trade 
zone to all of the Americas, essentially to enhance our trade 
exchanges with other countries, Brazil and Argentina in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have already taken one step in this direction with the 
Canada-Chile free trade agreement.  We believe Canada must continue 
along this path, which is a continuation of a long history of 
market liberalization, one which is accelerating as we approach the 
second millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Free trade agreements in our time bring numerous questions to 
the fore.  To provide a clear picture of the Bloc Quebecois 
position on this, I will begin with a reference to the steps 
leading to the recent liberalization of markets.  I shall then move 
on to the sad record of Liberal promises on this subject.  Lastly, 
I will set out the Bloc Quebecois position on Bill C-11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On numerous occasions we have referred to the essential nature 
of the free trade agreement. We have often said that a major shift 
in direction is needed, and I believe we must continue to say so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A review of numerous events in our history shows us that 
markets need to be opened up, as we have always believed.  As far 
back as 1950, American capital was flooding into Canada.  Since the 
War of 1914, the United States had replaced Great Britain as our 
principal source of foreign capital, funds which Canada could not 
do without. 
But the British contributed to the bonds issued by Canada and even to 
subsidiaries wholly owned by the Americans. So many Canadian companies 
were bought up by American interests in 10 years that the 1950s will be 
remembered as the decade of the big takeover. Entire industries, created 
by English Canadians to be sheltered from the tariff, fell into the 
hands of the Americans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian government was facing two problems at the same time. 
Unable to rely on customs duties to direct industrial development, it 
had to abandon any initiative in that area or find new means of 
achieving the same ends. Also, with the Americans apparently set on 
buying everything out, should they be allowed to carry out their 
initiatives or should measures be contemplated to hold them back? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answers came from the 1960s up until 1988. The policies that 
were set reflected a consistent effort to direct industrial development 
and to erect barriers against foreign control. Starting with the 1960 
federal budget, the purpose of fiscal policies and subsidies was 
twofold: to direct investments toward preferential activity areas and to 
encourage investment in regions where both unemployment and the rate of 
growth was particularly high.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this context, Canada was built and the early experiences were 
never forgotten.  Without the government, the railways could 
never have been built in a country with such a small population. 
When people saw where commercial aviation was headed and set up 
Trans-Canada Airlines, the development of Hertzian waves for 
transmission purposes resulted in the creation of the CBC.  The 
telegraph, and telecommunications could have developed along 
north-south lines, while railways were looking after the 
east-west link. Building a country by means of customs tariffs is 
inevitably a form of schizophrenia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally, without the burden of customs duties, factories 
sprang up, jobs were created, foreign companies that otherwise 
would have been content to sell to Canada, set up business here so 
as to avoid paying duties.  From these perspectives, a 
protectionist policy helped increase provincial production and at 
the same time contributed to trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also true, however, that the consumer paid more than 
would otherwise have been the case if he had bought goods directly 
outside the country duty free.  In addition, the establishment of 
many factories in a small Canadian market, with consumers demanding 
the same diversification of products as American consumers, meant 
that factories' production costs were much higher than in American 
factories, with correspondingly higher unit production costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it developed, the Canadian manufacturing industry cut 
itself off from most export markets. 
It existed for the domestic market, but in most cases, it was not 
able to compete on international markets, and it should come as no 
surprise that attempts were sometimes made to point out the 
advantages of free trade over those of national production. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The attempts made by the Laurier government, before World War 
I, and those of the Mackenzie King government immediately after 
World War II, make no sense otherwise.  But the imperatives of 
building a country and a national economy won the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fifteen years following the end of World War II, however, 
were to profoundly, decisively, and in some ways irreversibly, 
alter the policies of organizing and developing the Canadian 
economy. 
The great depression of the 1930s led most national industrial economies 
to resort to extremely restrictive protectionist measures. With 20%, 25% 
or even 30% of the labour force unemployed, governments did not hesitate 
to reserve what was left of the domestic market for national businesses, 
by drastically increasing custom duties. Such a measure encouraged 
trading partners to do the same, with the result that, in the decade 
which preceded the world conflict, tariff wars proliferated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From 1930 to 1935, protectionist hysteria between Canada and the 
United States knew no limits. Some traditional trade activities between 
the two countries completely disappeared. The same was happening all 
over the world. This period will be remembered as a crazy time when 
every country was trying to ruin its neighbour and ended up going 
bankrupt too. Nations came out of the war with a firm resolution to 
never let this happen again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1947, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, was 
established. 
The setting-up of that remarkable organization resulted in a gradual 
lowering of custom duties, first among major industrial countries, and 
then between them and an increasing number of developing countries. 
Suffice it to say that, by the end of the second world war, average U.S. 
customs duties on American taxable imports stood at 30%, compared to 
barely 5% today. This gives you an idea of the progress that was made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada, changes may have been less spectacular but they were 
nevertheless significant. Eventually, it was realized that the very 
nature of the GATT agreements made it impossible to use customs duties 
to structure the Canadian economy. In fact, if the government still 
needs an industrial policy, it has to rely on instruments other than 
those that have been used so rigorously for close to 100 years. 
Customs duties are bound to be reduced or to remain at their current 
level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be sure, GATT regulations contain any number of derogatory 
clauses. We gradually learned how to use them, which was no small feat.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have just described a significant part of the development of 
trade in Canada and in Quebec with other countries and between 
provinces.  I feel it is important to specify as well that the 
federal government has not shown great efficiency in this 
connection, has not demonstrated any desire to move further with 
it, despite its lukewarm support of free trade in the past—we need 
only recall the battle over the free trade agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where improvement of dispute resolution mechanisms is 
concerned, for example, the three partners announced in March of 
this year that no progress had been made.  In addition, the United 
States indicated that there would be no further discussions on this 
matter. 
By so doing, they drew attention to the false statements the party 
across the way was still making on the matter of free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same goes for energy.  Canada has never obtained similar 
protection to what Mexico has under NAFTA.  Instead, it has 
released a declaration setting out its interpretation of the NAFTA 
clauses relating to energy.  This declaration, of course, is not an 
integral part of NAFTA, unlike the special Mexican reservations 
and clauses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to Bloc Quebecois questions on the matter last 
winter, the Minister of International Trade at the time could do no 
more than take refuge once again behind the work of the task force, 
which was still incomplete.  He told us in his response that he had 
not yet been able to meet with his U.S. and Mexican counterparts to 
examine the NAFTA committee report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his testimony before the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs 
and International Trade, the minister recognized that he needed more 
time to come to an agreement with the U.S. over antidumping and 
countervailing measures. I need not remind you that such measures were 
often taken against Canada and that the so-called efforts of this 
government, which was looking for reforms in that area, never produced 
any concrete results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's strategy, as stated by the minister responsible, 
was to sign a similar agreement with Chile, and later with Mexico, to 
put a little more pressure on our other trade partner, the United 
States. He added that progress was made and that a report will be 
tabled, which he will release as soon as he is given the green light. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the government to table this document in the House of 
Commons now, if eight months was long enough to seek the necessary 
permissions to share this information with the elected representatives 
of the people of Quebec and Canada who are sitting in this House. 
However, it seems rather— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> Order.  I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member, 
but it being 11 o'clock, the House will now proceed to statements 
by members pursuant to Standing Order 31. The hon. member will 
have 5 minutes left to complete his speech after Oral Question

cultural sector, which relies on the arts for content, 
inspiration and talent.  Most important of all, it contributes to 
enhancing Canadians' understanding of each other and forging a

Ordinary Canadians resoundingly rejected the special status,

By doing so, they also rejected the top down process by which 
that accord was drafted. Canadians set an important precedent 
that day. Never again will they allow political elites to dictate 
our constitutional future.

injustice is being committed as we sit here today.  The Liberal 
government is killing off the early stage software development 
industry by axing tax incentives. 
The government crushed industrial creativity when it abruptly 
decided on August 6 this year to remove investment incentives to 
high risk “angel” investors of small to mid-size development 
companies. The Minister of Finance is going through with this 
removal of important forms of finance for early stage software 
developers without any consultation with the industry: no orange 
light, no warning, no review, even after he has been asked for a 
review and even offered co-operative help from the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The killing off of a valuable fast paced growing industry is 
absolutely despicable and unacceptable.  On October 31 an entire 
part of the technology industry will die.  If the government is 
going to brag about helping the innovative technology industry, 
then it should either treat the industry as partners or stop 
using the partnership rhetoric.

yesterday, the Canadian ambassador to France, Jacques Roy, continued his

Trois-Rivières to Quebec City and will do so through the lower St.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister. How does the Deputy 
Prime Minister justify having a diplomat, who is supposed to be

under the aegis of an organization that is no less partisan, the Council 
for Canadian unity?

he wants to adopt the tax as his own.  In fact the Prime Minister

“We introduced it”.  He wants to take credit for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Which Prime Minister should hardworking Canadians and

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International

coming from the party that is on record for praising our efforts 
at harmonizing the GST.  This is the party that worked with us 
constructively to ensure that we had a more competitive tax 
system.  This is the tax that, harmonized in the Atlantic 
provinces, is being bragged about by the premiers as offering a 
competitive advantage to those who have not harmonized.

Mr. Speaker, yesterday Mothers Against Drunk Driving held a press

toughening the Criminal Code with respect to drunk driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Twelve months ago MADD came to Ottawa looking for action and

</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the current Minister of Justice.  Will the

of all members of the House I congratulate and thank those who 
act as volunteers in MADD for the fine work they have done over 
the past number of years to sensitize Canadians to the problems 
of drunk driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have undertaken to raise the issue when I meet with my 
provincial counterparts in December.  I would like to have a

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, by doing nothing on the issue of drunk driving the 
Liberal government bears responsibility for the deaths and 
injuries caused by drunk drivers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday the minister said that she was waiting for the 
transport department to do something.  The minister knows well 
that neither the Department of Transport nor provincial ministers 
can do anything to amend the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the justice minister hiding behind another public servant's 
report to cover the lack of action by her government on this 
issue?  I urge her to take the responsibility to prevent another 
1,700 deaths in the coming year and commit to concrete steps to 
review the Criminal Code roadside procedures and enact a victims 
bill of rights.

mindlessly make changes to the Criminal Code.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order.  I caution the hon. member. He 
is not to read the petition but he is to give a brief summary of 
the petition and presentation.  I sense that he is reading it 
from what I am hearing.  I would invite him to comply with the 
rule and give the House a summary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the petition concerns the 
massive increase in CPP premiums that are proposed by the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners ask Parliament to enact legislation to wind down 
the CPP, protecting the pensions of current seniors and that 
Canadians contribute to mandatory RRSPs of their own choosing.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have three brief petitions today.  The first states that managing 
the family home and caring for pre-school children is an 
honourable profession which has not been recognized for its value 
to our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to pursue

the second petition has to do with the Food and Drugs Act.  The 
petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the House that 
fetal alcohol syndrome and alcohol related birth defects are 100% 
preventable by avoiding alcohol consumption during pregnancy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to require

the final petition has to do with our police officers and 
firefighters who place their lives at risk on a daily basis and 
that we all mourn that loss when one of them loses their lives in 
the line of duty.

relief against the imposition of certain duties of customs or other

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
continue with my speech on Bill C-11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals would only be too happy today to forget about the 1993 
election campaign, in which they stated time and time again that they 
were prepared to tear up the free trade agreement between Canada and the 
United States if this agreement was not renegotiated. In this context, 
it is surprising to see the Liberals going at it again in red book II, 
where, on page 34, they try to pass themselves off as the great 
champions of trade liberalization.

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike the Liberal Party, which fiercely opposed free trade in the 
1980s and changed its tune once in office, the Bloc Quebecois has always 
supported free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that trade liberalization has always been essential to 
the economic prosperity of Quebec and the rest of Canada in its present 
form. Just think that more than 3.5% of Canada's GDP depends on exports. 
In Quebec alone, exports account for 40% of all the goods and services 
produced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel it is important to spend some time looking at how trade has 
evolved in Quebec. Some federalists seem to think that, by constantly 
putting down Quebec's economic performance, they are furthering their 
cause. I personally think they are shortsighted individuals who put 
their parties' interests before the greater good of Quebeckers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are currently 16,000 exporters operating out of Quebec. These 
are mainly businesses, commercial concerns, boards of trade and 
individuals doing business in foreign countries. The top 260 exporting 
firms alone sell for more than $10 million abroad. This performance is 
the result of a gradual and steady rise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, between 1984 and 1996, the value of Quebec's exports abroad 
more than doubled, growing from $17.3 billion to nearly $49 billion. 
During the same period, Quebec's imports rose from $19 billion to $40.9 
billion. Because of this strong and sustained growth of exports, in 
1996, Quebec showed a large trade surplus, amounting to $8.1 billion. In 
1995, the trade surplus was $8.7 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we take a close look at Quebec's economic structure, we notice 
that international exports of goods and services account for more than 
25% of the GDP in Quebec, which is twice as much as in Japan and 2.5 
times higher than in the US. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the international markets, Quebec ranks among the top 30 
exporters and importers in the world. This ranking sets us far apart 
from a mere province without any economic vitality at the international 
level. 
Quebec is actually a leader in the export of certain products. It does 
particularly well in the export of aluminium, being number one in the 
world, and the export of asbestos. In the area of newsprint export, 
Quebec ranks second in the world. In fact, in 1994, Quebec was among the 
10 leading exporters in the world for some 20 products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Add to that interprovincial trade within Canada and Quebec ranks 
17th in the world in the export of goods and services, before countries 
like Norway, Korea and Australia. It would rank 23th in the world, just 
before China, for imports. Overall, approximately 50% of what is 
produced in Quebec is sold abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To better understand these figures in the context of free trade, we 
must clearly identify where this economic activity is taking place. 
While Quebec's trading activities span the whole world, they are 
primarily concentrated in North America. In 1996, over 86% of its 
exports went to the North American market. The second most important 
destination, western Europe, received 10% of Quebec's exports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these reasons, the Bloc Quebecois feels that expanding the free 
trade zone to include all the Americas is essential to increase our 
trade, including Brazil and Argentina, for instance. A step has already 
been taken with the signing of a free trade agreement with Chile. Canada 
must keep going in this direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this context, it is not surprising that Quebec's movers and 
shakers are in favour of gaining access to new markets. Quebec has 
established successful economic ties with its main trading partner, the 
United States, but also with other partners overseas, such as Germany, 
France, Japan and Italy.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, we reiterate our general support of free trade. Bill 
C-11, which we are debating today, is a step in the right direction. 
Needless to say it will not arouse passions. It is a very small step, as 
the Prime Minister likes them. We do not expect any better from a 
government that has always lacked vision as regards the future of this 
country, preferring once again to go “one step at a time”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be sure, it is not easy to find a balance between the importance 
that must be given to human rights and the opportunity for Quebec and 
Canadian companies to do business in those countries that violate human 
rights the most. Still, the Bloc Quebecois is convinced that 
international trade is not incompatible with promoting human rights. 
Unfortunately, it is clear to me that this government did not do enough 
to promote human rights in the context of its international and trade 
relations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the trade agreements themselves, I stress once again the 
lack of concrete measures to provide protection that goes beyond merely 
protecting the rich in our society. It is essential that all trade 
agreements include adequate clauses to protect labour and the 
environment. 
Canada will continue to negotiate international agreements until Quebec 
becomes sovereign and should protect the effective provisions of labour 
and environmental standards with our trading partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certain bilateral agreements already contain parallel accords that 
provide for such provisions. However there is no such accord in 
multilateral agreements Canada has signed. Environmental protection and 
social protection clauses provide more benefits to a greater number of 
people and are to be viewed in the context of sustainable development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government must stop hiding behind confidential reports in 
order to justify its lack of action in this area. We want the government 
to raise the issue of human rights in its meetings, during its 
discussions and on its trips abroad. 
It is high time this government publicly condemned, not only in camera, 
human right violations committed in foreign countries and, more 
specifically, in countries that trade with Canada. This government 
continues to drag its feet in establishing a code of behaviour for 
Canadian businesses active abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would like to reiterate that the Bloc Quebecois 
supports Bill C-11. However, this government cannot use this initiative 
as a substitute for developing an overall international trade policy.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this is my first time to conduct my order as a responsible member 
of Parliament in a most crucial debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate you on our esteemed 
appointment as Deputy Speaker of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to state at the outset that I am against Bill C-11. 
The intent of the bill is to provide relief against the 
imposition of certain customs duties and other charges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning the government asked for quick passage of this 
legislation.  It said that there would be a quick elimination of 
the nuisance rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years in some of the shopping centres in my riding we 
have seen the introduction of Wal-Mart stores.  Are these 
nuisance rates for Wal-Mart trucks coming across the border?  It 
looks like $1 billion will be gained by outside multinationals 
trading in our country.  The estimate is that $90 million will be 
saved by our companies in trading elsewhere.  Where is the 
balance? Foreign corporations will be saving $1 billion while 
Canadian companies will only be saving $90 million.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a test of our sovereignty, a test of who Canadians are. 
Canadians live here.  When we look at the intent of all our 
resources, our markets, our economy and our needs, and we look at 
tariffs, when people want to trade with our country and we look 
at the history of our country, the colonization of the world was 
the reason that brought many of our investors here. We 
should not continue on the rampant path of pillaging and plundering 
resources and taking markets to the lowest common denominator of 
simply making a profit and not looking at the social aspects of 
our people, the need for higher education, the need for medicare, 
the need for people to find meaningful employment in all aspects 
of our economy, not just in manufacturing or the providing of 
products but also in the protection of our environment.  It is a 
role where the citizens of our country can create a meaningful 
future for our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the record on the previous agreements that have been made, 
Bill C-11 seems to be a process of completing the North American 
Free Trade Agreement.  When we sing our national anthem we are 
the ones singing it as Canadians when we say “our true north 
strong and free”.  It is not an American singing it.  It is a 
Canadian singing it and being proud of who we are.  We are strong 
and we are free to work for the future of our country and the 
future of our people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not an American person saying it is a free country in 
northern Canada.  It is not.  They cannot come across here and 
get benefits from our lands, our measurable jurisdiction which we 
call our home.  This is our future and our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To cause a political awareness I call on Liberals who have 
formed the government and in their time have served their purpose 
on this side of the House that in 1988 the Canada-U.S. Free Trade 
Agreement was an issue.  The 1993 election came about with NAFTA 
as a major issue in the red book of the Liberals. The NDP was 
very clear in its opposition to the free trade agreements and the 
direction that was being taken, as did the Liberals, but the 
difference is that the NDP has stuck to its guns.  We are still 
against the free trade and the implementations of the regulations 
of free trade. That is what Bill C-11 is all about.  It is 
implementing free trade provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have turned full circle.  Now they want to be 
champions of the free trade agreement.   They ran two elections 
against the whole free trade aspect in this country.  The 
Liberals were certainly right when they told Canadians that in 
1993 their election campaign was if you are opposed to NAFTA 
you should vote NDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In future elections I call on Canadians to remember the New 
Democrats of this country.  We seem to be the only ones 
protecting Canadians, not multinational interests, not profit 
making interests, but the future of all Canadians, the future of 
our land, the environment and also the generations to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite these claims, these ironclad assurances that we have 
been crying for regarding labour and environmental standards have 
not been signed.  They have not been protected in the NAFTA and 
we are afraid that the government of the day will not be 
protecting them in the multilateral agreement on investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The extent to which the Liberals have joined the ranks of 
globalizing elites is this whole issue of NAFTA and MAI.  These 
are major issues.  Globalizing in the Miami summit of the 
Americas in 1994 where the negotiations began toward free trade 
of the Americas and where Canada began negotiating with Chile to 
join NAFTA, the government claimed that the trade deal with Chile 
would lead to cheaper bananas for Canadians.  This government 
evidently believed that a Latin American country like Chile was a 
major banana producer.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Someone in the Department of International Trade forgot to tell this 
government that Chile is not a tropical country.  It does not 
produce or export bananas.  The vision and the explanation of 
this agreement is simply to protect multinational interests and 
to break down our borders with other countries which have huge 
amounts of assets and capital to come in and invest, take our 
resources and our markets and break the economic cycle that we 
need in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to produce, to finish our products and use our products. 
We need to create a cycle where our Canadian dollars are changing 
hands within Canada, not externally.  If we can attract outside 
interest from European countries, Asian countries, the America 
countries and other American states, let them come in but let 
them invest in our future.  Let them pay the tariffs and duties 
that come with the existence of creating these provisions by our 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With these tariffs we can invest in better education.  We may 
have a future where children can have tuition free education. Let 
the corporations pay not only tax dollars through income tax, 
GST, BST, HST and provincial sales tax to improve our standard of 
living, but through investment into Canadians' means of providing 
a better future.  Let them pay for medicare and the building of 
hospitals.  Let them pay for the betterment of our medical 
personnel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are doctors in rural and northern Canada who are being 
imported from outside Canada to come and work and provide health 
services to our communities.  Why can we not teach our children 
from our local communities to be doctors?  The one simple fact is 
they cannot afford it.  If we cannot afford to buy a career or a 
profession in our own country what is this country's role? What 
is this government's role?  We have to protect our children's 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we do not stand up against multinational interests of pure 
and simple capitalism, of taking profits for their own 
corporations, we are going in the wrong direction.  The vision of 
this country has been to provide a means for continued investment 
and globalization.  Globalization is a nice, cute, sexy word but 
it does not mean anything to Canadians.  Our purpose in this 
country is to look within our boundaries for the betterment of 
our future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have looked at the Liberal's trade policies.  They have 
enjoyed the support of the Bloc Quebecois, as was obvious this 
afternoon when we heard Bloc members speak in favour of this, the 
Reform Party and the Conservative Party because it introduced the 
whole NAFTA project.  The NDP members are the only ones to take 
the choice to speak in favour of Canadians, in protecting 
Canadian companies, in protecting the Canadian labour force, in 
protecting the future of Canadians and in protecting our land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Globalization of Canadian sovereignty is for international 
communities.  It is not for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak on the irony of this.  As Canada has 
sought allies against Canadian trade harassment, it has built 
alliances with countries that do not contain American trade 
harassment. Americans are strong and powerful and they will 
harass you however they can.  Canada has been looking for 
alliances to keep human rights, labour rights and environmental 
practices on all trade agreements, to a greater extent, in all of 
North America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the question of the social clause of the World Trade 
Organization, common labour practices in the free trade agreement 
and supporting UN resolutions condemned Chinese human rights. 
However, Canada has been on the side of trying to keep the social 
dimension of trade off the agenda against countries like the 
United States which have been supportive of broadening trade 
agendas globally.  We must protect the consciousness of all 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians and Americans, like others around the world, have been 
asked by multinationals and their allies in government to 
sacrifice considerable national sovereignty; our investment 
policy in social, labour and environmental standards in exchange 
for rule based regimes and profit making schemes by 
multinationals.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP wants to work toward international trade rules that are 
not so one sided in favour of multinationals.  We are part of a 
system of international governance that balances economic 
opportunities for a new economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must build a responsible international economy that is 
accountable to our communities and the public interest of our 
country.  That is why Canadians have put us to the challenge of 
being here in the House of Commons to create the consciousness of 
this government and all governments of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The social clauses are a major source of awareness for our 
party.  We have fought to protect labour, farmers and other 
people of our communities.  A co-operative movement has striven 
in many corners of the country to protect the community interest, 
to keep the investment, profits and the dividends at a community 
level.  These are part of a Canadian vision for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The biggest challenge is to build a more democratic 
international community.  Multinational and international 
agreements have been trying to create international trade 
agreements.  They must deal effectively with the social 
dimensions of trade.  A growing international movement seeks to 
build social clauses such as NAFTA and the World Trade 
Organization.  We are calling on the government to keep that 
consciousness in mind when it is negotiating the multilateral 
agreement on investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such clauses should respect human rights, basic labour rights, 
economic decision making within the new economy and the ability 
of workers to negotiate the terms under which they will 
participate in the global economy.  Social clauses allow states 
to establish environmental regulations that have challenged 
non-tariff barriers to trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new trade rules are remarkably one sided in defence of the 
rights of investors.  I guess their lobbying strategy is working. 
They seem to have multi-parties talking in favour of 
multinational rights to intellectual property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Intellectual property rights are a major cause for sovereignty 
and national interests.  If we have resources within our country 
we must work to create, negotiate and fight for the rights of our 
people and our interests.  We cannot simply give them wholesale 
access to multinationals.  For the pharmaceutical companies to 
have access to resources for medicinal purposes, the interests 
might be in our backyards in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must protect our environment and our livelihoods.  If we 
trade them off and give them to the profitable right of somebody 
else we will never create an economic cycle with our own 
resources.  We will have lost it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To reverse this process seems to be a battle in itself.  How can 
we get away from NAFTA once we have signed on?  It seems to be a 
big ship that goes down.  We just cannot to keep it buoyant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing about workers rights and trade unions and the 
right to a safe workplace.  They speak loudly of level playing 
fields but globalization, according to many observers, has 
certainly been a race to the bottom, to the lowest common labour 
standards, to the lowest possible wage levels with the highest 
level of profit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no limit to profit taking.  The banks of the country 
brag that they are making 25% to 30% more profit than they did 
last year.  This means they made profits the years before.  They 
are measuring percentages over their profits, just leapfrogging 
their profit-making margins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then international banks are coming into our markets.  They are 
trying to break down the rules to allow them to compete against 
our banks.  We must speak on behalf of our own banking 
institutions as well.  We must protect our own market, our own 
industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see products like old growth forests being cut down on the 
west coast.  Whole logs are shipped to Japan for the people there 
to provide products and possibly sell back to Canadians.  Let us 
finish our products here.  Let us market and be aggressive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to be aggressive and competitive we have to train and 
teach our children.  If we do not acquire further taxes from our 
corporations and the multinationals operating within our market, 
we will lose a big source of revenue generation.  We must create 
revenue and wealth by taxing the people doing business with us.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government accepts one of the cliches of 
globalization, that the best way to address the problem of human 
and environmental rights is by developing open trade in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where does Canadian sovereignty fall into place?  Support for 
the social cause is a start.  We are seeing the government going 
hell-bent to negotiate these agreements.  We must call on the 
government to have a social conscience and link trade benefits to 
the human rights of the people of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without such causes the World Trade Organization is like a 
turkey shoot where multinationals and their allies in some 
developing countries can exploit the most vulnerable.  Chile is 
an example.  Why is it not negotiating free trade agreements with 
the other countries of South America?  It chose Chile because it 
was the most vulnerable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on the government to be fair and equitable to all 
developing countries of the world and not to pick on the weak. 
Speaking of the weak, Canadians cannot be seen as a weak entity. 
We must stand up for ourselves.  I call on the government to 
stand up on behalf of all Canadians, to be strong and to be free 
to speak for the will of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on the government and the House of Commons to challenge 
each other to provide a way of negotiating our needs with the 
rest of the world.  If they are willing to invest in our country, 
let us stop the colonization move. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are remnants of colonization remaining in our northern 
communities.  I draw attention to the reality that in northern 
Canada the Hudson's Bay Company has changed its name to Northern 
Stores.  The Hudson's Bay Company and Northern Stores do not 
invest in our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about our aboriginal communities needing to create an 
economic cycle for the betterment of their lives and those of 
their children.  The Hudson's Bay Company does not invest in our 
communities.  It deals in profits as it did in the days of the 
fur trade and takes them elsewhere.  We have to put up trade 
barriers to stop profit making and keep some of those revenues in 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak on behalf of our party against Bill C-11 because it is a 
remnant of the NAFTA.  I challenge the House of Commons and the 
leadership of the country to protect the interest of Canadians 
wholeheartedly.  Let us keep our companies, workers, banks and 
our railroads in this country for future generations.  Let us 
stay Canadian, strong and free.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I will be 
sharing my time with the hon. member for Richmond—Arthabaska. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PC Party of Canada supports making legislation that 
simplifies our lives and the lives of business owners.  However 
there are matters that need to be addressed in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the hon. member from Manitoba for acknowledging it was 
the Progressive Conservative Party that introduced and brought 
forward the free trade legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are happy to see the Liberal government has realized our 
initiatives on free trade in the late 1980s are so important, a 
lead that it continues to follow.  Our initiated agreement made 
trade between countries competitive, boosted economic success and 
began to tear down the walls that hindered successful open trade 
transactions between countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time the Liberals did everything in their power to 
oppose the initiative.  Today we witnessed something else.  What 
was so profusely objected to almost 10 years ago is today the 
largest bill on our shelves and the biggest factor in the 
contributing of tax revenues to the recovery of our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we are flattered the government of the day continues to 
carry out our initiatives and our tariff agreements that we put 
in place when we were in government, there are several important 
factors to be considered. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1240"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just a few weeks ago the government was reprimanded for the 
untimeliness of the year 2000 project.  How can we expect modern 
innovation from the Liberals when the bill is distributed in 
paper form instead of CD-ROM?  The documents are composed of 
about a foot and a half of paper.  In the last couple of days we 
have heard about the importance of the environment.  This is 
truly an unfriendly environmental document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the size of the bill.  Instead of setting an 
example and proving that we are moving into the 21st century, our 
offices are cluttered with these volumes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps my most important message today is that this is the 
beginning, not the end.  We cannot stop now with the progress 
that we have made because the bill has been simplified.  Work 
still needs to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the government to commit to continuing with the work in 
progress, to continue developing trade agreements with our 
partners, to look ahead to the global marketplace and to achieve 
a standard of excellence with our trading partners.  This means 
the government must continue to promote trade and encourage 
business development in Canada.  It is imperative that taxes in 
all areas be competitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we know that industry generally supports the bill, we also 
know it has qualms about it.  First and foremost is the sense of 
urgency being placed on the bill.  The Canadian Importers 
Association is concerned with its speedy passage as it says 
importers will not have enough time for what will be a very time 
consuming and costly exercise.  The Alliance of Manufacturers & 
Exporters also shares this concern.  It states that it is a scary 
exercise and there is very little time to do the programming it 
needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike the government that has known about the year 2000 problem 
for the last five years, perhaps we should give businesses a 
month or two leeway to implement the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the affected parties.  We demand that the government 
listen to their concerns and continue with the theme of 
simplification.  If we are to simplify the process we need to 
continue with their agreement and simplify the lives of business 
owners.  We will hold the government accountable and demand that 
it listen to the suggestions that have been received. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recurring message we are hearing from the business community 
with respect to the uneasiness it faces is related to the 
delivery and the implementation of the tariff simplification 
initiative.  While it supports the elimination of regulation and 
business procedures, it is deeply affected by the timing of the 
bill.  It feels quite rushed and that it has not been granted 
enough time to prepare for the upcoming changes and enormous 
challenges it must face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the most complex tariff system in the world.  We know it 
and our trading partners know it.  I urge the government to 
consider the huge tasks that lie ahead for importers in Canada 
and demand they be given time to adopt to the enormous changes 
ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the Liberal government obviously agrees with us on the 
importance of free trade, why do its members not agree with us on 
simplifying the lives of businessmen, simplifying the lives of 
Canadians, decreasing red tape, lessening government 
interference, simplifying Bill C-11 and agreeing with changes to 
the complexity and short term allowances given to these important 
businesses? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PC Party stands for less red tape, less government 
interference, less government involvement in people's lives, more 
power to businesses and more power to the people.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand (Richmond—Arthabasca, PC):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to thank my colleague from Markham for allowing me to share 
his time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative Party in fact is very proud to support Bill C-11. 
We are delighted that Liberals are today behaving like the Conservatives 
of yesterday. Nevertheless, we are surprised that the New Democrats of 
today are behaving like the Liberals of 1993. We hope that the miracle 
will continue and the people will understand that isolation is passé. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1245"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do agree with this bill. For over ten years now the Conservative 
Party has been working on a process, and we must not forget that NAFTA 
was only part of it, to globalize Canada's trade. Quebec and, in large 
measure, Ontario most strongly supported the debate and the treaty in 
the 1980s, so that today, all provinces may enjoy increased trade 
through the free trade agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as my colleague pointed out, the problem we have with 
people opposite is that there is no planning. 
Businesses are told to get ready because, in January, things will be 
made simpler. However, in fact, as my hon. colleague pointed out, the 
thickness of the document would indicate that people will not be ready 
by January 1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague also pointed out, we are asking the government to 
be patient. This is a bit surprising for the Conservative Party, but we 
are asking the government to perhaps pay attention to the bill's 
wording. Even though we support the bill, we honestly believe that it 
should have been introduced much earlier in the previous legislature so 
that people could prepare for it. People in private industry in Canada, 
big and small business, are not aware of the government's position and 
are still waiting, with a bit of surprise, for the bill to fall on their 
heads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, as I was saying, NAFTA was good for the country and for Quebec. 
Now there are more treaties with other countries.  That is why the 
Conservative Party will always support any bill that means that 
Canada and Quebec will not be isolated in the international 
marketplace, but will assume their rightful place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to point out that it would be a good thing 
in this House if the government were to start being much more 
conservative, in the good sense of the word.  I think that the gods 
must be smiling on us, because yesterday the Prime Minister said 
that the GST was a good thing.  A tax is always heavily criticized, 
but in the end it was a good thing.  It is now recognized that 
NAFTA was a good thing.  However, there can be no doubt that the 
election of the Liberals in 1993 was a bad thing.  But this will 
surely get sorted out with time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for Bill C-11, it is extremely complex.  It is, however, a 
step in the right direction. 
We hope that it will benefit all import businesses in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not be afraid of isolating ourselves.  Our New 
Democratic friends worry about this.  The hon. member of the NDP 
gave the example of western forests.  Western forests were being 
cut down and the logs sent outside the country, only to come back 
in as finished products.  I would like to explain to my hon. 
colleague that Quebec imports wood from the United States, 
processes it and sells it back to the Americans.  International 
treaties must therefore be examined as a whole and international 
trade looked at much more globally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nor should it be said that only large corporations have 
benefited from NAFTA.  Ten years ago, there were fears that textile 
companies, in Quebec for example, would take a terrible beating. 
They had to adapt quickly, and today Quebec's textile companies are 
among the province's largest exporters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are saying, therefore, is that the tens of millions of 
dollars that will be saved will result in our being much more 
competitive.  Here again, the government has a problem.  They are 
helping companies save money, using the argument that the economy 
has to make a better recovery, that we must help our businesses. 
However, this is just one point of view, the issue of imports. What 
we are saying is that there are also other ways of helping 
businesses.  We are prepared to support Bill C-11, but we are also 
prepared to support, and have always supported, a reduction in 
employment insurance contributions, among other things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, if all these objectives could be combined, Canadians and 
Quebeckers as a whole could benefit. 
Slowly but surely, this government is learning, and we hope that 
will continue to be the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are proud to support Bill C-11 and any bill, as I was 
saying earlier, that means that Quebec and Canadian businesses can 
benefit from the globalization of markets.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill because of the 
ramifications it will have, along with the NAFTA deal, the free 
trade deal, the MAI, APEX and all those other deals that 
governments past and present have made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would assume by listening to government members that the sun 
rises and sets on their current policies.  They have repeated on 
several occasions that Bill C-11 was created in consultation with 
industry.  Industry, industry, industry.  If I am not mistaken, 
the government member who previously spoke said that five times. 
However, not once have I heard them say they have consulted the 
working people, labour groups, citizens groups or action groups. 
Any group having a leaning toward the social left was not 
consulted with respect to Bill C-11. That is typical of the 
government when it comes to modifying or altering current 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I may digress for a moment, a few years back this government 
did not like the regulations which governed the foreign sale of 
nuclear CANDU reactors.  Literally overnight, with an order in 
council, it changed the trade regulations and the environmental 
regulations in order to sell two CANDU reactors to China. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that China has one of the worst human rights 
records in the world today and yet this government, without 
consulting the House of Commons, without allowing proper debate, 
changed the environmental and trade regulations and sold the 
CANDU reactors to China. Organizations such as the Sierra Club 
have taken the government to court to fight those arrangements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on and list more spectacles of that nature.  That is 
the despicable nature of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Slowly, bit by bit, this government and previous Conservative 
governments have relinquished control to the corporate elite.  I 
have said time and time again that I would much rather have an 
elected Bob Rae or an elected government official than I would an 
unelected Conrad Black.  The reason I say that is that if people 
do not like an elected official, he or she will come up for 
election again in so many years, and the people can kick them 
out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Elected officials have to listen to the concerns of the people 
whether they like them or not.  An unelected corporate official 
does not have to listen to the people.  They never have to attend 
meetings.  They can totally ignore the wishes of the Canadian 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have held talks with members of the professional bankers 
association in my riding.  They have indicated, as we have 
suspected for quite some time, that the big six banks will soon 
merge to become the big three.  The bankers are saying that will 
happen because we cannot compete globally.  That they can make $1 
billion in six months is not good enough for them.  Now they are 
saying we have to compete globally.  Globally, globally, 
globally.  That is all we ever hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will happen to the thousands of people working in the 
banking institutions?  What will happen to them years down the 
road?  What kind of jobs will we be able to offer our children? 
Are there going to be any jobs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member from Saskatchewan indicated that we should be 
working toward the benefit and health of our children.  Our 
children are our most valuable resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the wars and after the wars this country produced all 
kinds of equipment, machinery and products.  For example, the 
world's largest gypsum mine borders on my riding. Ninety per cent 
of the gypsum is shipped out of Canada, into the United States, 
turned into gyproc, and we turn around and buy it back.  That is 
insanity.  There could be hundreds of jobs created in my riding 
if there were a gypsum board factory.  That would be tremendous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do the same thing with whole logs.  We ship them to countries 
like Japan when we could be manufacturing those logs in Canada 
today.  We could be creating thousands and thousands of jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister for International Trade, through the Economic 
Development Corporation, is giving $285 million to a firm to set 
up a pulp mill in Indonesia.  That is another country with a 
terrible human rights record.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We give it $285 million to build a pulp mill so it can compete 
with our pulp mills in Canada.  We have pulp mill workers in 
Skeena, which is represented by the Reform, and I have yet to 
hear a Reform member stand up on behalf of those working people 
out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have to give labour concessions and more wage cuts and more 
benefit cuts in order to compete through the government's turning 
around and giving millions of dollars to another country to 
compete with ours, and not just a country with a good record, a 
country that has some of the worst human rights records in 
history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The APEC deal is coming around, and who do we invite with open 
arms and the red carpet?  Soeharto, one of the vilest people on 
the planet, and Canada is going to sit there and welcome him with 
open arms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish I had brought the picture with me that I had taken a few 
years ago of the defeated minister of health, Mr. David Dingwall, 
who was soundly defeated in the riding of Cape Breton.  He could 
not wait when the premier of China, Li Peng, the butcher of 
Beijing, came to Canada in his big 747 to the Halifax airport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members should have seen Mr. Dingwall tripping over everybody, 
pushing away security guards in order to get in that limousine 
and have his picture taken with the butcher of Beijing.  Those 
kinds of attitudes in this Liberal government are still there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberals are willing to sell their souls to anybody in this 
country or anybody in the world willing to pay, without proper 
debate and without consultation of the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recently referred members to the CPP bill, one of the most 
damaging pieces of legislation ever in Canadian history.  Whether 
someone is for or against it is really not the question.  The 
question is that we should be having proper debate on something 
that affects every single Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the hon. House leader do after only seven hours of 
debate?  He shuts it off.  He invokes closure.  He uses the 
majority, by the way only a slim majority, of the government 
officials to defeat the debate.  To us that is simply scandalous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is this government afraid of?  Why is it not willing to 
talk to Canadians, all Canadians, not just industry but labour 
groups, other opposition parties, to form political solutions to 
the political problems that we have today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unbelievable to those Canadians outside Parliament that 
this government and former governments would continue on this 
path of hide and seek policies every time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We kept hearing when free trade was talked about that it would 
be good for Canadians.  It was not good enough.  We have to have 
NAFTA.  That is going to be good for Canadians. No, no, that's 
not good enough either.  We have to go one step further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>APEC really is not anything, just some sort of agreement among 
economies and businesses, not countries; no human rights 
legislation, no protection for working people, none, just sort of 
business deals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But that is not good enough. Now we have the mother of all trade 
deals coming down, the MAI. I remind members that if not for the 
leader of the New Democrats, this deal may already have been 
passed, as this deal was silently being passed through without 
any consultation with the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the campaign she mentioned this deal and all of a sudden 
the government said “Hold off, the cat is out of the bag now. 
We are going to have to reluctantly discuss this with the House 
of Commons”.  I cannot wait for the day when that debate comes 
around.  It goes on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think back to a movie I saw in the early 1970s, 
“Rollerball”,  in which there were no governments and the world 
was being dominated by five corporations.  The corporations were 
fighting among each other for total control of the planet.  I 
cannot understand why elected officials would relinquish their 
control through legislation and allow corporations to take over 
and take over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind members in the War of 1812 we won.  We won the 
sovereignty of our country. We won the solidarity of working 
people throughout this country from coast to coast to coast, the 
French and English together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jonathan Winters said in a stand-up comic routine “We 
Americans, gee, we hope we can take you peacefully”.  They are 
doing a very good job of it right now.  They are taking us over 
economically, and what is happening? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are literally millions of workers in this country who do 
not even know if they are going to have a job next week. Probably 
every labour aspect and every trade union have had to go before 
their employers.  Their employers have had to go to them. It is 
becoming not just protection or improvements to collective 
agreements but givebacks and takeaways and further wage cuts, 
downsizing, restructuring, this and that and this. 
We have had over 80 months with unemployment rates of over 9%. We 
had heard that free trade was going to cure that problem. We had 
heard that NAFTA was going to cure that problem.  We hear now 
that the MAI is going to cure that problem.  We now hear that 
Bill C-11 is going to cure that problem.  Government had to get 
rid of the manufacturers sales tax.  The former Tory government 
said we absolutely had to get rid of that and place the burden of 
taxation away from corporations and on individuals.

get elected.  Eleven Liberals from the province of Nova Scotia 
are elected.  Off they go to the House of Commons.  I can see all 
11 of them sitting there and agreeing like this:  “You know Mr. 
Prime Minister and Mr. Finance Minister, the GST really isn't 
hitting those people hard enough.  I think we should impose 
another tax on them called the HST”, or as we prefer it, the 
BST.  “It is no longer acceptable to pay 8% or 9% or combined 
percentages of rates.  We now have to hit them with 15%”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that in three provinces of Atlantic Canada we 
pay more for postage stamps than anywhere else in this country. 
That is just one slight example of the scandalous treatment of 
Atlantic Canadians.  It goes on and on.  The HST is the most 
regressive tax ever to hit pensioners on lower incomes and people 
with low wages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is just incredible that government would shift the burden of 
taxation away from corporations that make record profits year 
after year and place the burden of taxation on to individuals. It 
blows me absolutely away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could stand here all day and mention example after example but 
I will cut my speech short and say once and for all that I wish

</I></B></P><P align=left>For the record, the bill is intended to improve the 
competitiveness of Canadian companies and industry and to lessen 
the regulatory burden on industry and government.  It is a bill 
that has received broad support from Canadian industry.  It has 
been developed in close consultation with Canadian stakeholders 
over a three-year period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No new commitments are being implemented in this bill.  It is 
really the elimination of nuisance rates, rates that would 
benefit Canadian manufacturers, as it mostly affects goods that 
are used in inputs for Canadian manufacturers.  This should help 
Canadian industry to be more competitive.  Certainly in the end 
it should benefit Canadian consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Comments were made earlier today with respect to the timing of 
this initiative.  For the record I want to state that since April 
when the initial notice of ways and means was tabled in the 
House, Revenue Canada and Statistics Canada have been undergoing 
extensive outreach campaigns to alert those who could potentially 
be affected by the legislation with respect to the proposed 
changes. Officials from the finance department have also met with 
industry and trade associations and participated in customs 
conferences to inform interested parties of the developments in 
preparing the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to note that we have received letters from 
various associations in support of this legislation that call for 
its swift passage through Parliament to ensure the business 
community has a wider window of opportunity to prepare businesses 
for the competition they face in the global marketplace.  Letters 
have been received from the Canadian Importers Association Inc., 
the Canadian Chamber of Commerce and other types of associations 
calling for passage of this bill in order to deal with some areas 
that lack efficiency within this climate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current tariff provisions are being consolidated into a 
single tariff schedule that will be simpler to read and will 
provide greater flexibility.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The measures, as I said earlier, will enhance industry 
competitiveness.  When industry competitiveness is enhanced, it 
allows greater opportunity of employment for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are just as sympathetic as all other members toward 
unemployment. The NDP made reference to that in their speeches 
today and I congratulate them and thank them for their 
intervention. It is important to make the point and they made it 
very eloquently.  We must ensure that what we do in enhancing the 
competitiveness for industry translates into greater 
opportunities for Canadians in allowing them those employment 
opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope the simplified customs tariff meets its objectives of 
improving the competitive position of Canadian industry while 
going forward and providing a very transparent and predictable 
regime that lessens the regulatory burden and reduces the 
business costs that companies face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We set out to improve the competitiveness and efficiency of our 
industries.  The review was launched over three years ago.  We 
believe, with the help and support of the House, companies will 
benefit, which will translate to greater competitiveness and 
employment opportunities.  I thank all members for the time that 
they have taken to participate in today's debate.

Speaker, I wish to thank the parliamentary secretary for his 
comments toward the New Democratic Party concerning our trying to 
get the message across that we should be working with and 
assisting Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one thing I mentioned.  He again said that the 
government had consulted with various industries and groups.  I 
did not hear him once that he had consulted with the CLC.  I did 
not hear him once say that he had consulted with the Quebec 
Federation of Labour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  What is CLC? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Sorry.  The Canadian Labour Congress, 
for those on the other side who do not understand the labour 
groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not hear him once say that he had spoken with the CAW, the 
Canadian Auto Workers.  Not once did I hear him say that they 
referred this bill to working people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one point I forgot in my submission.  A few years ago 
the Mexican government allowed the peso to drop and devalue on 
the market.  This caused shock waves through the financial 
community.  What was Canada's response?  Canada had to pump tens 
of millions of dollars through the auspices of the World Bank and 
friends in the American government to prop up the Mexican peso. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were told in the House of Commons—although I was not here at 
that time—but read the <I>Hansard</I> comments that that was to 
assist, enable and help out the people of Mexico and the Mexican 
workers.  In reality, it was to help out those Canadian 
businesses that left provinces like Ontario and the rest of 
Canada to go down to Mexico because of their cheap labour force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were told that the whole aspect of NAFTA and free trade was 
to prop up the living standards of those workers in Mexico. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, I invite you and everyone in the House of Commons 
to go down to Mexico and see how propped up they are.  They are 
not very propped up at all.  What has it done?  It has not 
increased the working conditions of Mexican workers.  It has 
decreased the condition of Canadian workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the member for 
the intervention and the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intention of the government with this legislation, as it is 
with other legislation, is to work closely with all Canadians. 
We do not want, as a government, to start pitting worker against 
worker, Mexico against Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want the entire global economy to become consumers of 
Canadian products.  We want the entire global economy to benefit 
and grow in its capabilities and become consumers for Canada. 
Canada's economy is based on exports and exports are an area of 
our economy which has driven the growth in the economy over the 
last little while and it will continue to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposals that we see before us are proposals that deal with 
the competitiveness of the Canadian industry, which translates 
into greater opportunity for Canadians in employment and into 
lower prices for Canadian consumers.  That is what this bill is 
all about.  I again thank the hon. member for the intervention.

thing I do not understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all of the agreements we have signed, such as the free

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri:</B>  Madam Speaker, the only comment I have 
is that there was a conference held in the Atlantic provinces to 
deal with the future and the vision of Atlantic Canada.  It was 
partly funded by Industry Canada to ensure that Atlantic Canada 
has an opportunity to express and build its own economic future. 
There was representation from various ministries along with the 
premiers and other stakeholders in Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is very committed to ensuring that all regions of 
Canada have an opportunity to grow and develop.  We will

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I would like to make a correction and a few points, 
because I attended the Vision for the Atlantic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell you how I attended it.  It was against the will of 
the premier of New Brunswick.  That is the type of vision which 
they have.  The social groups were not invited.  No workers were 
invited and the people who spoke at the conference were not 
representing the people of the Atlantic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important to start wondering whose vision it is for 
the Atlantic.  The New Democrats were certainly not invited, a 
lot of PCs were not invited and actually we were told that they 
were not welcome there.  Tell me what kind of consultation that 
was? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri:</B>  Madam Speaker, we are drifting away 
somewhat from the legislation.  I am perfectly willing to respond 
to the intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as I understand it, the participants at the conference 
were the premiers of the Atlantic provinces.  The last time I 
checked those premiers were elected by the constituents of the 
Atlantic provinces.  They were there to make representations with 
respect to developing that economic vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of the finance committee, and I would welcome the 
presence of the hon. member, I want to assure her that we were in 
Atlantic Canada this past week.  We heard from Atlantic Canadians 
on what to do with the fiscal dividend, and to ensure that 
Atlantic Canadians had an opportunity for input. The chair of the 
finance committee has requested an assurance that Atlantic 
Canadians, as well as all members of the House, have the 
opportunity to hold town hall meetings, to hear from their 
constituents and to bring the message back to the House of 
Commons.

Basques, BQ)</B> moved: 
<A NAME="LINK187">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the Government of 
Canada should make major changes in the employment insurance 
system, particularly by lowering contributions and improving 
benefits for seasonal workers and workers who have joined the 
labour market only recently. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Madam Speaker, I am very pleased that the House is 
considering this motion I have tabled today, which concerns a 
matter of national importance. 
It is important for all of Quebec, for all of Canada, since the 
entire employment insurance program is obviously completely unfair 
for all seasonal workers and all new entrants to the work force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, I wish to condemn what I call the employment 
insurance fund scandal.  Imagine today that, by the end of 1997, 
there will be a surplus of $13 billion in the employment insurance 
fund.  Two years ago, we started with a deficit of $6 billion.  We 
have since accumulated a $19 billion surplus, which will leave us 
with $13 billion as at December 31, 1997, and some $15 or $16 
billion by the end of the fiscal year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, the decision was made to increase the number 
of weeks required in order to be eligible for employment insurance, 
and to decrease the number of weeks of benefits people were 
entitled to receive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It might be said that the government was not listening to the 
public when it did this, not listening to what had been said during 
consultations, but that it instead carried out evaluations that 
could have justified its point of view.  Now we are faced with a 
fait accompli, faced with reality, and they ought to support a 
motion such as ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may be said that opposition motions are always against the 
government. But I want to point to the position set out in my 
motion, which reads in part: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—should make major changes in the employment insurance 
system, particularly by lowering contributions and improving 
benefits for seasonal workers and workers who have joined the 
labour market only recently. 
</UL>
<This is the same position that was taken by all of the provincial 
premiers at St. Andrews on the occasion of their last 
interprovincial conference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not, therefore, just the position of the Bloc 
Quebecois, although it is precisely the platform we defended during 
the election campaign. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1320"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party was the only one saying there could be both a reasonable 
reduction of benefits and a healthy surplus, but a reduction that would 
allow us to reinvest money in the economy by allowing employees and 
employers to use additional funds. We also said that part of the surplus 
in the employment insurance fund could have been used to improve the 
working conditions of seasonal workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The facts speak for themselves. In the early 1990s, 60% of people 
contributed to the employment insurance fund and eventually became 
eligible for benefits. This percentage is now below 40%, between 30% and 
35% actually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were in a private system, in similar circumstances people 
would have chosen another insurance company long ago. You can be sure 
that no private system could survive in such circumstances because 
contributors would have found another insurer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is an important aspect. The system is financed by the 
employees and their employers. The Government of Canada does not 
contribute a penny. The system is entirely financed by the employees and 
their employers. It would only be fair to allow them to control the 
money in the fund. 
No wonder they find it surprising that it has become some kind of 
insurance against the deficit instead of an employment insurance plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government, through its finance minister, decided that 
there would be two main contributors to deficit reduction: the people 
who pay into the employment insurance fund, that is to say, the 
employees and their employers. Fancy that, every two weeks money comes 
in from the premiums paid by workers and employers. However, this money 
people think will provide them with an adequate income in between jobs 
is no longer used to this end. Instead, the Canadian government is using 
the employment insurance fund to reduce its deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everybody agrees that the deficit should be lower, but nobody 
thinks it should always be the same people who pay for it. 
The people who contribute to the employment insurance plan are those who 
make 39 000 $ or less. This means that most of the deficit reduction 
burden has been borne by workers and employers, and not by the most 
well-off in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This even penalizes labour intensive businesses. This means that 
employers who pay little more than the minimum wage—for instance, 
seasonal businesses where workers make between $7 and $12 an hour—are 
penalized compared to those employing fewer workers, such as high tech 
companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sure, we must promote the high tech sector, but there is no reason 
why we have to create a system that penalizes businesses with many 
employees. This leads to the situation we are witnessing today. 
In the forestry or fishery industries, people face a totally 
unacceptable situation, and more and more of them can no longer afford 
to live in the area where they reside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This reform has created what I call the spring gap, something that 
is more and more prevalent, as we will see.  I am willing to predict 
something, which will occur as surely as what we were predicting last 
year about employment insurance.  At the end of next winter, when people 
have exhausted their entitlements, after the 10 or 12 week period, when 
they no longer qualify for employment insurance, we will have a very 
ugly situation, because many of these families will not be able to 
qualify for welfare since they own their own home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a government, we cannot act that way, and if we do, people will 
decide they no longer need government. 
If we decide that the market place must always win, that we are a 
strictly market economy, we might as well close down a number of 
regions.  It amounts to the same thing, and I am under the impression 
that this is the choice the government made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two years ago, I went to Gander, Newfoundland, with the Committee 
on Human Resources Development.  In the employment centre, on a display 
rack, I did not see a single program to diversify the local economy, I 
did not see a single program to allow people to find another job in 
their area. I saw a folder explaining how to move out west, because 
there were jobs out west.

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a government reaches such a point, there is definitely 
something very wrong, because it is not true that moving people around 
will make the country liveable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solution is in the principles that would ensure that people in 
each region can develop the resources in that region. Also, when they 
develop the resources in their region, they promote economic development 
in that region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us remember that at the end of the 19th century and the 
beginning of the 20th century, the situation was quite different 
from what it is today. The whole maritime region was 
self-reliant, self-sufficient in Canada. But in the 1960s, under 
the wonderful regime of Mr. Trudeau, the government made what I 
would call a deal. It said that manufacturing processing, the 
serious economic activity, would be done in Ontario. It would 
give transfer payments to the provinces east of Quebec, that it 
would be forthcoming, that it would be generous, that it would 
give them a handout. This is how the model was developed and how 
we ended up with the aberrations we have today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, what it did not expect, or what it said others would take 
care of after the Trudeau era, is that people finally realized that the 
tap could not be left on forever. At one point, it said it was no longer 
able to produce wealth and send it to the maritimes to keep people 
alive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solution that it found was not to diversify regional economies, 
but to turn off the tap. 
It decided to create such things as TAGS because it was faced with the 
real problem of dwindling fish stocks. So it developed a program, but 
did not implement it as planned. It did not respect the objective, which 
was to diversify the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, the government has the gall to say that local communities 
chose to benefit from the system. Canada's central government has a 
fundamental problem because it thinks it knows best, as far as people in 
the regions are concerned.  It ought instead to think about how 
important it is to look for solutions at the grassroots level, to see 
what they have to suggest and what it can do about it, so that regional 
economies can adjust and develop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the motion proposes that 50% of the surplus in the 
employment insurance fund be kept as a working margin, because there 
might be other recessions and we should not repeat the mistake we made 
in the past, when the unemployment insurance fund had a running deficit. 
We are willing to accept that 50% of the present surplus be used for 
that purpose, but we want the other 50% to be divided in two parts: one 
half would be applied to lowering contributions by 35 to 50 cents for 
each $100 of insurable earnings, and the other half to improving 
benefits for seasonal workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think there is a lesson the Liberal government, and especially 
Liberal members from the maritimes, should have learned from the last 
election.  There were even members on TV yesterday evening debating the 
issue. 
There was a member of the NDP who, after the election, said the same 
thing as she was saying before. And then there was a Liberal member, who 
had changed her tune since the election. I find this unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems the situation we have before us is one the government 
will not be able to ignore. We have been back here for two months 
and a half, and every opposition party has asked questions on the 
employment insurance issue. Everybody has said that the system 
should be changed. This morning, we had an extra reason to ask 
for changes. We have figures showing a phenomenal increase in the 
number of independent, self-employed workers who represent a new 
feature of the labour market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the election campaign, the Bloc Quebecois suggested that 
these people should be able, on a voluntary basis, to be eligible to 
employment insurance. 
If the system is not changed, we will have a system that will be suited 
to the problems of ten years ago, but that will in no way be suited to 
the problems of today and the years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As provided in the act, the government is required to report every 
year to the parliamentary committee to propose amendments to the act. 
Basically, if the government had taken its responsibilities and had 
recognized that there are indeed changes to be made and had decided to 
go ahead with them, there would be no need to debate this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another demand on the table. Yesterday, the premier of 
Quebec stated that he would come to the federal-provincial meeting next 
December, provided that the issue of the employment insurance surplus 
was on the agenda. 
What he said was “to help improve the living conditions of seasonal 
workers”.

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, I think we should answer this appeal, the appeal made by the 
premiers and even by the human resources development committee, which 
did in fact pass a motion asking the finance minister to give priority 
during his prebudget consultations to the issues of employment and 
employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The premier of Quebec, all of the premiers and the human resources 
development committee, that is a lot of people asking the government to 
use common sense and to listen to good sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the government to endorse my motion as soon as possible and 
to come back to the House with a government bill that will meet the 
goals of the constituents in my riding and in all of eastern Canada, and 
I hope that all members will give proper consideration to this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about managing the government surplus. The best way 
to manage this surplus properly is to be fair, so that everyone gets his 
or her share. Since employers and employees have generated most of the 
surplus, they should benefit most from its redistribution.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  A point 
of order, Madam Speaker.  I ask for the unanimous consent of the 
House to have the letter that was referred to in question period 
tabled at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Is there unanimous 
consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Resuming debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert D. Nault:</B>  Madam Speaker, the first thing I 
would ask the hon. member to consider is that if we adopted his 
motion it would not give due consideration to all the hard work 
that has gone into restructuring the system and the positive 
approach in helping unemployed Canadians that other members and 
myself were involved with in the last session. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government set out to redesign the way in which we 
helped unemployed workers get back to work, we made a dramatic 
shift from passive assistance to active measures that would act 
as an incentive for individuals to return to the workforce as 
soon as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new system is not yet 16 months old.  Most reasonable people 
would agree that it is not long enough to determine how effective 
it is going to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now address some specific points in the hon. member's 
motion.  He is asking the government to lower premium 
contributions.  In 1994 the government took action to stop rates 
from increasing, setting the rate that year at $3.07 instead of 
the scheduled $3.30. Since 1995 premium rates have declined each 
year.  They are now at $2.90 for every $100 of insurable earnings 
and the government is committed to bringing the rate down even 
further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for weekly maximum insurable earnings, we rolled them back to 
$750 and froze them at that level rather than allowing them to 
increase to $875 as they were scheduled to do.  But we did not 
stop there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the hon. member familiar with the new hires program?  Under 
that program up to 900,000 employers are eligible to pay 
virtually no premiums for jobs they create this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Combine these three measures and the government is saving 
workers and employers $1.7 billion in payroll taxes in 1997. 
By anybody's arithmetic, those are substantial savings to both 
employers and employees.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is asking the government to improve benefits for 
seasonal workers and new entrants and re-entrants.  First let us 
consider seasonal workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the old UI system was reformed, the government was 
determined to make the new system more flexible to accommodate 
changing conditions in the workplace.  Those changes included 
improvements in the way benefits are calculated for seasonal 
workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With EI we have an hours based system.  That hours based system 
enables an additional 45,000 workers in seasonal industries to 
qualify for benefits they would not have qualified for under the 
old system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the hours based system some 270,000 seasonal workers 
are eligible for an average of three additional weeks of EI 
benefits.  For families with children whose incomes are under 
$26,000, the family income supplement assists them financially. 
By the year 2000 their EI benefits may be as high as 80% of their 
insured earnings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, an $800 million annual reinvestment in employment 
benefits by the year 2000 will help workers in seasonal 
industries extend their regular season or find work in the off 
season.  Besides that, the government has a very active $300 
million transitional jobs fund to help create sustainable 
employment in areas of high unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give the House some statistics for those who are 
interested in the transitional jobs fund. So far more than 400 
projects have been approved.  We have spent $150 million on TJF. 
Some 20,000 new jobs have been created due to this program and 
some $1.3 billion has been leveraged by the private sector 
because of this fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone who has been involved in this fund in high unemployment 
areas, such as my area of northern Ontario, can attest to the 
fact that this is a very creative program which will create 
sustainable employment.  It is being used.  The significance of 
this program is that it has also been agreed to by the provinces, 
by members of Parliament, by non-profit organizations, all 
working together in their regions to create sustainable 
employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time the government recognized the issue of 
so-called small weeks, that is, weeks in which a worker earns 
less than $150.  There was a disincentive, which we recognized, 
for some workers to accept these small weeks of work because it 
would lower their benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A major objective of the new EI program is to encourage people 
to accept available employment. The government brought in 
adjustment projects which target 29 high unemployment regions 
across Canada, including the introduction of projects in the hon. 
member's province of Quebec. Over three years these projects will 
return an estimated $247 million in EI benefits to workers in the 
29 regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue to monitor the impact of the new system on 
seasonal workers so appropriate adjustments can be made, but it 
is far too early to start tinkering with the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for new entrants and re-entrants, yes, the requirements are 
higher.  There is a very good reason for that.  Higher entrance 
requirements ensure that workers who qualify for benefits 
establish a solid attachment to the labour force before receiving 
benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the big problems under the old system was that people 
became dependent on UI.  Some people used it to supplement their 
income and there is evidence that some young people left school 
early so they could collect income benefits.  I am sure the hon. 
member would not want to create that kind of incentive for young 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under EI higher entrance requirements will reduce the chance of 
workers, especially young workers, from developing a dependency 
on the system early in their work life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has a number of programs under the youth 
employment strategy to help young Canadians make a successful 
transition from school to work.  As was announced in the Speech 
from the Throne, we intend to take further measures to reduce 
barriers to post-secondary education. 
As well, we will work with our provincial and private sector 
partners to ensure that young men and women develop the skills 
necessary to thrive in the emerging knowledge based economy.

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, we are not unaware that more women than men 
are re-entrants to the workforce.  We have implemented special 
measures to help ease the effect of higher entrance requirements 
on women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take the case of a woman re-entering the workforce who 
has collected maternity or parental benefits in the last five 
years. To mitigate the impact of higher entrance requirements, 
this individual has access to EI's active employment measures, 
measures that will help or make a more stable attachment to the 
labour market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier with regard to seasonal workers, about 
350,00 low income claimants, two-thirds of whom are women, are 
eligible for the family income supplement.  And benefits for low 
income, single parent families headed by women will increase, as 
we all know, in these new changes by 13%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not fair that we have helped women who are at the low end 
of the income scale by increasing their benefits by 13%? 
Obviously, that is never mentioned by members opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would remind the hon. member that the 
transformation from UI to employment insurance was the most 
massive overhaul of the program in 25 years.  Part of that 
overhaul was a commitment by the government to monitor and assess 
the impact of the changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That process is currently under way.  As required under the 
Employment Insurance Act, early in 1998 the minister will report 
to Parliament on just how well the new system is working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the new EI system deserves a fair trial period. For 
that reason, I am opposed to the hon. member's motion and I think 
we should give change a chance to take place. 
<P><A NAME="LINK190"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, we are debating today a private member's motion 
introduced by my hon. colleague from the Bloc proposing some 
changes to the new EI system.  We find the change in wording from 
UI to EI just a little difficult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What my colleague is proposing is to make “major changes” to 
the EI system.  He is proposing lower contributions and increased 
benefits for both seasonal workers and for new entrants to the 
labour market.  That is what we are talking about today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. parliamentary secretary for the government pointed out 
that since the new EI system is barely in its infancy, it is not 
the time to make major changes.  He also argues that there have 
been some fairly significant elements of the new EI program to 
help both seasonal workers and to help those who are new entrants 
to the job market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the point of debate, to have proposals for change, to 
have the merit of those debated.  I hope I can add a few cogent 
and helpful thoughts to our deliberations on this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main point of this motion is to talk about the need for 
lower contributions, to lower the contribution, to lower the 
amount of money going into the EI system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has already been pointed out, the surplus in the EI fund will 
reach $14.9 billion by the end of this fiscal year.  That is a 
fairly big chunk of money.  In fact, it is about as much as the 
GST takes out of the economy.  Now we have another $15 billion 
being taken out and in surplus with the EI fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been said many times in this House before—I do not think 
it has really been rebutted or denied—that high payroll taxes 
particularly discourage employment and discourage hiring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have a government elected on the promise of jobs, jobs, 
jobs in 1993.  That was their rallying cry for Canadians. 
Yet in the four years the Liberals have been running the affairs 
of our country they have done tremendous damage to the job 
creators of this country.

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxes keep rising.  Here we have a totally unnecessary chunk 
taken out of the hides of employers and workers in this country 
simply so the finance minister can brag about what a good job he 
has done in getting rid of the deficit.  Sure, if you tax 
everyone to the max you should not have to borrow any money. That 
is nothing to brag about but that is essentially what has 
happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On top of the tax increases which have been $24 billion more 
revenue taken in by this government than when it was elected, 
there will be $15 billion from the EI surplus.  There is another 
$10 billion a year coming out of our pockets for the increase in 
the Canada pension plan premiums.  We wonder if the finance 
minister and the government think Canadians are made of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the Liberals play the violin and put their hands over their 
hearts about child poverty.  It is no wonder our families are 
poor.  It is a wonder our families are able to eat anymore with 
all the taxes, taxes and taxes this government seems to feel 
so free to rip out of our pockets on an ongoing basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have one that has proven to be unnecessary.  It is a 
surplus in a fund that is to help unemployed people.  It is like 
being forced to pay $30,000 for a $20,000 car.  We wonder why we 
must have a system that costs far more than it is acknowledged is 
appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must agree with my colleague from the Bloc that there should 
be and must be lower contribution rates to the EI program. 
Cutting EI expenditures in terms of premiums needed to operate 
the system would save most working Canadians about $300 a year, 
and $300 could buy a lot of milk for poor children in the 
country.  It could buy a lot of warm clothing for our children. It 
could make sure our mortgages get paid and the heat bills get 
paid.  But no, this taxaholic finance minister needs that money 
to play with, and so of course we have to keep paying unnecessary 
dollars into the hands of this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore the real engines of job creation, the small and medium 
size businesses, are actually penalized unnecessarily for every 
single person they hire.  It is no wonder hiring is cut back. 
When every person you hire takes a big chunk of your profits and 
your business capital naturally you will conserve and hire as few 
people as you can possibly get away with instead of expanding 
your business and the economic opportunities in this country.  I 
am not quite sure how long it will take some people in the House to 
realize that and to seriously deal with it, in particular those 
on the government side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say to the government that as long as this government 
keeps EI premiums unnecessarily high, Canadians have every right 
to say that it is not really serious about job creation in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The EI surplus has been used for fully 22% of deficit reduction, 
which means that over $1 in every $5 that the finance minister is 
bragging that he is no longer borrowing is made possible because 
workers and business people are subsidizing his deficit reduction 
efforts by 22%.  Sometimes you have to balance the cost and the 
benefit of some of these measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians' disposable income at the same time has decreased.  It 
has decreased by about $3,000 per family since this government 
was elected.  Three thousand dollars per family would buy a lot 
of milk, a lot of warm clothing and would make sure our families 
had adequate shelter.  But this heavy increase in taxation, of 
which this EI surplus is just a part, is responsible for a 
tremendous amount of the suffering in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Business Council on National Issues states tax cuts would 
help alleviate the problem of child poverty. 
The BCNI also said it is terrifying that many low and middle 
income Canadians face this steep tax burden and that this 
government is sitting on a time bomb on taxation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the government to recognize the suffering and the 
hardship being caused to Canadians by its insatiable appetite for 
our tax dollars so that it can politically brag about what it has 
done or is going to do.  It is nice to do these things, but they 
must be done in a way that is fair to the only source of revenue 
in the country, hard working Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government really must be serious about this change.  The 
parliamentary secretary said in the debate that the new hires 
program waives or does not collect the UI premiums for jobs that 
businesses create this year under the program, absolutely 
underlining and acknowledging the fact that these job taxes are 
keeping new jobs from being created.  If these job taxes were not 
a significant factor, why did the government tell businesses they 
will not have to pay them as long as they hire new people?  It 
knows this is an impediment and that is why it has removed it 
under the new hires program.  It has also put in place the family 
income supplement for low income Canadians, again acknowledging 
that under our tax regime low income Canadians cannot make ends 
meet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of struggling families I appeal to the government not 
to continue taking these dollars out of the pockets of hard 
working Canadians who are trying desperately to care for their 
families and make ends meet.

<P><A NAME="LINK191"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to address the House today and join with my colleague from 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques in demanding, as 
stated in his motion, that “the Government of Canada make major changes 
in the employment insurance system, particularly by lowering 
contributions and improving benefits for seasonal workers and workers 
who have joined the labour market only recently.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the last election campaign, we in the Bloc Quebecois made a 
commitment to press the government into dealing with these issues, and 
we will keep doing it through special initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind you of a few figures, if I may. The EI 
recipient-unemployed worker ratio dropped from 77% in 1989 to below 41% 
in 1996. Under the Liberals, this ratio has fallen from 60% in 1993 to 
36% in January 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1990, successive cuts have deprived thousands of people of EI 
benefits, and many of them are now on welfare. Under the current system, 
the unemployed in Quebec will receive $316 million less in 1997-98 and 
$534 million less in 2001-2002. As a matter of fact, this new employment 
insurance plan is a systematic impoverishment programm, and a hidden tax 
affecting many families in the Jonquière riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It looks like one of our initiatives will meet with great success 
in the Jonquière riding. 
Like my colleague from Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques, I have mailed out to my constituents in Jonquière postcards 
they can send me back to indicate their support for changes to the 
employment insurance plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More specifically, we ask the federal government to stop unfairly 
penalizing seasonal workers and new entrants to the labour market by 
amending the Employment Insurance Act and lowering contributions 
significantly by 35 to 50 cents.

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Jonquière as well as the local community and labour 
organizations, which are sensitive to the situation of seasonal workers, 
reacted positively to our initiative. In several parishes of Jonquière 
the priests invited their parishioners to send back their cards on 
employment insurance to make the Liberal government aware of the very 
harmful effects of the present employment insurance system on the 
workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many times during the last campaign, people from my riding told me 
they were outraged by the reduction in benefits while the premiums paid 
by workers allowed the government to collect around $5 billion a year in 
revenues that are not used to help the unemployed, but to reduce its 
deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people across the floor brag about this, but they should be 
ashamed of the mess they created. The federal government and the 
Minister of Finance may benefit from the cuts, but such is not the case 
for low income people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is now clear that it is the workers and the employers who make 
it possible for the Minister of Finance to artificially lower its 
deficit. But the Bloc is there to remind you of the interests of the men 
and women of Quebec. 
And believe me, we will constantly remind the government of the facts to 
bring it back to the people's true reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Together with the Government of Quebec, we are asking for changes 
to the EI system. Premier Lucien Bouchard, the head of the Government of 
Quebec, said that he will, at the next federal-provincial meeting, make 
a proposal to change the EI system for the benefit of both employers and 
workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He wants to put forward the following changes: reduced premiums for 
employers and workers and increased benefits, or a combination of both. 
We are in favour of such an initiative, which would improve the 
situation of Quebec workers. 
Mr. Bouchard said that these changes would allow seasonal workers to 
escape the terrible conditions they are living with now, and which 
increase welfare budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, the Bloc Quebecois reiterates its proposal that the 
Liberal government substantially decrease the EI premium rate and at the 
same time improve the program, which has become too restrictive, 
particularly for seasonal workers and new entrants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the Minister of Human Resources Development will take action 
on this issue. He will shortly have to respond favourably to Quebec 
workers' demands and needs, because year 2000 is fast approaching and he 
might be unprepared for what is coming.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
speaking today in support of the motion of my colleague from the 
riding of Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques—like the name of some families down home, the 
Basques—proposing major amendments to the employment insurance 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague proposes that the benefits for seasonal workers 
and new entrants be improved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are serious problems, and the government must address 
them immediately. 
I believe the Liberals have forgotten that these are real people 
who are suffering, that entire families have nothing to eat because 
of the changes to employment insurance. 
I will give you examples of the government's insensitivity and 
incompetence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I would like to point out that we have a bit of a 
problem with the matter of reducing contributions.  Allow me to 
explain what our problem is.  Before reducing contributions, I 
think the first problem needs to be solved, the problem of 
employment insurance and the employment insurance formula.  After 
that has been done, then would come the time to look at 
contributions, if there is any money left to reduce contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is really important to look at the employment 
insurance formula in order to be certain that it meets the 
requirements of the people who need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at what employment insurance reform has brought to our 
area and other areas in Canada, we see mostly problems. I am going to 
give you a few examples from back home, which I am very familiar with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, when the government decided to make changes to employment 
insurance, what did it do? Not only did it decide to make changes 
for the future, but it suddenly decided to look at people's 
files, people who had been told by its officials they were 
eligible for employment insurance. Surprise, they found they had 
made a mistake three years back. They wrongly told some people 
they were entitled to employment insurance. The people concerned 
were poor—I will give you examples—they were not rich. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give the example of a man who came to see me in my office 
shortly after the elections, a man with a child.  There were also a 
father, and a mother with 11 children from Caraquet, in New Brunswick. 
Because of the problems in the fish plants, that man went to see the 
government to find out whether he qualified for employment insurance. 
You know, employment insurance is supposed to provide some money to feed 
families.  He went to the government and was told “Well, you have to 
work, to work hard. Go out there and find some work”.  The man said 
“I 
would be glad to work, but I cannot get a job”.  And he was told 
“We are 
creating jobs in New Brunswick now.  We are making Christmas wreaths. 
Go and see the employer, he will give you a job”.  And he did get a job 
making Christmas decorations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The poor man went to work and put in a number of weeks in order to 
qualify for employment insurance. 
The guy, his wife and his kid would have loved to keep on making 
Christmas wreaths all year long, but that is not the way it works. After 
Christmas, wreaths are no longer in demand. So, they are out of a job 
again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They applied for employment insurance to see if they qualified. 
“Of 
course. You are entitled to employment insurance, and your son 
too.” So 
they get benefits for a year or two and then, all of a sudden, 
department officials come to their senses—I mean senior officers, I 
make the distinction because I do not want to offend low-level public 
servants who have no authority whatsoever—and ask for an investigation 
on these poor people because it would seem a mistake was made two years 
back. They tell these people they owe the government $10,000 or $15,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what Canadians got from the Liberals. The Liberals told 
seasonal workers back home to make Christmas wreaths, that great new job 
in New Brunswick.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on the Government of Canada not to blackmail Atlantic 
Canadians by telling them they are going to make them work full 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> That is a terrible thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin:</B> Yes, it is terrible.  Better yet, they should 
deliver on their threat, because our people want to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event, back to the Christmas wreathes, because this is 
an interesting case. This is what happens to our industries.  We 
cannot get at the fish in the winter because of the ice, there are 
no Christmas wreathes in the summer, blueberries do not grow under 
the snow, and there is no peat on top of it. 
These are the kinds of industries in which the government invests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are secondary and tertiary industries, but that is too 
complicated for the government.  They want to leave that for their 
friends in other countries:  the Japanese and the folks in Boston 
get a crack at the secondary and tertiary sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back to the Christmas wreathes.  The government told these 
people:  “You do not have enough hours.  Go and make Christmas 
wreathes”.  Off went 130 or 150 people to work for someone in New 
Brunswick.  All of a sudden, the government decided this was not 
insurable employment, once again, three years later.  Three years 
later, it decided that 130 to 140 of these people were not 
eligible.  What the government has done is completely unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, these people went to the employment insurance 
offices and explained how they were making the wreathes. 
For the information of wealthy Canadians who do not have to make 
Christmas wreathes, this is not something that you go into the 
woods to do.  You do not strip the boughs off the tree in the woods 
and make the wreath with a supervisor standing beside you. For 
those who do not know about these things, you go into the woods, 
you cut branches, and then you have to strip them.  Somebody then 
makes the wreathes.  People went back home, opened their garage 
doors, set up tables and began turning out wreathes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they reported back to the employment insurance office, 
they explained all this.  They were insurable.  But, as I am 
telling you, the government needed money to pay down the national 
debt.  It was not enough to cut employment insurance.  They said 
they would digging into the pockets of the poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform Party members are asking for a decrease in premiums because 
companies are having a rough time. They never say that Canadians are 
suffering because of employment insurance cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people went to EI offices, and they were told they were 
eligible. In the Acadian peninsula today, for one company alone, 150 
families owe between $10,000 to $15,000, and on top of that, they are 
seen as cheats. What the government has done to these people is totally 
unacceptable. That is what it did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not all. They are now saying that we must encourage small 
and medium-sized businesses. If I had a small business today, I would 
naturally start by hiring my children. It would be normal because it 
would be my company and my investment. What did the government do? 
Relatives are not eligible for EI. 
So why encourage the development of small and medium sized businesses 
when their owners face such total discrimination in Canada? I thought we 
could expect fair and equal treatment in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also this black hole, this vacuum created because the 
government promised to make changes and to take care of them but did not 
follow through with the 910 hours now required, which people cannot 
accumulate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, as I said over and over in my remarks, changes must be 
made immediately to the employment insurance plan. Seasonal workers are 
expecting the federal government to show some degree of compassion by 
passing immediately the motion put forward by the hon. member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, thereby ensuring 
that Canadian workers can look for work with dignity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want this motion to be a real motion that we could debate, 
instead of hiding like the hon. member for Moncton. During the election 
campaign, she promised the unemployed she would fight to improve the 
employment insurance system, but she now refuses to support the motion 
before us.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, NDP):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I think it is important to debate of this motion. I support it fully, 
and I thank my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois for introducing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague mentioned earlier, there are serious problems in 
our region. The Liberal Party member mentioned earlier the dependence of 
the unemployment insurance—which they want to call employment 
insurance—system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should ask a question, perhaps. When you live in a region where 
the economy is primarily seasonal, people depend on employment insurance 
in order to live and to eat. 
This is dependence. They have a choice: either employment insurance or 
meagre social welfare. Most of them are not eligible for social welfare 
if one member of the family earns $800 or more a month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From what I understand, the government does not like having people 
depend on the employment insurance system for sustenance. In other 
words, it says that they should starve. As a member of Parliament, I 
disagree. Having something to eat is not a privilege in this country, it 
is a right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I get calls from people in my riding who receive $39 a week 
from employment insurance I can see there is a problem, especially when 
there is a surplus of nearly $12 billion in the employment insurance 
fund, which was paid by employers and employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government says it is going to take it, and we will use the 
word “take” today, to pay its deficit, that it will decide to pay a 
debt, the deficit, on the back of the unemployed, people who have lost 
their job, small and medium businesses that have closed their doors. New 
Brunswick's economy has lost a lot of dollars because of the cuts to pay 
the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many businesses today say “enough is enough”.  People don't have 
money any more. So now more people than just the seasonal workers are 
suffering. There are seniors as well. If we look at the example of the 
man making $39 a week at home, with his 73 year-old mother looking after 
him. Do you think that this woman is earning enough to provide for her 
son? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Don't tell me that cuts don't hurt anyone; they hurt everyone. 
Take a good look of how much money it costs for our health care program 
today because of people who are stressed and end up in hospital because 
they cannot find a job and can no longer get employment insurance. It is 
easy for us, who make $64,000 and $70,000 a year to say: “No you do not 
get paid for three months of the year”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, I am not hungry, but I have experienced hunger. I am not 
hungry today and I may forget what happens at home, if I like, as some 
people on the other side have done in creating reforms without thinking. 
There are children who go to school without breakfast, who will have no 
lunch or supper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And yet they are saying people depend on employment insurance, that 
employment insurance should be eliminated because it creates dependence. 
I say that I was proud to depend on employment insurance when I needed 
it. 
I was unemployed until June 2, 1997. I needed employment insurance to 
feed my son and daughter. I am not going to turn around and tell people 
at home that they will lose their right. I can guarantee them today that 
I will fight to the last, because what the government is doing to our 
people is utterly inhuman.
