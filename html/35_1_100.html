<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="INTERNATIONALCONFERENCEONPOPULATION">INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON POPULATION</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Madam Speaker, I welcome this morning the 
opportunity to report to my federal colleagues of this House on 
the international conference on population and development 
held in Cairo earlier this month, at which I had the privilege of 
being the leader of the Canadian delegation.
<P>
	As head of that delegation I would like to express the 
government's sincere thanks to the very able Canadian 
negotiators who piloted through the program of action on 
Canada's behalf, a group of dedicated public servants who 
served our country with distinction.
<P>
	I should also mention the work done by a multiplicity of 
support staff that worked long and hard from morning to evening 
in those discussions. Many times we forget that those are the 
officials who worked for several years leading up to this 
conference and sometimes at the conference it is the heads of the 
states or the leaders of the delegations who get the limelight or 
the credit as well as the blame when perhaps things do not go per 
course. I think it is important for all of us to signal to them our 
appreciation for the kind of public service they have rendered on 
our behalf.
<P>
	Canada not only played a useful role as one of the many 
countries assembled in Cairo, but I would suggest Canada 
played a tremendous facilitating role. Canada was very much a 
builder of bridges among different countries that perhaps had 
different views and yes, some very hard concerns about certain 
aspects of the draft action plan.
<P>
<B>(1005 ) </B>
<P>
	Canada did not try to seek the limelight and speak in the 
public arena every day but there was a lot of behind the scenes 
work in trying to foster those rapports, in trying to keep channels 
open and also being respectful of the different opinions, whether 
they be political, whether they be cultural or whether they be 
religious. In terms of  the Holy See, I think Canada among the 
western countries had probably one of the better pipelines that 
remained open with the Holy See and others. That is the kind of 
internationalism that Canada has made a very proud tradition for 
herself.
<P>
	It was a truly rewarding experience as a participant to see such 
a remarkable degree of consensus on sensitive and controversial 
issues that strike at the very heart of the human condition.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	There were over 180 delegations from far and wide 
representing various political systems, cultures and religions. 
They agreed on a comprehensive program of action.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As an international blueprint for change the program of action 
represents a springboard for advancement on both population 
and development. It brings together the approaches of the past 
which focused on demographics and development. In the 
seventies in Bucharest the answer was development. It was seen 
as the panacea in terms of trying to deal with both population on 
the one hand and between the nations that do the consumption. 
Yet that did not work.
<P>
	In the eighties the whole question was the demographics, 
somehow arbitrary numbers brought down from thin air and 
probably forced upon people and nations the globe over. That 
did not work either.
<P>
	In the 1990s as a result of Cairo we have seen the convergence 
of both family planning and development, both for the 
individual as well as for that country. It think it is through the 
convergence of those two forces that hopefully we will be able to 
unlock a number of problematic doors that have faced the 
international community.
<P>
	Cairo also recognized the vital role of women in achieving 
social and economic goals. We mentioned in our speech from the 
platform, as Mahatma Gandhi once said, when you educate a 
man you educate an individual; when you educate a woman you 
educate an entire community and family. I think there is 
something to that. Some people get worried when we say 
empowerment of women.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6296"> 6296 </A></B>
<P>
	If we look at what that means the empowerment of women 
is also the empowerment of family. It is the woman in many 
families who is the centrepiece and the anchor. Therefore if we 
accentuate her role, her opportunities, her rights we clearly 
buoy up the entire family which many times she is responsible 
for.
<P>
	Governments agreed not only to talk but to act, to take action 
on reducing mortality rates of mothers and infants, on ensuring 
equal education opportunities for girls, access to employment 
opportunities for women, and pay more attention to the 
reproductive health needs of adolescence and improving access 
and availability of basic health care.
<P>
	At the end of the day when it came time to commit our fellow 
world citizens came to a degree of consensus which was 
unprecedented at similar population conferences in the past. I 
know that before going to Cairo there was controversy on 
various elements of the draft action plan. Yet that seemed to 
dominate the discussion, certainly the media attention and we 
forgot that as a complicated, complex diverse world this 
document enjoyed before the first gavel ever hit the desk 90 per 
cent agreement.
<P>
	Why is 90 per cent agreement on a document such a bad thing? 
If I got 90 per cent at high school or university I would have been 
a rocket scientist. If one of our parties would have attained 90 
per cent of the seats across the country we would have been 
superstars in terms of our political organization.
<P>
<B>(1010 ) </B>
<P>
	Why is it that when a diverse world comes together and agrees 
on 90 per cent of the document somehow it has to be seen as a 
negative or a failure because we have the last ten yards to go and 
those are the toughest?
<P>
	There was more that united this world in its action plan than 
divided it. One of the most important things to come out of that 
conference was that delegates took a new approach to 
population issues. Instead of looking strictly at demographic 
targets, just the numbers, they widened their focus in an 
important way. They recognize that social and economic 
development is central to achieving a balance between the 
number of people on earth and their demands in terms of food, 
shelter and other basic necessities of life.
<P>
	It was a real coming together of north and south, east and 
west, rich and poor. No one was dictating to anyone. Those days 
are clearly over. There was very much a question of consensus 
rather than suggesting by force or implications.
<P>
	It was also heartening that the international migration issue 
was treated in a truly comprehensive and balanced way for the 
first time in a forum of this kind. Governments recognized not 
only the negatives in terms of the mass of humanity that is on the 
move, some 150 million people strong, but also the positive 
benefits of migration. We were also able to bring one of those 
positive messages.
<P>
	Despite the challenges and difficulties that still confront us, 
we were also prepared to admit that the force of migration 
helped to build a country called Canada. That was something the 
international representatives, both NGOs and governments, had 
not heard enough of in terms of simply talking about the 
problems rather than also about the advantages.
<P>
	Delegates also stressed the need for increased international 
co-operation to deal with the challenges that current migration 
trends present to all of us. We talked about prevention, 
protection and then integration of those migrants.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Cairo program of action in international migration is the 
first to have been approved by this many nations.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It now provides a springboard for further progress on the 
international political level and on the daily operational level. 
Cairo has given Canada a relevant and practical tool for 
advancing its international migration agenda.
<P>
	We need more bilaterals, more of a regime between and 
among countries if we are to deal competently with that 
movement of humanity. One country cannot do it alone. Canada 
should not be expected to do it alone. No country has the 
answers to that kind of dilemma.
<P>
	If we put regimes together, if more countries keep their front 
doors open a little, it will make life not only easier and more 
bearable for those individuals seeking a home, it will also make 
life easier and more bearable for those countries that have done 
their share.
<P>
	No one is responsible for the entire problem. Rather, we are 
each responsible for our share of that situation. We as members 
of the global community met in Cairo with a daunting task 
before us. There were many who predicted we would dissolve 
into disagreement, discord and disarray. We proved them wrong 
and we proved there is consensus and commitment in the world 
community to tackle global problems not only effectively but 
together.
<P>
	The last message Canada brought on the closing days was that 
while the agreement provides us with that road map and that 
consensus, the agreement is only as good as its implementation. 
That too is a uniquely practical Canadian application of not 
simply being happy about an agreement but really rolling up our 
shirt sleeves making sure that individual member states follow 
up on the commitments we tied together in Cairo. Only then can 
we say that truly Cairo was a success. It clearly started as that 
and we in this country in co-operation with the United Nations 
will ensure that the individuals for whom this plan is intended 
will certainly see the fruits of our labour.

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
impressions we have brought back from the International 
Conference on Population in Cairo are too many to sum up in 
just a few minutes. But I would say that the two words that 
describe them the best are openness and progress.
<P>
	I am glad that the minister shared with us this morning his 
thoughts about this international conference. It makes us realize 
the importance of such gatherings because when cultures and 
deep differences that shape nations come in contact, we can 
subscribe to the idea that discussion promotes openness, and 
openness promotes progress and the furtherance of ideas.
<P>
	For us, Cairo was above all an occasion to voice major 
concerns that much not only be discussed in international fora 
but also in our target communities as well as in our 
parliamentary institutions.
<P>
	I would like to emphasize an aspect of the conference that 
distressed me deeply as a parliamentarian and a woman, and that 
is the status of women. It remains a stumbling block, the central 
area in which progress needs to be made if our civilization is to 
embark upon the quest for the well-being of our people.
<P>
	Suffering can affect both body and soul. Just think of the 
plight of millions of young women around the world who are 
subjected to what we call excision or infibulation.
<P>
	In a world in which technology and science keep turning 
everything upside down on a daily basis in the way we live and 
think, two thirds of the 960 million illiterate persons on this 
planet are women.
<P>
	Considering that life expectancy in Zimbabwe is 44 years for 
women and 40 for men, the tragic reality behind these figures 
shows strikingly the major imbalance between developing 
countries and industrialized countries. This geopolitical reality 
was palpable during discussions at the conference. The 
international community is faced with this implacable reality 
that concerns us all.
<P>
	The attitude change in people world-wide on issues such as 
family planning, health and education, is a sign of modest 
progress in the status of women, although much remains to be 
done. I noticed how widespread were the concerns expressed by 
women about abortion legislation. I also noticed how 
government leaders can make overcautious statements on this 
issue, statements that do nothing to help women in their 
everyday lives. To avert a potential disaster for mankind, it is 
imperative that every woman in the world be given equal 
opportunity and the chance to achieve her potential. That is the 
message from Cairo, the message that must be sent out.
<P>
	It must also be heard in this House. We must look at what has 
been accomplished in Canada in concrete term and how much 
progress remains to be done. I suggest to you that, while being 
ahead of many other countries on the issue of women status, 
Canada still has quite a long way to go.
<P>
	Economic equality for women is still far from a sure thing. 
Women working for the federal government continue to be paid 
less than their male counterparts. Yet, we know that to further 
the cause of women and the state of the children requires that 
women and men be treated as equals.
<P>
	It is also imperative that our government provide protection 
to women from foreign cultures by making illegal practices that 
adversely affect their basic rights. In fact, I would suggest that 
the government support the bill on the mutilation of feminine 
genitalia that I will be introducing today in this House, the 
purpose of which is precisely to protect a fair number of our 
Canadian women.
<P>
	I would also ask the government to take all necessary steps to 
fight child poverty and to take action immediately.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer):</B> Madam Speaker, I also want to 
commend the public servants who worked on this program. I 
know a number of people in foreign affairs put in a lot of time on 
this.
<P>
	Without really reviewing the conference and what happened, I 
would like to highlight a few facts where I think there would be 
agreement among all of us. Certainly over population is a threat 
and the world's sustainability is certainly dependent on us 
bringing this problem under control.
<P>
	However, demographers and researchers have done an awful 
lot of work on this. It is a topic for study in universities. I am not 
sure that a conference of this magnitude would be necessary to 
discuss the fact that there is a problem.
<P>
<B>(1020 ) </B>
<P>
	Second, the empowerment of women, giving them greater 
control over their lives through increased access to education, 
health care, and increasing their economic contribution in 
developing countries should be strongly supported and would 
have our utmost support.
<P>
	Uncontrolled migration is another major problem. We have 
seen what has happened in Rwanda and it is something that we 
must deal with. Making things better at home is one way to help 
uncontrolled migration.
<P>
	It is rather a motherhood issue to say we would support the 
essentials of life, such as water, food and shelter. Certainly the 
preservation of basic human needs is vital and we are all 
concerned about that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6298"> 6298 </A></B>
<P>
	The spread of disease is another major issue that we must 
look at when we talk about populations. We have seen the 
spread of AIDS, how it started in Africa and what has happened 
since. We now have the plague in India and we see how quickly 
it has become a global problem.
<P>
	We would like to emphasize the importance of the NGOs. 
They are on the spot, and in many cases understand the issues 
much better than governments do. Therefore, the promotion of 
the NGO community, helping with their funding as opposed to 
government to government grants is certainly commendable.
<P>
	If we agree on all of these things then what do we find is the 
problem with the Cairo conference? What kinds of questions do 
we have to ask? Most obviously Canadians want to know if this 
was the best way to achieve the goals desirable in this world. 
One has to wonder just how much further we have come as a 
result of this conference and what will come out of it. What new 
and innovative matters were learned at this conference that we 
did not know before? Was a timetable established? Will that 
timetable be kept? Will there be action instead of just words?
<P>
	Reference was made to the fact that a large part of the 
conference was the discussion of abortion. Both sides struggled 
to try to gain control of the conference. From a Reform Party 
standpoint we believe that abortion is up to the individual and 
not up to international bureaucrats.
<P>
	Everyone agrees that increased wealth in countries leads to 
smaller families. Talks aimed at promoting open markets and 
economic diversification were really not discussed at this 
conference. While certain aspects of the economy were 
mentioned that did not seem to be leading to any concrete action.
<P>
	We have to ask, was this a good expenditure of our funds? 
Canada sent a huge 28 person delegation to Cairo, including 
nine MPs. I was in Cairo last June. The tourism was great but we 
have to ask, did those 28 people have to go and what did they 
accomplish?
<P>
	The estimated cost that we could find at this point was 
approximately $235,000 paid for by foreign affairs. In addition 
in preparatory arrangements about $2 million was spent on this 
conference. Canadians are asking questions about the cost. Why 
did we send that many people? Could this money have been 
spent more wisely in other ways? Was this conference simply a 
recipe for big government? The suggestion that more agencies 
should tell people what to do is the traditional western approach 
to global problems.
<P>
	The Government of Canada should not be exporting 
politically correct agendas. The best way to help developing 
countries would be to promote open markets, economic 
diversification and development, and even more important, help 
improve educational opportunities for everyone around the 
world.

	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec) </B>moved for leave to 
introduce Bill C-277, an Act to amend the Criminal Code 
(circumcision of female persons).
<P>
	She said: Madam Speaker, this morning I am tabling my bill 
on the circumcision of female persons.
<P>
	It is very important that the government give its support to 
this bill. We are all well aware that there is a movement in the 
world concerned with the issue of genital mutilation of females. 
That is why I encourage the government to support my bill.
<P>
	We are well aware that this practice is carried on in Canada by 
immigrants to this country. The Cairo conference raised this 
important problem, one that is recognized by Egypt's population 
minister, who would like to see such a bill studied in the people's 
assembly of Egypt. I therefore hope that here in Canada, where 
we pride ourselves on our progressive stance in the area of 
legislation, we will move ahead, and that my bill will be debated 
and passed in this House.

Intelligence Service.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	This motion has become necessary following the allegations 
made about the Canadian Security Intelligence Service in recent 
months and the events revealed and corroborated during the 
same period.
<P>
	In addition, the many obstacles encountered by the 
Parliamentary Sub-Committee on National Security chaired by 
the hon. member for Scarborough-Rouge River make it even 
more imperative to set up a royal commission of inquiry 
responsible for investigating the alleged actions of CSIS.
<P>
	CSIS has become a state within a state as it is answerable only 
to the Security Intelligence Review Committee, commonly 
known as SIRC, which reports to the Solicitor General himself 
who, in turn, discloses to the House only some of the few 
elements he deems relevant.
<P>
	Although the enabling legal provisions give SIRC very wide 
powers of investigation, the fact remains that it controls only the 
elements voluntarily submitted by CSIS.
<P>
	The very composition of the SIRC greatly undermines our 
trust in this institution. In fact, of its five members, three were 
appointed on the recommendation of the Progressive 
Conservative Party of Canada and one on the recommendation 
of the New Democratic Party of Canada. These two parties no 
longer enjoy official status in the current Parliament.
<P>
	Without enforcement legislation, a simple sense of ethics 
would dictate that the people appointed on the recommendation 
of political parties no longer recognized in this House should 
resign so that the Review Committee can reflect the current 
membership of this House as elected by the people last October 
25.
<P>
	The Official Opposition, the Bloc Quebecois, and the second 
opposition party, the Reform Party, could then be represented on 
the review committee. However, this would only be a 
provisional measure until the act is amended to abolish the 
Review Committee and restrict to parliamentarians the power to 
control and monitor CSIS.
<P>
	What could be more normal and healthy in a democracy than 
putting this function under the exclusive jurisdiction of elected 
officials? Our American neighbours have shown us the way by 
demonstrating for many decades that such a system of 
parliamentary control is the only one acceptable in a free and 
democratic society.
<P>
	The royal commission whose creation we are calling for today 
is in no way intended to compete with the Sub-Committee on 
National Security. All the Official Opposition is asking for is to 
obtain the most results in the least amount of time.
<P>
	We fully recognize the legitimacy and authority of the 
Sub-Committee on National Security and we also acknowledge 
that Parliament never abdicated its powers to CSIS or its Review 
Committee. Nevertheless, given the present situation and the 
composition of the review committee, we must expect 
parliamentary guerrilla war with the members of SIRC instead 
of full and total co-operation from them.
<P>
	Creating a royal commission would keep members of the 
review committee from using delaying tactics to avoid being 
accountable.
<P>
	Last week, the Solicitor General, in answer to a question from 
the Official Opposition, refused to set up a royal commission, on 
the pretext that SIRC's internal verification was sufficient.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	You need only see how the meeting of the Sub-Committee on 
National Security went on September 13 to realize that SIRC 
members are past masters in the art of subterfuge, rather than in 
investigation. The minister should definitely review what 
happened at that meeting. He would see that clearly the 
Sub-Committee on National Security will not obtain from the 
members of SIRC the full and entire co-operation which it is 
entitled to expect.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6301"> 6301 </A></B>
<P>
	He should find grounds for reviewing his position and 
establishing a royal commission of inquiry without delay. We 
cannot remain in the dark where SIRC is keeping us, when 
serious charges have been leveled against CSIS. Let us see what 
these charges are. First, CSIS is accused of having used people 
like a certain Grant Bristow to set up or infiltrate the Heritage 
Front, a Canadian neo-Nazi organization based in Toronto 
which advocates white supremacy. The purpose of this 
organization is directly contrary to the values of Quebec and 
Canada, as proclaimed many times in our most important laws.
<P>
	Grant Bristow reportedly continued his work or was recycled 
as a bodyguard of the leader of the Reform Party of Canada in 
the last election campaign. This Reform ``volunteer'' was 
allegedly well paid by CSIS for doing this infiltration work. We 
are entitled to know whether the Reform Party of Canada, which 
has no other ambition than to take power through the normal 
democratic channels, was infiltrated on CSIS's orders or with its 
knowledge or if some ill-intentioned individual, following 
written or verbal instructions, or with CSIS's guilty silence, 
penetrated the inner circle of the Reform Party leader.
<P>
	Was the Reform Party of Canada at any time considered a 
threat to Canada by CSIS or by the Conservative government? 
We have eloquent proof in this House that the Reform Party was 
a real threat to the Progressive Conservative Party, but surely 
not to Canadian democratic institutions.
<P>
	It is possible that CSIS, either at the request of the 
Conservative government or on its own initiative, decided to 
infiltrate the Reform Party, knowing that it was acting with 
complete impunity, since its review committee was controlled 
by a majority of people appointed by the Conservatives who, by 
virtue of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act, were 
directly accountable to the Solicitor General of that same 
Conservative government.
<P>
	If the Reform Party of Canada was indeed infiltrated and 
considered, at one time or another, to be a threat to Canada, what 
was the attitude of these people towards other opposition 
parties, including the Bloc Quebecois, whose ultimate political 
raison d'être is to help Quebec become a sovereign state?
<P>
	We want to know how CSIS was able to resist the temptation 
of finding out a little more about the Quebec sovereignist 
movement. Let us not forget that, in the seventies, the RCMP 
stole the list of Parti Quebecois members, burned barns and also 
stole dynamite.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	Is it possible that CSIS may have decided to pursue similar 
activities? A royal commission of inquiry would, in all 
likelihood, provide the answer.
<P>
	The Official Opposition is not the only one requesting that all 
the facts be known. The chairman of the Sub-committee on 
National Security, the hon. member for Scarborough-Rouge 
River, also asked for some explanations, as reported by the 
media on September 13.
<P>
	Another allegation was made against CSIS. Indeed, the 
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation may have come under 
surveillance by CSIS after reporting that it was conducting an 
investigation into possible links between Heritage Front and 
some Canadian peacekeepers in Somalia. Given the behaviour 
of some soldiers in Somalia, the existence of such links is 
plausible.
<P>
	Are Grant Bristow and other agents part of a plot by CSIS to 
spy on the CBC?
<P>
	Another allegation made is to the effect that CSIS, Grant 
Bristow or other individuals who may or may not be related to 
the neo-nazi group Heritage Front have targetted the Canadian 
Jewish Congress, by leaking information on Canadian Jewish 
organizations to violent American racists, by promoting the use 
of violence by members of Heritage Front and by organizing a 
campaign to harass anti-racist leaders by telephone.
<P>
	According to another allegation made, CSIS apparently 
followed every step of French secret service agents interested in 
the Quebec sovereignist movement. Consequently, even if CSIS 
did not directly investigate Quebec sovereignist forces, which 
have been called ``the enemy within'' in this House by the 
member for Beaver River, it may have indirectly obtained 
privileged information through its contacts with the French 
foreign security services, the DGSE.
<P>
	According to a Canadian Press dispatch published in <I>Le 
Journal de Québec</I> on Friday, September 9, 1994, CSIS is said to 
have infiltrated the Canadian Union of Postal Workers during a 
labour conflict to provide useful information to Canada Post 
management. The same newspaper also reported that other 
documents confirmed the existence of a link between CSIS and 
some foreign secret service organizations, including Mossad in 
Israel and the secret services in Italy and Jamaica.
<P>
	Finally, some light should be shed regarding claims made by 
Brian McInnis, an advisor to former Solicitor General Doug 
Lewis, who admitted violating the law by giving a confidential 
note to the <I>Toronto Star</I>. Mr. McInnis added that CSIS also 
violated the law by infiltrating the Canadian Broadcasting 
Corporation, because that network was inquiring into possible 
links between the racist organization Heritage Front and 
Canadian peacekeepers in Somalia. Following these allegations, 
the RCMP arrested Mr. McInnis and thoroughly searched his 
home.
<P>
	As you can see, some serious accusations have been made and 
too many questions remain unanswered. Even though the 
Sub-Committee on National Security will look into this issue, 
the Official Opposition remains convinced that only a royal 
commission of inquiry with a very wide mandate can inform 
Quebecers and Canadians on CSIS activities.

<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this 
issue. I am a bit surprised by the fascination of members of the 
Bloc with this case. They appear to be very disappointed that 
they were not the organization or the political party with which 
CSIS was involved. It seems to be a clear case of CSIS envy.
<P>
	The attitude of the Bloc must be questioned. The original 
motion shows an inclination to condemn the government for the 
refusal to initiate a royal commission on the illegal activities of 
CSIS rather than the allegation. I think the Bloc gets ahead of 
itself in this particular matter.
<P>
	I have often listened to the Bloc accuse the Reform Party of 
using wild west justice and of being awfully tough on crime, but 
at least we believe people are innocent until they are proven 
guilty. The Bloc seems already to be assuming the guilt of CSIS 
before in fact it has been proven as such.
<P>
	There are a number of allegations out there and I have made 
more than a few of them myself, but I am not aware at this time 
of any evidence that CSIS was involved in illegal activities.
<P>
	There is a significant amount of evidence however that 
someone was involved in wrongdoing. But was it CSIS that was 
responsible for this wrongdoing, or was it Grant Bristow who 
was responsible, or was it the previous government?
<P>
	How can the Bloc accuse CSIS of committing illegal 
activities when the investigations are presently being 
conducted? I am not the biggest fan of the Security Intelligence 
Review Committee and that is quite obvious. I am prepared to 
give them the benefit of the doubt until the report is tabled.
<P>
	SIRC is actively investigating the role of CSIS in this issue. I 
know because I sat in on a SIRC interview. I know it is looking 
into it. I know it has spoken to a number of officials within the 
Reform Party. I know it has spoken to a number of people who 
have pertinent information about this case.
<P>
	There is no reason to doubt the efficiency of the SIRC 
investigation. However, once the investigation is over we will 
get the report. At that time the pressure will be on committee 
members as to whether or not their report is accurate and 
whether their report is enough. Their integrity will be at stake at 
that time.
<P>
	If there is evidence of wrongdoing by the previous 
government, will the Conservative members of SIRC 
enthusiastically pursue this information in their report? As the 
saying goes, only time will tell. I am encourage, however, that 
SIRC members have said they want the report to be as public as 
possible.
<P>
	I am still concerned about what definition SIRC uses for 
national security and the reasons for national security. I will 
explain why I am concerned. On May 10, SIRC appeared before 
the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs. When 
discussing the role of CSIS in technology transfer it mentioned 
it was limited to eight key sectors. When asked to identify those 
eight key sectors, the response was: ``We are not at liberty to 
identify those eight key sectors''.
<P>
	Exactly one week earlier the director of CSIS, Mr. Ray Protti, 
had appeared before the same justice committee. He too chose to 
talk about technology transfer. He stated that the investigation 
was: ``in those high technology areas like aerospace, nuclear, 
biochemical and telecommunications''.
<P>
	Here is an example of where the director of the Canadian 
Security Intelligence Service was being more open than its 
review body. This certainly does not bode well for a truly open 
and public report. However we must give SIRC the opportunity 
to come up with the report. Its report will then go to the Solicitor 
General who I understand will determine what will be released.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	The Solicitor General has assured the House that it is his 
objective: ``to make as much as possible the report public''. He 
went on to state that he would seek legal advice to help him 
make up his mind on how much he could make public.
<P>
	I would like to give him a little advice now. Everything should 
be released except the information about CSIS sources other 
than Grant Bristow. There is no reason why the entire issue 
cannot be discussed openly.
<P>
	While no one has ever accused members of the Heritage Front 
of being Rhodes Scholars, it is safe to assume even they have 
figured out that CSIS was investigating them. Likewise I think it 
is a safe bet to assume they now think Grant Bristow was a 
source. There really is nothing left to hid. Why would we even 
try?
<P>
	If the SIRC report that the Solicitor General releases to the 
public is not complete then the credibility of CSIS, of SIRC, of 
the minister and of the government will all suffer. Yes, CSIS 
needs a certain amount of secrecy to operate efficiently, but it 
cannot operate without the confidence of the Canadian people.
<P>
	The release of the report is all about confidence. If it is 
thorough and completely public, confidence in CSIS will be 
there even if CSIS is guilty of some minor indiscretions. 
However, if the report is heavily censored in the interest of 
national security there will be little public confidence even if 
CSIS is vindicated. Any evidence of any significant censoring of 
SIRC's report will automatically be viewed as a cover-up. If this 
is the case, not only will the Reform Party be joining the Bloc in 
a call for a royal commission; we will be leading the demand.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6303"> 6303 </A></B>
<P>
	The accusations that have been made are extremely serious, 
striking at the very heart of the democratic process. To us in 
Reform the most important question that must be answered is: 
Did the previous government use CSIS for partisan political 
purposes? At the very least we have a Conservative Solicitor 
General who was aware of the efforts of the Heritage Front to 
infiltrate the Reform Party and he chose not to advise the 
Reform Party of such.
<P>
	Some may ask if he should have. I asked somebody who 
should know. I asked Jean-Jacques Blais, a former Liberal 
Solicitor General and one of the first members of SIRC. Mr. 
Blais replied that if he had the information when he was 
Solicitor General he would have notified someone in the Reform 
Party. When asked why Mr. Lewis did not, Mr. Blais said he 
could not answer for the previous government.
<P>
	It will be interesting when the former Solicitor General 
appears before the subcommittee on national security in October 
to answer this question himself. However there are questions 
that CSIS must answer itself.
<P>
	Who made the final decision permitting Bristow to attend the 
Reform Party meetings? I cannot imagine the source handler 
himself making this type of decision. Just the mere fact that 
Bristow, publicly known to be a member of a white supremacist 
neo-Nazi organization, showed up at a Reform Party rally had a 
detrimental effect on the party. CSIS officials must have known 
that his mere presence could have a negative effect on the party.
<P>
	Since he would not have been sent there without high level 
approval, we need to know who approved his attendance and 
why. We need to know why Grant Bristow urged Heritage Front 
members to take out Reform Party memberships. We need to 
know why Grant Bristow even paid the $10 membership fee for 
some of these Heritage Front members. We need to know why 
Grant Bristow was so intent on getting Heritage Front members 
into the Reform Party when he refused to take out a membership 
himself.
<P>
<B>(1100 ) </B>
<P>
	We also need to know if any of this had to do with Bristow's 
allegiance to the Progressive Conservative Party as indicated by 
his work on the Hon. Otto Jelinek's 1988 campaign.
<P>
	These are the types of answers that we are expecting in the 
SIRC report and we will not be satisfied unless these questions 
are definitively answered. We will also want the answers to 
some questions like why did Wolfgang Droege frequently show 
up at Reform Party meetings after he had been expelled from the 
party? Why did he just come and sit at these meetings without 
trying to say anything, without trying to distribute any of his 
literature and without trying to make any contacts with people in 
the crowd? Why did he usually have a local Toronto television 
crew there to film him sitting in the audience at these Reform 
Party meetings? Most important, why  did Wolfgang Droege 
appear to have some money on him when he was attending all of 
these meetings?
<P>
	Let us not stop with Bristow or Droege. Less than two weeks 
ago another Heritage Front member, Max French, announced 
that he was running for mayor of Scarborough. At his press 
conference he proudly announced he was a member of both the 
Heritage Front and the Reform Party; a proud member of the 
Heritage Front, yes, but he certainly was not a proud member of 
the Reform Party.
<P>
	After the expulsion of other Heritage Front members from the 
Reform Party, Max French stated that Reformers were race 
traitors and would be lined up against the wall with the rest of 
them when the revolution came. He does not sound like an 
enthusiastic member of any party when those kinds of 
statements are made. Why did he keep his Reform membership?
<P>
	It is answers to these questions that SIRC must provide. The 
Solicitor General must release these answers if it is to maintain 
any credibility.
<P>
	I mentioned earlier that what is at stake here is the entire 
democratic system. Let me explain to the House why I say that. I 
have talked to a number of Reform candidates from southern 
Ontario. They advised that they had great difficulty overcoming 
the smear campaign that Reformers were racist. This campaign 
was led by the Conservative Party. In four ridings, none of which 
had a sitting Liberal MP, the Reform Party finished second by 
less than 5,000 votes. If just 10 voters per poll in those ridings 
had voted Reform instead of Liberal but did not because they 
were worried about the racist smears we would be sitting in a 
very different House today.
<P>
	The consequences of the racist smear campaign on Reformers 
are enormous and questions must be answered. With regard to 
the investigation into CSIS, we are prepared to wait for SIRC to 
complete its investigations and to make its report. We are 
prepared to wait for this report to be filed with the minister. We 
are also prepared to wait until the minister makes his report 
public. However, what we are not prepared to do is to wait for a 
cover-up.
<P>
	If the SIRC report that is made public does not answer our 
questions we will then be more than happy to join with the 
member from Bellechasse in calling for a royal commission.
<P>
	There are a number of other issues that do not fall under 
SIRC's responsibilities. There are a number of other issues in 
this controversy that have to be brought to light. Those issues 
are the handling of documents by ministers' aides within the 
former Solicitor General's office, an antiquated Official Secrets 
Act and the way it is enforced. The way that government 
information is classified leaves a lot of room for discussion.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6304"> 6304 </A></B>
<P>
	These issues can and will be examined by the subcommittee 
on national security. While we have similar concerns as the 
Bloc about the political make-up of SIRC, the make-up of the 
subcommittee does reflect the current Parliament. It is the 
subcommittee on national security that should first deal with 
these issues of classifying information, of handling high 
security documents and of reviewing the Official Secrets Act.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	If the subcommittee cannot resolve these issues in this House 
then another royal commission into Canada's security 
intelligence service would be warranted.
<P>
	First this House must make every effort to get to the bottom of 
this to avert the additional cost to the Canadian taxpayers of a 
royal commission. We have the vehicles in place. We have CSIS 
doing an internal investigation. We have SIRC doing a watchdog 
report and we have the national security subcommittee to 
investigate it.
<P>
	What we do need is to have the will to be fully accountable to 
the Canadian people, for only in being fully accountable will we 
maintain the support and the confidence of the Canadian people 
in the job that we are trying to do.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Madam 
Speaker, there are problems, to say the least, with the Bloc's 
motion.
<P>
	One of these problems has been identified by the Bloc itself 
when the proposer of the motion conceded there was the 
unfortunate absence in it of a key word, allegation. The motion 
originally spoke about illegal activities of CSIS as if it had been 
proven that such activities had in fact occurred.
<P>
	As I have said in this House and outside the House the many 
allegations made recently about CSIS activities are so far just 
that, allegations. By the way, it is important to stress that these 
allegations relate to a period well before this government took 
office and before I assumed the responsibilities of Solicitor 
General.
<P>
	To conclude that CSIS acted illegally requires analysis and 
conclusions based on solid evidence, that is based on definite 
facts, related to the legal framework created by this Parliament 
for the operations of CSIS and other relevant laws as well.
<P>
	That is why I believe that Canadians should await the 
conclusion of the work, the investigation of the Security 
Intelligence Review Committee, into what I repeat are so far 
only allegations.
<P>
	The requirement for the creation of the Security Intelligence 
Review Committee, SIRC, when Parliament passed the 
legislation creating the Canadian Security Intelligence Service 
in 1984 was designed to provide Parliament, Canadians 
generally and the Solicitor General with an independent review 
of CSIS activities.
<P>
	This body has over the years provided important insight and 
analysis for ministers, Parliament and the public regarding the 
operations of CSIS and has made recommendations to ensure 
that CSIS continues to operate as Parliament intended when it 
adopted the CSIS act.
<P>
	A reading of successive SIRC reports over the years, and I am 
talking about reports available to the public, shows that the 
SIRC as a permanent body at arm's length both from CSIS and 
the government has found areas for improvement since CSIS 
was created over 10 years ago. It has also found reason to 
confirm the value of the work of CSIS in the interests of all 
Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1110 ) </B>
<P>
	The point is that the SIRC was created exactly for the task that 
the Official Opposition in its motion says we need a royal 
commission to perform.
<P>
	The SIRC exists to provide the review of all CSIS duties and 
functions. More specifically, under section 54 of the act the 
SIRC can investigate any matter that relates to the performance 
by CSIS of its duties and functions, and then provide the 
Solicitor General with a special report of this investigation.
<P>
	A review of any such matter and the production of a special 
report is precisely what the SIRC has undertaken to do in 
response to the recent allegations. It has also stated that it 
intends to have a report as soon as possible. It has said that it 
intends to have a report available, in other words in the coming 
month of October.
<P>
	SIRC has built up a body of expertise and experience that I 
think will prove extremely valuable to this present 
investigation.
<P>
	The Official Opposition in its motion calls for the creation of 
a royal commission. What is a royal commission? It is an 
individual or a group of individuals independent of government, 
appointed by order in council, that is by the cabinet, with wide 
powers to look into a matter or matters of public concern.
<P>
	The Security Intelligence Review Committee is a body of 
individuals appointed by order in council, by the cabinet, under 
the CSIS legislation to look into and report on an important 
matter or matters involving the activities of CSIS.
<P>
	Like an ordinary royal commission it is independent of 
government. It is independent and at arm's length from CSIS 
and the minister. It has wide powers to carry out its mandate. 
That is why I say that in my view it is in effect like a permanent 
royal commission with the mandate of keeping under review the 
activities of CSIS and carrying out special inquiries into these 
activities, either of its own accord or at the request of the 
minister.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6305"> 6305 </A></B>
<P>
	We have in effect already in place what the Bloc is calling 
for in its motion. The spokesperson for the Reform Party made 
the important point that since CSIS is already carrying out this 
work, there is no need for the creation of another body that, 
looking at what the history of royal commissions indicates, 
would involve considerable additional expense for the taxpayer.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Parliament created SIRC precisely to ensure that so-called 
wrongdoings such as the ones which are being raised in this 
House today undergo objective investigation.
<P>
	Moreover, SIRC was given important statutory powers to 
carry out its mandate. SIRC is authorized to obtain from CSIS 
all necessary information to fulfil its responsibilities, including 
documents, reports and explanations. Obviously, SIRC has the 
abilities and the powers required to investigate the allegations 
being made.
<P>
	The Official Opposition was unable to prove that we should 
set up another review agency to do exactly what SIRC is 
authorized and able to do.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As I have said, it is my intention, my objective, to make as 
much of the CSIS report into the recent allegations as public as 
possible, subject of course to the requirements of any relevant 
legislation. In fact if the legislation permits me to do so I 
certainly would like to make the entire report public. Mind you 
the spokesperson for the Official Opposition herself has pointed 
out there may be some justifiable reasons for some of a report of 
this nature not to be made public and her views should be taken 
into account.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	I believe the SIRC investigation and the preparation of its 
report should continue. While it should take the time it needs to 
do the job properly, as I have said SIRC has already indicated it 
wants to complete that work as soon as possible. It expects to 
have a report available in October.
<P>
	I should also mention that the CSIS act provides for an 
Inspector General to report to the minister about CSIS. The 
Inspector General has been quoted publicly as saying that he 
himself is undertaking reviews with regard to policies and 
procedures governing the use of human sources by CSIS and the 
handling of CSIS documents. These reports will be another 
valuable source of information and analysis for me to use as a 
basis for seeing if action should be taken with regard to what has 
been alleged over the past weeks and months.
<P>
	I want to stress as I have done before that I will not hesitate to 
have corrective action taken where such action is in fact 
necessary on the basis of real proof that there are definite 
problems to be corrected with regard to the work of CSIS. 
However, I do not think it is fair or reasonable to make 
judgments in advance, as the Bloc has done in its motion, as to 
the value or the quality of the  work of SIRC in this matter before 
that work is even completed.
<P>
	To conclude, I submit that what the Bloc's motion calls for is 
not in fact necessary since Parliament in passing the law 
creating a framework for the operation of CSIS created an 
oversight mechanism for it. This involved the creation of SIRC, 
which I have said I look on as being very much like a permanent 
royal commission with a specific mandate for the ongoing 
review of the work of CSIS.
<P>
	I believe we should allow this body to complete its work on 
the recent allegations. Then we should make use of the report 
which as I have said I intend to make public as much as is 
possible in the light of the requirements of the relevant 
legislation. Then decisions can be made on what action may be 
necessary to take in the light of definite proof, if there is any, 
with respect to problems regarding the work of CSIS.
<P>
	However I submit that at this time the motion presented by the 
Bloc calls for action that is not necessary. It duplicates the work 
of a body created by Parliament which is like a royal 
commission. We should allow SIRC to complete its work so that 
its report can be completed and we can have access to it and take 
any action necessitated by that report.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I was pleased to hear the hon. Solicitor General 
acknowledge that he will take into consideration my comments 
about how much of the report should be made public. I hope he 
notes that the only exclusions I made were the names of 
additional sources other than Grant Bristow. I feel all else 
should be made public.
<P>
	My concern is that some of the legislation he may be looking 
at to see how much flexibility he has is outdated. I would like 
some assurance from the hon. minister that he will use some 
flexibility in the interpretation of these outdated pieces of 
legislation so that he is not restricted and bound by 
classifications of material that do not apply in this case.
<P>
	I would like some assurance from the hon. minister that he 
will be open minded in the interpretation of this legislation to 
allow a more open process.
<P>
<B>(1120 ) </B>
<P>
	While I have the opportunity I would also like to ask for the 
minister's assurance that he will support the efforts of the 
subcommittee on national security to further investigate this 
issue beyond that which SIRC can do. I hope the minister will 
give full co-operation to and persuade government members of 
this House to support the subcommittee in its efforts to get to the 
bottom of this.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Madam Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member's 
comments. I want to make clear that the legal advice I will seek 
cannot be limited to those comments, no matter how useful or 
well-intended.
<P>
	The hon. member says that certain legislation is outdated. I 
suppose she is talking about the Official Secrets Act. That may 
be the case but since that legislation is passed by Parliament I 
cannot ignore it, whatever my personal views about the 
relevance of the legislation today.
<P>
	That is why I have to seek appropriate legal advice from law 
officers of the crown with respect to how far I can go in releasing 
the SIRC report and with respect to responding to any relevant 
legislation. I want to be very open minded and forthcoming, but 
as I said I am not in a position to ignore the relevant laws on this 
matter as adopted by Parliament.
<P>
	Certainly the work of the subcommittee can be very useful. I 
cannot say what the committee should be doing but perhaps at 
some point it may want to carry out a review of the relevance of 
the current provisions of the Official Secrets Act.
<P>
	However, all of us in this House are still bound by the relevant 
legislation on this matter which has been passed by this House 
and Parliament as a whole. All of us have to take that into 
account in our activities.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I think the Solicitor General does not understand the 
object of the request made by the Official Opposition. The 
request for a royal commission of inquiry in this case is not just 
a whim.
<P>
	If you look back over past events, you see that so far we have 
had the McDonald Commission and the MacKenzie 
Commission, which were both Royal Commissions of Inquiry. 
Meanwhile, some joint committees have examined the issue of 
national security. But the only reports Parliament has followed 
up on are those of the McDonald and the MacKenzie Royal 
Commissions. Parliament has always ignored the reports tabled 
by the joint committees, except to implement two or three minor 
and watered-down recommendations to amend the legislation.
<P>
	A royal commission of inquiry would help us to clarify the 
whole situation and might even prove to be in the interest of the 
Canadian Security Intelligence Service, which is increasingly 
losing its credibility in the mind of the Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	As Solicitor General, you seem to trust SIRC completely. 
Then, tell me why SIRC is not aware of the allegations recently 
published in the newspapers, as you put it? Because these 
allegations relate to events which happened during 1990 and 
1991. We are now in 1994-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Order. I am sorry to 
interrupt the hon. member, but he undoubtedly knows that 
questions must be put to the Chair. Members cannot  directly ask 
questions to the minister concerned. The minister may answer 
the question.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Madam Speaker, the McDonald royal commission 
was created to do its work at a time when there was no equivalent 
of the Security Intelligence Review Committee. The security 
service of the RCMP did not operate within a specific legal 
framework as does the Canadian Security Intelligence Service 
and there was no mechanism for oversight or review. At that 
time something had to be set up to carry out the kind of work that 
SIRC is now mandated to do under the relevant legislation. It 
was a very different situation.
<P>
	Now we have a civilian security service that was created 
specifically by Parliament and which has a specific mandate and 
authority. It has limitations. For example it cannot look into 
matters involving lawful dissent; it cannot look into lawful 
advocacy, protest or dissent. This is clearly set out in the law.
<P>
<B>(1125 ) </B>
<P>
	We are dealing with a very different situation today. The 
experience of the McDonald commission is not relevant. As I 
said, it related to a time when there was no civilian security 
service operating in a specific legal framework with an 
oversight system as we have now.
<P>
	Finally, the hon. member asked me whether SIRC was seized 
with certain allegations. Since SIRC is a body independent from 
me, I am not in a position to comment.
<P>
	I conclude by saying I am continuously amazed by the interest 
of Bloc members in anything with the word royal connected to it 
and in having a royal body set up. Perhaps they should check 
with Mr. Parizeau who could possibly be very upset to see the 
interest of the Bloc in this House in relying on and calling for a 
royal commission.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am very pleased to speak on the motion put forward 
by the Bloc Quebecois today because I think that it is imperative 
that we have such a debate. The question we must ask ourselves 
is why we are now requesting a royal commission of inquiry on 
the activities of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service.
<P>
	I use the term royal commission of inquiry not because I am a 
royalist, but because I have to use the tools made available to us 
by this Parliament. Moreover, I would like you, Madam 
Speaker, to assure the Solicitor General that in an independent 
Quebec, we will not call such a body a royal commission of 
inquiry, but rather a state commission, a commission of inquiry 
of the sovereign state of Quebec.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6307"> 6307 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Right on!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> That being said, it may be necessary to 
look at the origin of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service 
Act to be able to understand the whole problem. You will see that 
it goes back to the commission of inquiry concerning certain 
activities of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, better known 
as the McDonald Commission, which published its report in 
1981. The commission had been established in 1977 in the wake 
of a series of illegal acts and practices by the former security 
service of the RCMP.
<P>
	The McDonald Commission had the mandate to look into 
illegal activities on the part of a supposedly reputable institution 
respected by the majority of English Canadians, and I am talking 
about the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, better known under 
the acronym RCMP. It is important to go back to the 70s to really 
understand the history of the secret service in Canada, but first, 
let us look at the act by which the Canadian secret service was 
created.
<P>
	In 1966, the RCMP became the responsibility of the Solicitor 
General when it was given the status of a government 
department. Before that, the police force was under the authority 
of the Minister of Justice. The reorganization that took place in 
1970 was the result of another royal commission of inquiry, the 
MacKenzie Commission, which published its report in 1969. 
The commission's main recommendation was to create a 
civilian security service. The commission considered it 
inappropriate to leave security functions to the ordinary police 
services, and the special operations branch did not have the 
complexity or the analysis expertise deemed necessary to play 
its role in security matters.
<P>
	It also recommended that a bill be passed to authorize 
investigation methods like undercover operations, and to 
improve the security screening process, including the addition 
of an appeal procedure. Accordingly, a security intelligence 
service was established under a civilian director. Until then, you 
could tell RCMP agents by their red uniform, but security agents 
became less easily identifiable and then, I am sure you agree, 
unrecognizable.
<P>
	Let us go back to the 1970s period when things went awry. 
Uniformed officers, unlike civilians, all had positions of power. 
At the end of the 1970s, for example, not a single civilian had a 
position above that of an officer in a planning or operations 
sub-branch. RCMP employees, therefore, wielded absolute 
power. Not only did they have police powers, but they were also 
had considerable leeway with the structure. Civilians knew 
almost nothing of what was going on in that section of the 
RCMP.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	Ironically, the same thing is happening in 1994 with the 
Canadian Security Intelligence Service, but this time, 
Parliament itself and the general public in Canada and Quebec 
are kept in the dark concerning our intelligence  service. 
Questions are asked, but there are no real answers. The fact that 
elected representatives could not get near or watch the RCMP in 
those days led to wrongdoings. And believe me, there were a lot 
of wrongdoings.
<P>
	The October crisis stunned everybody, both the Quebec 
population and the government. The then Prime Minister, Mr. 
Trudeau, did not know, when he invoked the War Measures Act, 
that he was unleashing a mad dog. I hope, and I would like to 
believe, that he was not aware of that.
<P>
	The government realized that it knew very little about the 
sovereignty philosophy in Quebec. Therefore, it asked the 
RCMP to adopt an active strategy on that issue and to get all the 
information it could on the bad separatists.
<P>
	In several cases and in various contexts, members of the 
security service committed extremely illegal acts and I think it 
is worth mentioning again some of the actions taken by the 
RCMP during those days. They set fire to a barn in order to 
prevent the so-called separatists or sovereignists from holding a 
meeting. They broke into the offices of a leftist news agency in 
Montreal, stole and destroyed files, broke into the offices of the 
Parti Quebecois, a legitimate political party, and even stole lists 
of members of that democratically recognized party.
<P>
	When I think about those days, I still shiver with rage. It is a 
pitiful page in the history of Canada, especially when you see 
that one of the people involved, Mr. Normand Chamberland, 
who was accused of stealing dynamite at the time, has been 
promoted within the Canadian Security Intelligence Service and 
is now the Deputy Commissioner for Quebec, no less.
<P>
	It seems that those responsible for enforcing the law can break 
it once in a while and even get rewarded for it. It is also 
important to note that the RCMP did not commit that kind of 
abuse only in the 1970s and only against separatists. The 
McDonald Commission indicated that other illegal activities 
had occurred, such as opening of mail, illegal access to 
supposedly confidential government information, planned 
prostitution, blackmail and other actions of that type which had 
been taking place for a long time with regard to various aspects 
of national security, from spying and counter-intelligence to 
subversion.
<P>
	The main recommendation of the McDonald Report 
advocated the creation of a totally independent intelligence 
service of a civil nature and it did so for the same reasons as the 
MacKenzie Commission did, that is the need to restructure the 
agency with a view to collecting and analyzing data instead of 
using mainly deterrence and repression. Therefore, the mandate 
of the proposed new agency would be defined by legislation and 
the law would state clearly which threats to Canada's security 
the agency would be authorized to investigate. The definition 
would cover four areas: first, espionage and sabotage; second, 
foreign interference; third, political  violence and terrorism; and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6308"> 6308 </A></B>
<P>
finally, subversive activities aimed at destroying the democratic 
system.
<P>
	The report also recommended that the new agency be 
prohibited from investigating legitimate advocacy, protest or 
dissent, and that it not have the power to implement security 
measures.
<P>
	All this led to the McDonald report published in 1981. The 
government indicated that it would accept the principal 
recommendation to create a civilian security intelligence 
service. Subsequently, a special transition group was set up at 
the Department of the Solicitor General to prepare legislation to 
that end.
<P>
	In 1983, Bill C-157 was tabled in the House of Commons to 
create the Canadian Security Intelligence Service or CSIS, 
along the lines recommended by the McDonald Commission but 
with some major changes and additions.
<P>
	As a result of severe criticism from the public that the 
service's mandate was too broad, the bill died on the Order 
Paper. During the second session of the 32nd Parliament, a new 
bill was tabled in the House. This was Bill C-9 which, for all 
intents and purposes, incorporated all the recommendations of 
the commission. Parliament adopted the bill, with very few 
changes, in 1984.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	The legislation was intended to restrict the activities of the 
Canadian Security Intelligence Service and create monitoring 
mechanisms to ensure that the Canadian Security Intelligence 
Service did not exceed its mandate.
<P>
	Central to the bill is the definition of the expression ``threats 
to the security of Canada,'' which determines the general 
parameters of CSIS. The definition also specifies that lawful 
advocacy, protest or dissent are not included. If we consider this 
definition and the allegations published in the media, especially 
about spying on a democratically recognized party-we have 
seen that happen before-and investigating the CBC and certain 
leaders of the Canadian Jewish Congress, there are some very 
real problems.
<P>
	CSIS members seem to have trouble with the definition of 
lawful advocacy. In any case, if the past is any indication of what 
the future holds, we can assume that members of CSIS have the 
same attitude as the former RCMP intelligence section, which 
does not augur well for the Canadian Security Intelligence 
Service. We have the right to know, and we have the right to call 
for a royal commission of inquiry.
<P>
	As far as the basic duties of the service are concerned, these 
are set forth in section 12: to collect by investigation, and 
analyse and retain, information and intelligence respecting 
threats to security. According to section 13 of the Act, the 
Canadian Security Intelligence Service may provide security 
assessments on future government employees. Finally, under 
section 16, CSIS may assist in the collection of information 
relating to defence and national affairs, by investigating and  
conducting surveillance of any persons, other than Canadian 
citizens or permanent residents.
<P>
	As we consider the history of intelligence services in Canada 
and their questionable activities, which always raise a number 
of questions in my mind and in the minds of many taxpayers in 
Canada and Quebec, there is one question we have every right to 
ask: ``Who watches the intelligence agency that is watching 
us?''
<P>
	One would expect that in 1994, our institutions would be 
monitored by people elected through the democratic process as 
the legitimate representatives of the present Parliament of 
Canada. Not at all, that is not the way it works in Canada, in 
1994. Legislation was enacted to establish the office of the 
Inspector General and the Security Intelligence Review 
Committee, better known by its acronym, SIRC, as we said 
earlier.
<P>
	The Inspector General is appointed by the Governor in 
Council and his duties are to review the operational activities of 
CSIS and to report to the Solicitor General and SIRC, as well as 
to monitor the legality and relevance of these activities.
<P>
	SIRC is made up of five members maximum, chosen from 
Privy Council members, appointed by the Governor in Council 
after consultation between the Prime Minister and the leaders of 
recognized opposition parties in the House of commons. We will 
see that it is not always the case. Its role is to review CSIS 
operations and to report to the minister and Parliament.
<P>
	When it comes to reporting to Parliament, MPs are certainly 
not overwhelmed with information. As parliamentarians we 
know virtually nothing of what goes on within the Canadian 
Security Intelligence Service. This department spends millions 
of dollars, but Parliament, the supreme authority, knows almost 
nothing.
<P>
	Those who watch over CSIS were never elected to the job. 
They are political appointees, and MPs are deliberately 
excluded.
<P>
	Do you think I am reassured by the fact that the deeds, or 
alleged acts, committed under the Conservative government are 
being investigated by a group with a Conservative majority? 
Certainly not, it rather worries me. Who are these valiant 
watchdogs, that some journalists humorously call lapdogs? 
Three of them are personal friends of the former Prime Minister 
of Canada, and very, very close to the Conservative Party. 
Another comes from the ranks of the Liberal Party of Canada; he 
is a former president of the party. You know him, he is the 
lawyer who is getting $250,000 to do some kind of inquiry with 
some native representatives. As a hobby, he sits on the review 
committee. Quite a review he must do.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6309"> 6309 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	The last member was appointed from among the ranks of the 
NDP. Ever since I have been sitting on the Standing Committee 
on Justice and Legal Affairs and on the Sub-Committee on 
National Security-I have not seen the latter yet and I wonder 
whether it is really interested in meeting with us or even in doing 
its job-I have doubts about the kind of report all of them will be 
able to produce.
<P>
	Where are the members representing the current Official 
Opposition? Where is the member supposed to represent the 
other opposition party in this House? They are nowhere to be 
found. We are asked to trust five individuals, appointed by our 
predecessors, who are looking into extremely important 
activities which have an impact on their own political party.
<P>
	The main objective in creating CSIS was probably to have 
some control or to check into allegations but in reality this has 
not happened.
<P>
	As crazy as it may seem, when the Canadian Security 
Intelligence Service was in the planning stages, some members 
and certain opposition parties said that there was no need to 
create a civilian body and that all that was needed was a piece of 
legislation clearly setting out the RCMP's frame of reference so 
that it would not go overboard.
<P>
	For someone from Quebec who has lived through the 1970s, 
which were a turning point in the history of the province, this 
seems rather strange. I am not referring to myself as I was still 
quite young in those days. It is somewhat ridiculous to trust this 
agency once more, but again some people thought that the 
RCMP could still do the job.
<P>
	The only thing I find reassuring is that when the Canadian 
Security Intelligence Service was created, there were those who 
thought that its mandate was too broad. I could not agree more 
with them and history has proven them right.
<P>
	Similarly, the definition of the word ``threat'' is very 
controversial. And again I agree with those who thought at the 
time that it was so vague that it could encompass a variety of 
activities not even closely related to real security. Current 
events have borne this out.
<P>
	The government is of the opinion that the definition should be 
interpreted in the context of, on one hand, the provisions 
protecting legitimate dissidence and limiting the agency's 
authority to what is strictly necessary and, on the other, the new 
monitoring and surveillance system. According to the 
government, within such a context, the definition is a reasonable 
one.
<P>
	When I look more closely at the investigative power of SIRC 
and its access to information, I get scared. I get very, very 
scared.
<P>
	Another concern of mine is the range of the SIRC mandate 
that allows it to use any investigation technique. The two most 
serious issues have to do with how this organization is being 
monitored: first, the office of the Inspector General must have 
access to information, and second, so must SIRC.
<P>
	We must acknowledge that, before the Sub-Committee on 
National Security, I was told that SIRC has access to every 
document possible. Indeed, it has access to all this 
documentation, but only if the Canadian Security Intelligence 
Service agrees to hand it out. And that is not how things work out 
in reality.
<P>
	SIRC does not have access to Cabinet documents, either. Yet, 
as we have learned recently, an assistant of a former Solicitor 
General of Canada can walk out with two cases of documents, 
with no questions asked, while SIRC is not even aware of the 
existence of such documentation. This really belongs in the 
realm of fiction.
<P>
	Why can we not grant this investigative power to people who 
have a vested interest in the truth and are able to reassure the 
public? In fact, this issue was raised when Bill C-157 was 
debated. We examined the possibility of implementing some 
kind of parliamentary review, as recommended by the 
McDonald Commission. At the time, both Opposition parties 
and some government members supported the creation of a 
special Parliamentary committee which would have had access 
to information regarding CSIS to ensure that it does not overstep 
its mandate.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, you are indicating that my time is almost up, 
yet I could go on and on.
<P>
	I want the government to know that there is no way we can get 
definite answers to our questions if we leave it to SIRC. I have 
sat and I still sit on the Sub-Committee on National Security. 
When an elected member of Parliament, a legitimate 
representative of the people is told by witnesses that they do not 
have to answer either yes or no, we have a problem. A very 
serious problem indeed. The system is sick. The Canadian 
Security Intelligence Service has become a monster that no one 
can control, not even Parliamentarians, and this is totally 
unacceptable in 1994.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	That is why only a royal commission of inquiry can get to the 
bottom of this issue. Taxpayers would then get satisfactory 
answers to questions they have been asking ever since the 
creation of CSIS in 1984.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General): </B>Madam Speaker, I did indeed listen carefully to the 
comments made by my hon. colleague from the Opposition. 
First, the hon. member referred to events that occurred in 1970, 
which I think is a rather sensitive period, but we are not here to 
go through that again, since this was already covered by the 
McDonald Commission, which led to the creation of SIRC and 
CSIS.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6310"> 6310 </A></B>
<P>
	Moreover, I find rather strange that when abuses are 
discussed, those which happened in the 1950s are never 
mentioned. The hon. member did not mention the Padlock Act 
passed by the Union Nationale. They went after the Asbestos 
workers in 1949. They went after my constituents in 
Murdochville. I find it passing strange that nothing is said about 
abuses done either at the federal level or especially at the 
provincial level.
<P>
	I am not here to criticize the province or the country, but I 
would like nevertheless to indicate to the hon. member that 
SIRC was created to ensure the presence of a civilian body 
operating at arms length both from CSIS and the government 
itself. We are looking forward to the report SIRC should present 
in the next few weeks, and I am sure it will be to everyone's 
satisfaction, or at least I hope so. We will see what we will be 
able to discuss here with the Opposition members.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Madam Speaker, I think that the hon. 
member did not ask a direct question but made some 
questionable allegations, which is even worse.
<P>
	He said that I referred to the events of 1970. Yes, I did. I do not 
think that we have to go back to 1950 to dig up provincial 
problems, when the RCMP is exclusively under federal 
jurisdiction. We are here to prevent more overlapping, to see 
that the present Constitution and set-up are respected. Later on, 
when Quebec has decided on its future, it will be different story.
<P>
	I must say to the hon. member that if we consider what 
happened in the 1970s and the information released by the CBC 
on CSIS's investigation of some members of the Jewish 
Congress in Toronto, the possibility that CSIS financed or 
helped found the Heritage Front, the employment of Bristow, a 
member of Heritage Front, as a bodyguard of the leader of a 
recognized party, I think that we can make comparisons between 
1970 and 1994. There are still reasons today to demand a royal 
commission of inquiry, just as there were when the McDonald 
Commission started its hearings in 1977. All we want is to get 
answers to the questions we have been asking since that time. 
We never got any answers.
<P>
	Just by looking at the Harlequin reports published once a year 
by the SIRC for the past two or three years, it is obvious that we 
will not be able to get answers even though we, as 
parliamentarians, were democratically elected by the people of 
Canada to oversee and monitor public expenditures. These little 
documents published by the SIRC from time to time will not 
shed much light on these activities. We need a royal commission 
of inquiry and I think we have enough allegations to warrant the 
setting up of such a commission. If there is nothing serious in 
these allegations, why is the Inspector General of the Canadian 
Security Intelligence Service looking into the matter? Why is 
the SIRC looking into the matter and why were its people so 
nervous when they approved before the Sub-Committee on 
National Security of which I am a member?
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	Why is it that parliamentarians felt the need to create this 
Sub-Committee on National Security to study these 
allegations? Because they had good grounds for doing so. But, 
despite all that, we will not get any answers unless we set up a 
royal commission of inquiry to look into the matter. Then our 
questions would be answered.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I would like to ask my hon. colleague from the 
Bloc why he is not prepared to give SIRC an opportunity to 
prove it is incompetent of coming up with a report that is 
satisfactory to us.
<P>
	The hon. member and probably most other members in the 
House know how I feel about the make-up of the Security 
Intelligence Review Committee. It is not a make-up of which I 
approve. It is not a process of which I approve. However I feel 
we should allow it to do its job and then judge whether or not the 
report is adequate and fulfils the needs of the Canadian public to 
know the facts.
<P>
	Why is the hon. member unprepared and unwilling to let SIRC 
complete the report, then sit in judgment and ask for a further 
commission to be established because the committee has not 
done its job rather than accusing it of not doing its job when it is 
not given the chance to do it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to 
answer that question from my hon. colleague whom I admire and 
for whom I have a liking since we once worked together. There is 
something else I admire about her, her naivety.
<P>
	When the SIRC came before the Sub-Committee on National 
Security, we could see that we would not get answers to our 
questions. To questions as simple as: ``On what date did Mr. 
So-and-So contact Mr. Such-and-Such?'' the Service 
member's answer was: ``I cannot answer you, Mr. 
Bellehumeur''.
<P>
	When I asked other questions on facts not related to national 
security, I was told: ``We cannot answer you, Mr. Bellehumeur. 
We will take note of that question and we will get an answer for 
you, but it will come from the Solicitor General of Canada, not 
from us''.
<P>
	What will we get from the SIRC? What answers will we get to 
our questions? Answers censored by the Solicitor General of 
Canada? That does not satisfy me. Nor does it satisfy the 
taxpayers I represent. We really need a royal commission of 
inquiry, where the principals will come face to face with us and 
will be compelled to give the commissioners answers to the 
questions we asked and to which we did not get answers from the 
SIRC.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General):</B> Madam Speaker, does the hon. member realize that 
the review committee can enter any office or public institution 
and visit all the premises, examine every document, voucher, 
or file in that office or institution? I get the impression the hon. 
member did not quite understand when the Solicitor General 
said the review committee has the same powers as a royal 
commission of inquiry.
<P>
	I do not see any purpose in having a royal commission. Since 
members opposite always complain about duplication, why 
should we have a royal commission? We already have a review 
committee, the SIRC. We all know that SIRC was created 
precisely to investigate allegations such as those made recently.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Madam Speaker, I thought that, after one 
year in Parliament, the hon. member would have lost some of the 
illusions he still seems to harbour.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</b> Madam Speaker, on a point of order. I object 
to that personal remark. I asked a question and I want to get 
an answer. Let us leave character out of this.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Order. The hon. member 
knows that no reference to another member's character should 
be made in this House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Madam Speaker, I apologize if I insulted 
the hon. member, but nevertheless, that is what I think.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I believe that the hon. 
member knows what he is saying, since his words are very well 
chosen. I ask him to withdraw them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur: </B>Which ones? He made two objections. 
Does he want me to withdraw the expression ``I think'' or the 
comments that I made on him?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I consider that the 
member has withdrawn his words.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> You know, Madam Speaker, the Opposition 
member is still a good devil. I rise today to speak on this motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur: </B>On a point of order, Madam Speaker. I 
believe that the member just attacked me by saying that I am a 
devil, whether a good or a bad one, but still a devil. I would ask 
the member to withdraw his words.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Does the parliamentary 
secretary withdraw his words?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</b> Madam Speaker, I did not use them 
pejoratively.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur: </B>I accept the hon. member's apologies.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</b> As I was saying, I rise today to speak on this 
motion which, as the solicitor general mentioned, involves a 
certain number of problems and misunderstandings. It 
seems essential to me that the members of this House 
understand and fully appreciate the complex and sensitively 
ordered system of checks and balances that is part of our 
national system of security intelligence.
<P>
	Also, that system is designed to ensure a balance between the 
protection of individual freedoms and the need to protect the 
Canadian public against threats to the security of their country. 
Most people will agree that we must protect Canada against 
threats to its security and that this protection requires a security 
intelligence agency.
<P>
	There is no doubt in my mind that Canada needs a security 
intelligence service, as all other industrialized countries do. Let 
us take for example the threat that terrorism involves. Canadian 
democracy is based on a climate of freedom and political 
objectives are met through open discussions, debates or other 
legitimate activities toward lawful advocacy.
<P>
	However, that climate, as well as public safety, is jeopardized 
when an individual or a group is trying to meet those political 
goals through violence or threat of violence.
<P>
	In the 1980s, terrorism became a major concern for safety and 
the government gave CSIS the mandate to gather, on a priority 
basis, security information on terrorism. Our first line of 
defence must be information.
<P>
	The other thing which is threatening us is espionage. Since the 
emergence of nation-states, espionage has become part of 
everyday life. Every nation is striving to improve its position 
within the international community. However, we have to admit 
that even if the political scene is better world-wide, some 
nations still resort to deceptive or clandestine activities for the 
purpose of enhancing their international position.
<P>
	Canada must protect itself against such threats, whether they 
take the form of traditional espionage or of any other means of 
illegally obtaining the technological know-how of this country.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	Canada must also be able to identify and to thwart steps taken 
by foreign countries or agents seeking to secretly influence or 
harass our ethnic communities. Again, we must protect those 
who have elected to settle in Canada and make it their new 
homeland.
<P>
	Here also, the gathering of good intelligence is at the very 
heart of our first line of defence. I am convinced that the CSIS 
Act is an efficient piece of legislation, enforced according to the 
wishes of Parliament set forth ten years ago. The CSIS Act 
provides a legislative framework likely to ensure the delicate 
balance between efficient national security and the respect of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6312"> 6312 </A></B>
<P>
individual rights and freedoms. The Canadian Security 
Intelligence  Service Act defines the mandate of CSIS and gives 
it the necessary powers to fulfill it.
<P>
	It provides a unique operational framework for CSIS. It 
defines the powers of the service and specifies its limits. These 
take the form of various control mechanisms: political controls, 
subject to ministerial accountability and responsibility; judicial 
controls and external controls by the Security Intelligence 
Review Committee, or SIRC.
<P>
	The act also provides a mechanism allowing any person or 
group of persons to complain about any aspect of CSIS 
activities. Furthermore, the Security Offences Act, which was 
passed at the same time as the CSIS Act, confirms the RCMP's 
responsibility concerning security offences, as well as its 
responsibility in preventing such offences.
<P>
	These two acts provide a legislative framework flexible 
enough to adapt efficiently to the circumstances of each case. 
Furthermore it should be emphasized that the political and 
judicial structure of these two acts is unique in the world. The 
government used policy directives to guide their interpretation 
and implementation.
<P>
	The main stakeholders in the Canadian security intelligence 
system made sure that the legislation was practical and efficient. 
The service has developed and follows a strict and satisfactory 
investigation procedure. Since 1984, the Inspector General and 
the Security Intelligence Review Committee have played their 
role in an orderly and strict manner.
<P>
	The Solicitor General relies a great deal on their work, 
especially on the reports of the Inspector General that enable 
him to make sure that the service is conforming to legislation 
and following departmental directives on orientations. The 
review committee's annual report that the Solicitor General 
tables in Parliament completes the annual cycle of public 
accountability.
<P>
	Finally, the RCMP and CSIS have established measures and 
developed mechanisms for co-operation. This is how the 
legislation works today. Solid legislation, detailed government 
instructions and an efficient internal administration are the 
elements which allow the service to fulfil the mandate it 
received from Parliament ten years ago.
<P>
	The government does not stop there. I wish to remind 
everyone that this government is constantly trying to find means 
to improve the quality of the service. As the minister 
responsible for CSIS the Solicitor General must make sure that 
in its daily operations the service maintains a fair balance 
between national security requirements and the rights and 
freedoms of Canadians. The minister does that by using his 
authority to approve and to give directions and also by relying 
on the reports of the Inspector General and the review 
committee.
<P>
	Therefore, his task is to exercise a ministerial control. He 
answers for the CSIS to cabinet and to Parliament. Two main 
processes allow the minister to fulfil that responsibility. The 
first one is his approval or concurring authority.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	In keeping with the Canadian Security Intelligence Service 
Act, the Solicitor General must personally approve all 
investigation warrant requests, all agreements concluded 
between CSIS and other organizations, departments, provinces 
and foreign countries, and all requests for data collection in 
Canada by CSIS on behalf of foreign countries.
<P>
	Now, let us examine the other act, passed in 1994, the Security 
Offences Act. This act confirms the RCMP's overriding 
responsibility in investigating certain security offences. 
Intelligence gathering, protection and enforcement are the three 
pillars of our security system.
<P>
	The RCMP and CSIS have complementary functions. Each 
service assumes a distinct role within the wider framework of 
our national security system. CSIS is responsible for gathering 
intelligence concerning threats to security and giving warning 
about such threats. The RCMP is responsible for investigating 
into offences, either planned or committed and, above all, for 
crime prevention.
<P>
	In order to facilitate CSIS's task, the CSIS Act contains 
detailed definitions of possible threats to the security of Canada.
<P>
	This enables CSIS to rapidly adapt to circumstances in our 
constantly evolving world and to ensuing threats, as was 
Parliament's wish ten years ago. For example, the CSIS Act has 
allowed this organization to adapt to political and economic 
upheavals in the world during the last ten years.
<P>
	Although areas of concern are not the same, we can still feel 
very strongly that hostile intelligence services threaten our 
national security. In matters of terrorism, new threats to the 
security of Canada have evolved as a consequence of foreign 
conflicts being unfortunately introduced into Canada. Terrorism 
is a scourge that spares no nation on Earth. Unfortunately it does 
not seem to be receding, quite the contrary.
<P>
	Ever since its creation in 1984, CSIS has been able to evolve 
considerably thanks to the flexibility provided by the act and to 
ministerial directives. The act continues to give us the necessary 
means to face any subversive action. Naturally, because of its 
very nature, a security intelligence service must remain secret. 
This is particularly necessary in some cases, when the right of 
someone to privacy is to be protected.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6313"> 6313 </A></B>
<P>
	Secrecy is also required to protect certain operational 
activities like staff distribution, modes of operation and sources 
of information. Everybody recognizes that secrecy as an end 
in itself does not serve anyone.
<P>
	I have touched on the kind of security intelligence system that 
Parliament wanted to meet the needs of democracy, and I have 
touched on some of the real threats that make such a system a 
necessity in a democracy.
<P>
	I am only echoing the words of the Solicitor General when I 
say that we do not need to set up a royal commission of inquiry, 
because we already have in place systems like the SIRC, that 
have the wide powers necessary to conduct an in-depth inquiry.
<P>
	Therefore, before deciding on anything, let us wait until the 
Security Intelligence Review Committee has completed its job 
and submitted its report to the Solicitor General. This should be 
done shortly. Once the report has been submitted, as 
parliamentarians we will be able to take the necessary steps.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I want to congratulate my colleague for his 
very enlightening speech. I also want to congratulate him on 
making his remarks entirely in French, from beginning to end, 
which is a first in this House for him.
<P>
	If I understood the member correctly, the Solicitor General 
rubber-stamps special mandates, and one must trust that 
everything is in order since the agency publishes a new annual 
report every year.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	I read the report made public in 1993. It is a ten-page 
document, with each page only half full to make room for some 
very interesting graphics. It is not with such a report, that would 
hardly meet grade 12 standards, that we are going to reassure the 
population regarding certain allegations.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois has never questioned the need for such an 
agency. I believe that any self-respecting nation ought to have 
this kind of agency; there is no doubt about that. The point we 
raised is that allegations were made and if the Solicitor General 
approves everything, this means that he knew that someone was 
spying on the Reform Party from within. This is intolerable.
<P>
	That is why, in case of allegations, one must go beyond the 
annual report. Do you know how difficult it is to get into CSIS? 
It takes about one hour to get all the doors unlocked. If they see 
you coming, they obviously have the time to put any file they do 
not want you to see in false-bottom drawers. There is no 
guarantee that an investigation can get all the facts. If something 
is secret, top secret, or top, top, top secret, obviously you will 
not find it lying on a table. It will be securely locked up in a file 
drawer nobody has access to.
<P>
	How can we guarantee that an investigation will get to the 
bottom of things? That is what we are wondering. This is the 
reason why we say that it is all nice and dandy to wait for the 
report, but the allegations are too serious. We are just about to 
enter very difficult times in Canada. We are no fools, but we 
want to make sure that what happened in 1970 will not happen 
again. We do not want to see history repeat itself. We want to go 
through this difficult transition as adults and in accordance with 
democratic principles, not with a top secret service which is 
going to plant bombs whenever it pleases.
<P>
	So I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Solicitor General 
how can he guarantee that we are protected from such an 
occurrence?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</b> Madam Speaker, first of all, the allegations 
made before CIRC about CSIS will be examined. This is not 
an annual report, but rather a report that will examine the 
issues and the allegations that have been made against the 
intelligence service by the opposition. I must conclude, 
however, that there are members on this side of the House 
who are on the sub-committee looking at allegations about 
our security intelligence service.
<P>
	I can also tell you that, in answer to the member for 
Rimouski-Témiscouata, one of the things we have recognized, 
particularly with respect to the CIRC and CSIS, is that it is 
unacceptable that such a group be asked to spy on a legitimate 
political party. I think that everyone in this House recognizes 
that this is not the goal of this government and that if it has 
already been done-I was not there then-but I can tell you this: 
I know these are difficult times, but I am nevertheless happy to 
hear that the hon. member recognizes the importance of having 
an intelligence service with a mandate to ensure Canada's 
integrity, particularly in light of the industrial and technological 
espionage that we see nowadays.
<P>
	I can assure the member that it is not the goal of the service to 
spy on political groups.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I would like to react to comments made by the 
hon. member from the Bloc who said that she is afraid these 
secrets are in hidden boxes, locked in drawers and cabinets. I 
think the reality is that these secret documents are passed around 
by staffers. They are taken home. They are left in open boxes in 
basements. We should be concerned about the lack of security of 
classified documents.
<P>
	My question for the Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada is this. Is the hon. member aware of how 
these documents are classified?
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6314"> 6314 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1215 ) </B>
<P>
	The hon. member made a comment that he does not want 
secrets for secret's sake. How are highly classified documents 
labelled as such? Does the hon. member know?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> Madam Speaker, actually I do not know and that 
is the idea of the inquest being held by SIRC. It is to look into 
these various allegations. The hon. member also brought 
forward before the committee a number of questions. I am told 
there are more than 130.
<P>
	I am sure that we will have to answer many of those questions 
and surely others put forward by the Bloc members as well as 
members on this side. I can assure the hon. member that I hope 
we will be able to answer a lot of them.
<P>
	Again, it will be up to the Solicitor General to make sure that 
the information made public will not undermine the national 
security interests of Canada. I am convinced that a lot of these 
questions will be answered to the satisfaction of the opposition.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford):</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
have a question for the hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Solicitor General. I listened carefully to his speech and I must 
tell you that it sounded to me like he had a lot of good to say 
about the previous administration. To listen to him, I wonder 
why he did not run for the Conservative Party in the last 
elections if everything was going so well.
<P>
	Considering that we have a democratic system and that 
nothing is more sacred than democracy in this country, in 
Canada and Quebec, does he not agree that it would be 
interesting from time to time to have a commission, whether 
royal or not-I say royal commission because that is how they 
are called in Canada<I>-to have a high-level commission 
investigate, especially when officials of the SIRC appearing 
before a sub-committee refuse to answer certain questions?</I>
<P>
	They did not answer all the questions. Would it not be time to 
have a commission investigate and shed light on this so that the 
people of Canada know exactly what is happening?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</b> Madam Speaker, unlike the hon. member's 
leader and Leader of the Opposition, I never ran for the 
Conservative Party. But I can you tell you this: for one thing, 
let us allow let the process to run its course.
<P>
	First of all, the SIRC was established specifically to answer 
questions raised by the member opposite as well as by interest 
groups. So, based on the facts or evidence submitted to us 
concerning the allegations made against CSIS, I trust we will be 
able to make an informed decision regarding this service. I think 
we should let the organization do its job. I am convinced that the 
hon. member opposite and our colleague from the Reform  Party 
will have ample opportunity to scrutinize the report in October.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Before resuming 
debate, I would like to read a quote from Beauchesne's sixth 
edition, citation 478. This morning a couple of times I hesitated 
to interrupt speakers but citation 478 states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The proceedings of a committee may not be referred to in debate before they 
have been laid upon the Table.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I would just ask hon. members to be aware of this rule.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard St-Laurent (Manicouagan):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I want to begin my speech with a brief historical overview. In 
1946, with the RCMP's increased responsibilities for security, 
the personnel assigned to security tasks as, for the first time, 
separated organizationally from the Investigations Directorate 
and grouped in the Special ``I'' Branch.
<P>
	In 1956, the Special ``I'' Branch was made a directorate 
within the RCMP, under the command of a deputy 
commissioner.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	In 1969, the Royal Commission on Security recommended the 
establishment of a civilian security agency. The government 
rejected this recommendation but announced its intention to 
give the Special ``I'' Branch a separate status and to increase its 
civilian personnel.
<P>
	Between 1971 and 1974, especially but not exclusively in 
Quebec, the security service mounted a series of operations, 
many of which were apparently illegal, in order to neutralize 
radical and separatist groups.
<P>
	On March 27, 1975, the federal Cabinet produced a directive 
governing the security service's activites; this directive 
remained secret until 1978.
<P>
	In 1976, a year later, Corporal Samson was tried following an 
incident unrelated to this affair, but revealed his participation in 
Operation Bricole in 1972. This operation involved breaking 
and entering and stealing files, especially on politics in Quebec.
<P>
	Various events occurred over the years, but let us go to 
November 29, 1984. The members of SIRC, the Security 
Intelligence Review Committee, were appointed. The chairman 
was Ronald Atkey, a former Conservative Cabinet minister, as if 
by chance.
<P>
	In February 1985, the federal government's budget estimates 
showed that CSIS, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, 
had a meagre budget of about $115 million; I say meagre 
because today its budget exceeds $200 million. This still 
represents, in the midst of an economic crisis, a considerable 
amount.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6315"> 6315 </A></B>
<P>
	Despite this huge amount coming from the pockets of 
Canadian and Quebec taxpayers, Parliament only plays a minor 
role in monitoring the review of CSIS activities. Even 
reviewing the budget only skims the surface as the CSIS budget 
amounts, in fact, to a single line in the 1994-95 Estimates. I 
know from experience that when Mr. Elcock, a senior director 
of CSIS, appeared before the justice committee I was on, we 
asked him, to no avail, how these millions of dollars spent on 
national security were used. We never at any time-the 
evidence is all around us-received anything even remotely 
resembling an answer. That is not really surprising since Mr. 
Elcock has a reputation that probably always precede him.
<P>
	In this regard, Richard Cléroux, a writer and former reporter 
with the Toronto-based daily newspaper the <I>Globe and Mail</I>, 
thinks that Mr. Elcock is very intelligent and plays political 
hardball. He sees him more as a Jesuit than an Oblate and thinks 
that he would make a formidable opponent of the independency 
movement.
<P>
	What is most important is not that he refuses to answer our 
questions despite being accountable to taxpayers but that he 
leads an organization that seems to be above government 
control, that costs over $200 million a year and whose activities 
we cannot find out anything about, let alone check. That an 
organization with millions of dollars at its disposal is beyond 
our control is rather disquieting. It is troubling for taxpayers and 
from a national security standpoint. How far can we go in letting 
people put our money to work and for what reasons?
<P>
	Talking about CSIS, opinions vary, according to experts. One 
of the questions we must ask ourselves is this: Could the 
organizations responsible for our national security with so little 
monitoring engage in illegal activities? It happened in the past. 
Let us just say that by asking the question, we are begging the 
answer to it.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	Money can do anything, really. But considering the economic 
situation, our present state of affairs, and the demographics and 
the geography of our vast country, could this really happen? 
Well, yes, it could, but is it likely? Personally, I would say that 
not only is it likely, it is very likely.
<P>
	Mr. Jean-Paul Brodeur, a criminology professor at the 
Université de Montréal, who specializes in intelligence 
services, among other things, even mentions that the Americans 
are sometimes taken for a ride, even though they have a much 
tighter control system than we do, in the form of committees 
with wide-ranging powers in both houses of Congress.
<P>
	Who has forgotten the famous Oliver North, who was taking 
orders from above and literally thumbed his nose at everything 
else?
<P>
	Mrs. Lorraine Lagacé, the former Quebec delegate in Ottawa, 
under Mr. René Lévesque, has some thoughts on this matter. She 
says that most English Canadians are not interested in looking at 
legal mechanisms, that what really counts for them is 
democracy, but that if they must choose between democratic 
rules and a united Canada, they will always opt for a united 
Canada.
<P>
	That is precisely how they see this issue, so, no matter what 
the RCMP or CSIS says, the mandate of secret services will 
always be to save Canada before anything else.
<P>
	CSIS employees, whom we pay more than $200 million per 
year, are not accountable. These people only have to table some 
kind of report before a pseudo-monitoring committee made up 
of political appointees. In fact, that review committee must 
phone CSIS before going to its offices to look into files, and they 
do not have access to all files. This is what you call 
transparency!
<P>
	The public does have the right to know and we, elected 
representatives, have the basic duty of providing the 
information. What is happening with the more than $200 million 
paid in taxes? CSIS is a monster that nobody can control, not 
even the government. Consequently, you can imagine what is 
happening! This is why the Bloc Quebecois is asking for a royal 
commission of inquiry.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I realize that the hon. 
member stopped after ten minutes. Am I to understand that you 
are sharing your allotted time with a colleague?
<P>
	<B>Mr. St-Laurent:</B> Indeed, Madam Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Fine. Questions and 
comments. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Solicitor 
General.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General):</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member mentioned again 
that we have no way of monitoring CSIS activities and referred 
to events dating back to 1970. We have been through this before. 
Today, all we want to do is ensure that SIRC can report on the 
allegations made either by the opposition or people whose rights 
have supposedly been, shall we say, impinged upon by CSIS.
<P>
	I wonder if the hon. member would acknowledge that we now 
have in 1994 a service and a control committee which did not 
exist earlier on. I understand that this monitoring committee is 
made up of people tied to the previous government, but the hon. 
member should recognize that, if a seat at SIRC becomes vacant, 
we have the obligation to consult the opposition leaders.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	So, I would like to know if the hon. member recognizes the 
existence of provisions in the act setting up SIRC which 
stipulate that we need to consult the opposition before 
appointing anyone to this committee?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6316"> 6316 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. St-Laurent:</B> Madam Speaker, of course, we must take 
certain guidelines into account, and this is provided for in this 
context.
<P>
	However, the question raised here today is that we believe it is 
particularly absurd to see the lack of control by the House of 
Commons over an institution to which it pays so many millions 
dollars every year and from which it really cannot get answers. 
On the contrary, people are asked to answer questions simply.
<P>
	They do not have to give exact details on individuals in 
particular with specific dates and amounts; these things are not 
asked, especially when we are in committee. We ask people to 
tell us how it works and what happens internally. We talk about 
different aspects which have something to do with the way our 
tax dollars are spent.
<P>
	We give $200 million dollars a year to CSIS, Madam Speaker, 
but I cannot explain to my constituents how the money is spent. I 
can only say to them that I do not have the slightest idea of how 
CSIS spends this money. I know that it hires people, of course. 
But what do they do exactly?
<P>
	The people from across the way do not seem to be interested in 
speaking about what happened before, but we must not forget 
that it did happen. It is part of our history, and it must not be 
forgotten. We must not be afraid of repeating that the taxpayers' 
money was used for terrorist acts specially directed at some 
Quebecers accused of separatist activities.
<P>
	With this in mind, we are justified in asking this question: will 
the taxpayers' money be used again for terrorist activities? This 
is the question we are asking today. It is a monster gone out of 
control.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General):</B> Madam Speaker, it is false to claim that activities of 
this kind take place in Canada. I believe that the hon. member 
has the privilege of sitting here in the House of Commons, the 
right to express his opinions and the privilege of sitting on the 
Sub-Committee on National Security. He has the privilege of 
asking questions about the performance of SIRC and the 
estimates tabled in the House every year.
<P>
	I think it is not a matter of money but of realizing that we have 
the mechanisms to ensure our security. In fact, according to a 
number of international experts, this mechanism does not exist 
in any other country. You know, in France when you get off the 
subway, you often see French policemen doing ID checks. That 
is not the kind of society we have here in Canada. We have a free, 
liberal and generous society with great respect for the freedom 
of the individual.
<P>
	It is not my purpose to defend our past performances, because 
I was not there. I have to admit I was not around at the beginning 
and the end of the sixties. But today, we have the mechanisms we 
need to ensure there is no abuse of power with respect to 
legitimate organizations, including political parties.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Before we continue this 
debate, I wish to inform the hon. member that he may use the 30 
seconds he has left.
<P>
	<B>Mr. St-Laurent:</B> Madam Speaker, I will do that, but instead 
of a lengthy reply, I just want to make a brief comment.
<P>
	The hon. member opposite said that I had the privilege to do 
this and the privilege to do that. I also have the right.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</b> Of course.
<P>
	<B>Mr. St-Laurent:</B> I have that right, because I was duly elected 
by people who pay their taxes, whom I represent here in the 
House. I am now exercising the right I was given by the 
electorate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf):</B> Madam Speaker, I thank 
my hon. colleague from Manicouagan for sharing ten minutes of 
his speaking time with me. Allow me to add my voice to that of 
my Bloc Quebecois colleagues and ask this House to blame the 
government for refusing to set up a royal commission of inquiry 
on illegal activities of the Canadian Security Intelligence 
Service.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	Let me remind you that CSIS was allotted a budget of about 
$205 million for fiscal year 1994-95. From a strictly accounting 
point of view, it is obvious that this House has not only the right 
but indeed the duty to look into the activities of this agency.
<P>
	But we are not here to talk about accounting today. This 
debate is about the very activities of the Canadian Security 
Intelligence Service, nothing less.
<P>
	I should point out that this agency was established out of 
concern for transparency, to follow up on the recommendations 
of the McDonald Commission, which had uncovered a 
disgraceful set of unacceptable, if not downright illegal, 
practices and actions by the RCMP's very own security service.
<P>
	Although the Canadian Security Intelligence Service was 
established with transparency in mind, there are nonetheless two 
major problems with CSIS. First, it does not have to account to 
Parliament for its budget, which it receives from Parliament. 
What this means is that we, who represent the people we were 
elected by, have no way of knowing how our tax money is spent. 
That is absurd!
<P>
	The second problem with the accountability of CSIS to this 
Parliament relates to its intelligence gathering activities. Some 
may quickly answer back that the annual report CSIS tables 
every year is public and that a monitoring committee, 
commonly know as SIRC, reviews all its activities. 
Unfortunately, the reports tabled in this House in that respect are 
rather laconic, they do not say much. They are the epitome of the 
lack of transparency.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6317"> 6317 </A></B>
<P>
	That is why the Bloc Quebecois considers that a royal 
commission of inquiry would give the people of Canada and 
Quebec a chance to determine whether their tax money is used 
properly and, more importantly, to check if CSIS has infiltrated 
and is trying to destabilize one or several political parties or 
other legitimate organizations. This is a serious matter. After 
all, an agency above suspicion, namely the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police, did engage in such activities in the past.
<P>
	We are justified in fearing that history will repeat itself. The 
<I>Toronto Star</I> recently uncovered a confidential note from an 
assistant to former Conservative Solicitor General Doug Lewis. 
According to this note, CSIS used an informant to obtain 
information on a report on the CBC television program ``The 
Fifth Estate''.
<P>
	CSIS used and paid an informant by the name of Grant 
Bristow, who is one of the founders of Heritage Front, an 
extreme right-wing group dedicated to the unacceptable 
promotion of white supremacy. It has even been maintained that 
this individual tried to spy on the Canadian Jewish Congress. 
Worse yet, it was revealed that this mole, namely Mr. Bristow, 
found himself in the entourage of the Reform Party leader at 
least twice as a security guard.
<P>
	Mr. Parrot, the president of the Canadian Union of Postal 
Workers, believes that CSIS also spied on his union.
<P>
	Tell me, is CSIS under control or has it lost its marbles? Is this 
a simple mishap or, on the contrary, just the tip of the iceberg?
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	There is no way to know. In parliamentary committee, 
officials clearly avoided and even refused to answer the 
legitimate questions asked by members of this House. The 
Liberal government tells us that the Security Intelligence 
Review Committee, SIRC for short, is checking out these 
allegations and will report to the Solicitor General within a 
month.
<P>
	That is not good enough. The people must know that on 
September 13, when the Review Committee itself appeared 
before the House Standing Sub-Committee on National 
Security, committee members were bold enough to tell members 
that they could not reveal their findings and that only the 
Solicitor General could decide what should be made public. We 
are not naive.
<P>
	The report or rather what will be left of it will obviously not 
tell us the whole truth. What about transparency, Madam 
Speaker? The Bloc Quebecois is not alone in demanding a public 
inquiry. Several very respectable organizations have called for a 
royal commission of inquiry. If I may, I would like to quote from 
an article published on September 10 in the Quebec City 
newspaper <I>Le Soleil</I>: ``More and more groups are calling for an 
independent investigation into the allegations against CSIS. The 
Canadian Civil Liberties Association, the Canadian Labour 
Congress, the Canadian Union of Postal Workers and the Simon  
Wisenthal Centre all argue that the government should set up a 
mini-commission based on the McDonald Commission which 
investigated the former RCMP security service in the 1970s. To 
ensure public confidence, someone should take a fresh look at 
this whole affair, said Mr. Borovoy, head of the Civil Liberties 
Association''.
<P>
	The Government of Canada also finances other intelligence 
agencies. In addition to CSIS, with its $205-million budget, 
there is the RCMP's Criminal Intelligence Directorate, with a 
budget of around $5 million, the Security and Intelligence 
Bureau of the Department of Foreign Affairs, with a budget of 
around $10 million, and finally the top secret Communications 
Security Establishment of National Defence.
<P>
	This famous establishment, the CSE, is governed by no law 
specifying its mandate or its powers, nor is it subject to any 
control mechanism. It is not even required to answer to 
Parliament. In spite of that, the CSE spends between $200 and 
$300 million in the greatest secrecy, without having to account 
for it, because it is so secret that it does not even exist in 
legislation. According to our information, this establishment 
has two mandates: the first is called INFOSEC, whereby the 
CSE gives the government technical advice, reports and 
assistance on the security of the telecommunications of federal 
departments. The second is code-named SIGINT; under this 
heading, information is collected on the activities, intentions 
and capabilities of foreign governments and on individuals and 
companies in various fields.
<P>
	We are not being paranoid, but when we see an organization 
like CSIS, which is covered by legislation and faces serious 
charges of infiltrating a political party and spying on other 
legitimate organizations, I am very inclined to suspect that other 
secret services which are not governed by legislation can do 
even more and much worse.
<P>
	As we just saw, these intelligence agencies have a combined 
budget of half a billion dollars and members of this House are 
unable to tell taxpayers if this money is spent in the best interest 
of the public and, most important, in accordance with the laws of 
the land.
<P>
	Given this flagrant lack of openness, this flagrant lack of 
accountability to parliamentarians and citizens, this flagrant 
lack of control over the activities of Canadian intelligence 
agencies, especially CSIS, it is imperative to review the process 
by which these agencies report to Parliament, to review the CSIS 
Act, to review the process of appointing members to the Review 
Committee, and in so doing, members of this Parliament can 
ensure that the interests and rights and fundamental freedoms of 
the people of Canada and of Quebec are respected.

<P>
	It would have been very simple to let members be informed 
openly, but since they are denied access to the truth, only one 
solution remains: the people must now be informed through a 
royal commission of inquiry on CSIS.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General):</B> Madam Speaker, the Security Intelligence Review 
Committee was set up ten years ago precisely to ensure greater 
transparency regarding the activities of CSIS. Let us not forget, 
and I hope the hon. member will agree, that we have a duty to 
protect industrial interests in Canada.
<P>
	All kinds of rumours are circulating in the Greater Montreal 
to the effect that some Quebec industries are the target of foreign 
interests or industrial espionage. I think the media reported 
several cases of Canadian companies losing contracts or being 
robbed of some technology by a foreign government. In my 
opinion, the primary objective is to protect the technological 
advances of our industries, including the aerospace and 
pharmaceutical industries, which are very important in Quebec 
and also elsewhere in Canada.
<P>
	Does the hon. member recognize that we must protect our 
interests against increasing and disturbing competition from 
certain countries?
<P>
	<B>Mr. de Savoye:</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member is full of 
good intentions. I notice that he is the only one on the Liberal 
side to defend that cause. In fact, some other Liberal members 
were making very different statements not that long ago.
<P>
	On March 19, 1992, when he was in opposition, the Liberal 
member for Scarborough West, said this regarding this issue: 
``We call upon CSIS and the minister to ensure, now that they 
can crawl, that future annual statements and reports contain 
more information, as promised by the minister himself, so that 
Canadians can have an informed public debate, be aware of the 
national security issues which face our nation, consider the 
major national security issues which face our country from year 
to year and how we are to handle them''. The hon. member for 
Scarborough West was right on then, but the fact is that two 
years later Canadians, and even MPs in this House, still do not 
have the information requested.
<P>
	Where are the Liberal members who were then asking for 
what we are asking for today? They keep silent. There is only 
one spokesperson for the Liberals and he has not been here long 
enough to realize that the problem has already persisted for too 
long and should have been resolved by now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</b> Madam Speaker, I want to assure the hon. 
member that, as the member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, I will always be first 
in line to protect individual freedoms. I will never accept the 
fact that legitimate organizations and political parties are 
being spied upon. I think that my party, and the  government 
I have the privilege to be part of, have always sought first 
and foremost to protect individual liberties.
<P>
	The hon. member referred to our committee. There is a 
sub-committee, made up of Liberals, Reform members and 
representatives of the Bloc Quebecois, which has been set up to 
undertake a review parallel to that of SIRC on allegations made 
against our security intelligence services. I believe we have 
shown some openness. I am very proud to see that even members 
on this side of the House are asking relevant questions that need 
to be answered. SIRC was created precisely to investigate 
allegations that can, at times, be legitimately made by the 
opposition or members on this side of the House.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	Let me reassure the hon. member by saying that we follow our 
proud tradition and always try to protect the underprivileged in 
Canada, who are unfortunately going through some tough times. 
I am proud to be part of this government and of a party which is 
concerned about the less-privileged in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. de Savoye:</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased to hear my 
colleague opposite say that they want to shed some light on 
actions by CSIS.
<P>
	Let me remind the House that, on April 1, 1993, the hon. 
member for Scarborough-Rouge River pointed out that 
Parliament's five-year review involved 117 recommendations 
and said: ``While it certainly was not our belief that the 
government would immediately adopt all 117 
recommendations, all of us who participated in the committee 
were disappointed that at the end of the day only one or two 
recommendations were actually formally adopted''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Asselin:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. When 
the hon. member for Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine 
referred to this side of the House when speaking about the 
government, I noticed that only a few members were interested. 
I call for a quorum count.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I will ask the Clerk to 
count the members present.

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Barnes):</B> My list shows the 
member for Durham. We have just heard from one side and we 
are alternating government and opposition and we now have the 
government speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham):</B> Madam Speaker, a clever 
motion has been put to the House that evokes a memory of 
transgressions from a bygone day. If approved, it would not 
serve the interest of Canadians or the lawful process that 
legislators designed to ensure their national security.
<P>
	There are a large number of Canadians who are unclear about 
the role of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service. These are 
serious people. If they are confused it is because they have been 
brought up on the myths about what an intelligence organization 
does.
<P>
	I want to dispel some of these myths. Today I want to talk 
about what CSIS does and what it does not do.
<P>
<B>(1255 ) </B>
<P>
	There is the issue of law, of accountability and of democracy. 
The point I want to make is that CSIS exists because of those 
things, not despite them.
<P>
	Nearly 50 years ago Canadians discovered, courtesy of Igor 
Gouzenko, that the Soviet Union was operating an espionage 
network here. The RCMP was asked to counter it and for 
decades it did. It became clear over time that police work and 
intelligence work were different. Police work involved 
enforcing the law, catching criminals and prosecuting them. 
Intelligence work involved warning governments and protecting 
people from acts by foreigners or by Canadians who threaten the 
security of our country.
<P>
	The role of warner is very different from the role of enforcer. 
By its nature good warning requires good information. There are 
many ways to get information and some of them can conflict 
with civil liberties and the law. For that reason, among others, 
the Mackenzie commission of the late 1960s followed by the 
McDonald commission in the late 1970s both recommended that 
Canada's intelligence service be civilian in nature and that it be 
governed by a strict regime of law and accountability of review.
<P>
	Simply put, CSIS exists because the government found that 
the rights of Canadians had not been adequately protected. In 
other words, the purpose of CSIS is to protect rights, to work 
within the law to be accountable to the elected Government of 
Canada.
<P>
	There is probably no intelligence organization in the world 
that functions with a law that is so strict and comprehensive and 
as clear. The legislation governing some intelligence 
organizations elsewhere is often a few general paragraphs in 
length. Sometimes legislation does not even exist. The CSIS act 
is 29 pages long. Nine of those pages are devoted to outlining 
how what CSIS does is to be monitored, reviewed and approved 
by others outside. No other part of the federal bureaucracy is 
subject to such strict rules.
<P>
	CSIS is under direct ministerial control and direction 
responsible to cabinet and responsible to Parliament. When 
CSIS engages in surveillance activities that are intrusive, such 
as electronic techniques, the director has to be personally 
satisfied in each case that the use of such techniques is 
necessary, that all other avenues have been exhausted and that 
the use of that technology is both lawful and within the mandate 
of the service. If it is not it does not happen. Even if the director 
thinks an action is justified, that is not good enough. The CSIS 
act requires him to secure the approval of the minister, the 
Solicitor General. If he does not approve, it does not happen. If 
he does, it does not end there. The case must be put to a judge on 
the Federal Court of Canada. There are no exceptions.
<P>
	In addition, the law establishes two review agencies. One 
agency is internal with an independent auditor called the 
inspector general, with his own staff to report to the minister 
directly. He has complete access to literally everything that the 
service does.
<P>
	The second review agency is external. We know it as the 
Security Intelligence Review Committee or, as some have 
mentioned, SIRC. It is independent both of CSIS and of 
government. SIRC also has its own staff. It has access to 
absolutely everything. It reports to Parliament annually. Its role, 
as it has described it, is to ensure that CSIS does things right and 
does the right things.
<P>
	When CSIS was first created, SIRC found fault with some of 
what was done. It still does, but it stated in its 1991-92 report 
much has changed: ``In the early years of this committee's 
mandate CSIS acted to a great extent as if it were simply a 
continuation of the RCMP security service. Despite public 
assertions to the contrary, SIRC felt that most CSIS targets, 
policies and procedures were virtually unchanged from those of 
a security service and that the CSIS preferred source of recruits 
was still the RCMP. It took over three years for this state of 
affairs to change significantly. CSIS is now virtually a new 
organization, hardly recognizable any more as the direct 
descendant of the security service of the RCMP. The number and 
type of CSIS targets, the rigorous justification required before 
anyone or any group is designated as a target, the lucidity, logic 
and balance of warrant affidavits submitted to the Federal Court, 
and the tone and content of reports by intelligence officers on 
target files have all changed significantly for the better. We still 
have criticisms to make, but our criticisms are no longer based 
upon strong and fundamental disagreement with the CSIS view 
of the world''.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	CSIS is a better organization because of that review process, 
but the mechanism of review and reporting have extended well 
beyond the work of that committee.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6320"> 6320 </A></B>
<P>
	In 1987 Gordon Osbaldeston who had been clerk of the Privy 
Council was asked to look at CSIS. He recommended changes 
to the services top level organization, a new approach to 
training, development, and an improved infrastructure for 
CSIS. Those changes were made.
<P>
	In 1989 Parliament reviewed the CSIS act, five years after it 
was created, and found that an organization to counter terrorism 
and espionage and to provide intelligence to the government was 
still needed in Canada.
<P>
	In 1991 the then government responded to that parliamentary 
review. The best summary of its conclusions in terms of the 
service and the act of Parliament that governs it is provided by 
the title of the report, ``On Course''.
<P>
	The third review since 1984 was done in the winter of 
1992-93. The Solicitor General asked the director at that time to 
conduct a full review of the service and how it should change to 
take account of the end of the cold war and present and future 
threats to Canadian security. Today's service reflects the 
changed reality.
<P>
	CSIS was created to enhance accountability, not evade it. 
CSIS was created to observe the rights and liberties of all 
Canadians. The law that governs CSIS is clear. The review that 
governs CSIS is comprehensive. The accountability of CSIS to 
the government is complete and the process of change and 
reform has been constant.
<P>
	CSIS reflects our cultural diversity and many more women 
are part of the operation. Two out of three employees have been 
hired since 1984. The service has expanded dramatically its 
capacity for research and analysis including in depth long term 
studies of global security problems of relevance to Canada.
<P>
	Hundreds of graduates in business administration, in history, 
in economics and in social sciences have been brought in. These 
people are not spies as some would prefer to believe. Many of 
them are analysts. Most are not sitting in some attic with a wire 
in their ear; they are at a desk reading. Much of what they 
analyse is open source material or information received from 
friends and allies.
<P>
	The CIA estimates that 55 per cent of its finished intelligence 
product comes from open sources, in some areas 80 per cent. 
That makes two points. First, the other 20 per cent is also 
crucial. It is the stuff the guys they are trying to understand do 
not want them to know. It is what makes intelligence work 
differently and hopefully sometimes better than work produced 
internally from open sources. Second, the value added more 
often than not comes from brains, not bugging.
<P>
	CSIS is not in the business of collecting information for 
collection sake. It is in the business of taking information, 
analysing it, integrating it, understanding it and then passing it 
on to the government. What CSIS does would be of no use if it 
kept the information for itself. It does not. Its role is to pass it 
on, to inform the  government, to warn it and to reassure it. So 
the people are different and the focus is changing partly because 
old threats have disappeared and partly because new threats 
have emerged.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	Security and intelligence was not the invention of the cold 
war. In Canada that function has been performed since the 
mid-nineteenth century when Sir John A. Macdonald asked the 
western frontier constabulary to patrol the borders of Upper 
Canada and to report on American Civil War activities that 
might affect Canada's security. The intelligence function was 
performed and continued until the cold war commenced. The 
beginning of the cold war was not the beginning of the need for 
intelligence, and the end of the cold war does not mean the end 
of that is near. Indeed some challenges have been made worse by 
the collapse of the Berlin wall.
<P>
	There are two types of threats that CSIS is responsible for 
meeting. The first is public safety. The second is national 
security. I will deal with public safety first. Simply put, public 
safety involves protecting Canadians against violence. Violence 
can come from abroad through terrorism. Violence can be 
fostered here through extremism or the support of terrorism 
elsewhere. Warning of that potential violence and its prevention 
is called counterterrorism. That was not a worry for Canada for 
most of the forties, fifties and sixties, but with the explosion of 
terrorist groups and the incidents of the seventies it became a 
serious concern.
<P>
	It became clear that Canada was not immune with the 1982 
assassination of a Turkish diplomat in Ottawa. So too the 
takeover of the Turkish embassy in 1985 and the shocking 
tragedy that same year with Air India in which 329 Canadians 
died. CSIS shifted its responses and its resources to match the 
new threat.
<P>
	In 1984 when CSIS was created only 20 per cent of its 
resources were devoted to counterterrorism and 80 per cent was 
devoted to counterintelligence. By 1992 the picture was 
dramatically different: a full 56 per cent of the operational 
resources were devoted by then to counterterrorism.
<P>
	Public safety or the protection of Canadian lives is the number 
one priority. It is also the number one difficulty. The sources of 
terrorism geographically are diverse. Groups come and groups 
go. The inventions, activities, movements and targets of 
individuals and governments are almost impossible to predict. 
Their methods are by definition extreme. Their reach is global 
and the consequences of failure are severe.
<P>
	The challenge of Canada's security service is to ensure this 
country is not the place where people are killed. That is not the 
only challenge. There are four others. We do not want to be the 
country where terrorism is planned. We do not want to be the 
country in which money for terrorism is raised. We do not want 
to be the country where the material to commit the act is bought. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6321"> 6321 </A></B>
<P>
We do  not want to be the place where the terrorists hide after the 
deed is done.
<P>
	In a sense dealing with the cold war was much easier. It was 
fairly obvious what countries the spies came from. Opposing 
intelligence specialists were extremely familiar with each 
other's habits. There was almost a code of conduct. It was all 
somewhat predictable, almost choreographed. That 
predictability, that order, is not there with terrorism.
<P>
	The terrorist threat is not diminishing. The technology of 
terrorism is becoming more accessible, more convenient. The 
sources of terrorism remain strong: nationalism, religious and 
political extremism and state sponsored terrorism. There is a 
correlation between the proliferation of terrorism and the 
proliferation of regional conflict. Regional conflict continues. 
There is also a correlation between ethnic unrest and hatred and 
the proliferation of terrorism.
<P>
	Looking at Asia, the former Soviet Union, eastern Europe, 
Africa and even Northern Ireland, it is clear that unrest will 
continue. Unfortunately Canadians will always be vulnerable. 
Our borders are open and long. We are a wealthy industrial 
society, a good target for extremists, a good place to secure 
equipment, technology and funds. Links of family, emotion, 
ideology and culture exist among millions of Canadians and 
societies abroad. When conflicts grip those countries the echoes 
can be felt here.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	The concerns of Canada's security intelligence service are 
several: first, to prevent the spread of homeland conflicts to 
Canada; second, to prevent the exploitation of immigrant 
countries for fund raising to support those conflicts; and, third, 
to prevent terrorism or support for terrorism that originates here 
in relation to conflicts abroad.
<P>
	The job of CSIS is early warning. It passes that information on 
to the government. Each year hundreds of threat assessments are 
prepared for the government by CSIS. The vast majority of them 
dealt with terrorism. Much of what it does involves dampening 
concerns rather than increasing them.
<P>
	Let me now turn to the second major priority of CSIS, national 
security. Simply put, this is about spying. Its job is to counter 
that. That is why it is called counterintelligence. The focus is on 
the activities of the organization that are the creatures of foreign 
governments.
<P>
	CSIS is concerned about countries that are one or more of the 
following: potential enemies equipped with weapons of mass 
destruction capable of striking Canada; countries that seek to 
develop such weapons through threat and theft of technology; 
countries that violate our sovereignty by meddling in our ethnic 
communities; countries that try to exercise repressive control 
over their citizens in Canada who are here on visitor exchanges; 
and countries that seek to prejudice our economic  security by 
covertly gaining access to our leading edge technologies.
<P>
	Throughout the cold war much of CSIS activity was devoted 
to countering those activities, but that was before the Berlin wall 
fell. What about the new world order? Unfortunately some of the 
new world order is not new. Arms control agreements have been 
negotiated and are substantially reducing the nuclear threat that 
is still there.
<P>
	Other countries continue to conduct espionage operations 
here because the reasons for spying remain strong. Communists 
did not invent spying; the desire for national advantage did. 
Spying is a cheap way to acquire weapons technology whether 
conventional or weapons of mass destruction.
<P>
	The proliferation problem is getting worse, not better. We 
have much of that technology here. It is at our nuclear, chemical 
and pharmaceutical industries; in our electronic sector; and in 
our machine tool capacities. As long as we are an open and 
wealthy country with a leading economy, countries will come 
here to spy and not simply for weapons. Developing countries 
eager to catch up with the rest of world find espionage a highly 
efficient way to modernize their economies. Former communist 
countries may begin to resort to intelligence gathering for the 
same reason. Everyone is after the competitive edge.
<P>
	In conclusion, the motion admonishes the government for not 
having set up a royal commission. I have already mentioned the 
Security Intelligence Review Committee. In addition we have 
established a parliamentary committee to further examine 
specific aspects of CSIS.
<P>
	This is not to detract from what may well have been useful 
exercises, but I have here summaries of various costs of royal 
commissions: aboriginal peoples, $13 million over nine months; 
national passenger transportation, $23 million over three 
months; Citizens' Forum on Canada's Future, $23 million over 
eight months; and reproductive technologies, $25 million over 
three years. The list goes on.
<P>
	Members of the Bloc have accused the government of creating 
deficits on the backs of Quebecers. Here is a clear case of the 
Bloc proposing the wasting of taxpayers' money on more 
studies that benefit no one. More interesting is the fact that the 
Bloc members, through their own representation on 
parliamentary committees, are saying they are so inept to carry 
out investigative powers the electorate has bestowed on them 
that we have to pay outside experts to do their jobs.

to all people of Canada who are so concerned about controlling 
government spending and getting our economic house in order.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>M. André Caron (Jonquière):</B> Madam Speaker, I listened 
carefully to the excellent speech on CSIS made by my hon. 
colleague from Durham. It is no doubt necessary, in a modern 
state, to take special measures in order to ascertain that 
activities related to espionage, foreign interference and 
revolutionary subversion are not carried out within a state's 
territory. I think the member has explained very clearly why 
there is a need for an organization to monitor these kinds of 
activities. However, the opposition motion before us today deals 
with a somewhat different subject.
<P>
	I am a little sensitive to these questions because my name was 
on the list of members of the Parti Quebecois that was stolen by 
members of the RCMP's security service in the 1970s. When I 
had the honour of being elected by the people of Jonquière to 
represent them in the House of Commons, some of my friends 
warned me, because I am a known sovereignist, a separatist as 
many of our colleagues opposite like to say. I was a separatist in 
the 1960s, and it looks like I am still a separatist in the 1990s.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Yes, and next week you will be a federalist.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caron:</B> You may rest assured, my dear colleague from 
Kingston and the Islands, that I will be a sovereignist for the 
referendum.
<P>
	When my friends saw that I was going to Ottawa as a member 
of Parliament, they told me that I would be under surveillance by 
the RCMP. I told them that I was not particularly worried 
because we are in a state governed by the rule of law and I did 
not think such a threat was real.
<P>
	When I look at the issue before us today, I realize that CSIS 
seems to have taken questionable measures. But I am not 
supposed to worry because we have a review committee. I do not 
want to know what is going on in CSIS, but I want to rest assured 
that it is well supervised and monitored. However, present 
members of the review committee have been appointed by the 
previous government, and parties then represented in this House 
had their say in those appointments. There are three 
Conservatives, on Liberal and one New Democrat sitting on this 
committee. I imagine they are all good federalists, and people 
with a certain vision of Canada.
<P>
	I do not trust those members. Sad to say, I do not trust them to 
see to it that my rights as a Canadian and a Quebecer are 
respected by CSIS. I am not sure they will do it. The Reform 
Party was infiltrated by CSIS, and I am  not sure the same thing 
did not happen with the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	Those issues are important. People are sceptical and the 
present review committee cannot set their minds at peace. Does 
my hon. colleague think it would be important, for the sake of 
democracy, to have a royal commission of inquiry even if there 
are costs involved? I think that in view of the present 
membership of the review committee, we should spend 
whatever money is needed. Would the hon. member for Durham 
agree that a royal commission should go to the bottom of those 
allegations made in the media about the Canadian Security 
Intelligence Service?
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Shepherd:</B> Madam Speaker, the essence of the hon. 
member's question is whether CSIS is accountable. I went 
through the process and CSIS seems to be just as accountable as 
every other government department through Parliament. That is 
a fundamental of our democratic system.
<P>
	It is a ludicrous assumption to me if we are saying that a royal 
commission is needed every time something has to be 
investigated, whether it has to do with CSIS, the Department of 
Industry or anything else. What would be the purpose of 
Parliament if we resorted to a royal commission every time a 
problem arose? We have made too much use of royal 
commissions and studies. The Library of Parliament is full of 
them, many of which are just collecting dust. What we are 
saying is that to move away from that process is a total disregard 
of our parliamentary traditions.
<P>
	More important is the cost. Clearly, the cost would be 
justifiable if there was an invasion of civil liberties, but the 
reality is that we have the functions here. There are all kinds of 
systems which scrutinize CSIS. Why spend the extra money? 
With the deficit running at billions of dollars it seems totally 
ludicrous that we would even think about a royal commission on 
something that already has tremendous investigative 
advantages.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like the hon. member to clarify a couple of points in 
relation to the actual function of CSIS. I thank him for the 
overview.
<P>
	It is my understanding from his presentation that CSIS was 
actually born from the RCMP out of a need to counteract 
Russian spying at that time. Since the cold war has ended and the 
Berlin wall has dropped the need which originally called for the 
start up of CSIS is gone.
<P>
	When the cold war existed 80 per cent of CSIS activity was in 
counterintelligence which falls under the national security point 
of the two points outlined. Considering there is now no cold war 
tends to imply that the public safety component of CSIS should 
probably go back to the RCMP. It seems to be an early warning 
system and once it is identified is referred to the appropriate 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6323"> 6323 </A></B>
<P>
sources to  carry out in any event. Under national security I 
believe the counterintelligence involvement is now 56 per cent. 
I am wondering if the role of CSIS is becoming unnecessary. 
Maybe we should be looking at some other component.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Shepherd:</B> Madam Speaker, the essence of the hon. 
member's question is whether it go back to the RCMP. The hon. 
member wonders why the RCMP cannot carry out those 
functions.
<P>
	My dissertation tried to point out the significant difference 
between law enforcement and intelligence gathering. It appears 
the birth of CSIS and indeed other intelligence gathering 
organizations like the CIA were predicated on the assumption 
that they had a unique role.
<P>
	The second part of the hon. member's question was whether 
there is a need for that today. It does not take much reading of 
our local newspapers to see that terrorism still exists around the 
world. We have been treated to the terrors of Northern Ireland, 
Bosnia-Hercegovina and other areas. These do have 
attachments to Canada; people who live here have relatives in 
those countries and so forth.
<P>
	The answer is yes, it appears there is a need. In fact due to the 
globalization and technology there may well be a greater need 
today than there ever was before.
<P>
<B>(1325 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I will be splitting my time with my colleague from 
Crowfoot.
<P>
	It is a pleasure to rise today to contribute to the debate on the 
security of our country. I am aware that by its very nature and its 
inception in 1984, CSIS and much of its work must be kept 
secret. The lives of individuals involved in CSIS work, contacts 
and ultimately all Canadians would be at risk if the wrong 
information got into the wrong hands. However this does not and 
should not preclude parliamentarians on behalf of all Canadians 
from discussing this secret agency, its work, mandate, activities, 
and the manner in which we review the scope of activity, namely 
through the Security Intelligence Review Committee otherwise 
known as SIRC.
<P>
	The work of CSIS in protecting the interests and security of 
Canadians is not in question. Canada being such an open society 
must be as vigilant as ever to the threat of subversive action. We 
must be conscious and sensitive to Canada becoming a proxy 
battlefield between immigrant groups who want to continue 
their hostilities on our soil. Remembering that Canada has the 
highest rate of immigration in the western world and therefore 
has extra exposure in that regard, we must be vigilant.
<P>
	While it is important to acknowledge these potential threats 
and reaffirm our support for CSIS, it does not mean that CSIS is 
ultra vires or some untouchable CIA type derivative. 
Accountability still remains the hallmark of the nature of this 
country, its public servants, politicians and those on the public 
payroll.
<P>
	Canada is one of the few western democracies to give its 
security service an explicit statutory charter. It provides a 
defined mandate for the operations of the agency. It interposes a 
system of judicially defined authorized warrants in the agency's 
use of intrusive investigation techniques. It establishes 
monitoring and review bodies. These purport to ensure that the 
agency does not indeed act outside the limits of its mandate.
<P>
	Therefore the question is: Is it doing so? It became obvious 
during the four years of existence of the McDonald commission 
in the late 1970s that illegalities and improprieties were rampant 
in the security service branch of the RCMP. The principal 
recommendations of that report called for an entirely civilian 
security agency. This agency was to be politically accountable 
and subject to strict review. The report concluded that law 
enforcement and security work are incompatible.
<P>
	Accordingly, Bill C-157 which was introduced in May 1983 
was put into effect in order to form this new security agency. 
However, it died on the order paper after much debate, 
committee review and public criticism. During the next session 
of the 32nd Parliament Bill C-9 was introduced and 
incorporated virtually all of the proposed changes and 
amendments as prescribed during the Bill C-157 debate. This 
was proclaimed in August 1984.
<P>
	The act assigns the management and control of CSIS to the 
director, a cabinet appointee. The Solicitor General is given an 
active supervisory role. Originally the bill had adopted a model 
similar to Australian legislation which would not have given the 
minister any operational role whatsoever. This was ostensibly to 
ensure that CSIS could not be used for partisan purposes. The act 
now provides that the minister has an override and must approve 
all warrant applications. The act also establishes the office of 
Inspector General and the Security Intelligence Review 
Committee. The Inspector General is to monitor CSIS 
operations and to report to the deputy Solicitor General and to 
SIRC on the legality and propriety of these operations.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	SIRC is a committee composed of five Privy Councillors 
appointed after consultation by the Prime Minister with 
opposition leaders in the House of Commons. It is to conduct a 
review of CSIS operations and to report to the minister and 
Parliament on them. It also has a variety of investigative duties; 
deals with complaints and acts as an appeal board with respect to 
security assessments and security influenced decisions under 
the Citizenship and Immigration Act.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6324"> 6324 </A></B>
<P>
	During its 10 years CSIS has had growing pains. The House 
of Commons set up a special committee in 1989 to review the 
CSIS act and the Security Offences Act. The committee had 117 
recommendations. Its report called ``In Flux but not in Crisis'' 
generally concluded that the system was sound and any reform 
should be based on the continuance and extension of already 
established institutions.
<P>
	The government's response set out its belief that legislative 
changes in the CSIS act and the Security Offences Act were not 
needed. Further it was unwilling to contemplate structural 
changes.
<P>
	In February 1991 a debate was held on an opposition motion 
that the House of Commons concur in the committee's report 
which recommended a parliamentary subcommittee on national 
security. The subcommittee held its first meeting in June 1991.
<P>
	On May 3, 1994 this same standing committee on justice and 
legal affairs re-established the subcommittee on national 
security which is the committee currently looking into the 
Bristow affair. The motion was a close vote and almost did not 
happen.
<P>
	Let me now turn to the formation of the Security Intelligence 
Review Committee, euphemistically known as SIRC. In 1984 
the then newly installed Tory government announced the initial 
membership of SIRC. In order to meet the requirements as 
prescribed in the act as a condition to sit on SIRC, two 
individuals had to be sworn in as Privy Councillors on the day of 
their appointments. The politics had begun, the die was cast and 
suspicions were raised. Naturally, due to the Privy Council 
appointment requirements, four of the first five appointees were 
ex-cabinet ministers and the fifth a well placed Quebec City 
lawyer.
<P>
	Today we have five politically appointed partisan individuals 
on the review committee; three from the Tories, one from the 
Liberals and one from the NDP. This was a Mulroneyism.
<P>
	What is its function? The security committee is to act as the 
eyes and ears of the public and Parliament on CSIS. The 
committee is intended to be independent of the government and 
its operations but responsible to the Parliament of Canada. The 
CSIS act provides that its members are appointed by the 
Governor General in Council after consultation with the leaders 
of all parties having more than 12 members in the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	Is it independent? Is it another politically charged patronage 
agency made up primarily of Tory cronies? Is it conducting 
constructive and an apolitical review of CSIS and its activities? 
We need to know and perhaps the only way is to investigate the 
investigators.
<P>
	We do not want to emulate the travesties perpetrated by our 
neighbours who have created monsters in the form of the CIA. If 
we are not vigilant and take the time to review agencies like 
CSIS after 10 years of work, it is  easy to lose control of their 
function and scope of activity.
<P>
<B>(1335 ) </B>
<P>
	Under the legislation SIRC does not have access to cabinet 
documents. For this reason I suggest that the requirement that 
members of SIRC have Privy Council designation or past 
cabinet experience is unnecessary and should be abolished. 
Instead have individuals cleared by the RCMP and if they meet 
the top security clearance available they fit.
<P>
	Why would one require a PC designation when one does not 
have access to cabinet documents? This change would lend itself 
to appointing independent members and not has been cabinet 
members.
<P>
	I would also like to recommend changes to the length of 
appointments to SIRC. Currently the five-year appointment 
allows a former administration to protect itself from a new 
administration. At the present time we have the first of the Tory 
appointments to SIRC expiring in December 1996 and the latest 
one in 1998. All may survive this administration, assuming the 
next election is held before December 1996. Four or five will 
survive if the election is held before November 1997.
<P>
	At the same time the Liberal committee appointee, Michel 
Robert, the same individual who worked Saturdays and has a 
non-tendered $249,000 contract from the Department of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development, ensures that the current 
administration has one of its cronies who can keep track of 
things. It is a joke and nothing more than political patronage that 
surely does not lend itself to independent review of CSIS 
operations.
<P>
	What we need is legislative permanence being granted the 
parliamentary subcommittee on security and legislative 
authority as well. This will at least meet the original 
recommendation of the 1991 review of national security and 
give us a body whose investigative powers include the ability to 
investigate cabinet, which SIRC cannot.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I want to recognize the very thorough job my colleague 
opposite has done in preparing and delivering this speech. It was 
refreshing to hear recalled some items of recent history.
<P>
	I appreciated the relatively thorough research that he 
obviously did in relation to the mechanism for appointing 
members to the Security Intelligence Review Committee. He 
has articulated a concern in relation to those appointments, i.e., 
the method by which consultation is or is not done with leaders 
of the parties in the House of Commons before such 
appointments are made. This is a point that I raised in the House 
in the last Parliament.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6325"> 6325 </A></B>
<P>
	At that time, as an individual member, I appeared not to have 
been heard by the then Prime Minister, who is solely 
responsible for those appointments, so the hon. member's 
remarks are refreshing.
<P>
	I would like to ask him if he could elaborate on what process 
would be used in relation to a possible parliamentary 
subcommittee that would be different from what exists now in 
Parliament, where there is a subcommittee whose mandate 
includes the general area of oversight of the security 
intelligence envelope.
<P>
	Could he elaborate or provide more particulars as to how he 
would change what is there now in relation to parliamentary 
committee operations?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to recognize the 
very important role that the member opposite has played in 
establishing that subcommittee. He has been the driving force. I 
must say I have had a crash course in CSIS since notification 
that this motion was coming forward.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	I would like to see permanence of that standing subcommittee 
through legislative authority. I would also like to see the 
standing subcommittee have a very real role in the appointments 
to SIRC. In other words they should have a vetting role as 
opposed to just an interview role.
<P>
	I would certainly be open to any other constructive 
suggestions the member might have.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
overriding question that must be answered regarding the Brian 
McInnis-Grant Bristow affair is whether CSIS and other 
institutions of government were politicized by the Brian 
Mulroney government and whether the McInnis-Bristow 
incident was the premeditated extension of that politicization.
<P>
	Rod Stamler, a former assistant commissioner of the RCMP 
has indicated clearly, not only in Paul Palango's book <I>Above the 
Law</I>, but in open line radio programs across the country that the 
RCMP was politicized by the Mulroney government and that it 
was denied a free hand in the investigation of political and other 
corruption in Canada.
<P>
	When we look for evidence of this very serious allegation we 
see several disturbing incidents. We see the accusation of Shelly 
Ann Clark about deception and deceit in the Canada-U.S. free 
trade deal and her continuous complaint that her concerns were 
never fully investigated by the RCMP.
<P>
	We see the accusation of Glen Kealy of kickback schemes run 
by members of the Mulroney government and in particular the 
case of Roch LaSalle which has never been finalized in court. 
We also see the case of Alan Eagleson, a close friend of the 
former Prime Minister, where detailed evidence of wrongdoing 
was placed in the hands of the RCMP, the Metro Toronto  Police 
and the Law Society of Upper Canada and absolutely nothing of 
consequence was done.
<P>
	Yet the U.S. justice department, after looking at the very same 
evidence, have laid 34 indictments against Mr. Eagleson, issued 
a warrant for his arrest, have frozen his American bank account 
and have initiated extradition proceedings to have him stand 
trial in the United States.
<P>
	These incidents strongly support the allegations of Mr. 
Stamler that there has been political interference in the 
administration of the RCMP and in the administration of justice, 
that politicization of the RCMP under the Mulroney government 
did occur and that evidence of wrongdoing by government 
members and friends of government was not, and has not, been 
properly investigated.
<P>
	I have been advised by individuals close to the situation that it 
would be much easier to politicize the Canadian Security 
Intelligence Service than to politicize the RCMP. When I asked 
my sources to explain this I was told that the Solicitor General 
has the power under the federal statutes to demand secret and 
classified information, including complete files and names of 
informants from CSIS.
<P>
	This is supported by the fact that at least eight boxes of secret 
and highly classified documents seized from Brian McInnis's 
residence came directly from the Solicitor General's office. 
Why does the Solicitor General have to have possession of such 
highly secret documents? Why does he have to have possession 
of CSIS documents at all?
<P>
	This is evidence that Doug Lewis, the former Solicitor 
General, was directly involved in the operation of CSIS. This 
was not an arm's length relationship. Mr. Lewis was directly 
involved.
<P>
<B>(1345 ) </B>
<P>
	The Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act grants the 
Solicitor General full knowledge and power of direction over 
the policies, operations and management of CSIS. As well, the 
assistant deputy Solicitor General sits on the CSIS target 
approval and review committee and has direct input into what 
groups and individuals are targeted by CSIS.
<P>
	The question is to what extent, if any, did the former Solicitor 
General politicize CSIS either through the assistant deputy 
Solicitor General who sat on the committee that determined who 
and what CSIS was to target or his own direct involvement or 
both? This question must be answered.
<P>
	In the speech the Solicitor General gave in the House today he 
attempted to negate the Bloc's request for a royal commission 
hearing into this matter by claiming that SIRC has a mandate to 
do the same work. This is not true. SIRC advised the 
subcommittee looking into this matter that it could not 
investigate matters once they reached the Solicitor General's 
office. This means that SIRC has no power whatsoever to 
determine whether the  former Solicitor General politicized 
CSIS. This is a central question 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6326"> 6326 </A></B>
<P>
beyond the mandate of SIRC. Was CSIS used for political 
purposes under the direction of Doug Lewis?
<P>
	Therefore, there is a need to look not just at this matter but to 
look at the whole question of the politicizing of our federal 
institutions by the Mulroney government, including CSIS and 
the RCMP.
<P>
	There is the clear suggestion that there has been a deliberate 
dismantling of the division of power between those who create 
the law and those who administer and enforce the law. This is the 
much broader and more serious question raised by this whole 
McInnis-Bristow issue and that is has the rule of law been 
destroyed or harmed in this country?
<P>
	Therefore I reject the submission made in this House today by 
the present Solicitor General that SIRC can do the job. It is 
obvious SIRC cannot look into misuse and abuse of political 
powers within the office of the former Solicitor General or any 
other institution of government. Therefore its mandate is 
inadequate.
<P>
	Our hopes must rest with the subcommittee. If the 
subcommittee fails to get to the bottom of the issue and answer 
all relevant questions, the demand for a full scale inquiry will be 
justified at that point.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I must admit that it was with some surprise that I took 
note last night of the opposition motion that a royal commission 
be invoked to deal with a number of allegations that have been 
put in the media of late, over the last month or two, in relation to 
both the mandate of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service 
and the security of documentation that emanates from CSIS and 
as it might make its way to the minister who reports to this 
House for CSIS which is the Solicitor General.
<P>
	These events out of which the allegations arose took place 
two, three, four years ago. In any event, the opposition has made 
its motion. Before dealing with the substance of the motion I 
would take note, as others perhaps have done before me, that the 
use of the word illegal in the motion might be construed as 
unparliamentary. That word has been found to be 
unparliamentary in the past. I recognize the courtesy of the 
opposition in changing the wording of the motion earlier today 
to allegations of illegal activities.
<P>
	I would have preferred to see the words allegations of 
improper activities because no one has been very particular 
about what illegality there might have been.
<P>
<B>(1350 ) </B>
<P>
	Any illegality there might have been would surely have been 
related to the mandate of CSIS. To draw an analogy, if someone 
in the department of agriculture decides they are going to do 
something involving the Department of Health that is surely not 
a matter of illegality per se.
<P>
	In any event, I will abandon the technical issues and attempt 
to speak to the motion.
<P>
	Other colleagues in the House have noted appropriately the 
work of CSIS on behalf of Canadians. CSIS has for 10 years 
been carrying on this type of work which involves gathering and 
analysis of intelligence and preparation of security clearances, 
providing security reports and analysis to other departments of 
government.
<P>
	The member who just spoke referred to a security clearance 
by the RCMP. The RCMP does not do security clearances. This 
is the job carried out for Canadians by CSIS.
<P>
	The work of CSIS focuses primarily around what are called 
threats to the security of Canada and these defined threats are 
outlined in section 2 of the CSIS act and they include espionage 
and foreign influenced activities. Sometimes CSIS activity is 
described under the category of counter intelligence. Some of 
that work includes the so-called spying which occurs in Canada 
on the part of some operations of other governments.
<P>
	There is the area of counter terrorism. Terrorism may or may 
not involve a foreign government and there is also a category of 
threat to Canada which we call subversion but in relation to 
which the service does not carry on any investigative activity 
without the expressed consent of the Solicitor General. The last 
time we checked here on the parliamentary side we did not find 
any ongoing CSIS operations in relation to subversion.
<P>
	Most of what CSIS does, most of the good work it does, never 
gets reported. Because of the nature of the work it does not 
prepare press releases every Friday afternoon for consumption 
by the media or for that matter consumption by anyone. Most of 
its good work is done quietly at desks using paper and computers 
and good common sense. That work carries on both in making 
security assessments and in the gathering of data mostly from 
open source. Most of the data it gathers come from open sources 
and it also has data that come from other non-open sources 
which it gathers using appropriate and legal methods.
<P>
	It assists both the Government of Canada and generally the 
citizenry by keeping an eye on foreign government theft of 
industrial secrets and it also keeps an eye on what we would call 
foreign meddling, meddling in Canada by governments outside 
Canada using whatever means it wishes. That is probably a bit of 
a cat and mouse game that goes on in all countries of the world.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="6327"> 6327 </A></B>
<P>
	Why does the official opposition request a royal 
commission? We have in this country a statute that governs 
CSIS, a statute that by comparison to other countries in the 
world is relatively modern, up to date, effective.
<P>
<B>(1355 ) </B>
<P>
	I am not one of those who takes the view that the CSIS statute 
is perfect. The record will show that I have attempted to make 
constructive comments both in the House and in the CSIS five 
year review on ways in which we could alter the CSIS statute. I 
point out that not all countries do have statutes that govern their 
security intelligence system.
<P>
	As we speak today, I understand that the people of Great 
Britain are about to invoke a statute which was recently passed 
and codify a statute which oversees and regulates the work of the 
security agency known as MI5. That is quite a step for the people 
of Great Britain to take. They have never had a statute that 
governed the area that James Bond used to work in. They will 
then develop their statute as they see fit.
<P>
	Australia has a foreign intelligence gathering agency which 
has no statute. I believe that everyone in the agency is employed 
by contract to one person and that person is employed by their 
government. A single person constitutes this particular agency. 
There is no statute that would confirm or deny even the 
existence of the operations which that agency carries out.
<P>
	In addition to our statute which has a series of sections that 
oversees and monitors what CSIS does, we have the Security 
Intelligence Review Committee, SIRC, whose job it is to review 
all of the work of CSIS, all of the work done under its mandate, 
to make sure that work is done within the law and efficaciously. 
There is a whole range of challenges there for the Security 
Intelligence Review Committee.

	<B>The Speaker:</B> It being 2 p.m., pursuant to Standing Order

	<B>Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
join my colleagues from Kitchener and Waterloo in paying 
homage to Kitchener Mayor Dominic Cardillo.
<P>
	Dominic Cardillo is being honoured today by the citizens of 
Kitchener for his tremendous contribution to their city. He was 
first elected as alderman in 1963 and has served as mayor of 
Kitchener for the last 11 years. Such longevity during a time 
when politicians are not very popular is a testament to Dom's 
integrity and hard work.
<P>
	Mayor Cardillo must be congratulated for his tireless 
promotion of the interests of Kitchener. During his tenure 
Kitchener has grown in population and has matured as a city. His 
greatest achievement is the new city hall which provides a 
strong, people oriented focus to the municipal government and 
downtown Kitchener.
<P>
	Dom Cardillo has been a model civic leader whose dedication 
to the interests of his constituents will long be remembered.

conversion. However, this promise applies only to the 
English-speaking provinces, as the CNTU revealed yesterday.
<P>
	The Maritime provinces, which lost 3,000 jobs when military 
bases were closed, have now received $20 million to help 
diversify their economy. Quebec lost nearly 1,000 jobs as a 
result of similar cuts and received a meagre $200,000.
<P>
	Furthermore, during the past four years, Quebec's defence 
industry lost 7,000 jobs and is still waiting for the federal 
government to adjust Defence Industry Productivity Program.
<P>
	This is one more example of the injustice done to Quebec. The

am proud to report that this past week the 10th Annual Canadian 
Student Leadership Conference was held in my riding of 
Yorkton-Melville. This conference originated 10 years ago in 
Yorkton and has been growing ever since.
<P>
	This year over 1,000 high school delegates and leaders came 
from every province and territory in Canada, and even some 
students from south of the border. It was an opportunity for them 
to share their experiences with other student leaders and to 
encourage one another in achieving their dreams.
<P>
	At the same time as the student leadership conference, the 
first annual Canadian high school finals rodeo championship 
was held in Yorkton as well. This rodeo was also a highly 
successful event and I am proud to report that the best high 
school rodeo team is from Saskatchewan.
<P>
	The top male high school champion was Jason Resch from 
Saskatchewan and the top female high school rodeo champion

<P>
	Both Mississauga and Brampton have bylaws that prevent 
strip clubs from hiring persons under the age of 18. But many

or do not have adequate resources to enforce them.

communities where families, friends and neighbours come 
together to celebrate the autumn season.

opportunity to attend and participate in the Dorchester Fair; the 
Thorndale Fall Fair; the Lambeth Harvest Festival; the Iderton

<P>
	Tremendous community spirit and long hours of hard work

	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (St. Paul's):</B> Mr. Speaker, millions of 
Canadians are quite distressed by the attempt of some to distract 
us from the legitimate debate which must take place about guns 
in Canadian society.
<P>
	A large majority of Canadians want tougher gun control 
because the presence of guns in our cities, our towns and our 
homes decreases the safety of all of us. I understand the need of 
hunters and farmers for long guns but gun ownership in this 
country is a privilege, not a right.
<P>
	These are the basic facts: Guns kill people and handguns in 
particular have no other purpose. Registration of all weapons 
would only be a minor inconvenience for those who need long 
guns to hunt. Handguns and assault weapons are not needed for 
hunting or by farmers for pest control.
<P>
	I respect the right of Canadians to choose their hobbies but 
hobbies should not dictate public policy. Demolition car drivers 
do not control highway policy. Sport shooters should not try to 
dictate gun policy.
<P>
	I urge the government to ensure that public safety is 
paramount in our gun policies. All considerations are not equal 
in this debate. We must address the smuggling of weapons and 
the use of guns in the commission of an offence, but outlawing 
handguns and a registration system will contribute to a safer 
Canada.

is using current consultations to deflect any questions. Senior

guess giving it over one billion bucks per year just is not enough. 
Now CBC television wants cable companies across the country 
to carry a new French language all-news station. It seems the

commitment, the Prime Minister did not hesitate one moment to 
honour that commitment, quite the contrary.

	It is obvious that verbal commitments do not all have the same

Government of Canada had decided to refloat that boat that has 
been lying in deep water for almost 8,600 days.

	It took only 135 days for this government to remedy the

when he was Minister of the Environment, had refused to 
intervene even if he was aware of the dangers of that time bomb 
and despite the recommendations of the study report on the 
security of tankers that he had commissioned.

	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Finance. The minister has been 
refusing for the past few days to rule out the possibility of taxing 
RRSPs in his next budget. Several analysts have come out 
against this retroactive tax penalizing middle-income 
taxpayers. Claude Picher, from La Presse, states that it would be 
very unwise of Ottawa to keep dipping into the taxpayers' 
pockets. He adds that it would be all the more objectionable 
since the first ones to be hit would be unorganized private sector 
employees.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Finance not realize that, by hiding 
behind his pre-budget consultations to avoid undertaking not to 
tax RRSPs, he is the only one to blame for causing fear and 
worry amongst taxpayers in Quebec and Canada?

he is the one causing worry. I can only repeat it again, in 
response to the question he has already asked four times this 
week.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue):</B> All the Minister of

large financial deficit. This country is heavily indebted and we 
have to come to grips with it. We did so in stage one, which was 
the last budget. We intend to do so very clearly in stage two, 
which is going to be the next budget.
<P>
	The member opposite raises the question of child poverty. It is 
quite ironic that question is coming from a member of the 
Reform Party, which is prepared to acknowledge, as we do the 
very severe financial deficit in the country, but it has never once 
acknowledged the very severe human deficit which we in this 
side of the House intend to address.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
in an interview shown on the ``Téléjournal'' on October 1, 1993, 
the Prime Minister promised not to raise taxes during the first 
two years of a Liberal government. The Minister of Finance, for 
his part, said yesterday that no option or suggestion should be 
ruled out in the pre-budget consultation process, including that 
of taxing RRSPs.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. How can the 
Minister of Finance leave the door open to taxing RRSPs, when 
the Prime Minister, his Prime Minister, promised during the 
election campaign not to raise taxes in the first two years of 
Liberal rule?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, what the Prime Minister 
said is that the tax burden of Canadians must not be increased. 
Besides, we stated very clearly in the red book that 
ultimately-that is one of the reasons we must reduce the 
deficit-any government has a responsibility to lower the level 
of taxation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Minister of Finance should read again the newspaper article 
in which the Prime Minister clearly said that taxes would not be 
raised in the first two years of a Liberal government. Not the tax 
burden but taxes themselves.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Finance not think that he would be acting 
more responsibly if, instead of penalizing taxpayers by taxing 
RRSPs, he made a commitment right now in this House to 
reduce the Liberal government's huge operating expenditures 
and to make his friends, the friends of the wealthiest Canadians, 
pay by eliminating the tax loopholes they enjoy?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member had 
read the last budget, he would have seen that we eliminated 
many tax loopholes, like the $100,000 capital gains exemption. 
We certainly eliminated corporate tax loopholes. Had he read 
the budget, he would have seen that we took very significant 
measures in the last budget and we intend to do the same thing in 
the next budget.
<P>
	I hope that the hon. member-and I urge him to do so-will 
offer us constructive suggestions during sittings of the finance 
committee.

<P>
	Last July 13, in the middle of summer, when Canadians were

transportation strategy. This strategy is patterned on the airport 
policy which will impact all regions of Quebec and Canada.

open, should local airport authorities become unable to fulfill 
their management mandate?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
as the hon. member just mentioned, the implementation of a 
national airport policy was made public and three levels of 
airports were identified. I hope that, with the co-operation of all 
those concerned, we will succeed in implementing an efficient 
and safe system, as well as one which will reduce the taxpayers' 
burden.
<P>
	We do not want to prejudge how things will go. We have two 
to five years to come up with final solutions based on problems 
experienced in each of the affected locations. I hope to be able to 
count on the hon. member's co-operation to arrive at the best 
possible solution. If things do not workout, we will review the 
situation. However, based on the results so far, I am very

success right across the country.

	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond

I am sure the hon. member knows that there are some 725 
certified airports in Canada.

	Transport Canada is involved in the management of only 150 
of those airports, either as owner or operator. Already, in every 
province, there are airports operating very successfully, without 
federal involvement. The hon. member for 
Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans and his colleagues from the

	<B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is directed to the Prime Minister. Yesterday I was very 
much surprised when the Prime Minister said he had not been 
informed of the commitment his predecessor made with respect 
to the referendum. I made inquiries, and I later found that before 
Question Period yesterday, the Prime Minister knew that his 
predecessor had promised the Government of Quebec he would 
submit to his government a request to compensate Quebec for 
referendum expenses.
<P>
	I would like to know from the government why the Prime 
Minister did not give this information to the House of Commons 
yesterday?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I think the present situation is quite clear and has been 
explained several times in the House. There is no evidence in 
our files that a commitment was finalized. In the past few days, 
the Prime Minister got in touch with the former Prime Minister, 
Mr. Mulroney, to find out whether there had been a definite 
commitment, and he asked him to indicate, in writing, what his 
position was. As soon as we  know the former Prime Minister's 
<P>

position on whether he made a definite commitment, we will act 
accordingly.
<P>
<B>(1455) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question to the government is quite clear and it is this: 
Yesterday, the Prime Minister knew, because his predecessor 
had told him before Question Period, that he had made a 
commitment to submit Quebec's request to the government. I 
would like to know why yesterday in this House, the Prime 
Minister did not share that information with Parliament and why 
instead, he insinuated there had been some unlawful activity?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> This question is, if I understand it, directly 
posed to the Prime Minister who is not in theChamber at this

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment): </B>Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister made no 
insinuations whatsoever. Today, the only insinuation has come 
from the hon. member for Sherbrooke. Now, the Prime Minister 
is waiting for a letter from Brian Mulroney because a lot is said 
on the telephone. We want to see the truth in writing, and that is 
what we are waiting for. The Prime Minister said that as soon as 
he sees a commitment by the federal government in writing, he 
will act on that commitment. That is exactly what he said 
yesterday in the House.

<P>
	Some Canadians have the wrong impression that immigrants 
take jobs and abuse our social security system. I have serious 
concerns about the growing backlash against immigrants and 
refugees.
<P>
	What is the minister doing to address these concerns and to 
inform the Canadian public about the real and positive 
contributions that immigrants do make to Canadian society?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague 
for the question which is a good question, because sometimes 
we allow mythology to wrap itself around this policy we call 
immigration. Rather than point to government, we should 
perhaps look at the study that was released by the Clarke 
Institute this week, a study of 1,300 former Vietnamese boat 
people spanning some 10 years.
<P>
	It found individuals who were a tremendous success story. 
One out of every five started a business; 99 per cent of them 
became Canadian citizens; 7.3 per cent used the social system 
rather than the 10 per cent of the rest of Canadians.
<P>
	What this paints is a distinction between fact and fiction. 
Hopefully that lesson is not lost on these customers who 
continue to spin mythology around immigration.

	<B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to 
raise a point of order on two matters. I also want to mention, 
since it just happened, that after Question Period, you called the 
usual Thursday question, but I always thought that after 
Question Period, Questions of Privilege and Points of Order 
were called first.
<P>
<B>(1505) </B>
<P>
	I just mention this in passing. It is not a point of order but I 
think it is important to bring this up, because we have certain 
traditions and customs.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The Chair recognizes members as items are 
called. I did not see anyone else. If the hon. member is referring 
to himself, I did not see him, except when the hon. member for 
Roberval was speaking. That is why I got back to him, but I am 
very much aware of the Standing Orders of this House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charest:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. In fact, I realize it may 
sometimes be difficult to see this far, but it is all part of what we 
expect the Chair to be able to do. That is why I sent you a note, 
advising you that I wished to rise on a point of order.
<P>
	I wanted to raise the following matter. During Question 
Period, you rose twice to ask to whom members were directing 
their questions. To my knowledge-and my memory is not 
infallible-when a member of the opposition puts a question, it 
is necessarily directed to the government. He addresses the 
Chair, in other words, he must address the government through 
the Chair. As for the particular person to whom the question is 
directed, that person is indicated only as a matter of courtesy.
<P>
	I am merely pointing out what I assume to be the usual custom 
in this House, since the government is perfectly free to reply 
through any member of Cabinet.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member is absolutely right. There is 
no doubt about that. The second time was indeed a mistake and I 
apologize. If that was the purpose of your point of order, you are 
absolutely right that when a question is put by a member, that 
question is directed to the government. I agree with that, if that 
was the purpose of your point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charest:</B> Mr. Speaker, perhaps I may finish my 
comments, since there was another matter I wished to raise. You 
may have noticed that my question was directed to the Prime 
Minister. Like other members in this House, I had understood 
the Prime Minister was to be present during Question Period. 
That is why I directed my question to him. Subsequently, you 
said that the Prime Minister was not in the House.
<P>
	I must admit this bothers me, and I will explain. We also have 
a Standing Order that is well-known in this House, which 
prohibits anyone from drawing attention to the absence of other 
members. A Standing Order that is usually observed.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Dear colleague, you are absolutely right. I was 
at fault and I apologize. It will not happen again, and I accept 
your comments in the spirit in which they were intended.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my discourse was interrupted by Question Period. I will attempt 
to pick up roughly where we left off.
<P>
	We were describing before we broke for Question Period the 
request of the Official Opposition for a royal commission and it 
was my view at that time, and it still is, that is an ill advised 
request.
<P>
<B>(1510 ) </B>
<P>
	We were discussing that in Canada we have statute law that 
oversees and creates CSIS. We have the Security Intelligence 
Review Committee that reviews the work of CSIS. We have a 
justice committee and a subcommittee on security and 
intelligence which looks at the same area. We also have the 
Solicitor General who stands in this House, responsible to 
Parliament and to the people of Canada for all of the matters 
under his ministry, including CSIS.
<P>
	Why do we need a fourth or a fifth level of scrutiny or inquiry? 
Why do we need a royal commission? This House through its 
justice committee in the last Parliament in reviewing the CSIS 
act made 117 recommendations. Only two of the 117 
recommendations were adopted by the government at that time. 
That was regrettable.
<P>
	Thank heaven for small mercies. Two were adopted. One 
which was not accepted by government was the creation of a 
committee or subcommittee that would work in this area of 
security and intelligence. The government basically said to 
Parliament it does not want one. The justice committee said beg 
your pardon, excuse us, but there will be one.
<P>
	All of the parties on the justice committee unanimously 
agreed to create the subcommittee on national security. That 
particular subcommittee was reborn in this Parliament. That 
provides Parliament with a particularly precise window with the 
ability to look into this area, the subject of debate today.
<P>
	One of the reasons we believed the subcommittee was 
necessary was that although the Security Intelligence Review 
Committee, SIRC, works for Parliament and for Canadians on 
their behalf, the linkages between SIRC and Parliament were not 
strong. SIRC makes one annual report each year and can make 
section 54 reports to the Solicitor General whenever it is deemed 
appropriate.
<P>
	Those section 54 reports do not come directly to Parliament. I 
think I am correct in saying the reports do not ever get to 
Parliament. The procedures have not been live and green. As a 
result there needs to be a better linkage between SIRC and 
Parliament.
<P>
	That is one of the reasons we have created the subcommittee, 
to provide that linkage, that relationship, between the oversight 
or review mechanism that SIRC is and Parliament with its 
general oversight mechanism for all of government.
<P>
	I want to discuss the issue of potential cost of royal 
commissions. I think it was adequately addressed by one or two 
colleagues in the House. Some of the more recent royal 
commissions have cost between $9 million and $25 million per 
item. That is a lot of toast.
<P>
	From my perspective the existing mechanisms of the statute 
of the Solicitor General, of SIRC and the subcommittee are able 
to cover the field and adequately address the questions that have 
been raised. If I am wrong then someone might be able to make a 
case for a royal commission, but at the moment I do not believe I 
am wrong. Time will tell. The next year or six months will tell. 
We will see how well SIRC, the subcommittee, the justice 
committee and members in this House deal with this particular 
set of issues.
<P>
	Let us deal with the justice committee and the subcommittee 
on national security. For members here and for Canadians I want 
to acknowledge the resources that will be used as an alternative 
to a royal commission are already bought and paid for by the 
taxpayers. We are adequately resourced. We have research 
capability and we have the power to compel attendance. We have 
a subcommittee which is working in a relatively non-partisan 
fashion and a justice committee which is working in a relatively 
non-partisan fashion. I believe that we can do the job that 
Parliament has set out for us in the standing orders.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	As I say, we have the resources. We have the power to compel. 
The wording of that power is called the power to call for persons 
and papers. That is basically the power to compel attendance and 
to require an answer. It is part of the law of Parliament. The law 
of Parliament has been here ever since this House was built and 
this country was formed. The law of Parliament began 
developing back when the barons forced King John, in the 
Magna Carta of 1215, to submit to a people's Parliament. They 
took some authority from the king. The Bill of Rights of 1689 is 
another large slice of authority for Parliament derived from the 
king.
<P>
	We have the power to compel attendance. The power has been 
described with some derogation as an absolute power. I will not 
get into details on that now but it is an effective power.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6341"> 6341 </A></B>
<P>
	We in the House want Canadians to know that we will not 
hesitate to use the authority that Canadian citizens have given 
us if we need to use them. I can point respectfully to the mace 
that sits on the table which is, as a symbol, the repository of 
every one of the powers and authorities that Canadians have 
given all of us in the House.
<P>
	What are the allegations that the Official Opposition would 
like to see investigated? There are two categories. First is the 
allegation that an alleged informant of CSIS had involved 
himself in some fashion in intelligence gathering or other with a 
CBC journalist, in another instance with some activities of the 
Reform Party of Canada, in another instance in an attempt to 
obtain an address list of members of the Canadian Jewish 
Congress and in another instance, potentially some intelligence 
gathering in relation to the Canadian Union of Postal Workers.
<P>
	Those are four categorized items for which allegations are 
being investigated as we speak by the Security Intelligence 
Review Committee which has three staff permanently working 
on them.
<P>
	The second issue has to do with security of classified 
documents. Essentially put the question is: How did a box of 
allegedly classified documents make its way out of a secure 
environment and into the basement of a residence somewhere in 
Ottawa and on to the pages of a major newspaper? That is a very 
reasonable question. That particular question is not one that the 
Security Intelligence Review Committee would ordinarily be 
able to look at, but it is one that the parliamentary subcommittee 
can and will look at.
<P>
	There are other related questions, hypothetical allegations, 
what ifs. Those questions have been asked publicly and the 
subcommittee will do its job as will SIRC. The subcommittee 
will consult with SIRC as it goes about its job and vice versa. My 
colleagues on the subcommittee will inquire into all of these 
questions over the next few weeks.
<P>
	Finally, in my view a royal commission at this point is 
absolutely unnecessary, ridiculously expensive and 
procedurally redundant in the extreme. I want to assure 
members in the House and Canadians that colleagues who are on 
the subcommittee will deal with the issues in a responsible way, 
in a rational way, in a manner that does not duplicate and waste 
resources and in a way that we hope will continue the faith of 
Canadians in the way Parliament works and in the way CSIS and 
SIRC operate.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have been told that the cost of a royal 
commission of inquiry would be in the order of $9 to $25 
million. We are a government striving to limit costs and I 
believe that the people have demonstrated, again and again, that 
they want better control of spending.
<P>
	Since a royal commission of inquiry like the one proposed by 
the opposition would cost between $9 and $25 million, I am 
curious to find out the real cost of the sub-committee chaired by 
my colleague, and I would like to know whether this 
sub-committee can exercise substantially the same authority as 
a royal commission?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for the question.
<P>
	On the question of cost, as Canadians know and members 
know, every member of Parliament is paid a salary. Each 
committee and subcommittee will have a clerk, a researcher and 
such other staff as the committee may need but within a budget 
that comes from the House of Commons, all of which is 
relatively closely controlled these days.
<P>
	The cost of the members of Parliament, the cost of the offices, 
the cost of the office space-we are not going to go out and lease 
a floor of an office building somewhere in Ottawa. We already 
have committee rooms that will be put to use-are being 
absorbed almost exclusively at this point in the existing budgets 
of the House of Commons.
<P>
	In terms of the powers and the mandate of the subcommittee, 
or any committee of the House for that matter, those mandates 
are primarily set out in the standing orders of the House, but they 
are very general. The mandate of the subcommittee in this 
instance is more than adequate to cover the subject area that we 
are dealing with.
<P>
	As I stated earlier, the power to compel attendance, the power 
to require disclosure are virtually absolute. I will not say they 
are absolute because there are very few absolutes left any more 
in law and politics. They are virtually and precisely as great or 
as small as the members of the House will them to be in their 
work, in committee or on the floor of the House.
<P>
	There is plenty of opportunity, mandate, power and resources 
to do the job.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse):</B> Mr. Speaker, through 
you, I would like to tell the hon. member for 
Scarborough-Rouge River that I share his views regarding the 
powers of the sub-committee he is chairing and the authority of 
Parliament to review all decisions made by government 
agencies.
<P>
	The problem is neither with the Sub-committee on National 
Security nor with the hon. member for Scarborough-Rouge 
River, the problem is with the people who make up the review 
committee, SIRC, who, when they appeared before the 
sub-committee on September 13, hid behind a particular 
interpretation of section 54 of the act when refusing to answer 
the questions of members duly elected to this House.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6342"> 6342 </A></B>
<P>
	This is the problem, a problem which will last as long as this 
Parliament: How to get answers from these people? This is why 
a royal commission of inquiry seems appropriate. Looking at 
what goes on in the United States before parliamentary 
commissions reviewing national agencies, we can probably say 
that if American witnesses were to behave the way our 
witnesses behaved before the sub-committee, they would be 
sent away for a while to think about it.
<P>
<B>(1525 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee:</B> Mr. Speaker, I suppose it is fair to say that my 
colleagues in putting the matter the way he has, makes a point. I 
cannot disagree that the Security Intelligence Review 
Committee appears to be less than forthcoming when it comes to 
the subcommittee's needs.
<P>
	I hope he will acknowledge that there is a certain amount of 
bridge building and educating going on, both with respect to the 
goals and powers of the subcommittee.
<P>
	I would not expect that everybody who comes in the front door 
of a committee room is going to know right away the extent of 
the powers that committees may have from time to time, 
especially in light of the history of this place.
<P>
	These powers have not been used effectively or clearly over 
the last several decades. As a result not only do ordinary 
Canadians not realize the under utilization, but in my view 
looking in other areas it appears that the courts themselves are 
not fully aware of parliamentary law and of the implications of 
sections 4 and 5 of the Parliament of Canada Act. It is not their 
fault. This is perhaps the fault of Parliament itself, which may 
have over the last few decades, maybe the last 50 years or so, 
failed to develop in the modern context. This is a challenge for 
all of us now. I hope the current exercise will play a part in that 
development.

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Fine.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, let there be no doubt about it, the 
Canadian Security Intelligence Service is a good thing per se. 
We are not questioning the fact that we need such an agency. The 
problem is that somehow CSIS is the offspring of the RCMP. If 
the past is any indication of the future, there is trouble ahead. 
This is the reason why we want to make sure the agency is 
properly monitored.
<P>
	There are many examples illustrating the fact that with this 
kind of agency, it is important to have appropriate safeguards to 
differentiate between a security mandate and the mandate to 
defend a particular government or party.
<P>
	In the past, on several occasions, the RCMP interfered with 
the democratic activities of political parties, which resulted in 
the creation of CSIS. When the membership list of the Parti 
Quebecois was stolen in 1973, I was probably on it together with 
a number of members of this House. It was totally illegal and 
irrelevant.
<P>
	Following that, CSIS was created, but it seems that history 
repeats itself. We now have a critical situation in which a 
well-known political party, an opposition party, the Reform 
Party, is being spied on and we do not seem to be able to shed 
light on the whole thing. This is not due to bad faith on the part 
of parliamentarians or the committee members, but rather 
because not enough light is being shed.
<P>
	When we ask for a royal commission, the argument regarding 
its costs is no more valid that in the case of the Canadian justice 
system. You could say that it would be easier to solve problems 
by chopping off people's heads and hands than by bringing them 
to court and allowing them to present their defence. You could 
easily say that. Similarly, you could say that a royal commission 
is not worth it because it costs too much. Some principles are not 
a matter of cost and, in all fairness, it has to be mentioned.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	For example, in the present case, if someone acting for CSIS 
has infiltrated the Reform Party and in so doing ultimately 
influenced the election results, even if only in a limited way, it is 
casting doubt on the very basis of our system and I believe it 
warrants a thorough examination. We must ensure there is no 
unacceptable situation casting a shadow on our democratic 
system.
<P>
	There is another reason for ensuring that members of 
Parliament are able to verify more directly and specifically if 
agencies like the Canadian Security and Intelligence Service 
abide by their mandate. Let me read a few excerpts from the 
agency's 1993 public report. We can see that, sometimes, 
members of agencies such as this one share opinions that are 
very close to being partisan or akin to a particular vision about 
the country's evolution. Those who do not think the same way 
are outlawed. They can no longer be full members of society.
<P>
	For instance, we can read that ``more important is the fact that 
the increase in the number of independent power centres in the 
world brings forth an increase in the number of potential 
threats''. In other words, everything would be fine if there was 
only one country in the world and if everyone was alike. It would 
be so much easier to administer, but that is not the way it is. 
There is a value judgment about a society's future in that kind of 
statement. I think that if, on the one hand, an agency like the 
Canadian Security Intelligence Service is going to  adopt such 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6343"> 6343 </A></B>
<P>
an attitude, we, on the other hand, should make sure that a good 
eye is kept on it and that changes be made if need be.
<P>
	There is another excerpt that makes me wonder and, in my 
view, argues for monitoring. It says that, while the RCMP is 
responsible for enforcing the law, CSIS collects information and 
provides operational or tactical advice on individuals, groups or 
activities that may constitute threats to the security of Canada to 
enable the government and police authorities to act.
<P>
	It would be important to know what they mean in that kind of 
agency by ``groups or activities that can constitute threats to the 
security of Canada''. I could be of the personal view that what 
constitutes the greatest threat to the security of Canada is the 
way the country is run, a view the government would certainly 
not share. The agency may consider that such or such political 
party constitutes a threat to Canada, as seems to have been the 
case. That too is unacceptable.
<P>
	So, based on the experience of past abuses by the RCMP and 
the attempt to remedy the problem by establishing CSIS, one 
critical step remains to be taken: we must get to the bottom of 
the matter and know everything there is to know about the 
agency, its mandate, the way it carries it out and all this 
information must be made available to the people in whom the 
public has placed its confidence, that is, the elected members of 
Parliament.
<P>
	Some may say that reports are made to the Solicitor General 
CSIS activities, but these reports are confidential. We can 
understand that certain aspects must remain confidential, that 
certain matters must not be debated publicly, but reports could 
be submitted in camera to a parliamentary committee 
responsible for ensuring that things are done according to the 
law and depending on the circumstances.
<P>
	I will give you examples of reports filed by the SIRC, the 
Security Intelligence Review Committee, which are classified 
secret or top secret. That is how they are classified. They deal 
with security screening on university campuses. It is rather 
important to know why this kind of agency is involved in 
security screening on campus. Is there another witch hunt on? Is 
what happened in the United States 30 or 35 years ago going to 
happen here now? What makes one person on campus a threat to 
the security of Canada and not another? There may be very 
clear-cut cases as well as abuse. We need to make sure 
appropriate control is exercised over all this.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	There is another study whose title in itself is so ambiguous, it 
would be worthwhile to look into it. I am talking about the CSIS 
regional studies. What do they need regional studies for? Did 
they find that the people living in a region where the 
unemployment rate reaches 20, 25 per cent are more dangerous 
than the residents of a community with an unemployment rate of 
10 or 12 per  cent? What is in these studies? These are things we 
should be able to look into.
<P>
	There is another document I would like to mention, namely 
the review by SIRC of CSIS activities involving Aboriginal 
Canadians. Why should Aboriginal Canadians be the subject of 
separate investigations? Why are such investigations being 
conducted? When they told us the titles of these studies and said 
they received studies on this, they suggested that there were 
specific reasons for investigating these groups, that is, 
university campuses, Aboriginal Canadians and various other 
groups, although there is no evidence that the report eventually 
submitted contains any accusations. All we know is that there 
was an investigation.
<P>
	It is a little like when someone is accused of something in a 
newspaper, only to be acquitted three months later. The acquittal 
headline is one inch high while the accusation is announced in 
two-inch-high letters but the effect is the same. The decision 
has already had a negative effect, which I think is quite 
unacceptable.
<P>
	I would like to give you another quote from the public report 
which outlines what we should expect in the future. It says that 
in general, the world has become less predictable and the power, 
more diffuse. It means that our society is undergoing all kinds of 
changes so that the people monitoring them must follow global 
developments closely and be able to understand exactly what 
they mean.
<P>
	Without judging the quality of SIRC's current membership, it 
can be said that the current situation is rather hard to accept 
because some of these people have been appointed on the 
recommendation of parties sitting in the House of Commons 
during the last Parliament. No Bloc or Reform member was 
involved in appointing these people. SIRC members have very 
few links with the current Parliament, even with the Liberals, 
because most of them were appointed from the Tories' list.
<P>
	For all these reasons, I think that the government should agree 
to the opposition's request so that we can meet the goal set when 
CSIS was founded, namely to achieve the most appropriate level 
of transparency in the delicate field of security and prevent past 
excesses from occurring again in the future, especially now that 
Canada faces major political challenges. The democratic debate 
must in no way be undermined by institutions exceeding their 
mandates.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General):</B> Mr. Speaker, I find it very strange that reference is 
again made to history being a guide to what will happen in the 
future. To be sure, the United States had the McCarthy affair and 
the Rosenbergs. France was involved in sinking Greenpeace's 
ship, the <I>Rainbow Warrior</I>. We have seen all sorts of abuses in 
other countries but nothing like that has happened here.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6344"> 6344 </A></B>
<P>
	Certainly, if someone wants to make a comment-and this 
is getting to the question which I would like to ask the hon. 
member-last night, Bernard Landry was on the CBC talking 
about Quebec's delegates general abroad and he wanted to know 
if they were true sovereignists. I think he threatened them with 
dismissal if they were not.
<P>
	This is another demonstration of intolerance towards the 
opinions of all Quebecers, if their opinions do not suit the party 
in power. But I can tell you this, Mr. Speaker; at least we set up a 
committee of inquiry, a sub-committee, chaired by one of our 
own people, but also with members of the Bloc Quebecois and 
Reform Party represented, which will shed light on this matter. 
Nevertheless, I would like to remind the hon. member that some 
of his colleagues in Quebec want to investigate good Quebecers 
whom they do not think are true Quebecers.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, what the member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine says makes me even more 
suspicious, because there is a very big difference between that 
and saying publicly: ``We will ensure that appointees conform to 
our objective as a government, which the people gave us; our 
objective is to make Quebec sovereign and we will give 
ourselves the democratic means to achieve this result.''
<P>
	This is very different from giving a mandate to an agency 
whose composition you do not control that will investigate 
subjects that you do not know-you do not know what they are 
investigating or how they will do it. Between these two ways of 
governing, I have just found another reason to make Quebec a 
very different country from Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General):</B> Mr. Speaker, I find these comments very regrettable. 
Canada is a tolerant society, but it is not right, now that there has 
been a change of government, to point a finger at people who 
have served in the Quebec government, who have tried to 
promote Quebec's development outside that province and who 
have convinced foreign investors to come here. There is a lack 
of continuity and, unfortunately, I think all this is beginning to 
sound like McCarthyism: you are not true Americans, you are 
not real capitalists, etc.
<P>
	It is unfortunate. This is what makes that argument a 
dangerous one. This is the reason why the government seeks to 
promote tolerance and welcomes opposition members and 
stakeholders to come and voice their concern and views on how 
to manage CSIS.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine is comparing apples and 
oranges. We are talking here about a dramatic situation. We are 
not talking, as I said earlier, about people who have been 
mandated by the public and who form a proper and transparent 
organization.
<P>
	We are talking about situations such as investigating the CBC, 
a national broadcasting network, or Mr. Bristow having 
infiltrated the Reform Party. In my opinion, CSIS is an 
organization which, in a way, chooses its own clientele. In the 
seventies barns and farms had to be set on fire before 
investigators were hired to set up the security intelligence 
service. Nowadays, they try to influence recognized political 
parties, enough to warrant investigation.
<P>
	There is a true lack of transparency which must be corrected. 
Indeed, in a society, it is important to know what is going on, 
otherwise perceptions from the past will persist in the future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to preface my speech by pointing out that a review 
committee was set up in 1990 precisely to reform the CSIS Act. 
The committee members were astonished to find out about 
another organization called the Communications Security 
Establishment, commonly known as CSE, and the extent of its 
powers.
<P>
	CSE comes directly under the Department of National 
Defence. It is a collateral organization similar to CSIS. 
According to the sub-committee's estimates, CSE has a 
supposedly secret budget of about $200 million, even though the 
House of Commons or any of its committees or sub-committees 
has no say in CSE's activities.
<P>
	As I said, CSE's budget is buried away in the overall budget of 
the Department of National Defence so that we cannot come up 
with an exact figure. Using estimates, the sub-committee 
reckoned at the time that CSE had a budget of about $200 
million over which we have no control.
<P>
	Even worse, the members of this 1990 review committee 
reported that even SIRC had no say in CSE's intelligence 
activities. In 1990, this committee made 117 specific 
recommendations.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	Since then, only two or three of these recommendations have 
been adopted, and by the previous government at that. Why? 
Because the committee recommended that the Communications 
Security Establishment be formally set up by a piece of 
legislation that we could oversee, examine and review.
<P>
	The committee also wanted SIRC to ensure that CSE's 
activities were carried out in accordance with the law and to 
report to Parliament.
<P>
	Why were the members of the 1990 review committee so 
concerned, and what exactly is CSE? In an article published last 
May, the daily newspaper <I>Le Droit</I> explained a little bit what 
could be learned about CSE and I quote: ``The Communications 
Security Establishment carries out its activities in total secrecy, 
resorting to electronic surveillance to pick up messages from 
many areas of the world. This high-tech equipment, which is 
worth tens of millions of dollars-and is apparently among the 
most sophisticated in the  world-can pick up messages to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6345"> 6345 </A></B>
<P>
troops stationed in Siberia or even listen to your own private 
telephone conversations with friends overseas.'' All that in the 
name of security.
<P>
	CSE provides intelligence services akin to those of CSIS, but 
without reporting to Parliament. Both agencies also signed a 
memorandum of understanding on cooperation. The activities 
that are carried out in the Chomley Building, in Ottawa, where 
hundreds of CSE employees work on nine floors full of top 
secret electronic surveillance equipment, are very similar to 
those of the CSIS.
<P>
	The same year, the <I>Ottawa Citizen</I> reported that a device 
supposedly allowed CSE to listen to 10,000 telephone 
conversations all at the same time and to tape specific ones on 
``Iran'' or ``sovereignty'', for example, just by entering these 
words in a computer. But it seems we are safe.
<P>
	Does CSE communicate its intelligence to CSIS? We do not 
know. Does CSE violate Canadian laws? We do not know. No 
citizen, no member of Parliament and no member of SIRC 
knows. Nobody knows. Yet, according to the Solicitor General 
and his parliamentary secretary, the hon. member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, SIRC is supposed to 
review intelligence services on behalf of the members of 
Parliament who are democratically elected by the people.
<P>
	How many untold Bristow cases are still to be unveiled inside 
CSE? It is difficult to say. One has to wonder if ministers across 
the aisle know more about this than Opposition members. We do 
not believe they do.
<P>
	CSE has a staff of 900 civilians and about 1,000 members of 
the Canadian Armed Forces. It has facilities everywhere in 
Canada: in Ottawa, in the North and in large cities.
<P>
	I would like to read another excerpt from the article published 
in <I>Le Droit</I> which says: ``The work of the CSE is so secret that its 
1,000 or so employees are asked never to travel on commercial 
flights in case the plane is hijacked or they are taken hostage''. 
But there is nothing to worry about, right?
<P>
	Does the CSE gather information on legitimate political 
parties such as the Reform Party and the Bloc Quebecois? We do 
not know. Can a citizen make a formal complaint to a monitoring 
agency? The answer is no. Why do we have a charter of rights 
and freedoms if CSE employees can, whenever they wish, listen 
to our phone conversations without prior judicial authorization 
and without ever having to report to a parliamentary body or an 
intelligence agency?
<P>
	In short, the CSE is not monitored by Parliament nor by any 
other body. The government does not want to ask SIRC to review 
the activities of the CSE. Nobody knows why. And the 
Sub-Committee on National Security that everybody on the 
government side is raving about cannot get any answers from 
members of SIRC and, I will say it again, has no authority over 
the CSE.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	But there is nothing to worry about. Or so we are told.
<P>
	That is why we need a royal commission of inquiry to explain 
to all Canadians and Quebecers as well as to members of this 
House how intelligence agencies and secret services are 
constantly keeping track of what we say and do.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to hear my hon. colleague's remarks because I am 
particularly qualified to answer at least some of them.
<P>
	I am the author of a book called <I>Best Kept Secret</I> that deals 
with the early history of the CSE and brings it up to the present. 
It was published last November. The member is welcome to get 
it. I regret however it was published only in English, but I would 
greatly appreciate it if the member could find me a French 
publisher, a Quebec publisher, so it would be available to him in 
the language of his choice.
<P>
	The history of the CSE goes back to the second world war. I 
will help the hon. member by giving him some background. It 
was part of the allied effort in code and cipher breaking during 
the second world war. It began with the examination unit that 
was in the house next door to the Prime Minister's residence 
during the second world war.
<P>
	It was engaged in breaking codes and ciphers primarily 
Japanese and Vichy French. The breaking of codes and ciphers 
was a shared arrangement, both diplomatic, economic and 
military during the second world war. The Americans 
specialized in Japanese ciphers in particular and the British 
specialized in German and Italian. The Canadians were left with 
some Japanese and Vichy French.
<P>
	The reason Canadians got involved-and this is important so 
the member will understand the perspective right now-was that 
Canada was the best country in the world for picking up radio 
signals. It was because of the radio skip phenomenon where the 
radio waves bounce in the atmosphere and come down in various 
parts of the world at focal points. Canada was excellently 
situated to pick up all kinds of messages. That is how we got 
involved.
<P>
	Naturally during the second world war this was a highly secret 
endeavour. It went into the post war period. Canada continued to 
be involved first as the communications branch under the 
National Research Council and subsequently it became the 
Communications Security Establishment.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6346"> 6346 </A></B>
<P>
	There is no secret about what the Communications Security 
Establishment does. If the member would look at my book, I 
cite in it a particular presentation before a committee, the name 
of which is in my book, by the deputy clerk for security 
intelligence, Ward Alcock, a couple of years ago. He explained 
that the mandate of the Communications Security 
Establishment was to listen in on telecommunications 
worldwide, just as do the Americans, the Australians and the 
British. The idea was to try to pick up intelligence that may 
have a bearing on Canada's political and economic security.
<P>
	There might be a case where Canada has entered into 
international agreements and one party or another is not obeying 
those agreements. Am I going on too long, Mr. Speaker?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Does the member have a 
question or a comment?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> I am coming to it. I will speed it up. I am sure my 
hon. colleague is interested because it is apparently-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> With the greatest of 
respect to all colleagues in the House, the member spoke for 10 
minutes and we have 5 minutes for questions or comments. 
When I rose for questions or comments there was more than one 
member rising. I would like to keep the debate flowing as much 
as I possibly can, for and against, so we might have the best 
possible debate in the Chamber.
<P>
	I would ask the member for Hamilton-Wentworth to 
conclude his remark or ask the question directly to the member 
for Terrebonne.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will try to make it a very quick 
question then. I am sorry for the delay.
<P>
	In a situation where an organization is charged with 
monitoring foreign intelligence sources, does the member agree 
it is very difficult to bring it before a parliamentary committee 
for open examination because of the tremendous political, 
social and economic implications of possible leaks of 
confidentiality?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sauvageau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think that, as elected 
representatives, we are entitled to know the main organizations 
who manage this country and Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	The hon. member opposite said: ``We monitor conversations 
that can be detrimental to national unity''. Given what we hear 
in this House, does that mean they can eavesdrop on 
conversations in Quebec? Surely not, but one has to wonder.
<P>
	Concerning the translation of his book, he could have done 
like one of his former colleagues, Senator Hébert, and have it 
translated in the Senate. Our only question is: Why should we 
have a security intelligence service without any supervision 
scanning the airwaves and recording conversations around us?
<P>
	My hon. colleague wrote a book on secret services. I would 
like to know why the 117 recommendations made by the 
committee have never been implemented. If there is no secret, 
why do we read things like this: ``The CSE headquarters is 
located in the south end of Ottawa in a building surrounded by a 
high fence topped by barbed wire. The roof is covered with a 
myriad of antennas, but the name of the occupant is nowhere to 
be seen. If you try to take a picture-and let this be a warning to 
Canadians-you will most probably be challenged within 
minutes''. But there is nothing secret.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened carefully to what my colleague, the member 
for Terrebonne, had to say and it frightens me in a way. We all 
know that the SIRC was created following enquiries. I am 
talking particularly about the Keable enquiry which was held in 
Quebec towards the end of the 1970s. It was sparked by a 
unimportant event. A former RCMP officer had been caught 
placing a bomb. Somehow this expanded and led us to find out 
about very disturbing facts.
<P>
	The RCMP had set fire to a barn, stolen lists of Parti 
Quebecois members, illegally opened mail-a totally 
democratic way of doing things after all-placed bombs and 
written false press releases in the name of the FLQ. Those events 
made us realize the need for a special service, one which would 
be totally independent from the RCMP, the Security Intelligence 
Review Committee.
<P>
	Given what we are learning today, given the reasons why the 
committee was established, given the fact that it is totally 
impossible to know what is happening there, even though we 
repeatedly made requests, does the member feel that security is 
now better, worse or equivalent to what it was in those days?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sauvageau:</B> Mr. Speaker, first, I would like to thank my 
colleague from Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies. I want to tell him 
that I feel less secure, especially when we hear the number one 
officer of CSIS say to the committee which is supposed to solve 
all the problems: ``I have learned never to say yes or no.''
<P>
	That is what the number one officer of the Canadian Security 
Intelligence Service says. He says to the subcommittee which is 
supposed to solve all the problems: ``We do not need any royal 
commission because we have a subcommittee. I have learned 
never to say yes or no.'' The other witnesses appearing before 
the subcommittee never want to answer the questions.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6347"> 6347 </A></B>
<P>
	Therefore, do I feel secure? No. Do we need a royal inquiry 
commission that would be independent instead of a 
subcommittee with a majority of Liberals? My answer is yes.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Maria Minna (Beaches-Woodbine):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to speak to the opposition motion. The motion is to 
denounce the government for not appointing a royal commission 
to inquire into the ``illegal activities of the Canadian Security 
Intelligence Service''.
<P>
	The hon. member is putting the cart before the horse. Why 
would the government wish to mount a royal commission when 
there has been no evidence of illegal activities? It is true there 
have been allegations of wrongdoing but they are just that, 
allegations.
<P>
	Yet on the strength of unproven allegations the member 
wishes the government to mount a royal commission which 
would cost the taxpayers of the country hundreds of thousands 
of dollars. The hon. member may be prepared to take such 
liberties with the public purse, but the government has made it 
clear that it is committed to a program of fiscal responsibility.
<P>
	Fiscal considerations aside, there is a more serious concern 
raised by the hon. member's motion. Implicit in the wording of 
the motion is the idea that the Canadian Security Intelligence 
Service is an organization that is not subject to the authority of 
Parliament or to any type oversight mechanism. This motion, by 
suggesting such an idea, does a grave disservice to the 
reputation of CSIS and to the House which in 1984 put in place 
an extensive array of legislative safeguards and oversight 
mechanisms to ensure accountability, control and review of 
CSIS activities. Operating within this legislative framework, 
CSIS has proven itself to be a responsible security intelligence 
agency on a professional par with those of other western 
democracies.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	Central to the control and direction of CSIS are the principles 
of ministerial control and accountability which are also central 
to Canadian parliamentary democracy. The CSIS act ensured 
that the minister would have full knowledge and power of 
direction over the policies, operations and management of CSIS. 
Subsection 6(1) of the CSIS act is unequivocal in its message 
that the minister provides direction to the director of the service.
<P>
	The CSIS act also supplied the minister with the means to 
control and guide the service. Ministerial control is to be 
distinguished from ministerial accountability. Though they are 
sometimes used interchangeably, the terms have distinct 
meanings. Control refers to the minister's power of approval, 
the minister's ability to set policy and give direction and the 
means at the minister's disposal to ensure that decisions are 
implemented.
<P>
	Accountability refers to the minister's obligation to answer 
before Parliament and the duty of officials to answer to the 
minister. A principal means by which the minister exercises 
control over CSIS is through the power of approval. By the 
normal rules of government, a minister must be consulted on all 
important matters related to the minister's portfolio.
<P>
	In addition, the CSIS act and ministerial directions issued to 
the service require the minister to personally approve a wide 
variety of operational activities, particularly sensitive 
operations. The CSIS act stipulates that the minister must 
personally approve all applications for judicial warrants, all 
CSIS arrangements with other federal agencies and 
departments, provincial authorities and foreign governments, 
and the service's assistance in the coalition of foreign 
intelligence in Canada.
<P>
	The minister also exercises control over the service through 
statutory power to establish the policy guidelines for the 
service. This is achieved through the issuance of ministerial 
directions.
<P>
	An act of Parliament can construct a legislative framework 
but legislation alone cannot provide detailed guidance covering 
every aspect of operational activity.
<P>
	For this there needs to be a policy framework to assist 
interpretation and implementation. Legislation governing the 
creation of a security intelligence agency has a special need for 
such a policy framework if there is to be public confidence in 
how the agency operates.
<P>
	Policy frameworks in support of legislation are normally 
achieved in two ways; through the formulation of regulations 
and the development of operation guidelines. Neither 
mechanism however is entirely satisfactory in the security 
intelligence context.
<P>
	Regulations as public instruments are obviously unsuited for 
conveying detailed instructions on how secret operations are to 
be conducted. Internal agency rules on the other hand would not 
provide a sufficient level of confidence.
<P>
	A third device was therefore embodied in the legislation in the 
form of ministerial direction issued pursuant to subsection 6(2) 
of the act. Ministerial direction helps to ensure that the Solicitor 
General is the linchpin of the legal and policy framework.
<P>
	In practice the minister issues all instructions of consequence 
in written form regardless of subject. Through the experience of 
working with the CSIS act the government now defines direction 
pursuant to subsection 6(2) as ``written instructions of a 
continuing nature issued at the prerogative of the minister that 
relates to policy standards or procedures''.
<P>
	The strategic work for ministerial direction is clear. Over the 
last 10 years a set of ministerial directions has been developed 
setting out the Solicitor General's governing principles for the 
service and its activities. The directions may be grouped into 
seven major categories relating to; arrangements to assist the 
director's  accountability to the minister; the government's 
annual priorities for intelligence on threats to Canada's security, 
known as the ``national requirements''; guidance on the 
service's statutory duties and functions; guidance on 
investigative 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6348"> 6348 </A></B>
<P>
methods and techniques; instructions dealing with the service's 
corporate management practices; standards for negotiating 
co-operative arrangements with domestic and foreign 
organizations and, policy and file mismanagement issues, 
particularly the service's retention of files inherited from the 
RCMP security service.
<P>
	Currently some 50 ministerial directions are in effect. 
Directions are converted by the service into operational 
procedures for use directly by CSIS staff. This logical 
progression from statute to ministerial direction to operational 
procedure provides a manageable and auditable means of 
ensuring that the service is fulfilling its duties and functions in 
an appropriate manner. I remind all members that SIRC is 
copied on all these directives.
<P>
	There is also great provision in the act for accountability. A 
general direction also exists to ensure the director's 
accountability to the minister. It describes the roles and 
responsibilities of the Solicitor General, the Deputy Solicitor 
General and the director and outlines formal reporting 
requirements such as the director's obligation to prepare an 
annual report. The minister has also established guidelines for 
the scope and content of the director's annual report.
<P>
	Direction on service operational policy in respect of the 
service's security intelligence mandate is particularly important 
to ministerial control. It ensures that the service's collection, 
analysis and reporting activities respond to the government's 
annual national requirements for security intelligence and 
provides practical guidance in interpreting important 
terminology of the CSIS act.
<P>
	The operational methods also are clearly laid out. A general 
direction on the conduct of investigations serves as an umbrella 
for other more specific directions providing guidance on 
operational methods. It implicitly endorses the five 
fundamental principles for controlling investigations espoused 
by the McDonald commission. The rule of law must be observed 
at all times.
<P>
	The investigative means used must be proportionate to the 
gravity of the threat posed and the probability of its occurrence. 
The need to use various investigative techniques must be 
weighed against possible damage to civil liberties or the 
valuable social institutions.
<P>
	The more intrusive the technique, the higher the authority 
required to approve its use. Except in emergency circumstances, 
the least intrusive techniques of information collection must be 
used before more intrusive techniques are applied.
<P>
	A direction on joint operations recognizes that in certain 
circumstances Canadian security interests may demand the 
active presence in Canada of investigators  from foreign 
security and intelligence organizations. The principles that are 
to guide the service's activities in this field are that Canadian 
sovereignty and law are to be fully respected and protected; the 
objective and potential product of the co-operation must be of 
benefit to Canada and serve Canadian national interests; and 
CSIS must exercise effective control of the co-operative 
activity.
<P>
	A direction on foreign investigation provides guidelines 
governing the service's foreign investigative activity in relation 
to threats to the security of Canada. It stipulates that the 
approval of the Solicitor General is required before CSIS may 
undertake operational activity abroad.
<P>
	The direction applies to human source travel, foreign security 
intelligence investigations by CSIS officials and service 
operational assistance abroad to foreign security and 
intelligence organizations.
<P>
	A direction on domestic liaison provides guidance on the 
establishment of arrangements between-

	The House resumed at 4.25 p.m.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Maria Minna (Beaches-Woodbine):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
was talking about liaison and co-operation. Direction on 
domestic liaison provides guidance on the establishment of 
arrangements between the service and other federal or 
provincial institutions. A primary example is the ministerial 
direction on RCMP-CSIS co-operation.
<P>
	The principles governing domestic liaison ensure that 
arrangements are consistent with the service's mandate and that 
they are in place when there is a requirement for access to 
information, operational support, information exchange or 
organizational consultation.
<P>
	Similarly a direction on foreign liaison sets out principles to 
guide CSIS in the establishment and conduct of liaison with 
foreign security and intelligence organizations. The Solicitor 
General will issue new directions as necessary to ensure that 
Canada has a responsive and responsible security intelligence 
agency.
<P>
	Other cornerstones of the accountability framework 
established by the CSIS act of 1984 were the review roles of the 
Security Intelligence Review Committee and the Inspector 
General of CSIS. SIRC has a mandate to review the propriety of 
CSIS activities, with emphasis on the delicate balance between 
national security and individual freedoms. Section 38 of the 
CSIS act directs SIRC to review generally its performance in the 
service of its duties and functions.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6349"> 6349 </A></B>
<P>
	This includes reviewing such things as CSIS annual reports 
and certificates of the Inspector General, ministerial direction, 
CSIS arrangements with domestic and foreign governments and 
agencies, section 20 reports on unlawful conduct, and 
regulations.
<P>
	Section 40 of the legislation makes SIRC responsible for 
reviewing the service's compliance with the CSIS act, its 
regulations and ministerial direction, as well as reviewing CSIS 
activities to ensure they do not involve an unreasonable or 
unnecessary exercise of powers.
<P>
	An equally important review function is carried out by the 
Inspector General of CSIS. The post of Inspector General is 
unique; it has evolved over time in response to practical 
experience and ministerial expectations. The basic role of the 
Inspector General is to conduct independent internal reviews for 
the minister.
<P>
	The CSIS act identifies three interlocking functions for the 
Inspector General: to review the operational activities of the 
service, to monitor the service's compliance with its operational 
policies and to submit certificates to the minister.
<P>
	To ensure the Inspector General is able to exercise these 
functions effectively, the act stipulates that the Inspector 
General is entitled to have access to ``any information under the 
control of the service'' that relates to the performance of the 
functions of the office and to receive from the service ``such 
information, reports and explanations'' as the Inspector General 
deems necessary. Under section 31 no information other than 
cabinet confidences may be withheld on any grounds.
<P>
	I have provided this detailed overview to illustrate the 
comprehensive type of legislative safeguards and oversight 
mechanisms in place to ensure that CSIS operates within its 
mandate and within the law at all times. Taken together these 
safeguards and oversight mechanisms provide a solid legislative 
foundation for CSIS that is in keeping with the best traditions 
and principles of a free and democratic nation.
<P>
	The motion before the House would have us turn our backs on 
these traditions and principles and on the years of work and 
experience that went into creating a modern and effective 
legislative framework to govern Canada's national security 
system.
<P>
	I am sure the hon. member's motion was prompted by concern 
for the wellbeing of our national security system. However I 
would suggest we wait for the SIRC review and the work of the 
standing committee, of which hon. members across the way are 
members, before we draw final conclusions.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened carefully to the comments of my hon. 
colleague who just gave us a list of the legislative authorities 
which would allow us, according to her, to make sure that the 
Canadian Security Intelligence Service is a body that we can 
control to a certain extent.
<P>
	She also said that, to some degree, CSIS is accountable to 
ministers who are empowered to control its activities.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	I would like to repeat to my hon. colleague that the RCMP was 
also, in fact, a regulated body and accountable to ministers. That 
did not prevent it from committing inexplicable criminal 
abuses. We now have created a new Canadian Security 
Intelligence Service. We put into place legislative measures and 
we now pretend that the problem no longer exists. What 
difference does my hon. colleague see between the situation that 
existed from 1970 to 1980 and the current situation?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Minna:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is not exactly the same. I believe 
the controls on CSIS currently are much stronger.
<P>
	The allegations that have been made against CSIS and 
discussed in the House, if they were true, and I stress the word if, 
I believe there would be cause for us to be concerned and for the 
government to take a look at how the issue might be addressed or 
what things might need to be changed.
<P>
	However, we do have a process in place. SIRC does have 
authority to investigate all of the activities of CSIS. The 
standing committee, as the hon. member said earlier, is also 
holding hearings. Some members opposite are members of this 
standing committee. They will also be having hearings and 
reviewing the reports that SIRC has. They will be meeting in 
front of SIRC yet again.
<P>
	If at the end of that process, when the report from SIRC comes 
out and when the standing committee reports to the House on 
this issue, at that point if hon. members still have problems or 
this government finds that there are major problems we would 
be the first to deal with the issue.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to at least allow for the process 
to go through and for the standing committee of the House, 
which is representative of members of this House, to go through 
the process rather than engage in a major royal commission 
which, as I said earlier, costs a great deal of money as we all 
know. Royal commissions do not always wind up when they are 
supposed to wind up and they are quite a cumbersome process to 
set in place when we already have a process. There is no need to 
duplicate that process at this time.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6350"> 6350 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose):</B> Mr. Speaker, the reason 
CSIS was formed was due to irregularities in surveillance by 
the previous security organization under the control of the 
RCMP.
<P>
	It is well documented that the RCMP broke the laws of 
Canada investigating a legitimate political movement in 
Quebec. It is also well documented when this illegal behaviour 
was revealed the government of the day not only authorized 
deep investigation but also formed CSIS so its actions would be 
responsible, law-abiding and within the scope of the law.
<P>
	Now we have independent concern that CSIS may have 
encouraged a private citizen to gather information on another 
legitimate political movement.
<P>
	What is the difference between the activity of the former 
security service and the alleged illegal activity of CSIS? I do not 
see any difference.
<P>
	On page 48 of the Security Intelligence Review Committee's 
annual report it states, under the heading surveillance that SIRC 
is concerned about the large amount of information gathered by 
CSIS in the course of surveillance operations. On the same page, 
under sensitive operations, SIRC also is concerned that CSIS 
undertook a sensitive operation when no definite indications 
existed that there was actual or potential reason for the 
intelligence activity.
<P>
	On page 47 of the same report SIRC expresses concern about 
the targeting of surveillance. It stated on one occasion the reason 
for surveillance, and in this case stretched its meaning too far.
<P>
<B>(1635 ) </B>
<P>
	SIRC is telling Canadians that CSIS had no real reason to 
target or conduct surveillance on its target, but it began and 
continued to monitor and observe its target even though SIRC 
confirmed it had no legal authority to engage in that behaviour.
<P>
	SIRC also stated that CSIS used inappropriate or imprecise 
reasons based upon section II of the CSIS act to target for 
surveillance. SIRC stated that CSIS had difficulty 
understanding what was considered an actual threat to the 
security of Canada. Yet there is no reference that SIRC ordered 
CSIS to better understand and follow the legislation that 
governs its operations.
<P>
	There is another instance in the annual report where SIRC 
indicated that CSIS targeted another investigation improperly. 
SIRC announced when reviewing the reasons for the 
investigation that its investigators said CSIS did not have any 
justification to pursue its surveillance. Again SIRC reported 
CSIS was running amok, but there is no record of SIRC doing 
anything about it.
<P>
	The act governing CSIS states quite clearly that CSIS must 
not have used and cannot use its powers unreasonably or 
unnecessarily and must perform its duties and functions 
effectively, efficiently and, most of all, legally.
<P>
	If CSIS paid a private citizen to infiltrate, assist in forming 
and spreading a message of supremacy, that clearly illustrates 
that CSIS violated the abuse of powers section of the guiding 
principles in the CSIS act.
<P>
	If CSIS allowed this same private citizen to encourage white 
supremists to join and infiltrate a legitimate political party, that 
is certainly violating the concern about abuse of power.
<P>
	The Reform Party of Canada is not a group of terrorists. It is 
not a group of agents of hostile intelligence services and it is 
certainly not a threat to the security of Canada. The Reform 
Party, whether this government likes it or not, is the party of 
choice for the law-abiding citizens of Canada.
<P>
	How can this Liberal government expect law-abiding citizens 
to continue their respect for the law when a government agency 
is accused of blatantly and with disregard for the legitimate 
purpose break the law with impunity?
<P>
	At the very least the government watchdog for illegal activity 
by CSIS, the Security Intelligence Review Committee, must 
announce to Parliament in no uncertain terms if CSIS allowed its 
informant to be a mole in the Reform Party, if CSIS allowed its 
informant to encourage white supremists to join the Reform 
Party? If this occurred SIRC must make that knowledge known 
to the entire public.
<P>
	If CSIS knew the private citizen was actively involved with 
white supremists, becoming active in the Reform Party would 
publicly damage the reputation of this legitimate political 
movement.
<P>
	SIRC and CSIS are responsible to Parliament for their actions 
and Parliament is responsible to the people of Canada. At the 
very least, this Liberal government must tell the people of 
Canada whether CSIS allowed a loose cannon to sully a 
legitimate political party.
<P>
	If CSIS was actively involved in initiating a supremist group, 
forming a supremist group and funding a supremist group 
through the actions of their informant, full disclosure of this 
despicable act will not be a threat to Canada's security or to 
Canadians.
<P>
	If CSIS was involved the only threat full disclosure will have 
is to the authorities in charge of CSIS.
<P>
<B>(1640 ) </B>
<P>
	Considering if the illegal activity was sanctioned by those in 
charge, this Liberal government must give a full, detailed and 
in-depth disclosure to all parliamentarians and the people of 
Canada the reason CSIS considered a legitimate political party, 
my party, the Reform Party of Canada, a target for surveillance.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6351"> 6351 </A></B>
<P>
	Since this Liberal government refuses to initiate a royal 
commission into the possible illegal activities of CSIS we must 
consider why this Liberal government is trying to hide behind 
secrecy and the CSIS act. All Canadians must consider why the 
governing party in the House of Commons refuses to initiate 
a thorough investigation of possible illegal activity by a 
department of government, displaying a total disregard for the 
laws of this land.
<P>
	A previous government not only investigated illegal activity 
by Canada's previous secret service, it disbanded the 
organization and formed a new service.
<P>
	No one is suggesting this Liberal government waste tax 
dollars disbanding and organizing a new service. All Canadians 
are strongly telling this Liberal government a full investigation, 
detailed disclosure and removal of those from CSIS, if any, who 
had knowledge of and supported any illegal activities must take 
priority over any minor embarrassment that this government 
could suffer.
<P>
	To refuse a full inquiry and detailed disclosure to Parliament 
tells Canadians this government condones unnecessary secrecy 
and is now abusing the trust given to it by the people of Canada.
<P>
	This Liberal government may full well claim it does not or did 
not have anything to do with the possible illegal activity of CSIS 
because it was not in power when this activity occurred. 
Refusing to have an investigation into what may have been done 
will not satisfy the law-abiding people of Canada.
<P>
	This Liberal government has everything to lose by not holding 
a full inquiry. It will lose the trust of Canadians and as a 
governing party that loss of trust can never be regained. That 
loss of trust may continue diminishing government in the eyes 
of Canadians, and that can never be allowed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with great interest 
to the comments made by the hon. member. I can assure the hon. 
member that no one on this side considers the Reform Party a 
terrorist organization.
<P>
	There are all kinds of allegations out there on improprieties 
and we have set up a mechanism, SIRC, which was established 
10 years ago as he very well knows, to look into those kinds of 
allegations.
<P>
	Furthermore, we have gone one step further. In co-operation 
with the opposition benches, Bloc and Reform we have set up a 
subcommittee on national security issues. One hon. member 
dealing with this subcommittee has done commendable work. 
We are looking forward to all the proposals made by the 
opposition. We are awaiting reports from SIRC. I believe the 
subcommittee is going to pursue its research on these 
allegations made against the service.
<P>
	I want to make sure it is perfectly clear to the opposition 
benches that never would this government condone spying on 
legitimate political organizations such as the Reform Party and 
the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	Since Reform is so concerned about accountability and the 
way we spend money and controlling the deficit, does the hon. 
member really believe that by spending $20 million to $25 
million on a royal commission we would not be better served by 
giving the subcommittee on national security issues the time and 
the chance to look into this and as well as SIRC to report to us 
and Parliament on what happened or what has allegedly 
happened? I would like to know if it would be preferable for us 
to wait before spending $20 million to $25 million of taxpayers' 
money.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. 
member for his assurances with regard to the feelings of the 
Liberals about this particular activity.
<P>
	I am shocked that anybody from that side of the House would 
suggest that spending money is wrong. Good grief, it has not 
shown it in any other direction or area. Spending money has 
become a very positive, happy thing for this group to do.
<P>
	I certainly do not believe for a moment that there would be 
any reason to think this kind of investigation would call for that 
kind of money. I am pleased to see that this committee has been 
set up and I hope this government can assure us that once that 
committee has finished its investigation the Canadian people, 
not the Reform Party, who have a right to know are thoroughly 
satisfied that this thing is resolved and if not would it please 
assure us that we will get to the bottom of it and that it must 
never occur again in this kind of activity.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a very quick question.
<P>
	The member mentioned in his speech that a parliamentary 
review must be taken which would cost $25 million because 
CSIS is accused of breaking the law. The word the hon. member 
used was accused.
<P>
	Does the hon. member not think we should wait until there is 
some evidence before we actually launch such an expensive 
inquiry rather than going on the basis of an accusation?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I certainly would not suggest 
for a moment that we run hairy-scary into some kind of thing 
that is going to cost millions of dollars. I do not think I indicated 
that at all.
<P>
	I did indicate that there is a special group of people put 
together called SIRC and I think it has a big responsibility to 
report everything that happens and when I suspect for a moment 
and when we have reasons to suspect that is not happening, my 
question in return would be is this Liberal government going to 
make absolutely certain that these people who are on the payroll 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6352"> 6352 </A></B>
<P>
are going to be accountable to the Canadians in  earning the 
bucks that they make. Are they going to do their job or not? Do 
we have to go to extremes such as a royal commission?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I can assure the hon. member that 
members on this side of the House are planning to take their 
work very seriously and we have countless assurances that 
members of the security committee including members on the 
opposite benches are going to look through this thoroughly.
<P>
	I hope, thanks to the questions raised by the hon. member and 
his colleagues, that we are going to clarify this thing once and 
for all.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am really pleased to speak to this motion. I think there is always 
a place for this kind of debate. I do not feel this motion is 
correct. I do feel it is flawed. Nevertheless I think it is always a 
topic that we on all sides of this House should look at from time 
to time.
<P>
	Let me address the motion first and foremost. The word used 
in the motion is ``illegal''. A royal commission is to be called 
because of alleged illegal activities. This appears to rise from 
allegations in the press, in the media, this is the way we 
understand events, that would suggest that CSIS has been 
involved in impropriety that requires an investigation.
<P>
	I would like to address that because one of the accusations in 
the press was that the CBC was being spied on by CSIS. I think it 
was that story more than anything else that fueled the reaction 
that has led to the debate we have before us and the various 
studies that are going on as to CSIS activities.
<P>
<B>(1650 ) </B>
<P>
	I would like to comment on the story that was in the Toronto 
<I>Star</I>. I have a document here and I wish to show it. It is relevant. 
The headline from the Toronto <I>Star</I> states: ``Spy agency kept 
watch on CBC''. I believe this was a page one story at the time.
<P>
	Naturally a headline like that is going to cause a lot of concern 
on all sides of the House and with the public at large. When one 
examines the actual body of the story that is in question here 
about the CBC being spied on by CSIS, one discovers that this 
headline is entirely based on one paragraph in the story. That 
paragraph reads: ``The source reported attempts by Howard 
Goldenthal, a researcher for the Fifth Estate, a CBC program, to 
obtain information from the Heritage Front leader Wolfgang 
Droege about whether members of the Canadian airborne 
regiment in Somalia had any links with racist groups in 
Canada.»
<P>
	It was the Fifth Estate, a CBC program, but it could have just 
as easily been a CTV program or it could have been an inquiry 
from the press itself. What we really see here is the informant 
replying to a legitimate concern that was connected to the 
possibility that there was racist infiltration of the Canadian 
airborne regiment.
<P>
	I think we would all agree that it is legitimate for CSIS to want 
to examine possibilities such as there may be infiltration of the 
Canadian forces by a group that represents racist elements. That 
was the tenor and the content of that particular story. However, 
the headline was: ``Spy agency kept watch on CBC''. This is the 
sort of headline that has probably generated more than anything 
else this type of public concern.
<P>
	At issue there is the whole question that we are pursuing 
something, and I mentioned it to the member for Wild Rose, 
where a whole debate has been initiated on the basis of 
allegations and not evidence. I cite that as an example and there 
are other examples in the media that are basically only 
allegations that are not supported in any way by fact that we 
know.
<P>
	Before we go to a royal commission I stress to the members 
present that we have to go a little further than allegations that 
appear in the press.
<P>
	I would like to go on a bit further. This situation concerns me 
greatly. We have story that suggests that CSIS had an agent, an 
undercover person, in an organization that may have sometimes 
been associated with very right wing activities, and that this 
agent may have engaged in activities as part of his cover that 
could be construed as right wing or even racist.
<P>
	What is the difference between this person, if he really did 
exist, and a police undercover operation involving a 
plainclothes person penetrating a drug ring? Surely we would all 
agree that it is perfectly proper for a police agency in an effort to 
expose crime, in an effort to ferret out threats to national 
security or municipal security, if you will, to have an undercover 
agent and we would expect as part of that cover that the agent 
would take on the persona of the group he is trying to penetrate.
<P>
	I will take that a step further. I do not have any background 
any more than any other member here about what was actually 
occurring. I submit that if this Grant Bristow was an undercover 
agent doing a legitimate task for national security and as a result 
of the leaks to the press has been disrupted in a project that had 
great value to the security of this nation, then I would say 
something very unfortunate has occurred.
<P>
<B>(1655 ) </B>
<P>
	We should be disparaging of what occurred, not coming down 
on CSIS on mere allegations. CSIS, because it is a security 
agency and an agency engaged in secret intelligence, does not 
have the ability to speak out and simply defend itself without 
jeopardizing agents like somebody who may be doing an 
undercover operation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6353"> 6353 </A></B>
<P>
	There is another issue here, the whole question of the leak 
of the documents that led to the disclosure that CSIS was 
engaged in certain undercover operations.
<P>
	The one involving the Heritage Front I do not know what 
damage is involved and I do not know whether it is true. 
However, I will draw the House's attention to something 
everyone seems to forget. There was a first leaked newspaper 
story in connection with this business. That leaked story 
resulted in a headline in the Toronto <I>Sun</I> on August 13, 1994, 
sometime before the Toronto <I>Star</I> headline that I mentioned, and 
it stated: ``CSIS-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. Colleagues, there 
is a rule which refers to our not being able to use any form of 
exhibits in the House. I know that quite often all of us engage in 
quoting from materials, including the newsprint, which is 
correct in debate, but certainly I would encourage all members 
to be mindful of the rule regarding exhibits and not to display 
them in an open fashion to the attention of viewers or others in 
the House. I would ask the hon. member for 
Hamilton-Wentworth to continue his intervention.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> Mr. Speaker, I stand corrected on that. I will 
read the headline because it is not relevant to display it: ``CSIS 
spied on metro Somalis''. The gist of the story, based on a leaked 
document, was that CSIS did have agents engaged in some 
undercover work in connection with the Somali community 
because it feared that there were some violent elements in this 
community that were a threat.
<P>
	Certainly with the very recent history of the problems in 
Somalia, we would all agree that CSIS had legitimate cause for 
concern. We would probably also agree that its wanting to get 
information from the Somali community in this case was proper.
<P>
	What is not proper is the fact that this document was leaked 
and the story appeared in the newspaper. I do not fault the 
newspaper because newspapers must run with the information 
they receive. The fault was the fact that a document was put out 
that very obviously was designed to or at least would have had 
some result in damaging a very legitimate operation on the part 
of CSIS.
<P>
	That brings us to a very important point which is that we 
should be deploring in this House the fact that somewhere along 
the line the system went awry and that an individual in a trusted 
post was able to collect CSIS documents with the apparent 
intention of leaking them to the newspapers for whatever 
reason. We can only be grateful that the Toronto <I>Star</I> actually 
ran a photograph of one of these leaked documents leading to the 
person who was leaking them.
<P>
	I do not want to sound very narrow and rednecked about this, 
to use that expression, but I really do hope that the government 
does take some very positive steps-and I hope it has the 
mechanisms-to prevent civil servants and people in trust from 
leaking documents of this nature. We must have orderly 
government, be it in connection with the secrets or intelligence 
agencies or  cabinet confidentiality or whatever. This was a very 
serious precedent and we should all be concerned.
<P>
	I believe I have time to move on to another topic which is the 
issue of accountability that has been raised time and time again 
and which I believe is the aim of the motion. It is a very 
important issue. I have heard the speakers on all sides and heard 
the explanation from my own members on the structure that has 
been set up to try to make CSIS and the Communications 
Security Establishment accountable.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	In the final analysis, when any agency or any government 
department is engaged in secret work, as many are-the 
military, for example, certainly is engaged in secret work; it has 
to do military testing and that kind of thing-the guarantee of 
accountability is the quality of the civil servants and the strength 
of democracy.
<P>
	We can put the legislative controls in place but nothing is 
guaranteed because people work of necessity in the shadows. 
When we are dealing with foreign intelligence or 
counterintelligence we have to work in the shadows. Despite 
what has been said I do not really believe that members opposite 
think we can expose that to parliamentary committee 
examination. It really is impractical. We would lose all our 
allies if we did that, at the very least.
<P>
	It still is a problem. How do we bridge the gap of confidence 
in the personnel who are engaged in activities that are not 
immediately seen, that are not laid out before you?
<P>
	The answer ultimately is having a strong democracy and a 
strong screening process. The only thing I would add to that, and 
it is a pet thing with me, is that I would have a very carefully 
documented accountability.
<P>
	Over and above what we have heard here, the only way we can 
control these individuals who must work behind the scenes, is to 
require them to put their orders always on paper and have this 
paper record preserved in perpetuity. We have to have a control 
that will not allow people to destroy records.
<P>
	I believe when democracy is strong with a strong and 
dedicated bureaucracy, the control on the bureaucracy for doing 
the right thing when it has to operate in secrecy is to be 
answerable to history. When the historian comes along 30 or 40 
years later and looks at it and sees that even if the decision was 
marginal or borderline or questionable, at least he sees the 
bureaucracy operated in good faith. The vast majority of people 
in our bureaucracy, certainly in this country, operate in a spirit 
of good faith and try their very best. This is an important point to 
bear in mind.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6354"> 6354 </A></B>
<P>
	I will conclude by talking about the future of CSIS. This also 
is at stake in this debate, the fact that the world has changed 
radically, as we know, with the collapse of the Soviet Union 
and so forth. This has to and must change the face of 
counterintelligence.
<P>
	CSIS is primarily a counterintelligence agency. We must be 
very clear on that. New threats are spread across the board. We 
now have situations where very small countries can pose very 
great threats. We all realize there is a terrific problem now in 
keeping controls on plutonium. The great stocks of plutonium 
that exist in the former Soviet Union may pop up in any third 
world country. I regret to say that the technology for making 
small bombs is well known. This is a fundamental threat.
<P>
	Fundamental again is the threat of biological and chemical 
warfare agents, particularly biological warfare agents. These 
are the weapons and dangers of very small nations. We have to 
have a constant and very alert secret service that examines these 
dangers worldwide. We also have to examine these dangers 
internally.
<P>
	We have an open door immigration policy, which I think is 
wonderful, but we have to understand that with that open door 
immigration policy we are also open to genuine security threats. 
It is not just obvious criminals, but the ones that are not obvious, 
the ones that may be carrying the torch of hatred from the 
animosities of their homelands which they might employ 
against other ethnic groups in Canada. We must have a strong 
organization to look at that.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	I have one more thing to say. This pertains to the 
Communications Security Establishment, which we alluded to 
before. The world is a global village. The threat now goes 
beyond just security threats. The threats are also economic and 
political. We have to be aware of the fact that Canada is a nation 
that relies enormously on trade.
<P>
	I see the Minister for International Trade is here. He will 
agree with me that Canada's future is delicately balanced on our 
ability to compete worldwide. Not every country competes 
fairly. Some countries are willing to resort to intelligence 
gathering in various ways and in other illegal activities, which 
may affect our ability to trade honestly and adequately.
<P>
	The role of our intelligence organizations involves making 
sure Canada is always dealt with fairly. We must have a strong 
intelligence service that will back us up because the record of 
history shows, going back to previous centuries and this century, 
that a nation with a strong intelligence service will use it and use 
it sometimes, I hate to say, on the weaker. We must be strong in 
order to compete.
<P>
	Finally, if ever there was a reason against separatism, against 
the break-up of the country into smaller pieces, it is the expense 
of running a comprehensive and professional intelligence 
service.
<P>
	If we separated, the new piece-a separate Quebec-would 
have to set up its own intelligence service. It would lose all it has 
gained from the very fine intelligence services that we have had 
since the second world war. It would be on its own and it would 
not have friends. That is a very dangerous situation to be in.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
thank the hon. member for his comments. I listened to them 
carefully. He cautioned members of the House, correctly so, that 
we should not condemn CSIS simply based on allegations and 
rumours or innuendo.
<P>
	Yet I have sat in the House and listened to members across the 
way label members of the Reform Party as racists and bigots. I 
have heard those words spoken in the House. In fact the Deputy 
Prime Minister had to recall the fact that she called one of our 
members a racist during debate. That is on the record.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</b> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order 
concerning unparliamentary language. I would like to know 
if the hon. member has any source or if this is actually 
printed in <I>Hansard</I> .
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I am not aware of the 
allegations or of the exact scenario that has been referred to, but 
I will take the time to remind everyone that in the conduct of the 
business of this Chamber we should all be respectful of one 
another and this institution.
<P>
<B>(1710 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would just conclude that those 
kinds of comments we have been subjected to without proof, 
without evidence have been done simply for the purpose of 
political partisanship.
<P>
	I would like to ask the member if it is a fact that this Bristow 
individual infiltrated the Reform Party in order to discredit it, 
who would benefit from that? Why would anyone in CSIS want 
to discredit the Reform Party of Canada?
<P>
	My analysis of this situation is that no one would want to take 
the time or energy in order to discredit the Reform Party. But 
who would benefit from it if the Reform Party was in fact 
discredited? It would be the political parties because we were 
vying for support from the Canadian public.
<P>
	Is it not reasonable that these two bodies, SIRC as well as the 
subcommittee, should examine whether the Solicitor General of 
the day politicized CSIS in order to do that very thing and 
received the benefit that would come if this party was 
discredited by those kinds of labels? I would ask my hon. 
colleague to comment.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6355"> 6355 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> Mr. Speaker, I certainly think that the 
examination of this issue should go wherever the parliamentary 
committee deems it ought to go and call whatever witnesses the 
committee thinks appropriate.
<P>
	I do point out that there is an enormous assumption of 
dishonesty here. Is my colleague opposite suggesting that the 
previous government was so corrupt, and it would be corruption, 
that it actually could politicize CSIS and do what he said? 
Otherwise, unless that assumption is made there is no reason, no 
motive to believe that this Mr. Bristow did infiltrate the Reform 
Party.
<P>
	I submit that the apparent lack of motive makes it enormously 
probable that this did not happen.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Liberal 
member who just spoke mentioned the role of CSIS in 
connection with our economy and the protection of our patents 
here in Canada. I know that several years ago, there were 
frequent complaints that Canada was a sitting duck for this kind 
of espionage. I think that was one of the roles CSIS had to play.
<P>
	Since the hon. member appears to be very familiar with the 
agency, with CSIS, I want to ask him, since we want an inquiry, 
whether this could also be part of the inquiry, in other words, 
why Canada is a sitting duck for industrial espionage. We are 
told it is terribly easy. People come from all over the world and 
apparently have no trouble taking or stealing-I think that is the 
word-something on which we have spent a lot of time and 
effort.
<P>
	Since we do a lot of research in this country, why is it so easy 
to come and steal the results of our research? Perhaps this should 
be included in the inquiry the Bloc Quebecois is calling for, so 
we could find out what the problems are and why it is so easy to 
get away with that.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question. I think it was a very good one indeed.
<P>
	The reason Canada has been perceived in this way-and I 
think it is a very serious problem-is that perhaps not enough 
money has been invested in CSIS in the past. Perhaps CSIS has 
not had the support it deserves. I am aware that there was a major 
investment in CSIS just recently. A new CSIS building has just 
gone up south of the city here. I think progress is being made.
<P>
	I do not think a royal commission, if I may say to my 
colleague, is the way to go in getting to the root of his particular 
concern which I share. I think this should be the subject matter 
of the appropriate parliamentary committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose):</B> Mr. Speaker, in my 
speech I used the word if quite often, as did the hon. member 
across the way. We have a couple of speeches with a lot of ifs. I 
think his if was a little bigger than my if. He was talking about it 
being a shame if Mr. Bristow happened to be on the right track of 
something and this whole thing interfered with it.
<P>
	I know what I believe. I do not think there is any doubt about 
it. One thing that has been lost in the country is the trust of the 
people who sent us here. That trust has been lost in the public. 
All we have to do is open our ears and listen to the fears of 
people about corruption, suspected corruption or supposed 
corruption, for the last 30 years.
<P>
	So far no one has accused me of it, but I have seen surveys 
asking people what is the most popular occupation or who are 
the most valuable persons in the country. When we see doctors 
and teachers on the list and find politicians underneath lawyers I 
think we in the House have something to think about.
<P>
	I like the assurances of the parliamentary secretary, but I am 
afraid assurances like those ones have become nothing more 
than political rhetoric for Canadians. They have heard it before. 
They probably heard it before that hon. member was born. It has 
been going on and on.
<P>
	What does the member suggest as a basis of the ongoing 
studies on what actions SIRC should take when it has obviously 
identified some serious problems? What actions does he think 
the committee will take if it verifies even some of the 
allegations?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member commented on 
the public's lack of trust. I submit to him that we do not help the 
public's confidence or trust when we engage in major, shall we 
say, witch-hunts based on unsubstantiated allegations as in this 
case and as occurred many times in case of the previous 
Parliament. When the House is drawn into debate and people 
make allegations across the floor without proper evidence we 
erode the public's trust.
<P>
	On his other comments, I cannot forecast what a review 
committee or the people reviewing the matter ought to do until 
they see the evidence. They will make their own decisions.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to also 
rise in support of this motion put forward by my colleague, the 
hon. member for Bellechasse, whose riding happens to be next 
to mine. I think it would be worthwhile to remind the hon. 
members that the motion in question reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House denounces the government for its refusal to set up a Royal 
Commission of inquiry on the alleged illegal activities of the Canadian Security 
Intelligence Service.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I listened with interest to the remarks made by previous 
speakers and I think that what the opposition is  suggesting is not 
that all activities of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service 
be abolished but rather-and the Bristow affair was the pretext 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6356"> 6356 </A></B>
<P>
for introducing this motion-to ensure that the Canadian public, 
and particularly the government and the House of Commons, be 
as well informed as possible on the activities of the Canadian 
Security Intelligence Service.
<P>
	The public has reason to believe that illegal activities have 
taken place. During hearings held by the House sub-committee 
looking into this matter, our colleague, the hon. member for 
Berthier-Montcalm asked a number of questions which, to tell 
the truth, remained unanswered for the most part. That is an 
important fact.
<P>
	I think that the Canadian public, the Canadians taxpayers who 
are paying to receive services, are entitled to get as much 
information as possible. Often members are asked questions and 
if those of us who sit on committees are unable to get the 
information required to answer these questions, how are we 
expected to adequately inform the public?
<P>
	This motion is about setting up a royal commission of inquiry 
to do everything possible to make sure that, at least the members 
of Parliament sitting on the commission, hear all the facts.
<P>
	Let me tell you about my personal experience as a Quebecer. 
It is a fact that we have gone through some rather quiet times, 
but I recall an event that many Quebecers of my generation 
remember. There was this incident in 1973 when a barn was 
burned down and a list of members of the Parti Quebecois, 
illegally seized. Quebecers of my generation remember that 
incident. The younger people were not around then and cannot 
remember, but it has remained in the minds of many Quebecers.
<P>
	At that time, some measures were taken; then there was the 
Keable Commission which was finally able to establish that 
some illegal acts had been committed. Of course, not as many 
people were convicted as should have been, but the facts were 
proven. After that, there was a relatively quiet period.
<P>
	In spite of all that, in the more recent past-I refer to a certain 
affair which I prefer not to name-there was evidence of an 
attempt to infiltrate not a political party but the Government of 
Quebec.
<P>
	The Bristow affair is another case that has come to our 
attention. Everyone saw it on the news.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	This was not just an attempt; another political party was 
actually infiltrated. This time it was not the Parti Quebecois but 
the Reform Party. I find such infiltration unacceptable on purely 
``democratic grounds''.
<P>
	Problems of infiltration by secret agents from foreign 
countries were mentioned. That may be, but since the Berlin 
Wall fell, I do not think that there is a really big threat from 
foreign sources. I listened to my colleague from Longueuil; yes, 
a security intelligence service may  indeed be necessary, but it 
must operate legally, within a legal framework.
<P>
	The issue here is not the one raised by the member for 
Longueuil, but rather illegal activities. Given what such a 
security service costs, I think that not only Quebecers but all 
Canadians are entitled to answers.
<P>
	I will mention some questions that could be raised in a royal 
commission of inquiry. Has CSIS directly or indirectly obtained 
information on Canadian media or political parties since 1989? 
We admit that we must not go back too far, but since 1989. Yes or 
no? We were unable to obtain that information. Without 
necessarily disclosing the information itself. However, if the 
answer is yes, it should perhaps be studied by a sub-committee. 
There could be some really important things. We should at least 
know whether or not information was gathered directly or 
indirectly on the Canadian media or on recognized Canadian 
political parties. Not small groups from abroad but legally 
recognized political parties that are among this country's 
democratic institutions.
<P>
	Could we have an answer on this? That is the kind of question 
to which Canadians would like an answer.
<P>
	Did the Inspector General of CSIS and the Security 
Intelligence Review Committee find cases where information 
was gathered on the media, unions, political parties and other 
legitimate Canadian organizations?
<P>
	Rightly or wrongly, as a member of Parliament, and before 
that as a member of public organizations, people told me 
personally on many occasions-that is not hearsay-of their 
concerns regarding some individuals then involved in militant 
and union activities-I could give examples of CSIS 
collaborators infiltrating the CNTU, a major union body in 
Quebec. Infiltration may be acceptable but I think that 
dynamite, arson and theft warrant investigation.
<P>
	I have a general question: What is the basis-I would very 
much like to know that-and the scope of the contacts which 
CSIS has with foreign intelligence services and with the 
Communications Security Establishment of the Department of 
National Defence? This should not be an official secret. What is 
the basis and the scope of the activities of that service? We 
should be allowed to know that. Why is it not the case?
<P>
	Does CSIS receive information from other Canadian or 
foreign intelligence services on activities conducted by 
Canadians within our borders? If so, is the receipt of such 
information by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service legal 
under the CSIS Act? Is it legal or not? Bench marks are required. 
If such bench marks exist, then they must be known.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6357"> 6357 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	In the Bristow case, when did CSIS become aware of Mr. 
Grant Bristow's participation-this is very important-in 
political events held by the Reform Party of Canada? Did CSIS 
end its relation with Mr. Bristow at that point?
<P>
	Regardless of its nature, has information gathered by Mr. 
Bristow been used for judicial purposes, in Canada or 
elsewhere, since 1989? Yes or no? These questions do not touch 
upon official secrets, and they can be answered by a simple yes 
or no. We could not find out.
<P>
	These vague answers, or even the lack of answers, leave 
Quebecers and Canadians with an uneasy feeling which may 
well undermine their confidence in certain institutions. Yet, we 
should reinforce public confidence in those institutions. The 
setting up of a royal commission of inquiry, as suggested by the 
Official Opposition, is justified since it would hear all those who 
can shed some light on certain activities. I am alluding to 
presumably illegal incidents. The idea is not to question the 
system as a whole but, rather, some specific actions and facts.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like again to say to the 
opposition that the Canadian Security Intelligence Service does 
not cover the legitimate activities of any advocacy or protest 
organizations. It does not spy on legitimate organizations like 
political parties or unions, as the member opposite claimed.
<P>
	Again, the opposition keeps harping on about events which 
took place over twenty years ago. Since then, we have had the 
McDonald Commission which helped to create the civil service 
as we know it today as well as SIRC. I also have the feeling that 
the opposition tends to remember only what suits its philosophy, 
and that is unfortunate.
<P>
	Last night, as a Quebecer, I was very disappointed by the new 
Quebec government, when I heard Bernard Landry himself state 
publicly that he would weed out federalists hiding in all the 
Delegations General of the province of Quebec and that he was 
appointed to find out if they are true sovereignists. Sometimes, I 
think the opposition should look at itself and ensure that the 
government of Quebec will still respect the great majority of 
Quebecers who are federalists and not separatists.
<P>
	I still want to point out to the hon. member opposite who is 
yelling at me that Canada is, after all, a land of open arms, a free 
country that first and foremost respects individual freedom. I 
think our government has made a commitment to examine in 
detail the allegations made against our services and to take 
remedial action if needed.
<P>
	So, I do not see why we should spend $20 million to $25 
million on a royal commission of inquiry, when we have not yet 
completed our own investigations, mainly through the 
Sub-Committee on National Security and the upcoming SIRC 
report. However, I want to add that I am deeply disappointed by 
the hon. member, who  belongs to a separatist party in the 
province of Quebec and wants to weed out the federalists, as 
suggested by Mr. Landry. I think this is unacceptable in a 
democratic society such as ours.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, this is a funny way of getting out of a 
predicament. If we were in the military, we would say it was a 
good diversion tactic.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	While talking about shifting the limelight to the National 
Assembly and what is going on in the new government in 
Quebec, incidentally, before 1976 we had a Liberal government 
that had an intelligence gathering services referred to as the 
CAD, which the Parti Quebecois government-I realize the hon. 
member for Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine is too young 
to remember that, but this may be useful to other people who are 
listening-later removed.
<P>
	What we are talking about today, however, is the Canadian 
Security Intelligence Service. As for shifting the focus to 
Quebec- The hon. member's answer is particularly disturbing 
since he is saying, more or less, that now the National Assembly 
has a new Parti Quebecois government, the separatists are in 
power, and the hon. member gets all upset and blurts out this 
type of question. The more I hear this ``nervous'' reaction the 
more I am convinced we should be concerned about the 
activities of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service. I must 
say that to me, this kind of nervous-Nellie reaction to the new 
Parti Quebecois government is all the more reason to support the 
motion standing in the name of the hon. member for 
Bellechasse.
<P>
	I would just like to remind this House that the members of the 
Bloc Quebecois and the members of the Parti Quebecois were 
elected in the same way as the hon. member. I respect the fact 
that he was elected to represent another party in my province. I 
respect him as an elected representative, elected by constituents 
who put their trust in him. However, when he goes on in this 
way, he infers that the people of Quebec-and I will not be 
unparliamentary-showed poor judgment in electing members 
of the Parti Quebecois, and because of that, people should be 
wary and feel insecure about this new government, but after all, 
like the members of the Reform Party who were elected in 
Western Canada by people who used their good judgment, after a 
democratic debate, these people were elected to represent them.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a question for my hon. colleague.
<P>
	Sometimes separatists say that after separation the new 
Quebec can still retain a shared currency with the rest of Canada 
and even a shared citizenship, which is somewhat contradictory 
in my view.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6358"> 6358 </A></B>
<P>
	Does the member feel that the new, separate Quebec should 
also expect to share CSIS and the Communications Security 
Establishment?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, although more calm than his 
predecessor, the hon. member nevertheless suggests, when 
talking about separatism, that we are wicked people who wish to 
inflict hardships on members on the other side, whereas we wish 
to remain good neighbours and friends as much as possible.
<P>
	As regards the question, you will understand that I represent 
the Official Opposition in the House of Commons. I am willing 
to act as a messenger or an interpreter and to pass on the 
question, but I think that it should be answered by an elected 
Parti Quebecois government after it has won the referendum. 
Therefore, I believe the question is rather premature or that it 
should be asked instead during a referendum campaign. Please 
understand that as a member of the opposition, I have no precise 
mandate to talk in the name of the Government of Quebec. That 
could be the kind of service that could be maintained.
<P>
	I take good note of the member's question and I thank him for 
his interest but this is all I can do for the time being. As a 
member of the opposition I am more used to asking questions 
than to answering them.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</b> Mr. Speaker, I would like to point out to the 
hon. member that he does not represent all Quebecers, and 
neither do we, I admit.
<P>
	But we have to take into account the commitment of our 
government, of this sub-committee, which is to look at this 
question in depth. I believe that today's question was to 
determine whether or not we needed a parliamentary 
commission. This sub-committee includes one member of the 
Bloc Quebecois and one member of the Reform Party, and along 
with them some of us on this sub-committee want to shed some 
light on the allegations against the Canadian Security 
Intelligence Service.
<P>
	I can assure the hon. member that once the reports of the 
sub-committee or even the SIRC have been submitted to 
Parliament, he will have the opportunity to look at them, and 
make enlightened judgments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, my answer will be very short, as 
requested. It is precisely the lack of clear answers and, in some 
cases, the total lack of answers that the member for 
Berthier-Montcalm who represented our party on the 
committee had to endure, which motivated the opposition.
<P>
	If, during the summer, the member, acting as our official 
representative, had been able to get the answers he was looking 
for, obviously this motion would have been very different. In our 
view, if the government is willing to change its attitude and 
wants to get to the  bottom of this, as we do, the only way to 
proceed is to call for a royal commission. This is what we 
contend.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Paddy Torsney (Burlington):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the 
interest of time I think I might begin with my conclusion and 
then get to the beginning part.
<P>
	It is my feeling the hon. member's motion is flawed and that it 
assumes the veracity of the recent allegations that have come to 
light in the media. The allegations have in no way been 
substantiated by fact or tested by the accountability of the 
system that is already in place in the CSIS act as it exists. The 
motion is premature, if not inappropriate at this time.
<P>
	The Security Intelligence Review Committee has appeared at 
the subcommittee of the House and offered assurances that its 
review of the matter will be painstaking, thorough and 
complete, and I expect nothing but that. The House should 
respect that commitment and await the outcome of the 
legislative process of review prior to reaching any conclusion on 
the matter.
<P>
	A basic principle of any democratic system should be the 
presumption of innocence. Unsubstantiated allegations which 
lead people to reach immediate conclusions of guilt fly in the 
face of this basic principle. Whether it is an institution or 
whether it is an individual, it is the responsibility of all of us to 
ensure that due process is followed and that only facts are 
entertained in reaching a decision.
<P>
	To date we have not been apprised of the facts. Nor have we 
been allowed due process to be followed. Sensationalism and 
innuendo, a lot of it in the House, have no place when we are 
dealing with national security issues.
<P>
	The CSIS act provides Parliament and all Canadians with both 
a process and an opportunity to reach factual conclusions. 
Regrettably in recent weeks we have seen a frenzy of 
unsubstantiated allegations and finger pointing that has 
undermined public confidence, about which many members 
have spoken today, in an important institution charged with 
significant responsibilities in ensuring the public safety of all 
Canadians.
<P>
	Members of the House, the media and all other Canadians 
have a responsibility in allowing the effective systems we have 
in place to run their course. Our national security ultimately 
depends on the public's confidence in the people and the 
institutions which are designed to ensure it.
<P>
	CSIS as part of this regime implicitly depends upon public 
co-operation to meet its mandate. It is our responsibility in the 
House to ensure that the review regime as prescribed in the CSIS 
act is allowed to run its course and address any doubts about our 
national security system.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6359"> 6359 </A></B>
<P>
	In the meantime members of Parliament should not 
encourage the distrust the member for Wild Rose spoke about. 
They should follow the process, review the information, and 
then if we are unhappy with the outcome the motion might be 
in order.
<P>
	It is important to remember how CSIS got here. In fact many 
members have spoken about that.
<P>
<B>(1745 ) </B>
<P>
	It has been 10 years since Parliament passed the act which 
created the Canadian Security Intelligence Service. This was 
done following lengthy deliberation and with the full 
participation of the then members of Parliament following the 
conclusion of the McDonald commission of inquiry into the 
activities of the RCMP security service.
<P>
	This latter inquiry was extensive and exhaustive in addressing 
concerns about the activities of the RCMP security service. The 
recommendation was clear that the national security interests of 
Canada would best be served by a civilian agency. I believe that 
the regime and the powers created by Parliament in 1984 by the 
enactment of the CSIS act fulfil the requirements of 
accountability to the Canadian people because the act itself 
fulfils the five basic principles which emerged from the 
McDonald commission.
<P>
	I will remind members of Parliament what those principles 
were. The first was the provision of security and intelligence is 
essential to the security of Canada. Second, there is an adequate 
legal framework within which a security service would 
co-operate under the rule of law while recognizing the 
democratic rights of all Canadians. The third was an effective 
management system to ensure responsible direction and a 
respect for the law. The fourth was effective accountability to 
ministers who are responsible to Parliament or responsibility 
subsequently assigned by Parliament to the Security 
Intelligence Review Committee. The fifth principle was 
openness to satisfactory external review, ensuring that the 
agency does not abuse its power and that it is not misused by 
governments.
<P>
	These principles were adopted by government in the drafting 
of the CSIS act and confirmed in Parliament in 1984. In 1989 
Parliament met the statutory requirement of the CSIS act by 
reviewing the effectiveness of the act and its stated objectives.
<P>
	It has been some five years since this review and I see no 
reason to question the validity of that document produced at the 
time. The recent flurry of allegations about CSIS are just that, 
allegations. The allegations have not yet been subjected to the 
full scrutiny of the review regime outlined in CSIS.
<P>
	It is worthy to note that the CSIS act is comprised of 29 pages, 
half of which are devoted to the control and review mechanisms 
applied to CSIS in the performance of its duties and functions. 
This fact alone should provide us with initial comfort in 
assessing the concerns that have been raised over the last seven 
weeks in the media. Each year for the last 10 years the House has 
been  provided with an annual report from the Security 
Intelligence Review Committee. While initially it was critical, 
it has in the last few years been much better and much more clear 
in its issues because of course CSIS is getting better and better in 
its operations.
<P>
	It is important to remember that here we are in 1994 and there 
still are threats to Canadian security. International terrorism 
remains a threat to world order. From time to time Canada is a 
base for activities in support of terrorism in other countries. 
Terrorist acts can have direct impacts on the lives of Canadians. 
The guests of Canada can also be the subject of terrorist threats.
<P>
	We do not want to be subject to violence in this country nor do 
we want our reputation as a nation internationally damaged. It is 
important to remember that this does exist. The technology of 
terrorism is becoming more accessible. The World Trade Centre 
bombing confirms that this is so. The sources of terrorism 
remain strong: nationalism, religious and political extremism, 
state sponsored terrorism, ethnic unrest and regional conflict.
<P>
	Canadians thankfully in recent years have been spared in large 
part from those acts of terror but we live in a world that is 
becoming increasingly smaller as a consequence of 
globalization. What happens in a distant part of the world can 
have an immediate impact in Canada. We are no longer isolated 
from what was at one time viewed as a far off regional conflict. 
We have responsibilities to assist our allies and protect 
ourselves in countering the effects of international security 
concerns.
<P>
	Our borders are long and open and we are part of a global 
transportation and communication system. Canadians and 
Canadian soil are not immune from security concerns. Terrorism 
is not an abstract force sowing its horror in a foreign land. 
Canada and Canadians are vulnerable and have been vulnerable 
in the past. Canada's evident prosperity and open society make it 
sometimes all too inviting a venue.
<P>
	The CSIS act defines the roles and responsibilities for the 
Solicitor General, the deputy Solicitor General and the director 
of CSIS.
<P>
	This regime provides a full measure of checks and balances in 
ongoing CSIS operations, particularly those of a most intrusive 
nature. Approvals are required from a federal court judge for the 
utilization of these most intrusive measures.
<P>
	This is a clear reflection of the priority and concern that the 
public and parliamentarians attach to the potential for abuse of 
power by a security service, given the extraordinary means that 
it would have at its disposal to intervene in the private lives of 
Canadian citizens.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="6360"> 6360 </A></B>
<P>
	As a member of Parliament, I am very concerned about this. 
For these reasons special care, precision and clarity were used 
in describing the mandate of CSIS in the act and the role of the 
various review bodies in control mechanisms.
<P>
	The system has evolved over a 10-year period and works 
effectively to guard the integrity of CSIS conduct. Certainly the 
process we are now in will determine whether that is the case.
<P>
	In addition to the the Security Intelligence Review 
Committee, the Solicitor General also has available the Office 
of the Inspector General to ensure CSIS complies with policy, 
procedures and ministerial direction. By international standards 
this is the most complex control and accountability system in 
the world. We should all be proud of that.
<P>
	This is what Canadians demanded in 1994 and creates the 
balance we see in the system today. Let us see the system work. 
Then we will have motions like this if they are appropriate and 
needed.
<P>

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 5.50 p.m., it is my

	<B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing)</B> 
moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should consider the 
advisability of reaffirming its commitment to seek to achieve the goal of 
eliminating poverty among Canadian children by the year 2000.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, as you have indicated, the motion that I 
seek approval for today is that the government should consider 
the advisability of reaffirming its commitment to seek to 
achieve a goal of eliminating child poverty among Canadian 
children by the year 2000.
<P>
	On November 24, 1989 the then member for Oshawa put 
forward a motion essentially in the same terms as follows: 
``That this House express its concern for the more than one 
million Canadian children currently living in poverty and seek 
to achieve the goal of eliminating poverty among Canadian 
children by the year 2000''.
<P>
	That motion received unanimous support from this House. All 
members present voted in favour of that motion. They voted to 
commit this country to eliminating child poverty by the year 
2000.
<P>
	That gave rise to Campaign 2000, a group of organizations 
fighting for the implementation of this motion, fighting to 
ensure that our most precious resource, the resource which will 
provide for our future, receives some attention in Canada today.
<P>
	As many will know, the number of Canadian children living in 
poverty has increased since that time, now amounting to some 
1.3 million children. Not only have we not brought a downward 
trend in child poverty, but in Canada it has increased.
<P>
	Canadians who care about children and children themselves 
will be watching Parliament's response to this motion. Does this 
Parliament care about children as it did in 1989? Does it want to 
reduce and move to eliminate poverty among Canadian children, 
our greatest resource? Does this Parliament view child poverty 
as an emergency situation, which surely it is in Canada today? 
Or will it try to turn a blind eye and a cold heart to those 1.3 
million poor children in Canada?
<P>
	At the end of my speech I will seek unanimous consent to 
make this motion votable, as it was in 1989, in the anticipation 
that this Parliament is as committed as the Parliament in 1989 
was to Canadian children. We may believe there are different 
ways to eliminate child poverty in Canada. We have different 
philosophical and economic perspectives on how to achieve this 
most important and laudable goal.
<P>
	It would be remarkable if anyone in this House would not 
support a motion to eliminate child poverty by the year 2000.
<P>
<B>(1755 ) </B>
<P>
	As I said, since 1989 child poverty has worsened in Canada 
and I would like to give some indication of how deep and how 
serious this matter is by quoting some statistics. I will do that at 
some length because I am sure many Canadians are unaware of 
how serious this problem is in Canada. They may have a sense of 
the numbers involved but I do not think many have a sense of 
how deep and how serious this problem is and how important it 
is in the long term for Canada because of the economic and 
social costs which are incurred as a result of not addressing this 
very serious social problem today.
<P>
	The high school dropout rate for children from poor families 
is 2.5 times that for non-poor families; children in families with 
incomes in the bottom 20 per cent of the population were twice 
as likely to be living in inadequate housing than in families with 
incomes in the top 20 per cent, and 1.4 times more likely than 
children living in middle income families.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6361"> 6361 </A></B>
<P>
	The infant mortality rate is twice as high among families at 
the lowest income level as it is among families at the highest 
level. Low birth weight is related to poverty as well; it is 1.4 
times more common among babies born in the poorest families 
than children born in the richest families. Children from low 
income families are 1.7 times more likely to have psychiatric 
disorders than children from other families and almost twice 
as likely to perform poorly in school and twice as likely to 
develop a conduct disorder, a behavioural problem.
<P>
	Teens in low income families are almost twice as likely as 
teens in higher income families to smoke and to have alcohol 
problems, and 1.5 times more likely to use drugs.
<P>
	Children who grow up in low income families are less healthy, 
have less access to skill building activities, more destructive 
habits and behaviour, live more stressful lives and are subject to 
more humiliation. In short, they have a less stable, less secure 
existence and as a result are likely to be less secure as adults.
<P>
	It is sometimes thought that people are poor because they do 
not work. Yet half those who live below the poverty line in 
Canada do work. Half of Canadians who are poor work to earn a 
living and still cannot sustain themselves above the poverty 
line.
<P>
	The total number of poor households has grown substantially 
over the last two decades. The number of poor families 
increased from 700,000 in 1973 to almost one million in 1992, a 
jump of 41 per cent. Similarly, the number of poor unattached 
individuals grew by 79 per cent. The total number of poor 
households in 1992, the last year for which numbers are 
available, was 2.36 million, an increase of almost a million 
since 1973.
<P>
	A family is five times more likely to be poor if the head of that 
family has not worked during the year. One earner families face 
four times the risk faced by two earner families. Twenty-five 
per cent of the heads of poor families and 15 per cent of poor 
unattached individuals work a full year, but in spite of this they 
are still poor.
<P>
	What distinguishes poor families from other families is on the 
whole lower levels of formal education and lower levels of 
employment.
<P>
	Let me say a brief word about aboriginal peoples because it is 
there where we find the greatest level of poverty. The incomes of 
aboriginal peoples tend to be lower than the incomes of other 
Canadians; almost one-half have incomes well below $10,000 
compared with one-quarter of other Canadians. Almost 
three-quarters of aboriginal peoples have incomes under 
$20,000 compared with only 50 per cent of other Canadians. The 
proportion of aboriginal people falling below the poverty line is 
increasing and is about 20 per cent higher than the Canadian 
population at large.
<P>
	Let me also say a word about persons who are disabled in 
Canada because that is another group that is over-represented in 
the poverty group. Those with disabilities are 25 per cent more 
likely to be poor than Canadians of the same age.
<P>
	Part of this problem is because income distribution in Canada 
is getting worse. The gap between rich and poor is increasing 
and is at around 1951 levels. The top 20 per cent of Canadian 
households, the richest 20 per cent, receive about nine times the 
income of the bottom 20 per cent. That gap is increasing in spite 
of some measures taken in the 1970s and 1980s.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	The number of poor families in the 1980s and 1990s increased 
by 18 per cent. One of the most significant increases was among 
younger families. We have essentially addressed to a large 
measure the problem of poverty among seniors because we 
cared that seniors who had provided so much to the country 
should be able to live their last years in dignity. We addressed 
the problem of poverty among seniors because we had the 
political will to do so.
<P>
	We sometimes hear from the government that more education 
is the answer to the problems of poverty that people face or the 
inability of people to participate effectively in the marketplace. 
Over the last decade it has become clear there is a large increase 
of families living in poverty whose heads have post-secondary 
degrees. The number of poor families where one or more of the 
adults held a post-secondary degree almost doubled in the 
decade of the 1980s. Therefore higher education is no guarantee 
against poverty but it is clearly an important element of the fight 
against poverty.
<P>
	Unless employment and the income picture improve, the poor 
will increasingly represent a larger portion of our population. 
We know about the incidence of poverty among single parent 
families. We know too that it is increasing.
<P>
	We also should bear in mind that the poverty gap, the gap 
between what people need in order to live at the poverty line and 
the money they actually receive from income and from other 
government supports is increasing. Indeed the increase in that 
gap was almost $3 billion in the decade of the 1990s due largely 
to an increase in the number of poor.
<P>
	The numbers go on and on and they are be depressing enough 
for everyone and should be enough to make us feel urgently of 
the need to address this important issue.
<P>
	The numbers of people living in poverty, the numbers of 
children living in poverty are growing. The gap between what 
they receive in increment and support systems and what they 
need in order to survive at a moderate level of dignity is 
increasing. The numbers of people working full time and 
nonetheless poor are increasing.
<P>
	Without an effective strategy to deal with this problem 
Canadians will continue to suffer with the second highest child 
poverty rates in the world. As we all know, only the United 
States has a worse child poverty rate than Canada and yet as we 
see with the suggestions for social security reform the 
government is proposing that we move to a more Americanized 
social security network. We need to  do something about our tax 
system. We need to do something about our economic system so 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6362"> 6362 </A></B>
<P>
that there are adequate jobs for those who need them to raise 
their families.
<P>
	It is not a question of people not wanting to work, not being 
able to work. It is a question of insufficient jobs to provide 
income through the traditional workforce for all who need it.
<P>
	In making a few suggestions for where we should proceed let 
me just say that children who just happen to be born to poor 
parents, and after all children do not choose to whom they are 
born, if they are unfortunate enough in terms of economic 
opportunity and social depravation to be born to poor parents, on 
average, they will be born with lower birth weight. They will be 
sick more often and when they are sick they will be sicker than 
those richer children. They do less well at school. They will be 
more likely to drop out of school. They will have more 
accidents. They are more likely to be unemployed. When they 
are unemployed they are more likely to be unemployed for 
longer than children of richer parents. They are more likely to 
experience behavioural problems and they will die several years 
younger than their richer counterparts. That is the legacy we 
present, that we enable to take place, for poor children.
<P>
	We should be ashamed of what we have done in this country 
with regard to children of those who are less well off. It is not the 
case that this is the only solution. In particular, if we look at the 
northern European countries, Norway, Sweden and Germany, 
certainly West Germany before the joining of the two, those 
countries had child poverty rates of about 5 per cent. We have 
child poverty rates of about 25 per cent, five times as high as 
countries who have committed themselves to solving this 
problem.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	The so-called solutions of the past have not worked. Child 
poverty and poverty in general have increased while over the 
last 20 years federal governments have cut social programs, cut 
taxes to the rich and large corporations, built up enormous 
deficits and engaged in trade, monetary and fiscal policies 
which have sucked jobs out of the Canadian economy. At the 
same time little has been done to address the structural problems 
of the economy which has led to the second highest child 
poverty rates of rich industrialized countries.
<P>
	As I said, while the U.S. has the worst poverty rates, the 
government is setting out this week to further the 
Americanization of Canada's social programs, continuing in the 
Mulroney tradition.
<P>
	The only solution to poverty and child poverty, and I want to 
stress that, is to make it a matter of national urgency to address 
the apparent inability of the Canadian economy to create the 
jobs required to enable those four million Canadians who are not 
presently part of the paid workforce to find work, four million 
Canadians who want to be in the workforce so they can feed their 
families.
<P>
	Further cuts to social programs can only make matters worse 
and yet that is what the government intends to do. Training can 
only help if there are jobs to do when that training has been 
received.
<P>
	The real problem is not social programs, but unemployment. 
As a country that is what we should be focusing on. If the 
government had committed the resources both human and in 
dollar terms to the job side of the equation that it has instead 
committed to social program review, we would be in a much 
better position to show hope and opportunity for those 1.3 
million children presently living in poverty. They would have a 
much better chance of breaking that poverty cycle.
<P>
	Two further brief points. As a signatory to the UN Convention 
on the Rights of the Child, Canada recognizes: ``the right of 
every child to a standard of living adequate for the child's 
physical, mental, spiritual, moral and social development''.
<P>
	Canada by this article is obligated to take and again I quote: 
``appropriate measures to assist parents and others responsible 
for the child to implement this right and shall in case of need 
provide material assistance and support programs particularly 
with regard to nutrition, health, clothing and housing''.
<P>
	We have not done that. We have not lived up to our 
international responsibilities. As a country we have not lived up 
to our responsibilities to our children.
<P>
	Last I would like to go back to the point I raised at the 
beginning. I know all members will regard this matter as a 
serious one and one of considerable importance. I believe that 
everyone in the House believes that we should work toward 
eliminating child poverty and assisting Canadian children and 
their future.
<P>
	I would now ask if there is unanimous consent to make this 
motion a votable motion, to recognize the critically important 
part that children will play in our future and our critically 
important responsibility to children we have today. I would like 
to seek unanimous consent to make this motion votable. If that 
was available I am sure we could choose a time to do that.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is there unanimous 
consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6363"> 6363 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Training 
and Youth)):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to have the 
opportunity to debate this very important motion presented by 
the hon. member.
<P>
	Child poverty is on the minds of many Canadians. We know 
from surveys that 91 per cent of Canadians make the reduction 
of child poverty a major priority. Considering the enormous 
riches we have in the country, there is no excuse whatsoever for 
Canada to have so many children living in poverty.
<P>
	Estimates vary as to the number, but a commonly cited 
statistic is 1.25 million children live in low income families. 
Clearly this is not acceptable. There are those who believe that 
poor children is not an isolated issue, but that poor children 
come from poor families, poor parents. It is a complex issue that 
we can appreciate only too well.
<P>
	This is not a simple matter. Child poverty is more than a little 
boy or little girl going without adequate nutrition or warm 
clothing for school. Yes, it is that. But it is so much more. Child 
poverty can stem from family breakdown, or a parent or parents 
not having a job, or not having a job that pays a decent wage.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	What do we need to do? We need to work together with our 
partners in the provinces and the non-governmental 
organizations to come up with constructive solutions that will 
address the underlying cause of child poverty. Let us do it right. 
Let us work in a co-operative, constructive way. Let us take the 
necessary steps to make a real difference in alleviating the plight 
of so many Canadian children.
<P>
	I extend an open invitation to hon. members and to all of our 
partners to contribute their input. That to me is what social 
security reform is all about. It is not about whose toes are being 
stepped on or how the status quo is going to be affected. No, it is 
about finding real solutions for real people and real problems.
<P>
	Let us explore a broad range of ideas and then zero in on the 
most effective measures to prevent children from falling into 
poverty in the first place rather than always reacting to the 
situation once it is there.
<P>
	Let me assure you however, Mr. Speaker, that the federal 
government is already contributing to the welfare of Canadian 
children through a number of initiatives. For example, in 
1994-95 under the child tax benefit program we will provide 
$1.6 billion to families with incomes below $30,000. Under the 
Canada assistance plan the federal government will provide to 
the provinces and territories some $1.3 billion for welfare 
payments, $315 million for child care and $440 million for child 
welfare.
<P>
	In the red book document the government outlined a 
commitment of $720 million over three years to expand the 
availability of quality child care. Last February the budget set 
aside money for the first two years of this initiative.
<P>
	We will have to develop a consensus in co-operation with our 
provincial partners and parents across the country about how 
that money should be spent. Discussions on child care have 
already begun with provincial and territorial governments but 
invest we must because our investment in children is an 
investment in our future.
<P>
	I am pleased to say that the Department of Human Resources 
Development is also working with the Department of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development to improve child care for 
First Nations children living on reserves. As a government we 
also have the initiative of the head start program that is being 
headed up by the Department of Health.
<P>
	Hon. colleagues know that I have a special empathy and so do 
they for aboriginal children and the appalling conditions that 
they face daily. I am reminded of a 1990 report by the National 
Youth in Care Network. It is estimated that of the more than 
303,000 children 17 years of age and under, 51 per cent of status 
aboriginals and 27 per cent of the Metis children live in poverty.
<P>
	It is no wonder that we have tremendous child poverty in 
aboriginal communities. On average aboriginal income is about 
one-half to one-third less than for other Canadians as a whole. 
This is a statistic that has been used quite often in different 
efforts to create equity.
<P>
	Both the unemployment level and the level of illiteracy is 
twice that of the Canadian population. Aboriginal students are 
only one-half as likely to receive a post-secondary education as 
are Canadians generally. There are significantly fewer 
aboriginal students who complete high school. In some northern 
communities as few as 5 per cent of aboriginal youth complete

<P>
	This situation which we should be especially ashamed of cries 
out for our immediate attention. The Canadian Council on 
Social Development reminded us last week that while we focus 
on social security reform to make our programs more effective 
we need to also look at the labour market and how it can supply 
good paying jobs.
<P>
	Of course, it all ties together. I am sure hon. members will 
agree that child poverty is linked to education and employment.
<P>
<B>(1815 ) </B>
<P>
	I heard my hon. colleague refer to the fact that there are 
educated people, heads of households with degrees, who live in 
poverty and their families that live in poverty. We realize as a 
government in terms of education and life-long learning that it 
is not that they learned something, that they have certain skills 
and certain talents, but that their skills are matched to 
opportunities.
<P>
	We have to approach the whole issue of learning with a 
difference. Not only will we be challenged with making tougher 
choices, but we will also be guiding people to make the right 
choices, better choices and smarter choices for their 
employment and other opportunities.
<P>

	In 1993 there was a 17 per cent increase in jobs for students 
with post-secondary education. There was no growth for those 
with only secondary education. There was a 17 per cent decline 
in jobs for students with less than secondary education.
<P>
	The Canada Council report says that children from poor 
families are more than twice as likely to be school dropouts. Let 
us face it, the better educated and the better trained a person is 
on the whole, the better chance he or she has of landing a well 
paying job.
<P>
	Last spring the Minister of Human Resources Development 
and I collaborated with provincial and business partners to 
implement an employment and learning strategy for Canadian 
youth. The strategy for which we have budgeted $684.5 million 
in the current fiscal year is helping our young people in the 
difficult transition from school to work. It is addressing barriers 
such as high school dropout rates, access to post-secondary 
education, lack of work experience and effective job training.
<P>
	Youth Services Canada is one of the strategic measures aimed 
at putting unemployed and out of school young people back to 
work. The mission of Youth Services Canada is to strengthen 
young people's sense of accomplishment, self-reliance and 
self-esteem and to enable young people to gain meaningful 
work experience.
<P>
	I point out that the majority of the program funds will go 
directly to youths and that eligible participants will receive 
financial assistance to help them pay for day care while they are 
working.
<P>
	As we reform our social security programs the whole 
employment and learning strategy will help to ensure that young 
people, the future leaders, the future builders of this great 
nation, will have every chance to become productive and 
self-reliant.
<P>
	This is the thrust of social security reform. It is a springboard, 
not a cushion that robs people of initiative and self-esteem. It is 
an effort to reintegrate, to pick people up and to help them to 
reintegrate into the mainstream, not to marginalize them and not 
to create dependency.
<P>
	Another aspect right now of the 1.25 million children living in 
low income families is that over 40 per cent live in single parent 
families headed by women. In the Northwest Territories in 1991 
the average income for single parent families was $17,100. 
Someone familiar with the politics and the economic 
demographics and otherwise of the country will know that the 
cost of living in the Northwest Territories has been stated as 30 
per cent to 40 per cent higher than that of southern communities. 
North of 60 there is a real difference in the cost of living, not to 
mention the lack of infrastructure and the lack of opportunities 
for employment. There are situations that are quite limiting so 
we are definitely at a disadvantage.
<P>
	We need to do much more to help sole parents, mostly of 
course single mothers, by providing more quality affordable 
child care services. Helping these sole parents become 
self-supporting will go a long way toward alleviating child 
poverty.
<P>
	One example of building self-reliance is a project announced 
by the government on September 16 in Rimouski, Quebec. For 
27 weeks beginning the middle of next month the government 
and its partners in the Rimouski region will give women with no 
income access to a training program that will enable them to 
enter the labour market by creating their own businesses. This is 
an empowering process. These women entrepreneurs have 
sound business ideas but they have no income to launch their 
businesses. By training them, by enabling them to attain specific 
skills, we are helping them to get their businesses off the 
ground.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	Human resources development is supporting the initiative in 
Rimouski. Each participant will receive financial assistance in 
the form of weekly allowances, which includes child care costs 
for those who require them. We know it is very limiting when 
individuals are faced with extra hours either to learn or to 
perform their duties on the job and are not provided with any 
kind of assistance.
<P>
	Three weeks ago in Winnipeg the government signed an 
agreement with the Government of Manitoba to assist 4,000 
single parents currently on welfare. It is called ``Taking 
Charge''. This five-year project will give single parents access 
to a storefront office where they will receive help with needs 
ranging from child care training to family support to job 
placement.
<P>
	I conclude by saying that I hope we will not hear complaints 
and cynicism that nothing can be done. If we work together we 
can do a great deal. There is plenty of optimism among 
Canadians. Let us tap into that hope and develop a social 
security system to serve Canadians in the 1990s and for decades 
to come. Poor people are not poor by choice; they are poor 
because of circumstances.
<P>
	I appeal to all my colleagues to have a heart for the poor 
children of Canada. They are not poor by choice; they are the 
victims of circumstances. We have to work to alleviate those 
circumstances and set the record straight for those people to 
have a better future in our country.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome the 
opportunity to rise in the House today, as the Official Opposition 
critic for training and youth, to support the motion standing in 
the name of the hon. member for Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing. 
The motion reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6365"> 6365 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should consider the advisability 
of reaffirming its commitment to seek to achieve the goal of eliminating poverty among 
Canadian children by the year 2000.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In a country that has already won international recognition for 
its quality of life, it may seem strange that it should be necessary 
to advise the government to deal with a problem as serious as 
that of child poverty. Children are a country's greatest asset, and 
it is thanks to them that nations develop and evolve. Thanks to 
them, we can look forward to the future.
<P>
	However, according to a recent study by the Canadian 
Institute of Child Health, in 1991 1.2 million children in Canada 
were living in poverty, which is 500,000 more than in 1981. 
Today, 20 per cent of our children live in poverty in this country.
<P>
	The hon. member who moved the motion mentioned more 
recent figures-1.3 million children-which indicates a trend 
and shows that the situation continues to deteriorate.
<P>
	Forty-two per cent of child deaths before the age of one year 
can be attributed to prenatal conditions. The mother's quality of 
life before birth is crucial to the life expectancy of the child. The 
incidence of learning disabilities and mental health problems 
among children from poor families is double that of children in 
the rest of the population.
<P>
	If I may, I shall digress for a moment. I was told recently that 
even in the supposedly richer areas, children in increasing 
number go to school without breakfast or a nutritious lunch. No 
wonder their failure rate is so high and they eventually become 
high-school dropouts.
<P>
	One cannot talk about child poverty without talking about 
poor families. As we all know, in the past few years, the average 
family income has not kept up with the cost of living.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	According to the same report on child health I quoted earlier, 
in Quebec, in 1993, a single parent earning the minimum wage 
had to work 73 hours to have an income equivalent to the 
poverty level. In Canada, the same single parent on social 
assistance, with one dependant child, would receive 65 per cent 
of that. In 1991, 453,200 single parents were women whereas a 
mere 83,600 were men. Therefore, we cannot talk about child 
poverty without talking about the poverty of mothers, especially 
single mothers.
<P>
	Single families make up 20 per cent of all families, but the 
most alarming situation is that of single mothers with children. 
Indeed, in Canada, close to 90 per cent of children living with a 
single mother live in poverty.
<P>
	Our young people, and that includes children of course, find 
themselves in a situation we had not seen since the Depression, 
that is to say that they are in a worse predicament than the 
previous generation. They have less opportunities than their 
parents had. The report on child health in Canada, which was 
published this  week, and from which I got my statistics, was 
funded mostly by the federal government. I would like to hope 
that the federal government reacts quickly and with concrete 
measures in the light of this troubling conclusion because it 
would be obscene for the government to commission a study and 
then to ignore its findings, particularly when it comes to the 
health of our children.
<P>
	As my hon. colleague who introduced the motion indicated, 
this is not the first time that the House of Commons looks into 
child poverty. On november 24, 1989, at the initiative of the hon. 
member representing Oshawa at the time, the House 
unanimously passed a resolution similar to the one before us 
today, to eliminate poverty among children by the year 2000.
<P>
	May I digress for a moment to say how disappointed I was 
when we did not get unanimous consent to vote on this motion, 
while consent was granted in 1989 and all the hon. members 
present at the time voted in favour of the motion. That was five 
years ago. Things are getting worse instead of getting better. 
Why is that? A resolution was passed, but why has the situation 
deteriorated? I say that it is because the Conservative 
government of the day did nothing to correct the situation and in 
the past year, the Liberal government has continued, as we heard 
again this week, to consult the people on social program reform, 
but this reform will only take effect next year, yet another year 
away.
<P>
	That will make six years since a unanimous resolution was 
passed to fight child poverty. However, the Liberal Party at that 
time was in favour of the resolution as it voted unanimously for 
the motion in 1989. Members then, even some who are ministers 
today, said many things which are worth quoting. Even the 
member for St. Boniface, whom I see in front of me, spoke in 
favour of this motion in 1989.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> I am still in favour of political reform, my 
friend!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> I will go more quickly, but one quote in particular 
attracted my attention because this speech was made by the 
present Minister of Human Resources Development. He said 
that members should set aside the fine speeches prepared by the 
departments and open their eyes and their hearts a little.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	They should try to face reality and talk about Canada's real 
problems. Not one day went by in the House without a minister 
or member of the Conservative government talking about the 
deficit. That is what they said at the time.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6366"> 6366 </A></B>
<P>
	I never heard the then finance minister talk about Canada's 
real deficit of one million children living in poverty. That is 
where we should be investing. That is the real tragedy. In 10 
years these children should be our educators, business people, 
politicians and journalists but they will never get that far 
because they cannot get a head start. One million children 
living in poverty is a tremendous loss. That is the big deficit 
we must face. Yet, nothing was done to solve that problem.
<P>
	In 1989, the current Minister of Human Resources, the same 
member who is now a minister, authorized the cut in the UI 
program, did not provide more daycare spaces, voiced his 
intention to cut social programs to fight the deficit, and did not, 
in my opinion, table a real program to create permanent jobs. Let 
me give you an example: The Youth Service Corps is a program 
designed to give $150 per week to young Canadians. In other 
times, it would be nice to create part-time jobs for our young 
people, but these are not real jobs.
<P>
	Such a program maintains duplication in the field of 
vocational training and this is costly for everyone. In the 
meantime, his colleague, the Minister of Industry, refuses to 
allocate funds for the conversion of military and civilian 
industries. I raise this issue because we have an industry back 
home called MIL Davie, which waited in vain for a year to get an 
answer from the Conservative government regarding a simple 
ferry, and which has now been waiting for another year to get an 
answer from the new Liberal government. If approved, this 
project would create at least 700 jobs.
<P>
	We are poor because of the deficit. We cannot help needy 
children since we are poor. In the meantime, there are costs. I am 
truly disappointed because the members of this House-some of 
whom seem to approve-will not even seize the opportunity to 
vote and confirm our commitment to fight child poverty.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise in the 
House today to speak to the motion to recommit to eliminating 
child poverty in Canada by the year 2000.
<P>
	What is poverty? The Oxford Dictionary definition is: Being 
poor, not having means to procure comforts or necessities of 
life, in deficiency, in want.
<P>
	Distinction must be made between basic financial deficiency 
for which there may be economic solutions, and social 
deficiency where individuals are deficient in relation to others, 
emotionally or otherwise, and the deficiency is more than just 
simple finances.
<P>
	Socially each individual may find themselves poor in some 
aspect of their life in relation to others, a situation which can 
never be helped. The purpose of government social programs is 
not to make people equal in every way.
<P>
	There is however, potential for government to find solutions 
to long term financial hardship by reducing taxes, reducing debt 
and reducing spending. It must be clearly understood that there 
is a world of difference between poverty, which is a situation 
where the basic needs of life are not being met, and the situation 
in Canada where we have a portion of population living with low 
incomes relative to the majority.
<P>
	These low income Canadians would be considered well off as 
an income group if compared to the citizens of most other 
countries in the world. However, because it is more common for 
us to compare ourselves to our neighbours to the south rather 
than to people in Brazil or Morocco, it is this comparison that 
forms the argument for the anti-poverty lobby in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1835 ) </B>
<P>
	There is at this time no existing fiscal definition of poverty. In 
Canada this is a general measure of low income that is widely 
misused by various advocacy groups as poverty line and it is 
called the low income cutoff of Statistics Canada.
<P>
	Statistics Canada has publicly and consistently stated that the 
low income cutoff is not a measure of poverty. Based on the 
premise that any family with an income less than the low income 
cutoff is in poverty, the child poverty lobby has falsely 
concluded that over 1.2 million children, that is one in five, must 
be living in poverty.
<P>
	Barbara Greene, the chairman of the House subcommittee on 
poverty in the 34th Parliament studying the issue, stated that the 
goal of eliminating child poverty is impossible to attain because 
the low income cutoff measure is a relative measure.
<P>
	Because the low income cutoff is a relative measure we will 
never be able to eliminate poverty if it is defined this way 
because we will always have a similar percentage of Canadian 
families statistically described as low income.
<P>
	As an example of how weak a substitute the term ``poverty'' is 
for low income consider that 18 per cent of the low income 
cutoff population owns their own home mortgage free.
<P>
	There are some generalizations that can be made from studies 
done on low income earners. Low income can be attributed to 
youth, unemployed persons, recent immigrants, single parents 
and native communities. The first three groups, youth, 
unemployed and recent immigrants, will undoubtedly increase 
their average earnings over time as their employment 
opportunities improve with their skills and experience.
<P>
	Single parents will clearly be helped by the reversal in family 
policy proposed by the Reform Party as family will be promoted 
through the tax system and the cycle of welfare dependency will 
be broken through the reform of social programs.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6367"> 6367 </A></B>
<P>
	Native communities will benefit from Reform's commitment 
to abolishing the department of Indian affairs and a move to 
full participation in Canadian society.
<P>
	I have described the confusion and have shown the distinction 
between real fiscal poverty and low income in Canada. 
Regardless of whether one accepts the premise that real poverty, 
meaning lack of food, clothing and shelter, is not a reality in 
Canada, we are debating the question of child poverty.
<P>
	It is possible that some children have faced such desperate 
situations through no fault of their own, as a child is a 
dependent. As such, a child is not expected to have an income or 
provide for its own needs. Canadian law recognizes this fact and 
makes provision for this fact in the Criminal Code of Canada. 
Section 215 states that everyone is under a legal duty as a parent 
to provide necessities of life for a child under the age of 16. 
According to Canadian law failing to provide these necessities 
is not child poverty, but child abuse and neglect.
<P>
	Child poverty advocates claim that they just want to help the 
hungry children but are there really 1.2 million hungry Canadian 
children as the advocates imply? Is there evidence of such a 
major crisis? Realistically there are children who are living in 
broken families and low income families but this does not mean 
that the basic physical needs of these children cannot or are not 
being met.
<P>
	In Canada the generous welfare system already in place is 
more than sufficient for parents to meet the basic physical needs 
of their children regardless of employment or family status. The 
government can never meet all the needs of children. How could 
government ever provide love and affection? Government can, 
however, provide a non-intrusive economic climate in which 
families can grow and prosper.
<P>
	Reformers believe that the state has no business attempting to 
raise the nation's children and that full responsibility for 
children must reside with their parent or legal guardian. The 
only time the state must intervene is in situations of clear 
neglect or abuse. Should parents find themselves in situations in 
which it is difficult for them to provide the necessities the 
responsibility to do so should remain with the parents. These 
parents may in these situations request help, first from relatives, 
but failing family support, private social service agencies and 
then as a last resort governmental agencies.
<P>
	There may well be isolated cases of individual suffering on 
the part of some children due to neglect or abusive parents just 
as there are cases of child sexual abuse, infanticide and child 
pornography. This is of great concern to all Canadians. 
Reformers believe that the proper enforcement of existing law 
and the promotion of family values in society are the most 
effective ways to deal with this sort of tragedy.
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
	Health researchers and others have correctly pointed out that 
statistically there are problems those in low income situations 
are more likely to have compared to those of higher incomes: 
problems such as greater school dropout rates, more domestic 
violence and higher health concerns. It is clear that these 
problems do not occur as a result of low income but as a result of 
family breakdown, illegitimacy, structural unemployment and a 
loosening of societal values.
<P>
	However the child poverty lobby believes that low income 
itself is the problem. Low income or poverty, as they call it, is 
not a disease that people catch. It is a situation that is the result 
of other factors.
<P>
	The child poverty lobby has proposed some solutions to the 
situation of low income earners. They want more day care, more 
welfare and more state intrusion in the lives of families. 
However studies by Dr. Doug Allen of Simon Fraser University 
show that 80 per cent of low income families do not collect 
welfare. Clearly for the large majority of low income families, 
more social programs are not the solution.
<P>
	The Reform Party recognizes that low income is not the 
problem itself, but rather one symptom of a much deeper 
problem in our society. Broken families, divorce, illegitimacy 
and unemployment are many of the factors that lead to low 
income status. These problems have quickly increased during 
the past 30 years due to intrusive policies of Liberal and 
Progressive Conservative governments.
<P>
	These are the tax policies that discriminate against 
stay-at-home parents or discriminate based on family type. 
These are welfare programs that provide disincentives for 
people to find work and that encourage and sustain illegitimacy. 
These are policies that fail to punish crime, especially youth 
crime, adequately and a massive debt that has led to structural 
unemployment in our economy.
<P>
	What do we propose as the solution? We believe government 
must get out of the day care business. We believe in a tax policy 
that does not discriminate based on the type of family one has. 
We believe in a non-intrusive system of social programs that 
helps the truly needy. We believe in a tax policy that continues to 
recognize the costs associated with raising children. We believe 
in spending cuts in all areas to deal with the debt and the deficit. 
We believe long term tax relief must be achieved so that families 
may have more freedom to make their own choices.
<P>
	Reformers are interested in promoting healthy Canadian 
families and in helping the truly needy. We do not believe more 
social programs are the solution to society's problems. We do 
believe in the promotion of the family as the best possible 
solution to the majority of Canada's social dysfunction.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="6368"> 6368 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Maria Minna (Beaches-Woodbine):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure for me tonight to speak on this issue, although a 
sad one at the same time.
<P>
	Child poverty in Canada is a clear indication of the failure of 
social programs in a society. I believe very strongly that this is 
something that we must as a nation take in hand, and take in hand 
very quickly.
<P>
	Poor children are not poor by themselves. They are poor 
because their parents are poor. Child poverty does not make for a 
healthy future in our society. Our human deficit will be the 
future deficit of this country. I believe that firmly.
<P>
	We talk about the need for a better educated, skilled labour 
force all the time in the House. We talk about the deficiency of 
skills in the workforce. We talk about the need to train and 
educate. We discuss youth crime and retribution. We talk about 
how we must punish these young people and put them in jail and 
throw away the key sometimes. We talk about harsh punishment 
for young children.
<P>
	We do not discuss openly and honestly why they are that way. 
The horrible blight on Canada is child poverty. It is a shame for 
this country to be in that position. We must work to eradicate 
this.
<P>
	Children do not get involved in crime and problems all by 
themselves. Society has a hand in helping from the time that 
they are born whether it be because they are poor, or whether it 
be because they are abused in their homes or what have you.
<P>
<B>(1845 ) </B>
<P>
	In my view poverty is not just poverty from the point of view 
of not having enough food, shelter or clothing. It is also poverty 
of the society and the environment around them. Children are 
abused in homes all the time.
<P>
	It is true, so there is no point in arguing about it, that we do not 
have social programs that meet the needs of children. We have 
seen mental health programs cut when children who need these 
programs are in line-ups across the country. That is 
unacceptable. How do we expect them to cope when we are not 
providing the support system they require? We do not have a 
proper child care program. We must provide one. Parents need 
that support. We need to have a comprehensive and supportive 
system for parents in this situation to cope.
<P>
	We heard a member across the way talk about the fact that the 
only way to recognize poverty was to look at basic fundamental 
deficiencies. He indicated that we were looking a little too high 
at poverty and that low income was somehow too high a 
threshold. He referred proudly to a former member of the House, 
Barbara Greene, who was busy trying to raise the threshold of 
poverty so that it could be technically wiped out of the books. 
That does not get rid of poverty. The people would still be there. 
The children would still be there. They would not disappear. We 
can change the jargon. We can change the  verbiage. We can 
change how we describe it. However they are still there; they do 
not disappear.
<P>
	It is the state's business to worry about the children of the 
nation. We have a collective responsibility toward our children. 
They are the best resource of the nation to survive as a nation. 
We collectively make decisions about iron ore, forestry and all 
kinds of things, but when it comes to children the member across 
the way talks about the sanctity of the family and not doing 
anything. He says that we have no say or no role as a collective 
society. We do have a very strong role as a collective society.
<P>
	Child care is very important. Proper support systems are very 
important. Low income is low income. Deficiencies, whether 
they be social, physical or whatever, are deficiencies. 
Supportive services in social programs are terribly important. 
We cannot blame the children. We must accept that raising 
children and preparing them to lead the country in the future is a 
collective responsibility that cannot be neglected. The member 
does not agree.
<P>
	The UN has said that Canada is the best country in the world to 
live in. That is a wonderful thing we can be very proud of, but for 
certain individuals, namely children, it is not the best country in 
the world to live in. That is something we should be ashamed of 
and deal with tout de suite.
<P>
	If we accomplish anything at all in the country it must be the 
eradication of child poverty in all its forms. We must develop a 
social support system that is comprehensive and supportive to 
children and their families.
<P>
	I look forward to working with the upcoming social security 
review process and working hard with members of the House 
and Canadians to develop a system to address the basic needs of 
families and children at the very least. I hope all members of the 
House will participate in the process and in the end come up with 
something can be very proud of.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Under the right to reply, I 
recognize the hon. member for Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing for 
a maximum of two minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to respond. It is clear there 
are some different philosophical concerns in the House. There 
are some who see the urgency of dealing with the problem and 
there are others who want to talk about philosophical issues 
while children stay hungry. It is offensive to me that we are 
having a philosophical debate about why children are hungry 
when we do not have a commitment to solving the problem of 
child hunger.
<P>
	How can Reform members look in the eyes of hungry kids and 
tell them they are not hungry? It is a disgrace to hear people 
saying those things. You say it is a question of parental 
responsibility. Maybe it is, but what about the hungry kids who 
do not have that parental responsibility  administered to them? 
Are you just going to let them stay hungry because you do not 
like the way-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I would remind 
members to make their interventions through the Chair and I 
<P>

<B><A NAME="6369"> 6369 </A></B>
<P>
would ask the member for Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing to 
conclude his remarks.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I apologize if I get angry. I see poor children on a daily 
basis in my riding and it is offensive to me that people do not 
respond in an adequate way to their plight. They are hungry and 
they need help now; they do not need it in 10 years.
<P>
	We need a commitment to resolving the problems we face. 
Children are poor because they are born to poor parents. They do 
not choose to be born to poor parents; it just so happens that that 
is the way it is.
<P>
	The hon. member may think it is funny but it is not. The 
problem of hunger is serious. He should treat it seriously and not 
in the facile way he is doing it.
<P>
	We need a national commitment to job creation. People are 
poor because they do not have jobs, four million of them. We 
need real and progressive tax reforms so that Canada will have 
the resources to deal with poverty. We need changes to trade and 
monetary policy so that we can solve our child poverty 
problems. Without a real and determined focus on these real 
problems we will not find a real solution.
<P>
	I think we all know poor children. We all know the pain they 
face and the hunger that they face. Surely we need to respond to 
them in the most humane and careful way that we can. Children 
do not need ideological debate. They need answers. They need 
food. They need support. I only wish the Reform Party would 
have supported the motion being votable.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 6.52 p.m., as 
there are no members available for the proceedings on the 
adjournment motion, the House stands adjourned until 
tomorrow at 10 a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.52 p.m.)
<P>
