during the summit of the Americas, which, I would remind hon. 
members, was attended by 34 heads of state of the Americas, 
including the President of the United States, a reception was 
hosted by the Prime Minister.  To the great pride of all the 
people of Brome—Missisquoi, and particularly the people of the 
town of Lac Brome, Brome Lake duck was on the menu. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An event such as this is an extraordinary showcase for our 
regional products.  We can be justifiably proud of the variety, 
quality and originality of our local products.  As well as being 
a source of pride to ourselves, I do not doubt that they were 
greatly appreciated by the summit VIPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My congratulations to Canards du lac Brome on this undeniable 
recognition of their product, an honour that reflects on the town 
of Lac Brome, on Brome-Missisquoi, and on the Eastern Townships 
as a whole.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to bring to the 
attention of the government the ongoing income crisis in the 
grains and oilseeds sectors, particularly on the prairies and 
throughout Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the Saskatchewan net income will be under $400 
million.  When we consider that it normally is up in the billion 
dollar range, that in itself is evidence of this tragedy.  On top 
of that, in my home province of Manitoba we have extremely wet 
conditions which are delaying seeding.  In western Saskatchewan 
and Alberta we have extreme drought conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage the government to take immediate action and work 
with provincial premiers in looking at solutions now and deliver 
the assistance that will be required sooner rather than later.

Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise in the House to 
congratulate Mrs. Carol Oriold, a teacher at Listowel District 
Secondary School in Listowel, Ontario.  Mrs. Oriold has been 
selected from 215 nominations to receive a 2000-01 Prime 
Minister's award for teaching excellence and a certificate of 
achievement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a teacher of dramatic arts, Mrs. Oriold has inspired students 
and increased enrolment of classes from eight to fourteen.  Many 
students have gone on to professional theatre schools and work in 
theatre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Black Door Theatre is another example of Mrs. Oriold's 
achievement.  As the founder of the theatre, students work in 
co-operation with the audiovisual club, arts and technology 
students.  The troupe has won more than 100 awards in the past 15 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mrs. Oriold is an exceptional individual who has inspired 
students and has been an excellent role model.  Congratulations 
to Carol Oriold.

pleased to bring to the attention of our Prime Minister, members 
of parliament and Canadians across the country that May is 
officially recognized as Neurofibromatosis Month.  NF is caused 
by spontaneous mutation of a gene that every human has.  This 
mutation acts to promote tumour development in over one in four 
thousand North Americans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This past weekend I had the privilege of attending a fund 
raising event sponsored by the Benjamin Thornewell Memorial Fund. 
Benjamin was a happy, outgoing child who passed away of NF at the 
age of eight and a half.  The impact this fine young Canadian had 
on all of us is exemplified in the fact that over 300 community 
members came together to raise over $17,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate Benjamin's mother, Pat, and everyone involved in 
this huge success.  Canada should come together and leave 
Benjamin a legacy of which he can be proud.  Let us support the 
necessary research to find a cure for NF.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, abalone harvesting licence holders on 
the west coast remain second class citizens.  Unlike other 
licence holders in other fisheries who have been disenfranchised 
from their livelihood due to closures, the federal government has 
never initiated a buyback program for owners of now useless 
abalone licences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's approach to disenfranchised abalone licence 
holders was to set up an advisory body to discuss the issue with 
the native fishery and coastal communities affected by the 
closure.  This is nothing but an attempt to bury the issue in a 
bureaucratic maze, hoping the real disenfranchised, the abalone 
licence holders, would forget about the whole thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A year ago I asked the minister of fisheries for a meeting to 
discuss the issue and to date I have not been accorded the 
courtesy of a response to my letter.  When will I get a response 
from the minister?  When will abalone licence holders get what 
they deserve?  When will the minister realize he is from British 
Columbia?  These people are suffering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard why do I not ask the parliamentary secretary, that he 
should know what the minister is doing if he is doing his job. 
They are not answering these questions.  They should answer them 
and do something immediately.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I received a letter from Barney who wrote to me from Ireland. He

this after the government's announcement in 1998, just three 
years ago, that the war museum would be built in Rockcliffe at a 
cost of $70 million.  Now the government is spending twice as 
much and moving the museum to a smaller site.

question is for the minister responsible for culture and 
heritage. The Minister of Industry has given government approval 
to sell the fabled Montreal Canadiens to a United States 
entrepreneur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite assurances to keep the team in Canada for a short 
period, it is still a sale of one of Canada's most prized 
possessions.  What message does this send to Canadian youth and 
Canadians generally?   What could be more Canadian than les 
Canadiens de Montréal?  Why can we not just sell the Minister of 
Industry instead?

Mr. Speaker, for any hon. member who has been watching the NHL I 
think probably one of the saddest moments was when the final 
Canadian team was knocked out last week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have exported an incredible asset, Canada's hockey.  However, 
in terms of investment in our youth, we have to start at the 
local hockey rinks.  We have to start in Corner Brook.  We have 
to start in St. John's.  We have to start in Gander.  That is 
where they build the dreams.  They do not build them once they 
reach the NHL.

a Toronto couple with four children, two of whom were born in 
Canada, to an uncertain future.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the federal government has lost an 
important test case involving residential schools.  Yesterday in 
Saskatchewan, Justice Ted Malone ruled that the federal 
government could not go after the Anglican Church to help pay the 
costs of lawsuits brought against it by former residential school 
students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the government settle these lawsuits now and not only help 
former students who have suffered years of hardship but also save 
Canadian taxpayers billions of dollars by settling these lawsuits 
now rather than later?  It has the choice of paying the victims 
now or paying the lawyers forever. 
<P><A NAME="LINK106"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the court case in question is one decision at the trial 
level.  It stands on its own facts, but I say to the hon. member 
that we are moving to work out settlements in a way that will be 
fair, above all, to the victims, to the churches, and to Canadian 
taxpayers.  I look forward to having my hon. friend's support for 
these continuing efforts. 
<P><A NAME="LINK107"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the government has always been the 
legal guardian of every residential school student.  It has 
frequently ignored this responsibility and continues to ignore 
its responsibility while dithering in the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thousands of former students are struggling just to survive. The 
Saskatchewan court has ruled that it is the government, not the 
churches, that has responsibility.  It is a responsibility it 
cannot cast off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the government settle these lawsuits now, save Canadian 
taxpayers billions of dollars and help former students begin the 
process of healing?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, my hon. friend has finally slipped into the Alliance 
trap of having unsuitable premises.  The case in question is not 
one that applies across the whole spectrum of cases.  It is only 
one case at the trial division, but we are working to move toward 
settlements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not dithering.  We are working actively with the 
churches.  My hon. friend should work with me in expediting the 
issue instead of trying to politicize the issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday in 
Geneva, the Minister of Health put forward the idea of drafting 
an international convention to ban reproductive technologies such 
as human cloning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the minister claim to be a world leader with respect to 
reproductive technologies, when we know that he allowed the 
recommendations of the Baird commission to languish for seven 
years before recently introducing a draft bill, which will put 
off any decision in this regard for yet another year?

<P><A NAME="LINK111"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Robert Nault (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern

that because of the importance of cloning, not only to Canada but 
to the rest of the world, he would be working with his colleagues 
across the globe to prepare and look at developing a convention 
among governments prohibiting this practice, one which we support 
as a government and I am sure all members of the House support.

<P><A NAME="LINK112"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister 
is well aware that there is a broad consensus in Canada that 
human cloning should be banned, and another year of consultations 
is perfectly pointless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government seriously wishes to ban human cloning, why 
does it not move quickly to introduce a bill with that in mind?

<P><A NAME="LINK113"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Robert Nault (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern

of the importance of the issue that it is not a political or 
partisan issue but one that needs a lot of study and thought by 
Canadians in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objective of the draft piece of legislation and the proposal 
is to get input from all Canadians at the provincial level, at 
the municipal level, and at the first nation level.  We would 
then go ahead with a consensus in the country on something as 
important as cloning of human beings.

promoting human rights in Canada rather than on taking trips 
abroad.  The only action thus far was the suspension of a senior 
lawyer who stated that the commission had lost its moral 
authority to act on cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister immediately advise the chief commissioner to

organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To that end we are putting a number of new programs in place: 
for example, a personal enhancement program that will increase 
the amount of reimbursement for educational courses from $5,000 
up to $20,000, not just for officers but for all ranks of the 
Canadian forces.  An additional $19 million is going into 
post-graduate work as well.  All together we are helping to

cannot answer his question as fully as I would like. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell him this:  No one is deported from Canada because of 
a $50 administrative error.  I am pleased however to hear that he

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, these people came from Poland in 1994 initially on a 
refugee claim on humanitarian and compassionate grounds.  Two of 
their four children are Canadian born.  There is no record of any 
illegal activity.  Mr. Sklarzyk has even started a small company 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it impossible to believe that the minister is less intent

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Elinor Caplan (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration,

Question No. 13 will be answered today. 
.[Text] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Question No. 13—<B>Mr. Svend Robinson:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For each of the last five years, 1996-2000: (<I>a</I>) on how many 
occasions were Canadian diplomats overseas alleged to have 
violated national or local laws in the host country; (<I>b</I>) in 
each instance, in which country did the alleged violation occur: 
(<I>c</I>) what was the alleged infraction; and (<I>d</I>) what was the 
response of the host country? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK171"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> The 
Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade is aware of 
five incidents in the last five years in which Canadian diplomats 
overseas are alleged to have violated national or local laws in 
their host country. Not included are tickets for traffic 
offences, which departmental policy requires diplomats to pay 
themselves. Provisions of the Privacy Act prevent the department 
from releasing personal information; for this reason, the 
identity of individuals must be protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three of the five incidents involved minor dependants of 
diplomats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first incident involved an alleged misdemeanour of arson by 
a minor dependant. A waiver of immunity was requested but not 
granted in this case. Given the very minor nature of the offence, 
the government of the host country took no further action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second incident involved an allegation of driving while 
impaired by a minor dependant. The department was advised by the 
host country that a refusal to waive immunity would result in 
loss of the dependant's driver's licence. The family returned to 
Canada shortly after the incident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third incident involved a Canadian consular officer alleged 
to have uttered a death threat. No charges were laid against this 
individual in the host country. However, a foreign court ordered 
the individual to stay away from a certain area. Since consular 
officers have more limited immunity than diplomats, the 
individuals was subject to the jurisdiction of the court. The 
individual was recalled to Canada by the department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth case, involving a diplomat formely posted to Israel, 
is generally considered public knowledge. This individual was not 
charged in the host country and thus no issue of immunity arose. 
The incident led to the laying of criminal charges in Canada last 
year for trafficking in narcotics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fifth case involves a recent allegation of an indecent act 
in a park by a minor dependant. The department waived immunity in 
this case and the matter is before the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>1. The word “diplomat” is used in a generic sense to cover all 
persons enjoying consular and diplomatic immunities and 
privileges.

<A NAME="LINK185">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 1 
</UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-7 be amended by adding after line 43 on page 7 
the following new clause: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“3.1 The lieutenant governor in council of a province 
may, by order, fix an age greater than ten years but not 
greater than eighteen years for the purposes of exemption 
from the application of this Act and the provisions of any 
other Acts amended by this Act, in which case the Young 
Offenders Act, as it reads at the time the order is made, 
continues to apply in that province.” 
</UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 3 
</UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-7, in Clause 199, be amended by replacing line 
18 on page 169 with the following: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“199. This Act replaces the Young Offenders Act, 
except in a province that makes an order under section 3.1, 
in which case the Young Offenders Act remains in force in 
that province.” 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, I wish to take this opportunity to say 
that the amendments moved by the Bloc Quebecois are inspired, and 
this is easily understandable, by the situation in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to remind the House that the member for 
Berthier—Montcalm has recently travelled across Quebec to 
explain to young stakeholders the threat that Bill C-7 
represents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is a warning we should issue to this government, it is 
to say that it should not try to impose on teenagers a criminal 
justice system made for adults. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent weeks, the member for Berthier—Montcalm has met many 
people, including teenagers, directors of youth centres, law 
enforcement officers, social workers in local community service 
centres or elsewhere. 
The member for Berthier—Montcalm has travelled from one end of 
Quebec to the other. He went to Jonquière, to the Lower St. 
Lawrence, to the Matapédia, to Bonaventure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Stakeholders and teenagers who were made aware of the possible 
consequences of Bill C-7 all had the same reaction. They all 
wanted to know what these consequences would be. The fact is that 
the youth justice system will no longer be focused on teenagers 
and their characteristics, but on the nature of the offence. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1520"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This balanced attitude towards the young offender, his past and 
his rehabilitation will now be replaced by a plan exclusively 
focussed on the offence. Let us be straightforward about this: 
all other factors related to the personal history of the young 
offender, and to his rehabilitation potential will take a 
backseat. Our amendment would allow Quebec to keep its tradition 
and programs of the last 20 years and more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, the chief whip of the Bloc Quebecois, will 
certainly agree with me that caucus proceedings are secret. But I 
think he will let me break this well established rule in our 
institutions by saying that we had the visit of a young actor in 
caucus this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marc Beaupré, the actor who plays the role of Kevin Teasdale in 
a very popular TV series, <I>Les deux frères</I>, has agreed to join 
the Bloc Quebecois campaign. What is this campaign about? The 
likeable and dynamic member for Berthier—Montcalm has already 
travelled throughout Quebec for this campaign. A pamphlet has 
been put out, and I would have liked to have it here, but 
logistical problems have made this impossible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Berthier—Montcalm has lead this campaign on 
behalf of all his Bloc Quebecois colleagues. It is called 
“Donnez-nous une chance”. What does that mean? It means we should 
refrain from automatically criminalizing young offenders. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I hope the hon. member will excuse me.  There have been further 
consultations which are moving us all toward further 
enlightenment.  I think you would find consent in the House to 
revert to routine proceedings for the purpose of three items. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent of the House to 
revert at this stage to routine proceedings? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard :</B> Mr. Speaker, obviously there seems to be some 
misunderstanding among the House leaders and I invite them to 
work it out. I do not like to be disturbed when I am in the 
middle of something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Berthier—Montcalm led a campaign that took him 
all over Quebec. What we heard from young people during that 
campaign was “Give us a chance”. I see that the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Justice is with us today. I would 
like to remind him that there is a consensus in Quebec. I 
challenge anybody on the government side, including Liberal 
members from Quebec, to give us one example of a person working 
with youth who does not support the Quebec consensus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was saying a few moments ago that the actor who plays the role 
of Kevin in the television series I mentioned, Marc Beaupré, a 
talented actor—and he is not partisan—accompanied the member 
for Berthier—Montcalm when he went to Jonquière, 
Rivière-du-Loup, the Lower St. Lawrence, the North Shore, all 
over Quebec. I was told about the warm welcome he got from the 
residents of the North Shore, and we all know the tradition of 
hospitality that is personified by the member for Charlevoix. It 
must be realized that a consensus does exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marc Beaupré, the actor, gave us an example that I will share 
with the members. It may be a minor violation of caucus 
confidentiality, but it will not cast a shadow over my legendary 
discretion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marc Beaupré was leaving the Joliette area in his car. He 
accepted to give a ride to a female hitchhiker whose exact age is 
unknown but who looked to be in her early 20s, maybe less, 
perhaps not quite 18. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Sixteen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, remember when you were sixteen. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1525"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT18"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT18"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1525

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, Marc Beaupré accepted to give a ride to this young girl who 
had had a difficult life and had been placed in a drop-in centre, 
a youth centre. She talked to Kevin, played by actor Marc 
Beaupré, and said that notwithstanding the difficult 
circumstances of her life that had brought her to commit an 
offence, she had a good experience in the youth centre, because 
she became aware of a number of things, developed certain 
talents and, more importantly, established a meaningful 
relationship with a youth worker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the new Bill C-7, which puts the offence at the heart of the 
decisions that the judiciary will have to make, if that person 
had been held in a regular institution, a penitentiary or any 
similar institution, could she have had the same meaningful 
relationship she had in a youth centre? Of course not, because 
the prisons are not focused on rehabilitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In keeping with the consensus in Quebec, when young people 
commit offences, misbehave, violate the law, we are not saying 
that they should not be punished or that we should grant them 
absolution, we are saying that efforts must be made to try and 
understand why they acted the way they did. These young people 
should be allowed to benefit from rehabilitation experiences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec there are youth centres, specialized institutions that 
allow young people to have a meaningful relationship with a youth 
worker and to get some learning experience. This learning 
experience is sometimes more focused on the professional aspect 
and sometimes more of a soul-searching exercise. Some young 
people need to do some soul-searching, to understand why, in 
certain circumstances, they tend to have a violent behaviour. 
Where did they learn that, in society, when there is a conflict, 
when there are problems to be solved, mediation must be through 
violence? Some youth workers provide training workshops. 
Sometimes these are about professional life, sometimes young 
people learn a trade.  And sometimes, these workshops have 
nothing to do with that, they deal with the soul-searching some 
young people must do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly, if Bill C-7 is passed, we do not believe that such a 
thing will be possible. We do not believe this is desirable for 
the mental stability of young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another argument was brought to our attention. I ask the 
government to consider the approach taken by the hon. member for 
Berthier—Montcalm, to consider that there is a special 
rehabilitation system in Quebec and to allow some sort of opting 
out, so that Quebec can apply the whole system, whose value has 
been proven, a system that defence lawyers, youth workers and the 
CLSCs are calling for. With current system, whose value has been 
proven in Quebec, I believe it will possible to rehabilitate 
young people.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>YOUTH CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK196">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of Bill C-7, an act in respect 
of criminal justice for young persons and to amend and repeal 
other acts, as reported (with amendment) from the committee, and 
of Motions Nos. 1 and 3. 
<P><A NAME="LINK197"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to be able to respond today to the opposition's motion 
to amend Bill C-7, the youth criminal justice act.  Motion No. 2 
calls for section 125 to be amended to make disclosure of 
information about young persons mandatory rather than permissive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 125, like the Young Offenders Act, specifically 
recognizes the interest of schools, professionals and other 
persons engaged in the supervision or care of a young person in 
receiving information when a young person is dealt with under the 
youth criminal justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 125 allows the provincial director, the attorney 
general, a peace officer or any other person engaged in the 
provision of services to a young person to disclose identifying 
information with any professional or other person engaged in the 
supervision or care of a young person, including a representative 
of a school.  It does so under the following circumstances: to 
ensure compliance for the young person with a court order; to 
ensure the safety of staff, students or other persons; or to 
facilitate the rehabilitation of the young person.  This can be 
done without a court order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The section expands the Young Offenders Act provision that was 
included in 1995 by adding the authority to disclose information 
to facilitate rehabilitation of a young person.  It is important 
that privacy protections are a hallmark of the youth justice 
system in Canada.  Any disclosure of identifying— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  The Table needs to know 
whether the hon. member is speaking to Motion No. 1 or to Motion 
No. 2? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am actually speaking to 
Motion No. 2, but I will be getting to Motions Nos. 1 and 3 
subsequently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  I am sorry to inform the 
member that we are on Motions Nos. 1 and 3 and the hon. member 
should limit his remarks to those motions.  We will come to 
Motion No. 2 a bit later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, Motions No. 1 and 3 would 
allow a province to opt out of the youth criminal justice act and 
continue to apply the Young Offenders Act.  Although some have 
questioned the need for new youth justice legislation, it is 
apparent that most Canadians feel that the Young Offenders Act is 
not working effectively as a legislative base for the youth 
justice system in Canada.  More than 16 years with experience 
with the Young Offenders Act backs up the perception that there 
are many real problems with the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed youth criminal justice act would address key 
problems with the Young Offenders Act.  It does not reflect the 
coherent youth justice philosophy.  Its principles are 
conflicting and do not effectively guide decision makers in the 
youth justice system.  It has resulted in the highest youth 
incarceration rate in the western world per capita, including 
that of the United States.  It has resulted in overuse of the 
courts for minor cases that could be better dealt with outside 
the courts.  It has resulted in disparities and unfairness in 
sentencing.  It fails to ensure effective reintegration of a 
young person after being released from custody.  Its process for 
transfer to the adult system has resulted in unfairness and 
delay.  It fails to make a clear distinction between serious 
violent offences and less serious offences.  It fails to 
recognize the concerns and interests of victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed youth criminal justice act effectively addresses 
these problems in a manner that also provides considerable 
flexibility for the provinces to implement the legislation to 
reflect local needs and circumstances.  However there are 
appropriate limits to this flexibility.  The youth criminal 
justice act is founded on federal criminal law and criminal 
procedure power.  There should be only one youth criminal justice 
law operating in Canada and fundamental legal principles would be 
respected.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we have been waiting since 1993 for significant changes 
to the Young Offenders Act that have not come from the 
government.  I am afraid, even with the new bill, that the 
changes are not the kind of changes most Canadians are looking 
for.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard from a number of individuals from Quebec over the 
last eight years.  The polls indicate very strongly to me that 
the people of Quebec are not happy with the Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc would like to keep the legislation intact because it 
claims that it is highly successful and popular in the province 
of Quebec.  I would question that as being a fact.  All victims 
of various incidents of violence and crimes by young offenders 
who reside in Quebec and to whom I have talked tell me quite the 
contrary to what I am hearing from Bloc members.  I believe it is 
time for a change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately I cannot personally support the bill because it is 
not the kind of change that Canadians are looking for with regard 
to young offenders.  We want to see some very serious things 
happen.  The Bloc's reason for not supporting it is that it wants 
to keep the status quo.  The status quo is not satisfactory 
anywhere in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill was adopted in 1984.  In 1994 it was supposed to come 
under a 10 year review.  The justice department came out with a 
report.  It indicated that crime, particularly violent crime 
among young people, was increasing at an extremely high rate.  In 
1994 it was reported to be nearly 300% to 350% higher than it was 
in 1984 when the Young Offenders Act was brought in.  It is going 
in the wrong direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we hear the rhetoric that everything is all right and that 
it is decreasing by 3% or 2%.  That tells me it has levelled off 
for the time being, but it is still 300% higher than it was when 
it was first brought in.  Surely it cannot be acceptable to the 
people in Quebec that they would have this high increase over a 
10 year period since the act was introduced.  There has to be 
something wrong somewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage Bloc members to go back and visit with people 
throughout their province to make certain the happiness they 
claim exists with the bill really and truly does.  I believe they 
would find that not to be the case.  Our party will be opposing 
the motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I have a few remarks on why the NDP will not be supporting 
Motions Nos. 1 and 3 in the name of the Bloc member.  These 
motions, if passed, would have the effect of allowing the 
province of Quebec to opt out of the youth criminal justice act. 
That would not be acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say this in the context of belonging to a party which on other 
issues and at other times has supported the ability of Quebec to 
opt out of certain national social programs with compensation. In 
the past our party has supported the recognition of Quebec as a 
distinct society in terms of its civil law, its French language 
and its culture, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However allowing Quebec to opt out of the youth criminal justice 
system, which would be applicable in every other part of the 
land, would be going much further than anything we have agreed to 
so far.  It would not be in keeping with the arguments we have 
advanced with respect to opting out when it came to other 
matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say this with some regret, because I have some sympathy for 
what members of the Bloc Quebecois have been saying about the 
youth criminal justice act.  They have indicated that in their 
home province the Young Offenders Act has been made to work 
better than in many other provinces.  As some would argue, the 
Young Offenders Act has worked in Quebec closer to what was 
intended when it was passed in 1984. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However that is not reason enough to make the leap that Quebec, 
or any other province for that matter, should be allowed to opt 
out and have its own separate youth criminal justice system. That 
is not something Canadians in general would find acceptable. They 
may not find the youth criminal justice act acceptable either. 
They may find, as we do, that the bill is imperfect to the point 
of not deserving our support.  They may find that it is 
cumbersome and complex, that it lacks the appropriate resources, 
and that all other things said about it by various critics at the 
provincial government level and others are correct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless the principle of there being one criminal law, 
whether it is criminal law for youth or a criminal law for 
others, for all Canadians no matter where they live is something 
I would want to uphold in this instance.  That is why the NDP 
will not be supporting Motions Nos. 1 and 3.

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much like the position that has been articulated by my colleague 
from Winnipeg—Transcona there is ample evidence, both in 
committee and before the House, that the province of Quebec has 
done exemplary work in the administration of the current Young 
Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has arguably set the standard for the rest of the country in 
the way in which it has been very innovative in early 
intervention and restorative justice model type programs aimed 
specifically and very directly at troubled youth before they 
enter the criminal justice system.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As was enunciated by the hon. member for Winnipeg—Transcona, 
the Progressive Conservative Party has in the past made 
monumental efforts to recognize the distinctness of Quebec not 
only in the area of justice but in the areas of culture and 
language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However in this instance we are dealing with a federal statute 
that pertains directly to the administration of justice.  This 
amendment would allow provinces to opt out completely, to take 
away federal jurisdiction and leave jurisdiction solely in the 
hands of one province.  That is dangerous and inconsistent with 
the administration of federal laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think all members would agree that an opting out provision on 
criminal law is a recipe for disaster. Criminal law must apply 
evenly and be administered with fairness and with balance across 
the country.  We cannot have bizarre sentencing schemes or 
justice that is seen as biased in any province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec's approach to criminal justice and youth criminal justice 
is arguably superior to that of other provinces and should be 
admired and emulated.  However, an amendment to opt out and 
administer separately and apart from the rest of the country 
would not be in keeping with federal legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the intent and spirit of what the hon. member has put 
forward but I cannot support the amendment.  We will have ample 
opportunity to debate this cumbersome and confusing bill in its 
entirety and to look at its many shortcomings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all its good intentions and emphasis on early intervention, 
the new law would shortchange provinces which try to administer 
it.  It would expand the existing Young Offenders Act twofold. 
The provinces would cry out for resources because the bill 
permits and alludes to the expansion of early intervention 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces would be left to live up to the standards the bill 
calls for without being given the resources to do so.  The 
Minister of Justice has given the provinces a postdated cheque. 
The bill would come into being after being rushed through 
committee, as we have seen in this session.  It would be foisted 
upon the provinces without the additional resources they would 
need to start and administer many of the programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are not my words or the words of the Progressive 
Conservative Party.  Those words came directly from provincial 
representatives who appeared before the committee.  They 
expressed grave concerns that the federal government, through 
Bill C-7, was trying to raise public expectations that all would 
be well if the bill came into being.   They said that the notion 
of putting in place early intervention programs and restorative 
justice models without the resources to back it up, both human 
and monetary, was a fallacy.  The provinces, given the option, 
would have preferred to keep the old bill.  They would have 
simply asked the federal government for the money, the know-how 
and the support to put programs in place to make the existing 
system work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have worked in the justice system in administering the YOA.  I 
think Quebec recognized very early on that although there are 
flaws in the Young Offenders Act there are ways to make it work. 
Quebec has set the standard and raised the bar in terms of its 
ability to work within the parameters of the old law.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a matter of giving more resources to provinces to allow 
them to fully administer programs, be innovative, make early 
interventions and set up programs for counselling.  Such programs 
were aimed at putting youth on the right path as opposed to 
attempting after the fact to usher them through the criminal 
justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will touch for a moment on the upshot of what the new bill 
would do.  It would cause incredible delay by introducing new 
procedures and processes pertaining to parole and early release, 
to the determination of violent versus non-violent offences, to 
new types of conditional sentences and to new types of tracking 
systems, so-called extrajudicial remedies that police officers 
would administer.  All this would result in more appeals and more 
confusion over what the law means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Judges came before the committee, judges with incredible 
experience in the criminal justice system and with the Young 
Offenders Act, who said they did not understand the bill and how 
it would work.  They said they did not believe it would in any 
way improve the criminal justice system.  They believed it would 
result in further delays. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The holding of young people to account, the protection of the 
public and the involvement of the state in rehabilitating young 
people would simply not occur.  The resulting delays would 
perpetuate a system which is already confusing and frustrating 
for all participants, not only police, prosecutors, lawyers and 
judges but the young people themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will take an incredible amount of time to weed through the 
new bill to discern and comprehend what the drafters intended. It 
has a very academic feel as opposed to a practical, pragmatic 
and, dare I say, streamlined one which was likely the drafters' 
intent when they undertook the task of rewriting our youth 
criminal justice law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us does the complete opposite.  It is not 
streamlined.  It is thicker.  It is more cumbersome.  It is more 
confusing.  It adds new procedures.  It adds new elements of 
delay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude on this note.  We all know the old legal maxim 
that justice delayed is justice denied.  The bill would do just 
that.  It would allow lawyers, on behalf of their young clients, 
to exploit these new procedures and cause lengthy delays that 
would deny the administration of justice.  For that reason and 
those I have enunciated I cannot support the amendment.  Nor do I 
support the bill.

have listened to all the remarks since the beginning of this 
debate, and I would like to go back on some of the questions 
that have been raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the Alliance member for Wild Rose said “I encourage 
Bloc members to go back and visit with people in Quebec. They 
will find out that they are against this and want changes to the 
Young Offenders Act”. The hon. member is certainly not reading 
the papers these days. Since Sunday, May 13, I have been on a 
whirlwind tour of Quebec, which has already taken me to 
Montreal, Laval, Bonaventure, Sept-îles, Jonquière, and 
Sherbrooke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just before coming to the House today, I gave a press conference 
and I met people in Hull, Gatineau, and Aylmer to discuss the 
Young Offenders Act and Bill C-7 of the Minister of Justice. 
During this tour, I met experts, but also ordinary citizens, 
mothers and fathers. I will meet more people, because I will be 
touring for five or six more days.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these people told me the same thing: We do not want the 
federal government to tell us how to raise our children. We have 
legislation called the Young Offenders Act and if it is applied 
properly, that legislation gives good results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the hon. member wondering if I know what is going on in my 
province, I can say that I do. I do not claim to know everything, 
and that is why I keep on touring Quebec. However, I have not 
seen anyone who was happy with the minister's amendments. No one 
in Quebec wants to see the Young Offenders Act amended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, there is room for improvement. If we had more money 
in order to apply that legislation even better, we would get 
better results. The justice minister said the implementation of 
Bill C-7 would cost Canadian taxpayers between $200 million and 
$250 million. That is just for implementing Bill C-7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the federal government has money it does not know what to do 
with, here is what I say: “Do not allow yourselves the luxury of 
a new act that no one wants and that everyone, even in the 
western provinces, finds complicated; invest more money so that 
provinces know and implement the Young Offenders Act better”. The 
success of a good implementation lies in knowing the tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They come up with extrajudicial measures as if it were something 
new to Bill C-7. 
But the Young Offenders Act already provides for alternative 
measures and we have been enforcing them for a long time in 
Quebec. This no doubt explains why we have the lowest crime rate 
in Canada. The province also has the lowest recidivism rate and 
the lowest detention rate<B>. </B>This may be because we enforce the 
law correctly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The justice critic for the Progressive Conservative Party, the 
hon. member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, spoke highly of 
Quebec. He said that Quebec is more successful than any other 
province. This is true. He praised Quebec's approach. And 
government members made similar comments. Do members realize that 
the bill they are about to pass—and I do hope they will not pass 
it—, the bill the government wants us to pass will put an end to 
this excellent success by Quebec? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec's whole approach is now jeopardized. If members do not 
wish to listen to me, the member for Berthier—Montcalm, 
hopefully they will listen to all the Quebecers who daily enforce 
the Young Offenders Act. This is why Quebec has such good success 
rates.

Justice Michel Jasmin appeared before the Standing Committee on 
Justice and Human Rights. 
This is not someone who knows nothing about the law.  Justice 
Michel Jasmin is the co-ordinating judge of the Youth Court of 
Quebec.  He came and told us that what the federal government was 
about to do was a mistake.  We should at least listen to those 
individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec coalition for youth justice is a group of thirty to 
forty agencies that enforce the Young Offenders Act on a daily 
basis, and it said the same thing.  They told us that the problem 
was not the Young Offenders Act, but the way it is implemented. 
It has to be better enforced. But to be better enforced, this 
legislation needs to be better understood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that, as members representing ridings, as 
legislators in this House, before we amend the law, we should try 
to find out what the problem is.  The problem is not the law but 
its enforcement. Let us work together to find a better way to 
enforce the law and inform the other provinces about the success 
achieved in Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the minister made some 166 amendments to the bill 
as it existed before the election of November 2000, in order to 
satisfy Quebec she says. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government across the way refused to hear what witnesses 
from Quebec had to say about his proposed amendments.  The 
government is embarrassed because it is fully aware that these 
amendments, as well as Bill C-7 we are now debating, are not in 
line with what is done in Quebec, and in fact go against 
everything that has been done in Quebec for at least 20 years. 
The government did not want to hear this.  It lacked the courage 
to hear those individuals who enforce that law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I toured the province a woman told me: “Everything you said 
about implementing the legislation and what a teenager needs to 
get back on the right track is true. The good thing about the 
Young Offenders Act is that it takes the human factor into 
account. The YOA is also good for families and for parents 
because it gives them something to do. The legislation gives them 
the right to act in order to help their children get out of 
trouble”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is one area where there is no discrimination it is 
youth crime. We find young offenders in poor families as well as 
in rich ones. No one is immune to the phenomenon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I myself have kids. If one day because of peer pressure from 
friends or a street gang, or because of school or for any other 
reason, one of my kids or both of them stray from the path, I 
would prefer them to come under the Young Offenders and not the 
legislation the minister wants to shove down Quebec's throat 
because the YOA gives me, the parent, a say in what happens to my 
kids, 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-7 contains a series of automatic responses and measures. 
Everything is left to the justice system. The cases are withdrawn 
from stakeholders who know very well how to deal with young 
offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If their offence is serious, they will be given a pre-determined 
sentence while if it is not so serious, they will be given a 
simple warning. 
It will not be possible to intervene at the right moment, do the 
right thing, and treat young offenders properly. That is what is 
catastrophic and what the government does not seem to understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am told that I only have one minute left. I could speak for 
hours on this issue because it is a subject that is close to my 
heart, and this has nothing to do with party politics. I met 
people and I will meet many more still during the tour I am doing 
with an excellent spokesperson, Marc Beaupré. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marc Beaupré is not in politics precisely because he pursues 
social causes. He is an actor playing the role of Kevin in the 
series <I>Les deux frères</I>. He is a talented young actor who 
decided to join us, not the Bloc Quebecois, but all those of us 
who want to fight for children in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He wants to convince the minister and the government that they 
are on the wrong track. He is trying to reach out to them, as we 
do, to make them understand.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased, for various reasons, to speak to Bill C-7. I want to 
start by paying a most sincere tribute to the member for 
Berthier—Montcalm for the colossal work he has done on this 
issue, as he does on all issues in which he is involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But his work on this issue is particularly remarkable. We know 
that he has been trying for months to get through to the 
government. He did it, among other things, by proposing 3,000 
amendments in committee, 2,977 of which were ruled in order by 
the chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also did it in a colossal way by speaking in committee for a 
period equivalent to almost 27 hours without interruption, 
probably to the great joy of his colleagues opposite. 
He did it very effectively, all things being relative of course. 
Let us say it was a relative joy—

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gérard Asselin:</B> We did not get to vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau:</B> My colleague reminds me that we did not get 
to vote. We know how timid this government is when it comes to 
using all the powers available to it, particularly to limit 
debate. We know how, in this great Canadian democracy, 
parliamentarians are free to express their opinions. We know how 
much we like to tell other countries how to run their affairs. 
This is part of the hypocrisy we were talking about a moment ago 
during Oral Question Period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of that, I hope that the Bloc will find a way to set 
the record straight, faced as we are with a government that is 
becoming more and more arrogant, and even more so since the last 
election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So I want to salute my hon. colleague for Berthier—Montcalm, who 
is touring all the regions of Quebec now to focus public 
attention on the fact that this bill contains certain totally 
unacceptable things which are absolutely contrary—and this is the 
aspect I want to bring to the attention of the hon. members—to a 
way of doing things which is really unique to Quebec and which, 
moreover, is a great success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must bear in mind that young Quebecers represent 23% of young 
Canadians but only 11% of young Canadians who are in trouble 
with the law. This is a sign that the Quebec approach is 
effective. While there are 201 cases involving young people 
before the courts in Quebec, there are 435 in the rest of 
Canada. That is the proof that the approach of Quebec is 
effective, valid and personalized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1970s, there was a slogan in Quebec “Québec sait faire”, 
or if you prefer “Quebec has the know-how”. Quebec does have the 
know-how in the field of juvenile delinquency. Quebec knows how 
to do things well, by respecting individuals and giving them a 
chance. 
Given our tradition, Quebec's rehabilitation rate is very high 
compared to the Canadian approach which is focusing more on a 
punitive approach and on repression, the words are delicate 
here, as we tend to make everything we can to rehabilitate the 
individual and get him back into society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is this approach that is now being challenged in the federal 
bill; it is challenged in what I call our soul. Crime is always 
a touchy subject in any society, all the more so when it 
concerns young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have developed a model that works very well and that makes a 
wide use of the Quebec expertise. 
We are faced here with a process that does not recognize 
Quebec's performance and originality, that even holds it in 
contempt. It crushes this specificity and distinctiveness—I am 
sure members understand what that means—that come perhaps from 
being a distinct society. I am using the very words used by the 
Prime Minister in his post-referendum motion when he declared 
that Quebec is a distinct society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the government does not recognize this so-called 
distinct society that the member for Saint-Maurice has in mind, 
whether it concerns young offenders, parental leave or the $5 à 
day day care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It indicates an obvious lack of courage. 
All we are asking as Quebecers, all my colleague from 
Berthier—Montcalm is asking as a member of the House of Commons, 
all the coalition is asking for, based on a consensus among 
Quebecers, is that Quebec be allowed to use its own approach and 
that it be allowed to withdraw from this bill, if only on the 
basis of its distinct character. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the use of having a consensus in a society which 
purports to be a democratic society—and Quebec is a democratic 
society—and of asking every Tom, Dick and Harry and various 
prestigious organizations—my colleague from Berthier—Montcalm 
listed them earlier—as well as criminal lawyers, youth centers, 
youth protection services, psychologists, etc., when everyone 
agrees that the Quebec approach is the best?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Its the best because 
it is focused on the individual and his special needs. The 
justice system examines every individual on a case-by-case basis 
to understand his personal development, to see if he can be 
rehabilitated, if he cooperates, if he has a good behaviour. This 
formula works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When all those in the know say that we should keep the status 
quo, what gives members opposite the right to do what they are 
doing? They are obeying a mean western right wing anxious to 
stomp on those who have made mistakes in their youth without 
giving them a chance to make amends. They would lock them up and 
throw away the keys. Why should Quebec have to submit to such a 
process? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a wonderful example—and you can be sure that your 
humble servant will use it to the best of his intellectual 
capacities—of the price Quebec has to pay for its dependence, 
its non-sovereignty. This is the result of having voted no in the 
1995 referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are ramming down our throats legislation which is 
steamrolling over Canada and from now on, things will be decided 
here and no longer in Vancouver, or Winnipeg, Halifax, Toronto 
and especially not in Quebec City. Things will be decided here, 
from coast to coast, with national standards for health, 
education, and social programs as is this could be called. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will be the leader. Even when the public is 
against it, or when the major stakeholders are against it as is 
the case with Bill C-7 on young offenders, it strong-headedly, 
arrogantly, heavy-handedly forges ahead with its legislation 
instead of been true to its promise. A promise from whom? From 
none other than the Prime Minister. He is the one who used the 
expression distinct society to deceive Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With every week, and every month that goes by we realize that 
the Prime Minister's distinct society is but an empty shell. He 
was talking through his hat. He was trying to fool people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next time when there is a referendum in Quebec, soon we hope, 
people can count on us to appeal to Quebecers' wisdom and remind 
them they should no longer trust this Prime Minister; they should 
not put their trust either in his predecessors such as Pierre 
Elliott Trudeau, who was his mentor, or for that matter any other 
prime minister in this supposedly great democratic country. They 
made promises during the referendum campaign, at a three-day 
love-in. They make nice memories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They made commitments and promised to put their heads on the 
chopping block. They made commitments, in Verdun this time, only 
to break them and lie to the people of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contempt can only last for a while.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, usually, 
it is a pleasure for me to speak in this House, but, today, I am 
very sad.  With Bill C-7, we will be burying a practice that has 
proven its mettle in Quebec, that of democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I begin, I would like to congratulate my colleague, the 
member for Berthier—Montcalm, for preventing the government from 
burying the Young Offenders Act for years now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, in the Jonquière region, with stakeholders from the 
community, I attended a meeting.  In attendance were 
representatives of the Centres jeunesse du Saguenay, the head of 
youth protection, the Syndicat des enseignants de Jonquière, the 
Corporation de développement communautaire des Deux-Rives, which 
comprises some 50 community organizations and the Aînés de JAK 
de Jonquière, senior citizens.  They said “No, no, no.  We 
seniors oppose this bill”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, there was the Association des parents d'ados, an 
organization helping young people.  This organizations provides 
a 24 hour help line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also in attendance were the Patro de Jonquière, streetworkers, 
Justice alternative jeunesse du Saguenay Inc., the Commission 
scolaire des rives du Saguenay, the Commission scolaire de 
Jonquière, the Association québécoise de défense des droits des 
personnes retraitées et préretraitées, the Centres Jeunesse and 
a number of individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They all came to speak to my colleague and to Marc Beaupré, the 
person in charge of the non political aspect of the issue in 
Quebec.  It is far too important an issue to make it political. 
Marc Beaupré is doing an excellent job of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also attended a meeting in the riding of Sherbrooke, with my 
colleague who represents that riding and about twenty 
stakeholders, ordinary people, street workers, community 
organizations. They came to tell my colleague and me that they 
did not want this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are the ones who are the first to intervene with young 
people. They are the ones who know how effective the Young 
Offenders Act is in Quebec. I am not saying that it does not need 
any improvement. Nothing is perfect in this world. But these 
people work with this act and they are telling us “We have the 
right tools; we must just improve them and invest in the front 
line, that is, in prevention”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what they came to tell us. I did not ask them to do so. 
They are the ones who agreed to meet my colleague and who said 
“Congratulations, you are informed. You are defending young 
people. You are defending tomorrow's society”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last couple days, I have been witnessing a vaudeville in 
the House. We know what a vaudeville is. It is a human comedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think now that enough is enough. What is happening now with 
this arrogant government is enough. The Minister of Justice 
should go and listen to the Quebec people. Why does she not 
travel? I am prepared to invite her to my riding of Jonquière, so 
she can meet workers who will tell her about their views on the 
Young Offenders Act and Bill C-7. I would like that. I am 
inviting her. I am extending my hand to her. 
I would even like to invite the Prime Minister and tell him “Come 
and listen to ordinary people. You are a lawyer by training. Come 
and listen”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Judges are saying that they will not know how to implement Bill 
C-7. Moreover, it will cost between $200 million and $250 million 
to do so. That money will not go to young people. It will be lost 
in structures such as buildings and facilities, and in training 
for judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two hundred and fifty million dollars to implement a bill, when 
street workers back home are not even paid minimum wage to 
provide frontline to young offenders. They sure could use $250 
million. In Quebec, the recidivism rate is nil. It would be 
wonderful; things would be even better. We would be able to help 
young people who have stumbled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At age 14, we all make foolish mistakes, including you and I, 
Mr. Speaker. Should a 14 year old be branded for the rest of his 
life? Today's young people are not allowed to buy alcohol or 
cigarettes until they are 18 years of age. The law prohibits them 
from doing that. But at age 14, they would be sentenced and 
branded for the rest of their life? This is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we get this across to the Minister of Justice, all 
members from Quebec and all Liberal members from Quebec? They 
should tell their minister “Open your eyes. We are successful in 
Quebec. Make sure it gets even better. Help us improve things if 
necessary, but do not dismiss it out of hand and start all over 
again”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been successfully implementing this legislation for 
years in Quebec. Why should we pay for the other provinces, which 
had the same legislation, but did not implement it?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am speaking for young people. I have children myself, and I 
have grandchildren, as do many of you and many of those watching 
us today. Parents came and told us “The young offenders system 
is helping us. But with this bill, it will become judicialized”. 
This is not what people want. They want assistance, assistance 
for the young people, and for their families so that the young 
people can learn to take charge and make something out of their 
lives. This is possible under the present Young Offenders Act, 
but it will not be under Bill C-7. What a shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know how I will proceed, but I have a lot of 
imagination and I will not allow the minister to come in my 
province, where we are successful, and establish a system under 
which this success will be ignored, and young people will have 
no opportunity to take their destiny into their own hands. This 
is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, actor Marc Beaupré came to speak with young people. 
He asked them what they thought about the bill. They answered 
“We cannot support this bill. You must stop them”. But how can 
they be stopped? That is the question I ask Quebecers and 
Canadians, as well as the Liberals in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking the Liberals “When will you stop criminalizing young 
people with such a bill?” I do not think that we should throw 
stones at the young person who commits an offence. In life, we 
should all have an opportunity to get their lives back together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my family there are several lawyers, so I know how the 
judicial system works. Instead of helping young people we will 
put them through the judicial system. That is enough. We are 
dealing with young people less than 18 years old, not with 
adults. Oddly enough, adults sentenced to six years of prison, 
thanks to a remission of sentence, serve only two years. That is 
serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Presently, under the Young Offenders Act, young people sentenced 
to six years serve six years. They serve their sentence in a 
rehabilitation system, in institutions that allow them to know 
themselves and progress. This is possible under the Young 
Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister must be thinking “I made a mistake. We must allowed 
Quebec to withdraw from the application of that act”. We must be 
allowed to keep on applying proactive measures for our youth. We 
are asking her to allow us to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If she wants to maintain her bill as is, she should keep it for 
the other provinces and let Quebec withdraw from its 
application. That is what I am asking her to do. If she 
maintains it as is, I will vote against it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK206"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Bas-Richelieu—Nicolet—Bécancour, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I pleased to address the House, and I want first to 
congratulate my colleague for Berthier—Montcalm on his splendid 
job of raising the level of public awareness within Quebec and 
probably in the rest of Canada also. He is getting feedback from 
Canadians throughout the country about the public awareness 
campaign he is waging against this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People do not see this bill for what it really is. It is a far 
right bill, a punitive bill. It does not allow young offenders to 
get back on the right track, and it does not allow for their 
rehabilitation. In Quebec, rehabilitation is working, and it is 
working well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A recent report broadcast on the TV program <I>Le Point</I> showed 
two teenagers who had committed roughly the same crimes. The 
Quebec method was used with one of these youngsters, and he is 
now rehabilitated, he is back in his community, and he is doing 
fine. The prevailing punitive method that they want to make even 
tougher in the rest of Canada was used with the second one. He 
ended up in prison, which is a school for crime. While in prison, 
he learned how to become a more dangerous criminal.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what we want the minister and the government to 
understand. We are telling them “In Quebec, there are people, 
and not just anyone, judges, police officers, crown attorneys, 
school boards, scholars, academics, social services people, 
community groups, youth centres, the youth protection branch, 
all those who are providing social services to young people, who 
are saying that changing the present system does not make any 
sense. Pass your bill if you want, but let Quebec pull out and 
keep its rehabilitative approach as opposed to a punitive 
approach, such as the one proposed in the bill”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All those people are asking for this, and I fail to understand 
the Liberals' position. If we look at the members across the 
way, we see that they are keeping a very low profile. They were 
told to shut up, and they chose to serve the Liberal Party 
instead of the interests of the people. I am addressing my 
remarks to the Liberal members of Quebec in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the election campaign, you said “We will try to influence 
the government from inside and ensure that Quebec will be 
respected and that policies are adapted to Quebec's reality”. 
However, when they have an opportunity to express themselves on 
a bill that is unanimously rejected in Quebec—the opposition 
comes not only from the Bloc, but from all the main forces of 
Quebec—what do they do? I am looking at them right now, and they 
are not saying a thing. They remain silent, and they prefer to 
serve the Liberal Party instead of the interests of Quebec. 
They prefer to work for financial moguls who contribute to their 
campaign funds to the tune of $100,000 at a time, and for 
western Canada to try to get some votes there. They have turned 
their backs on Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each time members from Quebec are elected as government members, 
the problem is the same.  It is more obvious within the Liberal 
Party, because this is the party with two different attitudes: 
one during the campaign, when Mr. Chrétien speaks loud and 
clear, and a completely different one after the election.  Then 
the Liberal members from Quebec suddenly become silent and 
ignorant.  It is incredible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see people like the member for Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies, 
who was a president of the Quebec teacher's corporation, a man 
who had a career, a man from the left who was even friendly with 
Khadafy in Libya, a leftist from Quebec who, suddenly, remains 
silent, in his seat, and repudiates his commitments, rejecting 
everything to serve the Liberal Party and all its underhanded 
practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see people like the member for Saint-Laurent—Cartierville, an 
academic, who is not saying a thing, when all his peers have 
expressed their opposition to this bill. All the academics, all 
the university student associations, all the youth centres, all 
the legal community and all the police associations have said 
they are against this bill.  But the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs says nothing and claims he to be 
serving Quebec's interests. 
Why, then, is he saying nothing? He remains silent, sitting back 
in his seat, oblivious of his duties toward Quebec. Is this not 
a totally reprehensible attitude? Why is the minister not 
fighting for Quebec? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the newly re-elected member for Portneuf remain silent 
today, he who spoke against Pierre de Savoye, a great spokesman 
for Quebec? Where is the former minister who sharply criticized 
Mr. Turp, and won against him, while Mr. Turp rose almost every 
day in the House to defend Quebec's interests? In his maiden 
speech, he sullied Mr. Turp's reputation and then he claimed to 
be fighting for Quebec. Is it time for the member for 
Beauharnois—Salaberry to stand up. Why do you remain silent? Are 
you ashamed of your party? You should at least be ashamed of 
this bill, which is totally contrary to Quebec's interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You are here, in Ottawa, supposedly to fight for Quebec.  To the 
hon. member for Beauharnois—Salaberry, the hon. member for 
Portneuf, the hon. member who defeated Ms. Alarie, such a good 
advocate for the riding of Louis-Hébert. You have taken her seat 
because of the municipal amalgamations. You told her “I will 
fight for Quebec”. Please rise, Madam, and speak up.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No member from Quebec wants to talk; no Liberal member from 
Quebec wants to talk. And yet, as I said earlier, everybody in 
Quebec is saying “no” to this bill, all the law enforcement 
community, all the people in the judicial system, all the 
academics, all the social services community. They are all 
saying that Quebec must have the right to opt out of this bill 
to pursue its own line of action, which is far better and, 
moreover, a source of envy around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So why so quiet?  In the last campaign, you promised to serve 
the interests of your constituents, to serve the interests of 
Quebec.  Why do you say nothing?  Why do we hear nothing from 
you?  Why do you prefer serving the Liberal party to serving the 
interests of Quebec?  It is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will spread the word in your ridings. We will shout it from 
the rooftops.  There is a campaign under way for a visit to all 
the regions of Quebec to tell them about the attitude of the 
Liberal members from Quebec, who say nothing, who prefer 
betraying Quebec to serving it.  And that is unacceptable. 
Never has such a unanimous outpouring been heard from Quebec 
against this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They must take a stand, they must speak up and tell their 
minister “Pass your bill, but back off in Quebec”.  That is all 
we are asking and it would cost nothing 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But it is not even that. It is all part of the Liberal party's 
centralizing philosophy which says “In the future, there will be 
national standards; there will be only one nation.  The Quebec 
nation will not exist.  The French fact will not exist.  There 
will be one Canadian nation.  And you people in Quebec will not 
have a voice”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the Liberal party's philosophy, which the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs spouts and which the Liberal members 
from Quebec have decided to support, rather than serving their 
own constituents and listening to the alarm being raised by all 
Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that, I must close, because I have a meeting with some 
students from my riding, as it happens. 
I want to make them aware of this bill.  But I must say one last 
time how well this bill shows, once again, that we would be 
better served by ourselves.  If we were 100% ourselves, we would 
be much better off than being 25% of someone else.  That is why 
this bill once again shows the need for Quebec to be sovereign.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak to an amendment to the young offenders bill, 
which was brought forward by my colleague, the member for 
Berthier—Montcalm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment strongly suggests that Quebec be excluded from 
the application of the new legislation recently introduced by the 
Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be acknowledged that, during the course of this debate 
on amendments to the Young Offenders Act, the Minister of Justice 
showed good judgement on one particular occasion. Do you know 
when it was? It was when she recognized that Quebec was 
incredibly successful in the way it enforced the Young Offenders 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all her documents and even when she appeared before the 
Standing Committee on Justice, the minister recognized that 
Quebec had done so well with the Young Offenders Act that its 
success rate exceeded that of the Canadian provinces as a whole, 
with the lowest recidivism rate in North America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So why change things? Why ignore Quebec's success just because 
the YOA was a total failure elsewhere and because the right—that 
has become more powerful over the last seven or eight 
years—wants children to be treated like adults, wants them to be 
thrown in jail just like adults? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why a blanket policy? Why impose a new Young Offenders Act that 
makes no sense, thus ignoring the greatest consensus in recent 
years—a consensus supported by all stakeholders, who are against 
the fact that the Minister of Justice wants Quebec to be like any 
other province despite its successes? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1635"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about a consensus, we are not referring to a small 
one. The National Assembly has adopted a unanimous motion to 
postpone the review of this new Young Offenders Act, so that 
Quebec can keep on enforcing the law as it has always done with 
all the success it is known for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last two and a half or three years since the beginning of 
the debate on the reform of the Young Offenders Act, we have 
heard from people who work with young people on a day to day 
basis. These people try to ensure that these young people 
benefit from a first or a second chance, that they are given a 
chance. This is what young people want. We have demonstrated it 
in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we react with an open mind and give them a second chance, 
most young offenders do not commit other offences. However, when 
we put them in jail with adults, it is well known that prisons 
become criminal factories for them. They have an opportunity to 
meet hard-core criminals, real criminals, and living with them, 
they soon become like them. We deny them the chance to 
rehabilitate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In passing, I would like to congratulate my colleague from 
Berthier—Montcalm for his excellent work on raising awareness of 
the most important issues in this bill. He was telling me that 
he had met this afternoon with a University of Ottawa professor 
who had worked as a criminal lawyer in Alberta as well as in the 
Maritimes. He is well aware of the mess these provinces made in 
enforcing the Young offenders Act. He supports us. 
A University of Ottawa professor is supporting us in our 
opposition to changes to the Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, this shows that, in Quebec, when this act was 
properly enforced, there were some success stories. We have an 
incredible rate of success in the rehabilitation of young 
offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years, there have been many testimonies. Among other 
things, speaking about a consensus, a coalition was created in 
favour of justice for minors. Here is what this coalition said 
in September 1999, when we were dealing with the bill that 
preceded this one, which contained almost the same provisions, 
and which died on the order paper because the election was 
called. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Coalition pour la justice des mineurs said in September 1999: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before throwing away sixteen years of practices, adjustments and 
case law to engage in a program that breaks with traditions 
almost a century old, parliamentarians must ask themselves if it 
is worth doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will they have the courage to defend an act that is unanimously 
agreed on by those who know and use it, or will they give in to 
lobbies that are relying on misinformation to promote a program 
that is both mean-spirited and simplistic? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This tells a lot about the state of mind of those who oppose 
this reform. This reform makes no sense. It throws away all the 
efforts of people who work with young offenders to try to give 
them a chance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been other testimonies by people known for their 
great competence on the issue of rehabilitation of young 
offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is what André Normandeau, a criminologist from the 
University of Montreal, was saying in 1999: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in western Canada still react as they did 20 years ago, 
at a time when the crime rate increased each year. They have 
kept more of a punitive approach. Changing the law is the easy 
way out, but, more importantly, it does not work. Violent 
criminals, who represent 10% of offenders, do not respond to 
coercion. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an easy way out to resort to the stick, or the whip, as my 
father would have said. It is an easy way out to play petty 
politics in referring to a supposedly increasing youth crime 
rate, which is wrong and refuted by every statistics.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an easy way out to engage in petty politics at the expense 
of our children's future. It is cheap. There is no other word to 
describe what the minister is proposing and to describe also the 
support she can get from her Liberal colleagues or from Alliance 
members. It is cheap to play politics with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is cheap to use misinformation about an alleged increase in 
youth crime rate to show support for a right wing approach, for 
beating, or for the death penalty while at it. That is cheap. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First and foremost, we should think of our children. That is 
what we are doing in Quebec. 
Why not accept to exclude Quebec from the application of the new 
legislation? It would be so simple for some people to stop 
playing dumb and to open their minds to the fact that Quebec has 
made it work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why prevent us from continuing just because people from western 
Canada want to be tougher and Liberals are willing to go along? 
All they do is play petty politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not think of the children's future first? No wonder young 
people are no longer interested in what goes on in parliament. 
We are not listening to their concerns. We are ignoring their 
concerns. On top of that, we want to throw them in jail instead 
of giving them a second chance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In what kind of country do we live? Sometimes I wonder. The 
Minister of Justice is thick as a brick and she is narrow-minded. 
I have never met anybody as narrow-minded as she is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today again, on another bill, the one aimed at strengthening the 
criminal code, we mentioned the fact that the solicitor general 
said that the bill would not apply strictly to criminal groups, 
that it could go beyond that. The solicitor general could 
authorize a police officer to commit crimes to enforce the new 
provisions of the criminal code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the only thing wrong with this bill, but the minister 
could very well kill any support for her bill. The Bloc 
Quebecois has been calling for a strengthening of the criminal 
code for years to be able to fight crime more effectively. Why 
does the minister not go after real criminals instead of 
children? She should stop including in her legislation 
provisions that are too broad, thus killing any support we could 
have given her. She should open her mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite all my colleagues to vote in favour of the amendment 
proposed by the member for Berthier—Montcalm to exclude Quebec 
from the application of the new legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the 
hon. member for Cumberland—Colchester, Fisheries; the hon. member 
for South Shore, Fisheries. 
<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to rise today on behalf of voters in Quebec who elected us 
during the last election on November 27. This was a senseless 
election called by the prime minister, but it went ahead anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebecers, especially those in Charlevoix, were lucky enough to 
be able to make a democratic choice and send to the House of 
Communes an MP with the mandate to defend Quebec's interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very proud to rise today in the House to speak to Bill C-7 
on behalf of my constituents in Charlevoix, but most of all on 
behalf on young people in my riding. Our youth is our future. 
They will be penalized by Bill C-7 on young offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec National Assembly is totally opposed to the federal 
bill. Once again we feel that the federal government wants to 
centralize through a legislation the former Reform Party had 
asked for. The minister, in order to win a few ridings in 
Western Canada, has rehashed legislation asked for by the Reform 
Party now called the Canadian Alliance, only to win a few votes 
in Western Canada. This is been done at the expense of one 
province, Quebec, which is managing very well under the Young 
Offenders Act.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Statistics show that we have a rehabilitation system in Quebec. 
There are institutions for young people, such as drop-in centres, 
where they are followed by psychologists and have access to 
guidance and training. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of all this is social reintegration. Sometimes, 
because of bad luck, depression or drug or alcohol abuse, a 16- 
year old girl or boy commits an unfortunate act. Right after 
committing that act, that young person deserves some form of 
reintegration, of rehabilitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to Bill C-7, youngsters 14, 15 or 16 years old  would 
be put in jail for an undetermined period of time.  Putting a 
youngster away for ten years in a maximum security jail with 
adults, criminals, is like sending him to the university of 
crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be totally illogical to send a teenager who has 
committed an offence—oftentimes by order of an organized crime 
group—to “the pen” while organized crime members are free to 
come and go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The young offender obeyed orders, either to make money or to act 
out violently or because he was acting under remote-control. He 
would be sent to penitentiaries, those crime universities, for an 
indeterminate period of time that, as I said, could be from eight 
to ten years. The minister agrees to all of this, she is fully 
aware of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She will know that in Quebec, the justice system, the police, 
the CLSCs, in other words all those involved are unanimously 
rejecting this bill and saying that the minister is mistaken. It 
is totally illogical to send teenagers to prison while criminals, 
who are clearly identified with their crest on their backs, go 
about freely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because she made a mistake we are asking the minister to 
introduce a bill to fight organized crime. We are also telling 
her that Bill C-7 is targeting the wrong people, young offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since it has not yet achieved sovereignty, Quebec is still 
subject to federal legislation. The federal government is about 
to pass a bill that would be bad for Quebecers, who are 
unanimously denouncing it. The courts, educational institutions, 
penitentiaries, the police, lawyers, judges, everyone is against 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because we have not yet obtained sovereignty, because we are 
still dependent on the federal government, we must give in. The 
Liberal government in power is about to muzzle us by saying: “We 
will end the debate at such time, on such day and proceed to the 
vote”. With its majority in the House the Liberal government will 
once again pass a bill that will affect our constituents, 
particularly young Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the 1995 referendum campaign, many Canadians came to 
Montreal to tell us how much they loved us, how much they 
appreciated us and wanted to keep us in Canada. They wanted our 
young people to vote no. The difference between the yes and the 
no sides was about 50,000 votes. More than 48% voted yes, and the 
federal government won by a slim majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberal ministers from Quebec and even the Prime Minister 
travelled extensively throughout Quebec and its regions, and they 
made all sorts of promises. But the Liberal government's promises 
do not wash anymore, or they will not, because Quebec's motto is 
I remember.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope those who voted no in the referendums will remember that, 
once again, the Prime Minister of Canada has lied to and misled 
the population. Today, the minister is trying to have a bill 
passed that will be detrimental to Quebecers and young offenders 
in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate, but, in the circumstances, Bloc Quebecois 
members who are here to represent the young and Quebecers in 
general have to condemn this situation. 
I also find unfortunate the fact that the Quebec members in the 
government, the Prime Minister, who comes from Quebec, the 
Minister of National Revenue, who hails from Charlevoix, the 
Minister of Finance and the Secretary of State for Amateur 
Sport, who is also from Quebec, said during the election 
campaign “Vote for us. We are in power. We listen carefully.  We 
can speak in Cabinet”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are they not telling the Minister of Justice, who does not 
live in Quebec, who does not know or understand it, that 
everyone opposes this bill, which is skewing the whole legal 
system for young offenders in Quebec?  Why are they not taking 
the minister to task?  It means nothing to be in office today. 
What counts is the party line. 
The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and the Minister for 
International Trade come from Quebec as well.  There is a fairly 
sizeable group from Quebec, who should have some influence on 
the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here again, the focus of the minister is to meet the demands 
made at the time by the Canadian Alliance and say “We are 
looking after that, we in the Liberal Party.  We are getting 
organized”.  Unfortunately, the Liberal members from Quebec are 
totally out of this debate.  None of them is rising.  They smile 
at us, almost arrogantly.  What is the member for Québec East 
waiting for? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think I see Jean-Paul Marchand rising here today and 
criticizing the situation.  I see Hélène Alarie, the member for 
Louis-Hébert at the time, rising and doing the same thing. 
I can also see the former member for Frontenac—Mégantic, Jean-Guy 
Chrétien.  He would have torn his hair out here in the House in 
his unbridled criticism of the situation and in his whole-hearted 
defence of the interests of the young people in his riding.  I 
think I can see the former member of Frontenac—Mégantic 
expressing his disagreement to the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the Liberal side, however, a number of members have probably 
left for supper, and the others still here are totally out of 
this debate.  And yet, they were elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I close in the hope, once again, that the minister will accept 
the amendments to Bill C-7 proposed by the Bloc Quebecois.  I 
would like to congratulate the member for Berthier—Montcalm for 
his excellent work in this. 
<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my voice is 
not in the best of shape for me to speak today, but I really 
wanted to make a speech on the young offenders legislation. This 
is a very important piece of legislation for Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find unfortunate the position of the government where it 
refuses to recognize the realities of Quebec. With this bill, we 
are seeing the same lack of flexibility of federalism when it 
comes to recognizing Quebec's realities and approaches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is insult that is made today to Quebec's National Assembly, 
which voted unanimously against this bill that make the Young 
Offenders Act tougher. We know that for our young offenders who 
have committed a severe crime, a crime that is unacceptable in 
our society, but who need a particular approach or reinforcement, 
the bill will run counter to everything that was put in place in 
Quebec to help them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not alone in this fight. In Quebec, many stakeholders 
have in fact supported our colleague, the Member for 
Berthier—Montcalm, in the battle that he has been waging for 
many years against the justice minister's bill. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1655"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister insists on enforcing an act that goes against what 
is being done in Quebec. Each problem is different, and this is 
exactly the approach taken by Quebec. Each problem is different, 
and each one has a different solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new act that the minister wants to adopt, which is focusing 
mainly on the seriousness of the offence, underestimates the 
needs of young people. It does not deal with the young person, 
with the one who needs a special approach or individualized 
treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec approach is successful and it has been said that, at 
23%, the Quebec criminality rate it is the lowest in Canada. What 
Bill C-7 will do is to change the face of juvenile justice. It 
will change gradually. We all know that the attorney will be the 
one who will do justice. Whether he will enforce the minister's 
bill or adopt Quebec's approach remains to be seen however. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can only be against this bill. The government claims that 
there will be flexibility and that the provinces will have some. 
But this is nothing else than smoke and mirrors. It will be up to 
the attorney. There is nothing in the bill confirming that Quebec 
may carry on as it would like to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We thought that the amendments put forward by my colleague from 
Berthier—Montcalm would persuade the Minister of Justice. But 
no, quite the contrary. I do not think she will be persuaded. She 
is digging her heels. From her answers, it is obvious that she is 
stubbornly refusing to understand what is being done in Quebec. 
But we will not give up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, there is a tour of Quebec going on at present. 
Through it, Quebec public opinion will be heard louder and 
louder.  The public is becoming more and more aware of what is 
going on here in the federal parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to make particular mention of the generous 
contribution of Marc Beaupré, a young actor who wanted to add his 
voice to the campaign.  He plays a troubled youth, Kevin, in the 
televised serial <I>Les deux frères</I>.  In order to see what it was 
like for a youth in jail, he spent time there himself.  He was 
able to see for himself how much it was a school for crime. In 
just a few days, he was able to learn some of the tactics taught 
in the schools for crime that are our prisons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not bury our heads in the sand on this. We know very 
well that, when a person is treated like a criminal, 
rehabilitation becomes harder.  We know very well that there are 
no more true life sentences, that the person will be coming back 
out into society.  We must do everything possible to reclaim our 
youth, to give them every possible encouragement, while at the 
same time making them accept the seriousness of what they have 
done. 
This is the approach used in Quebec at the present time.  The 
young offender is made aware, made to understand right from the 
start the serious nature of what he or she has done, and 
immediate assistance must be provided as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the minister's law in place, we will no longer be able to 
take that approach, to intervene as appropriately, as promptly, 
as necessarily as is often required, with the young person who 
has committed an offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very disappointed, because we have the support of many 
people.  I can tell the House that the list of those who support 
us is impressive.  André Normandeau, a criminologist from the 
University of Montreal, supports the Bloc Quebecois' approach, as 
does Cécile Toutant, a criminologist and a member of the Quebec 
Bar Association's subcommittee on young offenders, Jean 
Trépanier, a criminologist, and André Payette, a spokesperson for 
the Association des centres jeunesse du Québec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could read out pages and pages of names of people who support 
us, but I will stop here, because it is truly discouraging to see 
how stubbornly the government is pushing this bill through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope that our offensive today will show that we are not going 
to give up and that we will keep on hoping right up until the 
last minute that the minister will finally recognize what is 
being done in Quebec.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is often easier to amend legislation than to change our 
approach to a problem. It may be tempting to think that tougher 
legislation is the answer to the problems of delinquency. 
Simplistic responses blind us to the full extent of complex 
problems and create the false impression that we are doing what 
is necessary to resolve them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One such simplistic response is 
substituting get-tough measures for educational approaches. Doing 
so, however, loses sight of the fact that adolescents are still 
developing, and lays all of the blame for their delinquency on

to do with it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that we all feel concerned.  When a young person commits 
such a serious offence, I think that all of society should feel 
responsible.  Our legislation and approaches must be realistic. 
They must be rooted in reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to support the initiative of the hon. member for 
Berthier—Montcalm.  I find it sad that members of this 
parliament are not rising to speak today.  Where are the Liberal 
members from Quebec?  The Liberals from Quebec said they were 
going to have one voice in parliament.  When they were 
campaigning, they were very interested in mergers. 
We are not dealing with mergers here; we are dealing with the new 
Young Offenders Act, which is going against the Quebec approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like my colleague for Charlevoix was saying, where are the 
Liberal members from Quebec? Where is the member for 
Louis-Hébert? Where is the member for Québec East? Where is the 
member for Portneuf? All of them are members of the Liberal Party 
that got elected in the last elections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We, in the Bloc Quebecois, are here to speak for the interests 
of Quebec. We will never let go because we are not afraid to talk 
loud and clear about the consensus existing in Quebec. This bill 
will be one more example of the federal government's 
inflexibility concerning Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the youth centre support the legislation already in place in 
Quebec; they are against the minister's bill because its approach 
is not good for young offenders and their rehabilitation. We will 
never say it enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, I might not have had the voice to make a speech, but I 
was trying to express my concern over what is proposed in this 
bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Serge Cardin (Sherbrooke, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, to follow up 
on my colleague from Quebec, despite her voice that gave her some 
difficulty, are we to assume that all Liberal members from Quebec 
also have a sore throat? She has the courage to speak out on 
behalf of all Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with great interest that I speak to this bill. In 
September 1998, when I was elected as the member for Sherbrooke, 
I proudly committed to representing the interests of residents of 
my riding, my region and Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been constantly in contact with youth centres, with the 
Coalition des travailleurs de rues, with different youth workers. 
I know quite well several people who work with young people in my 
region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look at young people, I remember that, one day, there was 
born a child, an exceptional child, a sovereign being to whom 
people wished only good things, the best things in the world, 
both for the mind and the body, and also intelligence. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1705"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT38"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT38"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1705

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, even when an exceptional and sovereign child is born, 
it is not certain that child will be able to live comfortably in 
society. Numerous actions and contacts throughout his childhood 
and his adolescence will mould him, develop him and shape his 
behaviour. Likewise if, unfortunately, this young person ever 
commits some wrongdoing, it is difficult for us to determine why 
it happened. 
We know that each person is different, and can commit certain 
offences, but the first thing that we must do is to help that 
person because, as I said earlier, this individual is not allowed 
to function like this in a society that has laws, regulations and 
even biases. We must of course identify the causes of that 
person's reprehensible behaviour and deal with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the bill, at how it is drafted and at what it 
proposes, we realize that the government's priority is to 
establish a list, label crimes and define the price to pay by the 
young offender, instead of developing a set of personalized 
measures for each young person who commits an offence. We know 
that it is possible to take action at that level, so that these 
young people will later be able to contribute in a very positive 
way in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of using a personalized set of measures for young 
people, the bill tries to define the seriousness of the offences 
and, for all intents and purposes, make the individual pay on 
that basis. Let me go back to young people's power to make 
decisions. Through its acts, the government is telling us that a 
person under 18 years of age is not allowed to vote or to decide 
for himself if he can smoke. That young person does not have that 
power. A young person under 18 is not allowed to drink beer 
moderately. He is not allowed to make such a decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, the government wants to make that same person 
responsible for actions which, as I said earlier, may be due to 
any number of circumstances in which a young person lives in our 
society. It is difficult to identify the real problem, but we 
must take every measure possible to make that young person able 
to function. If he has made a mistake or done something 
deplorable, we must help him. 
The first principle is early intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, there are many stakeholders today who gained a solid 
experience in intervention and supervision, helping young persons 
learn how to function in our society. Should we always proceed 
punitively? I am very sceptical about that. Why did we say that, 
on the one hand, the bill against organized crime does not go far 
enough while, on the other hand, the bill respecting young 
persons goes a little too far? Are we to understand that the 
government maintains automatically, as the saying goes “He who 
steals a penny will steal a pound”? I do not agree, but this is 
what the government says automatically.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since September 14, 1998, I have direct contact with people 
involved in criminal justice in my riding. Only yesterday, as 
part of the tour being carried out by my colleague from 
Berthier—Montcalm, we met with quite a large group of 
stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This group included many young persons who are familiar with 
this situation, young persons who saw some of their friends faced 
with situations that were sometimes painful, to say the least. 
These people witnessed how Quebec stakeholders rehabilitated some 
young persons who, if Bill C-7 had been in effect at the time, 
would have been lost. One day, these young persons would have 
ended up being dealt with under the organized crime legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious that the members of the Bloc Quebecois are acting 
in good faith, are being caring and are acting out of love for 
the young people.  We ask the Quebec members of the Liberal party 
to also act in good faith and to honestly say that, in Quebec at 
this time, the Young Offenders Act adequately meets the needs of 
the young people.  Thanks to this legislation, they can have 
access to workers who give them guidance.  However, such an 
approach is expensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of investing $200 million or $250 million for the 
enforcement of this legislation, the federal government, which 
often speaks about its great generosity, should transfer a pro 
rata share of this money to Quebec, so that we can continue to 
enforce the legislation we now have in Quebec, where it is 
undeniably yielding good results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If all Quebec members honestly and sincerely declare that they 
want to protect the young people of Quebec, I think that all the 
Liberal members will vote against this bill, alongside Bloc 
Quebecois members, to make sure that our youth can has a chance 
at happiness. 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, like the member for Quebec, I believe it is my duty to 
rise today to speak against the bill. It will be extremely 
detrimental. It will fly in the face of the approach developed by 
hundreds if not thousands of people who have been working for 
years with Quebec youth; this approach has a proven track record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is based on rehabilitation and the needs of young people. It 
is individualized and specific. It does not include automatic 
haphazard punitive measures without any regard for the context 
and the situation of the young offender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before daring to hand out harsher sentences, and considering 
sentencing young people at an ever younger age to adult 
sentences, the government should first prove to us that the 
approach put forward by Quebec is no good. It is in fact quite 
the contrary; it has yielded very good results, as a matter of 
fact the best in Canada, as mentioned on many occasions by the 
member for Berthier—Montcalm. He has done an outstanding job of 
reaching people working in the field in Quebec and consulting 
them. Of course he first studied the act very carefully. And then 
he consulted workers in the field, which he has been doing for a 
long time.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is seeking to respond to a need or request voiced 
in one area of our country, more specifically western Canada—where 
there is a right wing movement, we must say—and try to 
apply this approach coast to coast, including in Quebec, when we 
have the lowest youth crime rate. As a matter of fact, statistics 
show that youth crime rates have been dropping throughout Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite incredible to see that, when the situation is 
improving and not deteriorating, the government has decided to 
pass a bill that is even harsher and that holds our young 
offenders responsible for their acts by punishing them. This is 
quite inconceivable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993, with other members of the Bloc, we sometimes visit 
various provinces in Canada. I will always remember that, in the 
fall of 1994, with my colleagues from 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques and 
Mercier, I was part of a tour that dealt with social programs, 
and we found out that, depending on the province, there was a 
different culture and a different mentality, but also different 
social problems, different ways of treating problems. The rest of 
Canada tends to depend more on the central government than 
Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebecers, however, federalists as well as sovereigntists, have 
always had more confidence in their own government, in the 
government that is the closest to their problems, especially 
social problems, such as those we are talking about today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To talk about young offenders is to talk about teenagers. To 
talk about teenagers is to talk about the future. When we send 
these teenagers to prison, thinking that we will rehabilitate 
them by doing so, we are in fact putting them in a school for 
crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently, I heard a speech by Marc Beaupré, who went on a 
consultation and awareness raising tour with the hon. member for 
Berthier—Montcalm. He told us that he himself stayed two days in 
prison—not to serve a sentence of course—but as a learning 
experience. In those two days, he was taught many things. We can 
only imagine what he would have learned had he stayed longer. 
He gave that as an example. He learned a few of the tricks taught 
in the school for crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a few minutes, I will name the members of the Coalition pour 
la justice des mineurs, just to show how strong the Quebec 
consensus is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I would first like to point out that, as second reading 
of the bill, I have made a speech, as had certain members from 
Quebec, including the member for Beauce, who had said that they 
had consulted youth organizations and that what they heard was 
different from what the member for Berthier—Montcalm was saying. 
I wanted to check because he and I live in the same region. I 
called those who had attended the meeting to know their opinions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They all told me that their opinions had not changed. They said 
that, on the contrary, they told the member in question that he 
was mistaken, that he was headed in the wrong direction, but he 
kept saying that the government had consulted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe they did not give him a hard time, because people who work 
with teenagers do not usually favour the aggressive approach for 
obvious reasons, but they did make him understand that he was 
headed in the wrong direction. 
Despite that, members from Quebec do not talk much in the House, 
and when they do, it is to say that it is not that serious.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now give a list of members of the Coalition pour la 
justice des mineurs because it is worth mentioning. They are: 
Commission des services juridiques, Conseil permanent de la 
jeunesse, Centrale de l'enseignement du Québec, Jean Trépanier of 
the University of Montreal School of Criminology, Fondation 
québécoise pour les jeunes contrevenants, Institut Philippe 
Pinel, Association des directeurs de police et pompiers du 
Québec, Conférence des régies régionales de la santé et des 
services sociaux, Association des centres jeunesse du Québec, 
Crown Prosecutors' Office, which comes under the Quebec Minister 
of Justice, Association des CLSC et des CHSLD du Québec, Marc 
Leblanc of the University of Montreal School of Psyco-Education, 
Regroupement de justice alternative du Québec, Child Welfare 
League of Canada, Canadian Criminal Justice Association, 
Association des avocats de la défense du Québec, Société 
criminologie du Québec. And there are a few more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a lot of people. I am not sure how many, but these 
groups must represent hundreds and thousands of people who work 
with young people daily. They are part of a coalition that came 
here to condemn this bill, but the government is still turning a 
deaf ear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with those who suggest that, if the rest of Canada—and 
by that I mean all the provinces except Quebec, because we are 
still part of the Canadian federal system—wants this bill, let 
the government add a clause granting Quebec the right to opt out, 
if we have a flexible federal system, with the support of a 
consensus in Quebec that includes members of the National 
Assembly, all Quebecers, all the stakeholders I just enumerated, 
the young people and their parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would make a lot of sense. There are precedents for this in 
many areas, like the civil code, on questions that are under 
Quebec's jurisdiction, contrary to what exists in other 
provinces. Education is a provincial jurisdiction. Why stubbornly 
try to have a uniform Canada, and why treat everybody the same 
way when it is obvious for everybody that there are differences 
out there, that there are two nations in this country? Let us 
show some respect for the Quebec people by letting them determine 
how they are going to educate their children. 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak to the bill in 
respect of criminal justice for young persons, at report stage. 
As a matter of fact, this legislation is better known as the 
Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That legislation has caused much ink to flow over the last 
several years. It carried various numbers and each time the 
federal government came up against a solid and strong consensus 
by Quebec stakeholders. Those stakeholders say that this punitive 
approach which tends to be very severe toward young people and to 
punish them by sending them to jail instead of keeping and 
developing an approach of co-operation and rehabilitation, is 
unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government says it has to change the model. Yet statistics 
show that the existing model is working well, that the youth 
crime rate in Quebec is lower, that rehabilitation is having good 
results and that recidivism is very low. However, over the last 
few years, because of the rightist wind blowing from the west and 
carrying the justice minister who comes from that part of the 
country and represents a western riding, the federal government 
steamroller has been obstinately persisting on imposing this 
model. That is very sad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After all, the major strength that helped the hon. member for 
Berthier—Montcalm in carrying the issue so efficiently is that 
there is nothing better in democracy than knowing that one's 
cause is directly connected to what people wish and want. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1725"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we have seen in the past and are seeing now, it is not a 
political party that is opposed to this bill, it is a society. 
There is in Quebec a society that has developed a model and that 
wishes to maintain this model. Indeed, we have something that is 
successful and that is working better than elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Societies must be open to other environments. When a good idea 
is being developed in the rest of Canada, in the United States or 
in Europe, we can take it and use it in our models. But when we 
have something that is working very well in Quebec, we would like 
to use it. We do not want the federal government to barge in 
order to change the situation and bring us back to a situation 
that Quebecers do not want. We are seeing this today, we have 
seen this with the list of people who have supported the 
legislation and the organizations as well as individuals that are 
supporting it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The testimonies we are receiving are from young people who have 
been through the system. Instead to going to jail, they had the 
chance of going in close treatment, in environments where they 
are forced to reflect on their situation. We force them to ask 
themselves what led to such behaviour. We help them with 
psychologists, with social workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not necessarily easier. I think this is the tough 
solution, the hard road to go, but this is giving them a chance 
to turn their act around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other way is easier. In jail, they learn all kinds of 
things, things they do not need to know for the rest of their 
lives and things that lead to unacceptable behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The human aspect is the most important. I have three children; 
one 17 year old, another 15 year old and a 10 year old who will 
soon be 11. I would not like to see my children find themselves 
stuck in the criminal system for the rest of their life because 
they had made a mistake. If a young person makes a mistake, I 
hope he gets an opportunity to correct his behaviour, understand 
his mistake and what it entails. There is an important 
educational aspect to the issue. It is refreshing to see that 
people have understood that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We often read in the newspapers about the plight of some people. 
A crime is committed by a teenager and for five days, the media 
repeat that he has been identified, arrested and then he is 
brought to trial and goes through all the subsequent stages. 
People have understood that these are the exception, not the 
rule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rule is that we succeed in rehabilitating our young 
offenders and making them responsible citizens, people who, in 
the end, have learned to behave. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The attitude of the federal government should have been more 
focused on investing money in the system and make a maximum 
effort. The rest of Canada does not want that system so let us 
try to find a way to answer their needs. If we want Quebec's 
system to continue to operate and show good results, we have to 
invest money in the system and allow Quebec to make the best 
possible use of available resources for the benefit of teenagers, 
in order to continue to reduce the crime rate and to get the best 
possible rehabilitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government does not have this attitude, which is 
surprising. 
I will mention a few members, such as the members from Québec 
East, Portneuf, Bellechasse—Etchemins—Montmagny—L'Islet, and 
Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok; the last two 
members represent ridings next to mine. What message did these 
members receive from their constituents for them to say so 
little? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it is time to vote, I wonder if they will have the courage 
to say “Our system in Quebec works well. We will never accept 
this Canadian model, which does not suit us, which will thwart 
the efforts that have been made for several years”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In legislation, principles come into play, but ultimately some 
resources are also involved. 
We will end up in a situation where more and more money will be 
needed for penitentiaries, to deal with the repressive aspect of 
this legislation, while all that money would have been needed for 
prevention. There is not a word about that in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where are Quebec's federal Liberals in this debate? Why are they 
keeping so quiet? Is this not an issue on which they will have to 
vote? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know I will have a few minutes left that I will be able to use 
when we resume debate on this bill, but I urge all members in the 
House to listen carefully to the message that all Quebecers are 
sending them.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>BLOOD SAMPLES ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK218">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from March 20 consideration of the motion that 
Bill C-217, an act to provide for the taking of samples of blood 
for the benefit of persons administering and enforcing the law 
and good Samaritans and to amend the Criminal Code, be read the 
third time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to speak to Bill C-217, under Private Members' Business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I am not mistaken, this bill, the blood samples act, was 
introduced in the House by a Canadian Alliance member on February 
5, 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It arises out of an event that occurred in October 1997, when a 
police officer, Isobel Anderson, arrested a man for armed 
robbery. It is useful to explain why the Canadian Alliance member 
introduced this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While searching for weapons, she reached into his pocket and 
felt a sharp pain. She pulled her hand out to find a bloody 
needle stuck in her palm. As she feared, doctors told her that 
the needle may have infected her with HIV, which leads to AIDS. 
Then she learned that the robbery suspect had refused to take the 
HIV test and could not be compelled by law to give a blood 
sample. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After some negotiations, the suspect agreed to a blood test, and 
the results came back negative for HIV but positive for hepatitis 
C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a precautionary measure, Ms. Anderson agreed to AZT 
treatment, which understandably changed her life for several 
months. Six months later it was confirmed that she had contracted 
neither HIV nor hepatitis C. Today this policewoman is in good 
health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the creation of the Reform Party, a group called Front 
Line and Good Samaritans Rights to Know has been encouraging 
police officers and other emergency workers to make their voices 
heard and support the efforts of the party, now the Canadian 
Alliance, in favour of a bill to protect the interests of people 
working for others in a service capacity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our position on this bill is the following: the bill is 
essentially aimed at forcing people suspected of being HIV or 
hepatitis B or C positive, and who could have infected a peace 
officer, a security guard or a person acting under section 494 of 
the criminal code, to give a blood sample. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is pitting one fundamental right against another, 
namely the right to health and safety and the right to privacy 
and the sanctity of the human body. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that in its present form, the bill might infringe 
upon the rights of people with HIV or hepatitis B or C by 
ostracizing them. Moreover, such a bill might lead to abuses 
against those suspected of carrying one of those diseases. Far 
from reflecting the values dear to Quebecers, this bill would 
contravene the fundamental human rights legislation passed by the 
Quebec government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, it seems obvious to us that this bill would go against 
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and change the 
Criminal Code in a worrisome way.  It would allow for the taking 
of blood samples even when no misdemeanour or offence of any kind 
has been committed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill does not respect the fundamental values of Quebecers, 
and the government has passed several laws to entrench human 
rights and freedoms. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1805"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It might bear repeating that these values are entrenched in the 
Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms, at articles 1—dealing 
with right to life, freedom, security and integrity of 
person—to 5, which deals with the right to privacy protection. 
In the Civil Code of Quebec, article 10 states that “Every person 
is inviolable and is entitled to the integrity of his person”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this bill were to be passed, several Quebec acts and codes 
would be affected by Bill C-217 and would require consequential 
amendments.  That would be the case, for example, for the 
Professional Code and the Act respecting health services and 
social services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When creating the Quebec Charter of Rights and Freedoms in 
1974—under the Quebec Liberal Party at the time—the legislator 
established as a fundamental right that “Every person has a right 
to respect for his privacy”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is in the Civil Code of Quebec, in force since January 1, 
1994, a whole chapter on the issue of respect for one's 
reputation and one's privacy. The new code, after recalling the 
principle stated in the Charter, provides that only the law or 
the consent of a person or of his heirs can justify an intrusion 
in his or her private life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, Bill C-217 does not respect the concept of the human 
body's inviolability provided for in section 10 of Quebec's Civil 
Code, that says that, except for certain exceptional situations, 
no one is to be subjected to medical treatment without his or her 
well-informed and freely given consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to some experts, the definition of medical care is 
broad enough to include the taking of samples, tests and even DNA 
analysis. A practice that affects someone's integrity violates 
all the more his right to privacy. And respect for one's privacy 
implies that every person can exercise control over personal 
information concerning him and decide whether to make them public 
or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting finally to note that the doctors' code of 
ethics includes under the principle of the confidentiality of 
medical information two exceptions that would apply to genetic 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first exception provides that the doctor can divulge facts 
that he was personally made aware of when a patient or the law 
authorizes him to do so, when there is a pressing and justified 
reason to do so for the patient's health or that of the people 
around him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second exception provides that, unless there is just cause, 
the physician may not reveal to people who are close to the 
patient a serious or fatal prognosis if the patient forbids it. 
However, in this last instance, experts say that nothing 
indicates what would constitute just cause to justify such 
violation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, these exceptions could not apply to the subject 
matter of Bill C-217. The bill could be viewed as going against 
sections 7 and 8 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
and the jurisprudence from the Supreme Court of Canada. In <I>R. v 
Dyment</I>, Justice La Forest noted that “the use of a person's body 
without his consent to obtain information about him invades an 
area of privacy essential to the maintenance of his human 
dignity”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we are not convinced that taking a blood sample from 
the person suspected of having transmitted bodily fluid to 
another person will enable to determine in every case whether 
the person carries the HIV virus or the hepatitis B or C virus. 
Indeed, because of the incubation period, it is very difficult 
to determine with certainty whether an individual is a carrier 
of these diseases. Had the tests done on the suspect apprehended 
by Ms. Anderson been negative, nothing could have indicated that 
the individual himself was not in the incubation period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons, we must oppose Bill C-217, which, in 
essence, is an interesting bill. 
When a peace officer, firefighter, or any other person needs to 
interact with another in the performance of his or her duties 
and is left with doubts as to whether he or she may have been 
infected with HIV or hepatitis, this is unbearable, everyone 
will agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, when a situation needs to be corrected, the way to do 
it is not with an incomplete, unconstitutional bill, because the 
very first inmate required to be tested would take it to the 
Supreme Court of Canada and would—as I have attempted to prove—win 
his case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So we need to find a way to provide these personnel with some 
peace of mind.  We in the Bloc Quebecois do not believe that 
Bill C-217 is the way to go.  We do not feel it is going to 
provide any piece of mind to those working with the public, who 
are unfortunately infected by misadventure, by accident, or 
deliberately by inmates in detention.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We often hear stories of prison guards being bitten by inmates. 
They are then subjected to a truly unbearable sense of 
insecurity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill, which is intended to remedy this untenable situation, 
would not do so. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we have here one of those common sense type bills.  It 
is one of those bills that looks into what is good in society and 
what would protect the health and the good nature of people.  The 
bill would address good Samaritan activities.  It would address 
the protection of good Samaritans, health workers and emergency 
workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think all members of the House have at one time or another 
been in contact with an emergency worker.  We have extended a 
helping hand to someone in an accident, whether on the highway or 
somewhere else, or have wanted to extend a helping hand but were 
not sure of the conditions of the situation.  Emergency workers 
such as firefighters, police officers and security personnel are 
often subjected to cases where they do not know all the risks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member brought forward the bill with the noblest of 
intentions.  His intentions are not only noble but practical. The 
member wants to give as much protection as possible to people who 
are subjected to risks of which they are perhaps unaware. However 
there seems to be a feeling that any individual who suspects 
something can demand a blood test. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a safeguard in the bill.  The safeguard is a judge. 
Judges are people who have demonstrated and exercised good 
judgment in the past.  That is why they are judges.  They help us 
interpret the law.  They make sure the law is applied, as far as 
humanly possible, in a fair and equitable way.  That is what we 
are after. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When individuals are put into questionable situations they may 
be subject to risk.  The bill looks at three kinds of risks: 
hepatitis C, hepatitis B and HIV.  The bill focuses on these 
three risks and no others.  The presence of these diseases can be 
detected by a blood test.  Is the test foolproof?  Of course it 
is not.  No test in the world is absolutely foolproof.  However 
it is good enough to ask a judge that it be administered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do people suggest it would be an intrusion into privacy? 
The greatest intrusion into people's privacy is to shorten their 
lives by infecting them with a disease.  Drawing a couple of 
drops of blood and subjecting someone to a test is no great 
infringement on anything.  It would be done through the auspices 
of a judge and through careful analysis of the situation.  I do 
not know of anything more common sense and humane than that.  We 
should all be supporting the bill with everything we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we not support the bill?  We need only look at the 
absolute volume of organizations that support it.  All kinds of 
organizations support the bill.  I am talking about police 
departments and associations, and 18 such organizations support 
the bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not one group of policemen in some city somewhere. These 
are national and provincial police associations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go another step.  We have security guard unions and 
associations.  I have eight groups here.  Who are some of these 
groups?  The Union of Solicitor General Employees is a pretty 
sophisticated group.  We have the Correctional Officers' 
Association of Ontario.  We have the National Office of the 
Commissionaires and the North Saskatchewan, Manitoba, 
Northwestern Ontario and Nova Scotia divisions of the 
Commissionaires.  Not only do we have groups on a national level, 
we have them on the provincial level.  People in these groups are 
all emergency workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We go beyond those groups to include hospitals, health boards 
and nursing associations.  Some 26 different groups support the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should pay special attention to health workers.  Can anyone 
imagine a situation that is more significant to the welfare of 
our society than to have a sound and healthy group of health 
practitioners?  Do we want to subject them to unusual and 
unnecessary risk?  We should do everything we possibly can to 
protect their safety and to assure them that everything is being 
done to ensure they are not infected due to the risks that are 
inherent in the profession they are pursuing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not only health workers.  I have two other groups here, 
the paramedic associations and the ambulance services.  My heart 
goes out to these people in a very particular way.  They are the 
frontline people when an accident happens and no one knows for 
sure what will happen in a situation like that.  These are very 
experienced people who can usually recognize when there may be an 
unusual risk of exposure in a particular accident or in a 
particular development.  They often know when they have been 
pricked by a needle, cut by a knife, or have cut themselves on a 
zipper or on a piece of metal from a vehicle.  If they see blood 
on their hands they do not know if they have been exposed to an 
infectious disease.  Should we not give them every opportunity to 
have as much protection as possible?  Surely that is not 
unreasonable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot for a minute believe that anybody would oppose the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have just talked about the paramedic associations and 
ambulance services, but we are still not finished.  We also have 
the fire departments.  The same set of arguments can be used here 
when people are going into a building that is on fire.  These 
firemen, who enter buildings filled with fire, smoke and heat, 
could also suffer a cut to their face or hands no matter how much 
protective clothing they wear.  It will happen.  Should these 
people not have maximum protection?  I believe they should. I 
believe judges are very sympathetic to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Someone mentioned to me that there may be abuses with a test 
like this.  What kind of an abuse could there be if members have 
to appeal to the highest law enforcement office in the land for 
an interpretation?  Are we really suggesting that judges would 
abuse this kind of a provision to hurt someone else?  Would they 
really to do something like that?  I cannot for a second believe 
that this would be a legitimate concern.   I cannot imagine what 
kind of a reason that might be, but it would have to be an excuse 
that is manufactured, not one that is resting on common sense or 
past experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not finished.  I have many other groups, such as the 
Victims Resource Centre in the city of Nicolet, Quebec, the 
Retail Loss Prevention Association of British Columbia, and 
another group from Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member from the Bloc mentioned some instances where 
this might be an intrusion into somebody's privacy.  We have 
dealt with that to at least a small degree.  I think even that 
member, when he thinks through what he said, did not actually 
mean everything he said.  I think what he really wanted to say is 
that we should maintain the privacy of individuals, but we also 
wanted to protect their safety and ensure that is the case.

anyone else.  I hope we can encourage everyone to vote in favour 
of the bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure and an honour for me to rise in support of Bill C-217. I 
take this opportunity to praise the hon. member for Fraser Valley 
for his tireless work on this file and, more important, for 
bringing forward a matter of great concern to true Canadian 
heroes.  If the hon. member for Fraser Valley would like to come 
over here and sit beside me, I would not have a problem with that 
at all.  He has done a wonderful job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-217 respecting the blood samples act offers a measure of 
protection, security and peace of mind to those brave Canadians 
from every part of the country who put their lives in harm's way 
to defend and assist those in need.  There can be no more noble 
legislation than that which protects those who protect us.  There 
is a policeman in the gallery tonight who works in the community 
to protect us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been said that Bill C-217 would benefit Samaritans.  I am 
reminded of the parable of the good Samaritan as recounted to us 
in the readings of Luke 10:30-37.  It is a story of a traveller 
who was beaten and robbed by a pack of thieves.  Left by the side 
of the street, hurt and bloodied, this innocent victim was in 
dire need of help.  Others came down that same road but passed 
the traveller and would not reach out a helping hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then came a Samaritan who was himself on a journey and who bore 
witness to this victim of crime in desperate need of help.  The 
Samaritan did not know the traveller and did not know what had 
happened. The Samaritan did know, however, that he should treat 
his neighbours as he would want to be treated himself.  The 
Samaritan stopped and helped the severely beaten traveller, not 
knowing even so much as his name. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are fortunate that many brave Canadians have taken this 
parable to heart.  I cannot imagine our not taking the steps in 
this place, no matter how great or small, to ensure that those 
who selflessly put themselves in the path of danger are afforded 
some measure of protection.  Whether our modern day Samaritans 
are heroes by virtue of career or circumstance, they must always 
be mindful of the fact that helping others must often involve 
taking risks.  The very challenges they overcome to help those in 
need often make their acts much more heroic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know all too well that the modern world has its share of 
danger.  It is hidden from the naked eye but can strike us down 
as painfully and as deliberately as any danger that is plainly 
visible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not difficult to imagine that a policeman, a firefighter, 
a nurse or an ambulance attendant could come into contact with 
the bodily fluids of someone who has been injured.  We could even 
go as far as to suggest it is expected that they would. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that because my mother and father, on their 50th wedding 
anniversary, were in a car accident caused by two young people 
who were drinking.  Their car rolled over and my mother was 
pinned.  Firefighters and policemen had to cut her loose to get 
her out of the car.  She never walked again.  Those who looked 
after my mother and father did have my parent's blood on their 
hands.  They saved their lives that night and I thank them from 
the bottom of my heart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many people in the constituency of Saint John, New 
Brunswick, which I represent, who put their lives in harm's way. 
I thank them also from the bottom of my heart tonight.  In 
today's society, when policemen are called out and have to go 
into a home, they put their lives on the line as they never know 
whether the person in there will attack them with a gun or a 
knife.

</I></B></P><P align=left>These bodily fluids can cause the spread of infectious diseases 
that would in some cases be life threatening.  For heroes who 
might well have come in contact with infected bodily fluids, the 
possibility exists that they might well live out their days under 
the looming spectre of a debilitating disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we consider the potential consequences of these selfless 
acts and the risk to those who undertake them without hesitation, 
we would agree that the onus falls clearly on us in the House to 
ensure that every possible preventative measure is in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House is well aware that I am neither a lawyer nor a 
physician.  I am just an honorary doctor.  However it seems to be 
a matter of pure common sense that we would seek to take a blood 
sample for the single purpose of protecting the lives of those 
who protect us.  We all know that by taking a blood sample 
medical professionals can conclude whether there is a risk of 
contamination and can decide whether or not to give the powerful 
drugs available to them that might well fend off an infection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When my colleague from Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough spoke to 
this legislation he cited an example of a Calgary police officer 
who was bitten by an AIDS infected suspect in the course of his 
daily work.  The officer, a loving husband, had to endure a 
barrage of tests and trials to guarantee that he was not infected 
with AIDS that day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly there are questions here that go to the heart of 
individual rights.  If it were my cousin, Gordon Fairweather, 
standing here instead of myself, I am sure he would speak to 
those issues and those concerns more eloquently than I.  Suffice 
to say, however, that our Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
clearly protects each individual Canadian and I see no corruption 
of those rights by voting in favour of Bill C-217. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot imagine a world where a police officer, a fireman, 
ambulance drivers or the people in the ambulance must face the 
daily possibilities of being infected with AIDS. I cannot imagine 
a world where an ambulance attendant would have to hesitate 
before giving medical attention to a victim for fear that he or 
she might contract a disease.  The rights of the person who has 
blood taken are already protected to a large extent.  Police 
officers must obtain warrants and go before a justice before a 
blood sample can be taken.  In most instances there are 
exceptions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-217 has been carefully drafted so as not to go too far 
afield in breaching a persons human rights.  Current sections of 
the criminal code would also apply to compel those who would use 
the particular section not to go outside a person's human rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are current sections that apply to impaired driving, 
sexual assault and the new DNA databank that would come under 
similar scrutiny in the judicial chambers.  It is an important 
step toward protection and enhancement of safety for everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I again commend the hon. member for Fraser Valley for this 
initiative.  It is a tremendous common sense initiative and one 
that my party, the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, 
wholeheartedly endorses.  I encourage all members to do likewise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot imagine a world where our police officers, our 
firefighters and our ambulance attendants would have to hesitate 
before giving medical attention to a victim for fear that they 
might contract a disease.  They never hesitate.  They do their 
job immediately.  We owe them a lot.  Bill C-217 is one thing 
that we do owe to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that we must take this step.  This is the responsible 
thing to do.  It is the right thing to do.  Each and every one in 
the PC Party is in favour of the bill.

As we are talking about blood sampling, the other day I had the

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of coming up with one of my eloquent speeches, I thought 
I would just repeat a speech from my former colleague, Mr. Peter 
Mancini from Cape Breton, who spoke on the bill so eloquently.  I 
thought it would be proper just to repeat what he said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we welcome the member for Fraser Valley for bringing 
forward this piece of legislation, Bill C-217, which is well 
intentioned.  We commend him for it.  It raises some important 
questions about people who partake in the kind of activity 
envisioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When listening to his remarks we became a little concerned, and 
the government member raised some of those concerns as well. 
There is a difference between people who engage in criminal 
activity and people who in the execution of their professional 
duties, such as firefighters or peacekeepers, have suffered or 
have cause to be concerned about whether they have been infected 
with various forms of hepatitis or HIV. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A great deal of his time was spent referring to the perpetrators 
of the crime.  He was right.  When someone has committed an 
offence, should our police forces or security guards not have a 
right to find out if they have been infected with some kind of 
disease when in the execution of their duty, which is the 
protection of our society, they encounter some activity that has 
caused them some concern? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is wider and goes further than that.  It does not 
narrow those affected to those involved in fighting crime and to 
the perpetrators of crime.  The legislation says that a person, 
not a crime fighter or a police officer, may apply to a justice 
for a warrant authorizing the taking of a sample of blood from 
another person who is not necessarily the perpetrator of a crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are numerous examples.  We can envisage how wide ranging 
the legislation would be.  For example, it would apply to 
firefighters who in the execution of their duties such as saving 
an individual from a burning building, came into contact with 
bodily fluid blood or whatever and may have cause to wonder if 
they have been infected in the line of their duty with some 
disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same would apply to health care workers and paramedics.  The 
bill is quite broad.  It applies to persons who in their 
professional capacity may find themselves in that situation. 
Like the government member, I wonder if the criminal code is the 
best way to meet the need which is obviously a real concern for 
the member and the people engaged in those activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the New Democratic Party intend to support the legislation 
to at least get it to committee where it can be examined. 
However we wonder if we might better to look at labour 
legislation, because we are talking about the health and safety 
of individuals engaged in the performance of their professional 
duties, be they nurses, firefighters, policemen, security guards, 
prison guards, teachers, people in day care centres, et cetera. 
We are talking about a wide range of professionals and working 
people who are faced in 2001 with health and safety concerns that 
we could not possibly have imagined 25 years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We applaud the intent of the legislation.  The purpose of the 
legislation is good.  However we wonder if by working 
collectively through the committee members of the Conservative 
Party, the Alliance, the Bloc, the NDP and the Liberals, we might 
find a better way to ensure that this legislation does what the 
member wants it to do without running into all kinds of hurdles. 
Working collectively we may all be able to achieve just that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to wondering whether the criminal code is the 
appropriate piece of legislation, there are certain civil 
liberties that have been raised by the government speaker as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We may be able to find a way to take the thrust of the 
legislation out of the criminal code and place it in labour 
legislation.  The government talks about working in tandem with 
health.  We lean toward labour legislation.  If we find a way to 
do that then we may avoid some of the constitutional challenges 
that could follow as a result of criminal code legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member in speaking to his bill referred to the 
perpetrators of crime.  However we remind him, and he obviously 
knows, that this legislation is very wide ranging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague is a lawyer and a bit of a wordsmith from Nova 
Scotia, and we deal with words all the time.  Subclause 3(b) 
states that a judge can issue a warrant and it outlines the 
considerations.  Subclause 3(b) goes on to state “by reason of 
the circumstances by which the applicant came into contact with 
the bodily substance”.  We need to explore that to see exactly 
what it means.  If it is a matter of a criminal code offence, 
then we know that if in the execution of his or her duties, and 
the examples were given by the mover of the legislation, a police 
officer gets stabbed by a needle or gets bitten, these are 
compelling circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However for a nurse who works in a hospital in a unit where a 
number of people suffer from HIV or hepatitis B are those 
circumstances sufficiently compelling? 
No one says, as in some of the criminal cases cited by the 
member, “I bit you.  Now you have HIV” or “I have a score to 
settle with you and I am going to pierce you with a needle”.

<A HREF="#LINKT51"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How compelling should the circumstances be for the invasion of 
someone's civil liberties to take a blood sample?  We need some 
clarification on that.  By sending the bill to committee, we 
might very well get the clarification that is required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary there is a serious point raised by the government and 
the opposition members, and that is the arresting of someone who 
has not committed a criminal offence.  That is a serious matter 
for all of us to consider, especially in the constitutional 
challenges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada one of the things we pride is our freedom: freedom 
from arbitrary arrest, freedom from arrest without the reading of 
rights and without knowing what we have done wrong.  This is 
where the criminal aspect of this is different than applying it 
to the civil aspect, to those engaged in health and safety 
occupations where no crime has been committed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have fought the intent of the legislation.  We would like to 
bring it forward to the committee for further examination.  There 
are some real concerns that we see with it, but we think by 
working together we will be able to iron them out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was originally said in 1999 by our great colleague, Mr. 
Peter Mancini from Nova Scotia. 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (St. Catharines, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the bill proposed by the member for Fraser Valley raises a number 
of important issues that must be thoroughly examined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-217 provides that a justice may issue a warrant 
authorizing a peace officer to require a qualified medical 
practitioner to take or cause to be taken by a qualified 
technician, samples of blood from a person in order to determine 
whether the person carries the hepatitis B virus, or the 
hepatitis C virus or human autoimmune deficiency virus if the 
justice is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to do so. 
These reasonable grounds are subsequently enumerated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At first blush the bill appeals to our desire to help those on 
the front lines, those individuals who in their daily work 
confront the possibility of putting their health at risk.  We are 
speaking medical practitioners, firefighters and police officers 
to name a few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Health, as we all do, appreciates the work that 
has been done by the emergency responders in Canada.  They are an 
essential component of the Canadian health care system.  Health 
Canada has collaborated with the emergency responders on many 
occasions leading to the development of a national consensus on 
guidelines for the establishment of a post exposure notification 
protocol for emergency responders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who work on the front lines as emergency responders can be 
exposed to blood and other body fluids in the course of their 
work.  Of concern in this proposed piece of legislation are those 
injuries that could result in an exposure of blood borne 
pathogens, namely HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C.  It must be 
pointed out that exposure to the blood or blood fluids of an HIV, 
HBV or HCV infected person does not necessarily result in a 
transmission of the virus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to properly prevent these exposures and to respond 
appropriately when an exposure occurs, emergency response 
organizations need an overall occupational health protocol.  That 
includes immunization against hepatitis B and personal protective 
equipment such as gloves and safe work practices.  If a possible 
exposure does occur, emergency responders need to be educated on 
the protocols of how to obtain immediate assessment and follow 
up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-217, a blood samples act, would authorize the drawing of 
blood samples from individuals who may have accidentally or 
intentionally exposed frontline emergency providers or a good 
Samaritan to hepatitis B, hepatitis C or human immunodeficiency 
virus HIV.  After a suspected exposure, an emergency service 
provider would be permitted to apply to a justice for a warrant. 
This warrant would authorize a medical practitioner or technician 
to take a blood sample from the patient in question, tests for 
the aforementioned diseases and provide test results to the 
patients and to the emergency service provider.  Refusal to 
submit a blood test could result in a prison term of up to six 
months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we recognize that emergency service providers must act 
promptly to counteract the negative effects of exposure to 
serious diseases, it is important to note that previous requests 
for such testing have been rejected by the courts.

<A HREF="#LINKT52"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Preventive measures should be taken within hours of exposure. 
According to Health Canada guidelines published in the Canada 
communicable disease report, the option to administer post 
exposure prophylaxis should be established within a few hours. It 
is unlikely that the legal and medical procedures necessary to 
draw an authorized blood sample, to test it and to distribute its 
results could be accomplished within this brief timeframe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While mandatory blood testing of sources in cases of genuine 
exposure might assist in making more informed decisions regarding 
the use of post exposure medications, there would also be the 
potential for endangering the health of the victim, especially 
his or her mental health, by breaking the rules on patient 
confidentiality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The guidelines referred to previously and established by Health 
Canada in 1995, in conjunction with firefighters, police and 
ambulance workers, demonstrate concrete actions taken to address 
the risks and consequently have already anticipated the 
objectives of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Guidelines that ensure emergency responders will be notified 
quickly regarding exposures obtained in their line of work have 
been implemented by the provinces of Alberta, Ontario, British 
Columbia, Saskatchewan and the Northwest Territories and by other 
regions and hospitals in other jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 a second protocol outlining assessment, testing and 
treatment procedures to be used to promote the well-being of 
health care workers, including firefighters, police and ambulance 
workers, was released by Health Canada.  By following the second 
protocol, emergency responders will receive up to date care 
directed toward reducing the effects of an exposure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The guidelines recommended by Health Canada for emergency 
responders reflect the same standard of care given to all other 
health care workers including nurses and physicians.  The 
guidelines recommend testing the source in such cases but always 
with consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By following Health Canada's notification protocols emergency 
responders can be assured of timely, rational and effective 
assessment and treatment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to join in the debate.  I commend 
my colleague from Fraser Valley for bringing forward this 
initiative.  I thank those who have worked so hard for so long 
behind the scenes to bring this idea to the floor of the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There seems to be one underlying issue for those who have any 
hesitation in supporting the bill, that of two conflicting 
principles: the principle of individual personal autonomy versus 
personal responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In objections raised by a few of my colleagues, that is the nub 
of their argument.  They say or have said that we need to be 
careful of an individual's right and in taking a blood sample we 
might be impinging on a person's right.  The flip side of that 
argument is that individuals in society need to be responsible 
for their own actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When there is a conflict in this area, which do we choose as 
legislators?  We have the opportunity with Bill C-217 to make a 
positive change to help those who help others.  We have the 
opportunity to make a change for health care workers, police 
officers, people in emergency services or those who do something 
out of the goodness of their hearts.  We can do that with the 
bill.  Let us not focus on the aspects that might stop us from 
moving ahead because there is a greater good in passing the bill. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1845"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT53"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are always faced with choices in our lives.  As legislators 
we are faced with the choice of moving ahead with the bill or 
saying yes, it is a good idea, but let us not do it.  I say let 
us do it.  I encourage my colleagues from all parties to move 
ahead and say yes to Bill C-217. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It needs to be done.  The reason it needs to be done is that 
there are many people in our society who do things out of the 
goodness of their hearts.  When doing so they rarely stop to 
think about the implications of their good deeds.  Those who work 
in the health services area or are police officers or emergency 
service workers obviously do think about it.  They are trained. 
They do have protocols. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from St. Catharines seems to be saying, and I hope 
I mistook him in some way, that these protocols would provide an 
extra level of protection.  In one way they do, but at the end of 
the day what needs more protection and was not mentioned by my 
colleague is the uncertainty that has to be lived with by an 
individual who has done a good deed and may have accidentally 
been exposed to hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV.  That individual 
has to live with the mental anguish of not knowing.  I cannot 
fully imagine how terrible that is for those who have had to walk 
that road, thinking about their own families, their children, 
their lives and their livelihoods and how that one act of 
goodness done to help another might be the cause of their own 
demise.  That is a terrible thought and that is a terrible place 
to be in.  We can do something about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Change happens when individuals seek out change, take a stand 
and move forward with a vision and with hope on something that is 
very important to them.  Constable Anderson has been very 
instrumental in behind the scenes work with the bill in terms of 
developing an organization called FLAG, Front Line and Good 
Samaritan's Right to Know.  I commend her for her good work. 
Oftentimes it must be frustrating to hear the different debates 
we have about this conflict of individual rights versus personal 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of this debate what we need to hold in the forefront 
of this discussion as legislators is that we want to discourage 
negative behaviour and encourage positive behaviour in our 
society for the good of our country, for the good of our citizens 
and for the well-being of all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should we then place the emphasis on those who might commit an 
act that could endanger the life of another citizen?  Should we 
put that principle above the principle of personal 
responsibility?  I do not think we should in this case, and I 
think the bill addresses very well that specific concern 
mentioned by my colleague from the Liberal Party and by other 
colleagues as well.  There would have to be a warrant issued by a 
judge for the taking of a blood sample in this situation.  There 
is protection built into the legal system so that this would not 
be abused.  There would have to be a good reason for a warrant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also for those who have concerns, the warrant can be used just 
for that specific purpose. Clause 14 of the bill says that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A sample of blood taken from a person pursuant to a warrant 
issued under section 5 shall not be analysed for any purpose 
other than the purpose specified in the warrant. 
</UL>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is very specific. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a well crafted bill that addresses a need and a concern 
and it should be passed.  So many times in this place we hear 
good ideas, for good causes.  We debate both sides and make a 
decision.  In this case I believe we must be compelled to focus 
on the greater good of those who give of themselves in the line 
of service.  We must focus on that because it is a positive thing 
to do and it will provide a benefit to our society, to our health 
care workers and to people who put their lives on the line every 
single day in every single way that they can.  That so often goes 
unnoticed and unthanked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is that selfless giving of individuals day after day in their 
lines of work that contributes to society and makes it a better 
place to be.  We should not neglect that and pass up the 
opportunity now.  If we let the bill slip away, we will lose an 
opportunity to do something good that would benefit our country, 
our people and future generations.  For that reason, I ask my 
colleagues, when considering why they should or should not 
support the bill, to consider the argument that it is a better 
thing to focus on personal responsibility and the greater good of 
our society in passing the bill.  While taking into consideration 
individual personal responsibility, the greater good must be 
done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us do it.  Let us work together and make this happen.  We 
have an opportunity to make a difference and that does not happen 
too often in this place.  We can do it today.  Let us move 
forward and support Bill C-217.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I will begin by commending my colleague for introducing this 
bill.  It is a very good bill.  One of the things that has really 
impressed me in my years as a member of parliament is that many 
of the good ideas that come into the Chamber are brought in by 
private members.  These are the people, all of us, who on the 
weekends and in the weeks out of the House rub shoulders with our 
constituents.  We find out from them what is really important to 
them.  To me that is the essence of representative democracy:  to 
bring to the Chamber the ideas that our electors back home 
implore us to deal with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased that my colleague has introduced the bill.  I 
am also exceptionally pleased that in our grand lottery scheme he 
actually had his bill drawn and was then able to somehow persuade 
that so-called independent committee that it was actually worthy 
of a debate longer than one hour and worthy of a vote.  We will 
actually be voting on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is truly remarkable and it should not be.  If I digress for 
just a few seconds, Mr. Speaker, I am sure you will not mind. 
There should not be occasions when members bring forward ideas 
that they consider important enough to occupy the House's time 
which are then automatically discarded without resulting in a 
decision, by vote, of the members here.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite a bit has already been said about this bill and why people 
should support it.  If I may, I would like to add my ideas and my 
argument in favour of supporting the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of important issues.  The one I would 
underline is the conflict that appears when we have presumed 
conflicting rights.  We have these all the time, no matter how 
large the society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our children are all grown up and have left home, so our little 
society in our house consists of my wife and myself.  Every once 
in a while we have little conflicts on whether she should get her 
way or I should get mine if we disagree on something.  I have 
learned over the years to simply compromise and do what she 
wants, not always but most of the time.  It keeps peace in the 
house.  I know if she gets word of what I have said here, I will 
be in trouble when I get home, but we will debate that further at 
that stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This situation arises in a democracy, in a society, regardless 
of whether there are two people or 30 million.  There will be 
times when the rights of people collide.  How do we evaluate 
which right takes precedence over the other? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue before us today is one of those cases where one does 
not have to be a very deep-thinking person to realize that it is 
almost an open and shut case.  I know that we want to defend the 
right of privacy in the country, and justifiably so.  We do not 
want a society where people are looking over our shoulders and 
watching everything we say, do and think. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Notwithstanding that, we seem to have that situation in the 
country.  We have agencies of the government like the CRTC, for 
example, which is very involved in determining even which radio 
stations can exist, what their formats will be and what they can 
broadcast.  That to me is an intrusion on a personal freedom.  If 
people have financial backing and want to have a radio station on 
a certain theme, they should have the right to proceed.  It 
should not be up to a government bureaucracy to decide that they 
cannot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However we have situations like the one before us today where 
one person, having done the right things, is potentially at risk 
of contracting a life threatening disease, whereas the other 
person has the risk of giving a sample of blood or other body 
tissue that he or she does not want to give so that an evaluation 
can be made as to whether or not the person who is the victim has 
been infected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that this is not an issue we have to think very 
hard about.  The rights being protected are worlds apart in 
magnitude.  One is very important and the other one, the 
necessity of giving a sample of blood or whatever, is a very 
small loss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was younger I used to donate blood at the Red Cross 
clinics.  It was not very painful to give.  In those days we 
measured things in quarts and gallons.  I would go quite 
regularly and give a quart of blood with no problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can a person say that my rights are being violated if I am 
asked to give a little vial of blood so that another person can 
find out whether or not he or she has been infected?  To me it is 
totally clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to run out of time very shortly, but I would like to 
appeal to all members of the House to simply use their 
intelligence, analytic abilities and independence to vote in 
favour of this very good bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  The time provided for 
the consideration of private members' business has now expired 
and the order is dropped to the bottom of the order of precedence 
on the order paper.

</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise and follow up on my question of February 23 
about the Cobequid fish hatchery which served northern Nova 
Scotia for 60 years and was very much a part of the community. 
Then along came a new policy by the federal government to divest 
the fish hatcheries in Nova Scotia, a great new enlightened 
policy that would result in an expanded fish hatchery through 
private sector investment.  The only problem was the fish 
hatchery did not survive that private sector divestiture.  The 
company failed and the fish hatchery was wound down to virtually 
nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was amazing that when we had such a serious situation with 
our fisheries and so many different threats to the fisheries the 
government responded by selling off the fish hatcheries to 
companies that could not raise the revenue to make them viable. 
Even right from the very beginning, anybody who looked at the 
proposals on the divested fish hatcheries knew they would not 
work.  Three hatcheries in Nova Scotia failed and ended up 
reverting back to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government wound down the Cobequid fish hatchery at a time 
when we needed it very badly.  Everyone knew the fisheries were 
at risk.  Again, the response was to close the fish hatcheries or 
sell them off to companies that could not make them survive.  The 
fish hatchery near Oxford, Nova Scotia, served the environment. 
The fishery provided jobs and was very much a part of the 
community for decades and decades.  Again, it failed and reverted 
back to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a really opportune time for the government to grab the 
agenda and do something really appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The inner Bay of Fundy salmon has been designated as a very 
distinct species of fish which only stays in the Bay of Fundy. 
Most salmon go to Greenland in the winter and spend time there. 
However this unique species of fish stays in the inner bay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I would like the minister to consider and even accept 
the proposal that the Cobequid fish hatchery be dedicated to this 
endangered species.  The government has a responsibility for 
endangered species.  Here is a perfect opportunity to deal with 
it.  We have a fish hatchery that needs to be upgraded and 
enhanced and we have a need for the fish.  It is a perfect 
opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the government will respond to this repeated request to 
upgrade the Cobequid fish hatchery with a very positive answer. 
It is an opportunity to solve two problems, one of an endangered 
species and one to deal with the Cobequid fish hatchery, which 
served our community for so long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again I ask the minister to enhance the Cobequid fish 
hatchery, reinstate it, bring it back to where it was and help it 
serve the community like it did for so long? 
<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lawrence O'Brien (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
talk today on behalf of the Department and Fisheries and Oceans' 
plan for continuing support of Atlantic salmon conservation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At one time Fisheries and Oceans Canada operated three mainland 
Nova Scotia hatcheries principally to enhance Atlantic salmon 
stocks for aboriginal and recreational fisheries.  In October 
1997 DFO negotiated an operational agreement and divested these 
hatcheries to Salmon Care, a not for profit group dedicated to 
the conservation and sustainable use of Atlantic salmon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>DFO has now consolidated the following programs:  the Atlantic 
Salmon live gene bank, which is a program to maintain inner Bay 
of Fundy Atlantic salmon and potentially acid rain impacted 
Atlantic salmon stocks; the rearing of salmon to stock acid 
impacted rivers; the rearing of the endangered Atlantic 
whitefish; and support for the integrated Atlantic salmon 
fisheries management plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>DFO is currently looking for resources to maintain the 
facilities at Mersey and Coldbrook for their use for Atlantic 
salmon and Atlantic whitefish conservation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
issue of fish hatcheries is not dissimilar to the issue I am 
raising this evening.  My question is for the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has shown the same lack of vision, direction and 
responsibility toward the issue of salmon and the three Nova 
Scotia fish hatcheries as it has toward other aspects of the 
fishery in Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I pointed out to the minister on March 2 that Chief Lawrence 
Paul and others in Nova Scotia have stated that federal 
negotiators are considering dividing bays in Atlantic Canada 
between aboriginal and non-aboriginal fishermen.  That would be a 
clearly wrongheaded policy.  It would go against the spirit of 
sharing the fishery, under one set of rules, between aboriginal 
and non-aboriginal fishermen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer I got from the parliamentary secretary was not 
satisfactory.  It did not speak to my question.  I asked it in 
March and a couple of agreements have been signed since then. 
Agreements were signed with two Nova Scotia bands just a short 
time ago, one with the Glooscap band and one with the Pictou 
Landing band.  I commend the government for being able to do 
that.  Those agreements should not be ignored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However that begs the question:  where is the long term policy? 
What are we doing to prevent another outbreak in a very short 
period of time, by June 1?  What are we doing to prevent another 
Burnt Church or another problem with the Shubenacadie band?  What 
are we doing to protect the livelihoods of non-native fishermen 
who have seen licensing fees increase from $70,000 to $125,000? 
One could typically have bought a licence in LFA 33 for $70,000. 
For $150,000 to $175,000, one could have bought a licence in LFA 
34.  The licence that sold for $150,000 before the government 
started its wrongheaded policy is today selling for $700,000. How 
can a young man or woman even begin to imagine buying their 
father's fishing licence and entering the fishery today?  It is 
impossible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have spent $180 million on efforts with first nations issues. 
My party and I are fully in favour of settling issues with first 
nations, signing modern day treaties, reconciling the situation 
and moving forward together in a new society.  This type of 
legislation from the government does not achieve that.  This type 
of short term policy and this type of decision making do not 
achieve that.  It is time we addressed this.  We must have one 
fishery, one set of rules and one opening date for all commercial 
fishermen.  Nothing else is acceptable. 
<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lawrence O'Brien (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, thank you for the 
opportunity to address the issue of whether fishing areas should 
be split into native and non-native areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must all keep in mind that aboriginal groups and the 
commercial sector want the same things.  They want a sustainable 
fishery, prosperity, and safe and vibrant communities.  That is 
what the federal fisheries team is working toward.  The 
government is working toward providing first nations with access 
through the issuance of commercial licences.  These licences are 
subject to the same rules as all other commercial licences. There 
is no differentiation between aboriginal and non-aboriginal 
fishers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not establishing separate fishing zones or different 
rules for different groups and will not do so unless all parties 
agree.  Such a proposition is not the way to foster co-operation 
and coexistence.  Creating two classes of fishers does not serve 
the purpose of managing fisheries resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  The motion to adjourn 
the House is now deemed to have been adopted.  Accordingly the 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m. pursuant to
