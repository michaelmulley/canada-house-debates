<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="BORROWINGAUTHORITYACT,1994-95">BORROWING AUTHORITY ACT, 1994-95</A></H3>
	The House resumed from February 25 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-14, an act to provide borrowing authority for 
the fiscal year beginning April 1, 1994, be read the second time 
and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, thank you for recognizing me in this debate today. I 
recognize the necessity for the government to have a borrowing 
authority bill passed by Parliament.
<P>
<B>(1105 ) </B>
<P>
	The government does not receive all of its revenue from taxes 
on a specific date early in the fiscal year. Therefore, to meet its 
program needs when there is a shortfall in revenue it needs to be 
able to borrow. This is done all the time in the business world. 
What is new and extraordinary about the situation we in the 
House of Commons are faced with on this bill is the fact that the 
government knows now that there will be a substantial 
difference between revenues and expenditures, some $39.7 
billion on the expenditure side, and has done nothing substantial 
to move toward balancing its books.
<P>
	The only thing it has done is sought borrowing authority 
through this bill to make up the difference.
<P>
	We were also told on Thursday, February 24, 1994 by the 
President of the Treasury Board that spending for the fiscal year 
1994-95 only went up by $3 billion. Then he told us if we took 
out the increased amount to pay the interest on the debt, not the 
principal, spending only went up $.7 billion. What is most 
surprising is that he said this as if it were something to be proud 
of, some great achievement.
<P>
	Does any of this make sense to the people of Canada, the 
people who pay all the bills? I repeat, the people who pay all the 
bills for everything the government does.
<P>
	The government, in the overall scheme of things, is going to 
increase its spending, making a bad situation in relation to the 
deficit even worse. How can this government justify to 
Canadians any tax increase which puts more financial burden on 
Canadians when it will not even begin to put its financial house 
in order?
<P>
	What does this government think Canadians want? What does 
this government think Canadians voted for on October 25 last 
year? They voted for a promise to create jobs and they voted for 
fiscal responsibility. If they did not want fiscal responsibility we 
in the Reform Party would not have increased our numbers from 
1 to 52. The government's actions two weeks ago with the 
budget and the tabling of spending estimates and the borrowing 
bill will do nothing to create long term, permanent jobs, nor are 
they fiscally sound.
<P>
	We have a short term, make work project through which we 
borrow money to create jobs, but nothing permanent. The 
president of the Canadian Manufacturers' Association has said 
that the Martin budget measures do not add up to a coherent plan 
that will help manufacturing grow, modernize and reinvent 
itself for the 21st century.
<P>
	On the second issue of being fiscally prudent and attacking 
the deficit now, what are we told by the government? Just like 
any loser in an athletic contest: ``Just wait until next year, or 
maybe the year after that''.
<P>
	Canadians thought on October 25 that they had elected a 
government with a plan, a plan for the economy, a plan for social 
programs, a plan for reworking unemployment insurance, a plan 
to deal with the provision of better health services. Really what 
they elected was a government with a plan to study, not a plan to 
act; a plan to pass the buck, a plan to spend a lot of bucks but no 
plan to act.
<P>
	We have the red book but what does it say? It spends a lot of 
time discussing programs but little time discussing 
implementation. If the government had plans to implement 
change, then at least we could see where we are headed in 
relation to program change and tax savings.
<P>
	My friend from Lethbridge two weeks ago asked the Minister 
of Finance when the results of all these studies came in, after the 
summer break, after these results had been considered by 
cabinet if he would bring in a new budget, a budget in the fall. 
The answer was no.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1886"> 1886 </A></B>
<P>
	We believe it is time to act. The government was elected in 
October last year and we are now in March. We are now going to 
undertake studies, studies whose results will be reported to us in 
approximately six months. If the government had acted quickly 
and decisively when it was first elected, we would have the 
results of these studies well before the summer break, and a 
budget could reflect such quick and decisive action.
<P>
	Does the government not realize that by reducing and 
subsequently eliminating the deficit we will eventually be able 
to start paying down the national debt?
<P>
<B>(1110 ) </B>
<P>
	By reducing and eliminating the deficit we would have in a 
very short period taxpayers' money freed up so that taxes could 
be reduced, thus stimulating the economy or perhaps this money 
could be used for retraining or to help industry, manufacturing, 
expand or retool so that permanent long term jobs are created.
<P>
	Action on the expenditure side, action to reduce expenditure, 
will return to us as Canadians the economic freedom to choose 
which we have not enjoyed for many years. Again, what do we 
hear from the government? In three years the deficit will be 3 per 
cent of GDP. What does this mean?
<P>
	It means that any hope of dealing with the country's debt is 
put off until the next century. We will still be devoting a huge 
amount of taxpayers' dollars to pay the interest on the debt 
without any hope of encroaching on the principal for many 
years.
<P>
	If the government is not prepared to act on the expenditure 
side, I am serving notice today that we in the Reform Party are 
ready to act.
<P>
	Each line item of each departmental expenditure plan will be 
scrutinized carefully by members of this party when the 
estimates are in committee. We will ask each minister and each 
deputy minister to justify every penny of the departmental 
expenditure plans. When we find expenditures which we believe 
are not crucial to the well-being of the people of Canada we will 
vote against them. The government wants to consult with 
members of this House. We will give the government 
consultation.
<P>
	Second, I will press the Standing Committee on Procedure 
and House Affairs and the government House leader to 
recommend the creation of a permanent standing committee of 
this House whose sole job would be to review the spending 
estimates of government departments.
<P>
	In 1983 the special committee created to study the standing 
orders and procedures of the House recommended an elaborate 
series of estimate review committees in its fifth report to this 
House. My proposal is simply to create one such committee 
which would in the course of the fiscal year scrutinize very 
carefully the estimates of perhaps only three government 
departments. It would then report back to this House and also to 
the  standing committee which deals with a particular 
department on a regular basis.
<P>
	This information could then be used by the departmental 
standing committee when the minister came back for 
supplementary spending estimates or in the following year when 
new spending plans are referred to the departmental standing 
committee.
<P>
	The fiscal responsibility committee which I recommend be 
established would during the life of a Parliament scrutinize in 
detail the spending plans of virtually all government 
departments. This would not be glamorous work but it is the 
kind of work that is needed, the kind of tough work the 
government does not seem prepared to do, at least at this time.
<P>
	I can assure my friends opposite that this is the kind of work 
that we in the Reform Party were elected to do and we are quite 
willing to spend the long and necessary hours to reduce 
government expenditures.
<P>
	The time has come for action, not for talk. Canadians are a 
fiscally responsible people. They do not live beyond their 
means. If in a family something cannot be afforded then 
spending priorities change. We do not expect families to run out 
and borrow every time they see a new item they want to buy. 
Why should government be any different?
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I would like to apologize because at the very 
beginning I should have told you on behalf of the whip, pursuant 
to Standing Order 43(2), we will be dividing our time this 
morning.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, through you to the member, I would 
like to congratulate her on her remarks. There are some points 
about the budget that she did not include in her remarks.
<P>
	She said that we were afraid to take on the tough decisions. I 
believe that is not an accurate assessment. We did announce 
policy reviews in our social security system, in defence, foreign 
aid, the goods and services tax which is being reviewed in 
committee right now for an alternative. We will begin our study 
in the industry committee in two weeks where we will have 
public accountability of financial institutions in Canada: a 
program review, overlap and duplication, tariffs and the paper 
burden. All of these are concrete actions taking place right now.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	It is important we not leave in the public's mind the thought 
that the Reform Party is the only party interested in reducing or 
eliminating waste. If people can bring forward ideas on how to 
eliminate or reduce waste in a particular area we welcome their 
letters, phone calls or faxes. It is the same type of information 
the member receives as well.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1887"> 1887 </A></B>
<P>
	The government has taken a very tough stand on reducing the 
deficit and our net savings over three years will be $20.4 billion. 
We have only been in government for three and a half months, 
but we have to put some hope back into the economy and get 
some job creation going. Any further cuts would cause the 
fragile economy to slip back into a recession.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jennings:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. 
member for his comments.
<P>
	I stress again that I talked about reviews and studies. In 
answer to the hon. member, more reviews are not what we need. 
It is time for action. A deficit of $39.7 billion is certainly not 
tough at all and does not address the issues that have to be 
addressed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Where would you 
cut?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jennings:</B> The Reform Party put out a very good zero 
and three which went into detail. If I had another hour I would go 
through it with the member.
<P>
	I would like to point out something to everyone in the House. I 
am very concerned about the infrastructure money. Where is the 
money coming from?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Existing budgets.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jennings:</B> I was in my constituency last week and they 
said they did not have the money for more taxes. The federal 
government is going to lend it to them.
<P>
	An article in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> dated February 11 warns very 
much against the infrastructure money. Every tax increase 
causes a loss of jobs. Taking $7 from a taxpayer to pay for a 
construction industry job means taking $7 away from a job 
somewhere else: a department store, the auto industry or a 
clothing manufacturer. I insist that is going to be a problem 
down the road.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The time appears to have expired. I 
might remind the hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister 
of Industry that nobody heckled him while he was making his 
remarks.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> On a point of order, 
Mr. Speaker, I did not think I was heckling the member. I was 
merely pointing out some factual information that did not seem 
to be a part of the address. I certainly did not think that was out 
of order. I have been here, not as long as you, but for six years 
and-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order. That is certainly not a point of 
order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hugh Hanrahan (Edmonton-Strathcona):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise in the House for my 
first major address.
<P>
	It is with a great sense of pride and humility that I stand before 
you and the rest of Canada as the representative for 
Edmonton-Strathcona. I would like to take this opportunity to 
thank the people of my riding for the trust they placed in me as 
their representative in the 35th Parliament. I would like to 
assure them that I will do my very best to represent their views 
in the House of Commons. I would also like to thank my wife 
Dianne  and daughter Margaret for their support and patience 
during the campaign.
<P>
	The constituency of Edmonton-Strathcona is an extremely 
diverse riding with a wide range of small and medium sized 
businesses. It is also the home to, in my opinion, the best 
educational facility in the country, the University of Alberta.
<P>
<B>(1120 ) </B>
<P>
	It was the youth of my constituency who gave me the 
inspiration to seek a seat in Parliament. Clearly they recognized 
the implications of the national debt on their futures. Given the 
increasing debt and the demographics of our country, it is little 
wonder that so many of our population of all ages look with such 
growing concern at the future implications of this debt. While 
both the Reform Party in its blue book and the government in its 
red book have taken significantly different approaches to the 
debt problem, neither party has suggested it be attacked by 
placing the burden on youth.
<P>
	The Reform Party, while suggesting many cutbacks, also 
suggests that these cutbacks be priorized. In surveying our 
members and Canadians in general we have concluded that a 
number of areas must be maintained. These include federal 
grants to medicare, the environment and advanced education.
<P>
	If we are to leave a Canada to our children similar to the 
Canada our parents left to us, then we must offer hope to the 
younger generation. We must not only attack our debt but do it in 
a manner which allows for a clean environment, a healthy and 
educated population able to confront the global economy in a 
confident manner. This is one of the major challenges of this 
Parliament.
<P>
	To emphasize the present situation let me cite the following. 
A recent article by the <I>Globe and Mail</I> reporting on a study from 
Statistics Canada stated that unprecedented numbers of young 
Canadians have been wrestled out of the workforce. 
Proportionately more of them lost their jobs than adults and it 
will take longer for them to gain back these jobs than it will be 
for adults. The same article, quoting Dr. Phipps of Dalhousie 
University, suggests it is possible that by the time the economy 
does produce good jobs a fresh generation of better trained, 
better educated young people will be vying for these jobs. The 
prospect that a combination of all these factors could produce a 
lost generation is very real.
<P>
	On a more individual level, I would like to cite a letter 
received by an employer in my constituency from a recent 
university graduate. In it he states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I am a 1993 graduate of the University of Alberta with a BSc in meteorology. 
Unfortunately due to the state of the job market, I had no success in gaining 
employment in my field. I would like your company to consider me for any 
position that may be available from answering phones to lab analysis.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1888"> 1888 </A></B>
<P>
	These are just two examples of problems facing the youth in 
our country today. What is perhaps of greater concern is that this 
problem of youth unemployment is occurring at a time when 
there are as many as 400,000 jobs available in our economy.
<P>
	John Yurxa of Yurxa Research stated in a recent speech in 
Edmonton that ``the economy will have no shortage of lucrative 
jobs in the remainder of this decade, it is just that you will need a 
new set of skills to get them. The fact is there are now over one 
and a half million Canadians out of work, yet many employers 
say they cannot find the workers they need. In fact, today, the 
mismatch between job seekers and job vacancies is so high that 
if it could be remedied overnight, up to 400,000 jobs would be 
created instantly''.
<P>
	It would seem the problem of youth unemployment can be 
found in the structural unemployment that is present in the 
Canadian economy. The solution to this problem lies in 
matching the training of our youth to the demands of the 
marketplace.
<P>
	The recent budget included in its job creation an entire section 
devoted to apprenticeship programs for the training of youth. 
This apprenticeship program is to be introduced in 1995-96 and 
will cost the Canadian taxpayers $96 million in the first year and 
an additional $192 million in the following year. While I 
applaud the government for recognizing the problem of youth 
unemployment, some serious questions as to the structure of this 
program must be asked.
<P>
<B>(1125 ) </B>
<P>
	How did the government come up with these figures? Why 
$96 million? Why not $50 million or $150 million? Will these 
programs meet the needs of the mismatch between job training 
and job requirements? Who will be eligible for these programs? 
Where and under whose auspices will these programs be 
delivered?
<P>
	As mentioned earlier, I agree with the government's decision 
to initiate the youth initiative program. However, if it is to offer 
real hope to our youth it must be tailored to the needs of the 
market. Another program that does not offer real prospects for 
employment will only add to the frustration of our youth.
<P>
	I suggest the government take the following into 
consideration in developing the youth initiative program. First, 
identify through co-operation with industry, labour and the 
provinces those skills that are actually needed in present and 
future markets.
<P>
	Employment growth in the Canadian economy in recent years 
has been in services. Throughout the eighties, however, more 
than 90 per cent of occupations covered by apprenticeship 
programs have related to manufacturing and construction. Most 
vacancies now exist in informational technology, 
telecommunications and environmental technologies.
<P>
	My second suggestion is that industry participate, not only in 
setting the standards but also in the financial responsibility for 
these programs. Here we can look at two existing programs as 
models: One, the very positive aspects of the Canadian 
provincial apprenticeship programs already in existence; and 
two, the programs of other countries, particularly in Germany.
<P>
	A third suggestion is that like trade apprenticeship programs, 
the youth initiative program should include some sort of 
credential on completion. This accreditation should be 
nationally recognized in order to ensure mobility from one 
province to another. This would allow for the free movement of 
workers to areas experiencing economic growth. This 
suggestion may be criticized by some who believe that 
apprenticeship programs are essentially a provincial 
responsibility. While this is mainly true, the provinces have 
already in place interprovincial standards under their red seal 
program which in Alberta covers approximately 90 per cent of 
the certified journeymen.
<P>
	A final suggestion for the youth initiative program is that it 
must be focused on areas that do not jeopardize existing 
employees. To simply train our youth to replace at a lower wage 
present workers would only increase conflicts within the 
workforce.
<P>
	It is estimated that 60 per cent of youth go directly from high 
school to the job market. Our experience shows a high school 
education, while necessary, will not be sufficient for the market 
demands of the future. The youth initiative program if done 
properly offers an opportunity and hope for our nation's youth. 
However, if done improperly it will be seen as a short term, 
quick fix government program and a waste of Canadian 
taxpayers' money.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo):</B> Mr. Speaker, I enjoyed the 
member's comments, particularly the positive light he puts on 
youth initiatives for employment.
<P>
	The member posed a question: Why $96 million in the first 
year? Why not $50 million or $150 million? I could say that we 
could probably do a lot better than $96 million because the need 
is much greater. The reality is that we are trying to balance need 
and financial conditions. However I welcome his comments 
because I found them to be positive. I welcome his balanced 
approach, which is very refreshing to hear from that side of the 
House.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanrahan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
comments. He correctly points out-and we are consistently 
pointing it out to the Canadian people-that while a balanced 
budget is a necessity it must be done in a way that is priorized.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1889"> 1889 </A></B>
<P>
	We see education as an investment for Canadians. That is one 
area our members and Canadians at large have told us very 
clearly should not be cut. We do not want to see a lost generation 
and the problems implied with such a lost generation.
<P>
	While we believe in fiscal responsibility, our program of zero 
in three clearly shows many areas in which we can make 
responsible cuts to the budget. However we would not include in 
that advanced education, training of our youth, federal 
payments to medicare, or environmental concerns.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too 
enjoyed the member's remarks. I wondered what he thought 
about the internship and apprenticeship program described in 
the red book.
<P>
	This a national program under which people will get 
interprovincial licences. It is, as I understand it, focused on 
particular trades and areas of activity where we hope jobs will 
appear in the near future. It is also an apprenticeship program 
based on competence rather than time.
<P>
	Some examples the member mentioned were in other 
countries where people spend many years learning a trade 
whereas in fact it appears in modern times that it might be 
possible to proceed more quickly. Then persons might not only 
have one trade; they might have two or even three.
<P>
	On the question of funds, has the member given any thought to 
the idea of the apprentices paying fees as do students in colleges 
and universities?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I ask the hon. member for 
Edmonton-Strathcona to be brief. There is about a minute left.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanrahan:</B> Mr. Speaker, with respect to briefness I will 
respond to the final question regarding fees.
<P>
	I quite agree with the suggestion that fees are an appropriate 
matter. It has always been my belief that if a student in an 
educational facility takes some ownership of the facility, the 
training, he is much more likely to succeed than if he had not.
<P>
	I would not be opposed to user fees in that they would serve 
two purposes. They would give the student some opportunity to 
participate in his own education. They would also cut back on 
the public expenditure.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Secretary of State 
(Multiculturalism) (Status of Women)):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
delighted to speak on Bill C-14, the borrowing authority which 
would allow the government to meet its commitments and put 
into effect its budgetary policy. This statement, this budgetary 
accounting, indicates the choice our government is making for 
the next fiscal year and shows some very important fundamental 
changes.
<P>
	The agenda before us is a very ambitious one. It is a difficult 
one and it is taken in a time of economic restraint. 
Notwithstanding, our main goal has been to create jobs and 
growth and to be innovative while being  fiscally responsible. 
We also believe that with the co-operation of Canadians we can 
reduce the deficit to 3 per cent of GDP within three years.
<P>
	Our agenda and our priorities are no secret. Last fall we laid 
out our blueprint in the famous Liberal Party policy book. I 
know some members refer to it as the red book, but for me it is a 
fundamental policy book. It was our blueprint for job creation, 
deficit reduction, and a comprehensive policy review. 
Canadians have looked at it and have given us their approval by 
electing a strong majority Liberal government for the people, to 
speak with their voice and for them.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	We are turning those promises into action. The budget tabled 
by the Minister of Finance is based on fairness for all Canadians. 
It stems from an unprecedented consultation process and 
dialogue, a process to which the government is firmly 
committed in many areas. It is an open process of which we can 
be very proud. Women and women's groups have participated in 
the process and our voices have been heard.
<P>
	I am especially happy to point out to the House that the budget 
addresses a whole series of issues that are very important to 
women. The government is sensitive to the fact that programs 
and policies may have a different impact or a different effect on 
women. That is why we will ensure gender perspective is taken 
into consideration in all proposed changes undertaken as part of 
the various policy reviews. I can say that we are wearing gender 
tinted glasses, for that is what we are doing. Essentially my job 
is to make very sure that within the machinery of government we 
maintain that gender tint all along the way.
<P>
	Women and women's groups have been very important in 
applying that theory and ensuring within our party that 
perspective is always kept in balance. This is the first time a 
budget clearly recognizes that women often bear the brunt of 
social stress and economic dislocation. It is also the first time 
that a minister of finance recognizes publicly that there are 
disparities in our tax system and income system that are 
detrimental to women.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The comprehensive review of our tax system which we will be 
undertaking shortly represents a unique opportunity for women 
to help us correct some of our system's shortcomings, such as 
the tax treatment of support payments, which are prejudicial to 
them. It is very important that women and women's groups 
participate in these consultations because by proceeding with 
these kinds of reforms, we will succeed in improving the lot of 
Canadian women and quickening the process of equality for 
everyone.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1890"> 1890 </A></B>
<P>
	Our goal is to build a society in which women will have full 
access to the economic, political, cultural and legal spheres. I 
see that you are nodding in agreement, Mr. Speaker. There is no 
question that equality for women, equity and justice for all are 
tied to economic independence. Women must have the 
opportunity to participate in the labour market, to receive equal 
pay for work of equal value and to contribute fairly to our 
collective wealth.
<P>
	The contribution of women to our society and to our economy 
is enormous. Yet, women are often economically disadvantaged 
because of the disproportionate burden they must bear as far as 
family and home are concerned. Today, 60 per cent of Canadian 
women are active members of the labour force and 
three-quarters of them hold down full-time employment. This 
is a rather interesting figure as it reflects the major shift that has 
occurred in the past twenty years.
<P>
	Women of diverse ages, origins and cultures make up 45 per 
cent of Canada's labour force. By the year 2001, it is expected 
that women will account for nearly two-thirds of all new labour 
market entrants.
<P>
	In the short term, our infrastructure program will help to 
create thousands of jobs. We are increasingly confident that this 
program will give our economy the needed boost to get back on 
the prosperity track. This program, by investing in local 
communities, will create direct and indirect jobs for Canadians 
and improve the quality of their lives.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	Women too have a role to play in the development of 
legislation by introducing initiatives to increase the safety of 
their environment. I must say that women also have 
responsibilities. They must bring pressure to bear on mayors and 
municipalities so that their needs become a priority at the local 
level and can then be recognized as a responsibility at the 
provincial and federal levels. It is up to the mayors, aldermen 
and women's groups to demand whatever they consider 
important for their communities. That is part of our local 
priorities.
<P>
	The program can be used for building day care centres, which 
has the triple advantage of creating immediate employment, 
providing important services to families and leading to 
long-term employment. We will be ready to go ahead with child 
care services when the economic growth rate reaches 3 per cent 
of the GDP.
<P>
	On the other hand, our infrastructure projects are under 
review by federal, provincial and territorial co-presidents, as I 
just said. I can assure you that our representatives have been 
instructed to assess projects in terms of employment equity. I 
must thank the President of the Treasury Board for having taken 
this into consideration, while recognizing the need to take 
women into account in that regard.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Statistics released in January 1994 show that Canadian 
women still average only 72 cents for every dollar earned by 
men for working full time and that immigrant women make only 
80 per cent of women's income. That is quite a gap that we will 
have to address. Women, especially during child bearing years, 
experience more career interruptions which impact on their 
advancement in the workplace and their lifelong earning 
potential.
<P>
	The budget begins to address the fact that low income earners 
with dependants, primarily women, need a fairer system and that 
women live longer and have lower incomes in old age. The 
proposed changes to the Unemployment Insurance Act are 
designed to promote job creation, adequacy and fairness. The 
government has recognized that unemployment insurance 
programs must be linked to family status, dependants and other 
needs. As such these programs should be changed to provide 
assistance to those in greater need.
<P>
	In today's economic conditions many households are under 
financial stress even where there are two income earners. More 
often than men, women tend to earn low wages and have 
dependants. Increasing UI benefits to 60 per cent for individuals 
with low earnings and dependants helps women, particularly 
single parents.
<P>
	Amending and clarifying how the voluntary quit and 
misconduct provisions are applied stands to benefit women and 
improve the fairness of the entire process. That is something we 
complained about and felt strongly about in the last Parliament.
<P>
	We recognize that some other changes to the unemployment 
insurance system may have a detrimental effect given women's 
weaker attachment to the workforce. However we must 
remember that these changes are temporary. The Minister of 
Human Resources Development has already initiated a full 
review of our social security system. Every measure will be 
closely examined after extensive consultation in all regions of 
the country.
<P>
	In the meantime it is comforting to see business and labour 
leaders agree that Canada cannot afford to maintain barriers to 
the full and equal participation of women in the workforce.
<P>
	In a report published a few days ago the Canadian Labour 
Market and Productivity Centre makes some recommendations 
aimed at breaking the principal barriers to women's equality in 
the workforce. Among other recommendations the report 
proposes to provide family responsibility leave and extend 
flexible working arrangements.
<P>
	When I read the report I thought back to 1967 and the 
beginnings of the royal commission. I thought how far we had 
come in some areas, at least in terms of sensitivity if not in terms 
of complete catch-up. When I read a report from the Canadian 
Labour Market and Productivity Centre that says that family 
responsibility leave should be provided and flexible work 
arrangements  extended, I remember when they wanted to count 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1891"> 1891 </A></B>
<P>
every head from 9 to 5; employees did not move and could not 
leave.
<P>
<B>(1145 ) </B>
<P>
	Now at least there is some understanding that there has to be a 
flexible system. Establish a national child care system with 
professional salaries for child care workers. Reduce the work 
week possibly to four days with longer paid vacations and limits 
on overtime to free up jobs for more workers. Reduce stress for 
women who juggle work and family. Increase access to 
financing for women entrepreneurs.
<P>
	There is really big news here. Actually the biggest news, 
speaking as a mother of four sons, is the fact that my sons can be 
involved in raising their children in a far more equitable way. I 
know that is something they look forward to doing.
<P>
	The recommendations are good. Indeed this government has 
initiated many of them, including convincing the banks to 
supply more capital to small business. I know my colleague 
from Broadview-Greenwood is going to make very sure that 
the banks are going to listen. I told him what I said to the Royal 
Bank the other night. Go to it, Dennis. You and Berger make sure 
the banks listen.
<P>
	What is totally new is the strong endorsement this report has 
received from both business and labour. I have always said 
consensus of this type is essential to the advancement of women. 
I can only give this new consensus my strongest support. Unless 
we have men and women working together I do not think we can 
advance.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We are certainly on target. Our economic recovery plan is 
based on small business. I should add that women are a major 
element of our strategy, as 30 per cent of small and 
medium-sized businesses in this country are run by women. It is 
with great pleasure that I remind you that the proven rate of 
success of businesswomen is at least double that of their male 
counterparts. That is why, in the budget, actions concerning 
small business are essential for women.
<P>
	We know that it is very difficult for small business owners, 
women in particular, to obtain funding for their businesses. 
Banks impose unrealistic financing conditions which prevent 
the establishment and expansion of small and medium-sized 
businesses, acquisition of new technology, development of new 
markets and above all job creation. The fact of the matter is that 
the risk taken by banks-and I point this out to my hon. 
colleague so that he can bring it to the attention of the presidents 
of the nation's banks the next time they get together-by 
increasing the percentage of loans to small and medium-sized 
businesses is very small.
<P>
	Studies show that only 13 out of every 1,000 loans granted to 
small business are not repaid. In other words, Mr. Speaker, 98.7 
per cent of borrowers are creditworthy.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In the actual conjuncture 98.7 per cent constitutes an 
incredible rate of success. It should impress even the leaders of 
the banks and the most conservative of the bankers.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It must also be noted that profits in the banking sector reached 
$2.9 billion in 1993, or almost 60 per cent more than the 
previous year.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	That is a lot of money. I think they could start taking some 
risks along with our small and medium sized businesses.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	That is why our government set up a finance and industry task 
force to study, in collaboration with banks and small businesses, 
the issue of access to capital. I hope that the hon. members here 
in this House who have ideas will share them with us and 
provide clarification.
<P>
	In addition, business leaders asked us to urgently reduce 
unemployment insurance premiums, and we have done so. This 
will enable businesses to save $300 million a year and to 
reinvest this money in new jobs.
<P>
	We will also cut red tape and reduce interprovincial trade 
barriers, create a Canadian investment fund, form strategic 
alliances in favour of small business, establish joint ventures 
between research services and small businesses, and replace the 
GST with a tax that is more equitable for taxpayers and less 
burdensome for businesses.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This being said, our budget also proposes many initiatives 
that focus directly on women's needs. It puts in place provisions 
to improve women's health by creating a centre of excellence for 
women's health and launching a prenatal nutrition program. The 
national forum on health will also give us the opportunity to 
redress disparities in the way women are treated in our health 
care system. I could go into that at great length because there is 
much to do in that area.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	As soon as we reach 3 per cent of economic growth we will 
create 50,000 child care spaces a year until we reach an 
additional 150,000 spaces. The budget contains provisions for 
this in 1995 and 1996.
<P>
	Our initiatives will assist the people of this country to fully 
exercise their rights in terms of the charter, the Human Rights 
Act and the Multiculturalism Act. I am referring to the creation 
of the race relations foundation, the restoration of the court 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1892"> 1892 </A></B>
<P>
challenges program and the law reform commission, as well as a 
review of immigration and refugee policies. All these initiatives 
are  aimed at making this country's society a fairer, more 
compassionate one.
<P>
	We have to do that because we cannot allow the increase in 
racism that has been taking place and the manifestation of 
scapegoat because of the economic situation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We must take steps to make people understand that we are a 
peaceful society, where we live together in reasonable harmony, 
either in English or in French, Canada's two official languages.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Finally, the budget reaches out to young people, the pride and 
the future of our nation. The aboriginal head start program, the 
youth services corps, the young internship program, the literacy 
program and the youth student loans program are all important 
because they fill a great need.
<P>
	I see young people upstairs in the gallery. Your future is what 
we are talking about as we look at the budget and try to analyse 
where we will be going to put this country back to work and give 
hope to the next generation, which is our absolute mandate in 
this House.
<P>
	Added to this basic reform and initiatives already announced, 
these programs will allow our young women and men to prepare 
themselves for the challenges the new global economy is 
imposing on them. Our young people are smart and creative. 
They are like their parents, hard working and dedicated. They 
want the opportunity to contribute to society. We have made it 
our mission to help them reach that goal.
<P>
	In conclusion, I must say I am very pleased with the budget, 
primarily because it is fair but also because it reflects our 
commitment to including all Canadians in the economic and 
social life of this country. If philosophical and ethical 
considerations do not move people, then common sense 
considerations should. In an increasingly complex and 
competitive world societies which do not tap into the talents of 
all their citizens are societies which sooner or later will lose.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Before I give the floor to the hon. 
member for Louis-Hébert, perhaps the hon. minister would 
permit me to point out a couple of things.
<P>
	One is if she would please address her remarks to the Chair. 
Again, to other members as well, please do not address other 
members by their names, particularly their first names.
<P>
	A more important point if the hon. minister would allow me to 
make it, the Speaker neither agrees nor disagrees with anything 
that is said. The minister indicated I was in favour of something. 
I am in favour of everything that is said in this House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
carefully to the Secretary of State for Multiculturalism and the 
Status of Women. At first, I admit that I was eager to hear her, 
because she said ``we have adopted a series of concrete 
measures'' and I thought that this morning we would find out 
some wonderful things that we did not yet know.
<P>
	Now I must admit that it was just a list of good intentions. It is 
a statement of principles that may possibly be good for the status 
of women, but there is very little specific in it. I will give some 
examples. When she talks about infrastructure, the Secretary of 
State wants women to present projects related to environmental 
safety, as well as projects that could increase the number of day 
care spaces. But having seen the infrastructure projects that will 
be put forward in my area, we know very well that the projects 
she is talking about will have lower priority, so there is little 
hope for them.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	She also mentioned that women earn only 72 cents for every 
dollar men earn. I do not doubt it. What we would be entitled to 
expect is specific legislation and measures requiring businesses 
to correct that situation, but basically, we have nothing concrete 
there either.
<P>
	I want banks to be more sensitive to small business from now 
on, but that is still part of projects that have yielded nothing so 
far.
<P>
	She concludes by saying that we will create day-care spaces 
when the debt is no more than 3 per cent of gross domestic 
product, so parents who need child care will still have to wait 
and the government will not grant their request any time soon.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Finestone:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. 
member for his question. Before answering, I must say that I 
appreciate and understand your neutrality. In my enthusiasm, 
when reflecting on the role played by my colleague for 
Broadview-Greenwood, I used his first name in a friendly way. 
I am sorry and I apologize for doing so. As you know, we 
sometimes get into heated arguments in this House, and I think 
that we all understand what happened.
<P>
	As for my colleague's comments, I believe that the budget is 
very well balanced. Based on what we read in the newspapers, I 
think that all issues relating to the debt and all efforts made to 
create jobs so that Canadians feel useful were put in balance. Let 
us not forget that when we started developing our vision and our 
program, the debt was already at $32.6 billion. And when we 
took office, we discovered that it had grown to $45 or $46 
billion. Consequently, we had to make some adjustments. Yet 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1893"> 1893 </A></B>
<P>
we still found ways to ensure that the basic commitments would 
be taken into account and be fulfilled. We, the Liberal Party, 
stick to our word.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In these very difficult and trying economic times our Minister 
of Finance and all our other ministers found mechanisms to be 
creative, to be forward looking to answer some of the serious 
problems facing our society given the economic situation in 
which we find ourselves.
<P>
	We have not been able to fulfil every commitment at this 
moment. The financial commitments in our policy book have 
been fulfilled, but there are others and time will tell. 
Consultations will take place. I hope members will participate 
and share with us some of the more creative ideas they may 
have.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, I found the 
speech given by the hon. member very interesting.
<P>
	At one point during her speech, the hon. member mentioned 
the people in the gallery and said how we were discussing the 
future for the young people of this country. I definitely agree.
<P>
	Did the hon. member ever ask her children and her 
grandchildren or the young people in this gallery whether they 
wanted another $34 billion to $37 billion added to the mortgage 
for their future? This bill we are discussing today could add $37 
billion to their debt load. How is the member going to explain to 
her children and her grandchildren that she supported 
mortgaging their future?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Finestone:</B> Mr. Speaker, my grandchildren are a little 
too young, but my children are all in economic portfolios. The 
feedback I get from them and their circle of friends in all their 
different spheres of activity is quite fascinating.
<P>
<B>(1200 ) </B>
<P>
	They do not hold back on the criticisms that they would 
launch, nor the gun that they would shoot in the sense that 
mother does not know everything, which is true, I do not. When 
they looked at the budget their feedback to me from their 
colleagues, from the businesses in which they are involved, 
from the services in which they are engaged daily was 
absolutely amazing.
<P>
	They tell me that whole attitude is holding. They think we 
have taken a grip and we are moving in the right direction, and 
they were not interested in having this whole country go into a 
tilt and a dizzy downward economic crisis because you want to 
reach a certain fantastic little figure in your head. You have to 
have some compassion, some understanding of where the future 
is. It takes money to make money, just remember that.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Would the hon. minister please not use 
the word ``you'' in this House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
also appreciated what the minister responsible for the status of 
women had to say. But I also did not quite understand what the 
government means to do to improve the status of women in 
Canada. It is a well-known fact that women are disadvantaged in 
many ways, that they earn less money than men and that they 
support a chunk of the social and economic burden in this 
country. However, the minister had nothing concrete to offer, no 
initiative directly focusing on women.
<P>
	The minister did mention changes in the unemployment 
insurance area. But these changes do not necessarily affect 
women. In fact, they hurt the unemployed.
<P>
	The minister mentioned that 30 per cent of small businesses 
are controlled by women, as it should obviously be. Still, there 
are not a lot of women in that field. The system generally hurts 
women. What did the minister responsible for the status of 
women have to offer to change that? What concrete measures 
can be found in the budget which specifically focus on women?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Finestone:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question, because it raise a very important issue. We have a 
comprehensive vision, and I wish the hon. member could 
understand that. Our vision involves several objectives on 
which we have to work. We cannot work on only one objective at 
a time.
<P>
	As far as the small businesses are concerned, you can laugh all 
you want and you may not be proud of the fact that 30 per cent of 
small businesses are headed by a woman, but I am. Even if these 
women do not have access to all the capital they need, they do 
represent a very important proportion of business owners.
<P>
	Second, in order to help our young people, men and women 
alike, we must make sure that there will be a bridging system.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A bridging system between education and the workforce 
would equally handle men and women leaving the universities 
and the campuses. It says right in our red book, which I suggest 
the member read, and in the budget that there is a very important 
undertaking in which it will be equal and interesting for women 
as well as men.
<P>
	There is another whole area in which we see the 
disenchantment of young people. We are undertaking a youth 
initiatives program. I sincerely hope that those school dropouts, 
along with the literacy programs, will ensure that Canada as we 
move into the telecommunications age, as we have already 
moved into the telecommunications age, will have the best 
trained, the best intellectual material out there and the most 
competent workforce so that we can stay number one.
<P>

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Time for questions and comments has 
now expired. Resuming debate, with the Official Opposition. 
Bloc Quebecois members may wish to share their speaking time. 
The Chair recognizes the hon. member for La Prairie.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie):</B> Mr. Speaker, the next 
speakers for the Bloc Quebecois will each take 10 minutes.
<P>
	This budget contains a number of desirable initiatives that 
have been described in great detail by government members. 
According to the Bloc Quebecois, however, these measures 
remain incidental. There is no comprehensive plan with specific 
objectives, no global vision providing a medium-term 
perspective and supported by strong measures to put public 
finances on a sound footing, make drastic cuts in the 
government's operating expenditures and improve the 
employment situation.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	During four prebudget seminars, the minister consulted his 
socioeconomic partners as they had never been consulted 
before. I think we all remember that. The minister had mobilised 
his partners. The public was prepared to tighten its belt, 
provided the cutbacks were fair and would require all taxpayers 
to do their fair share, all of course, to help reduce the public 
debt.
<P>
	Still in the initial months of its mandate, the so-called 
honeymoon period, the Liberal government had a unique 
opportunity to send out the right signals and change the course 
of Canada's public finances. However, consulting is one thing 
but making difficult decisions is another thing altogether. 
Instead of changing course, as all Canadian taxpayers expected 
the government to do, what happened? We expected leadership, 
a change from 20 years of letting public finances slide in this 
country, a process that started under Pierre Trudeau's Liberal 
government, as you will probably remember.
<P>
	I think the government should look at what is being done by 
Premier Klein of Alberta, who is of course too far to the right for 
the present Liberal team. Nevertheless, by cutting where he has 
no other option, Mr. Klein will eliminate Alberta's deficit in 
three years, and in the future, this may be the only Canadian 
province that can maintain an adequate social safety net, all 
because the inevitable cutbacks were done at the right time and 
not under pressure from international lenders who, one day, will 
force the federal government to make these choices.
<P>
	According to us, the deficit reduction forecast in the budget 
brought down by the Minister of Finance is far too timid. The 
deficit for 1993-94 was artificially inflated to $45 billion, but 
according to us, this legacy from the Conservatives should be 
more like $42 billion. The forecast deficit of $39.7 billion for 
1994-95, just under the $40 billion mark, is based on an 
expected $9 billion increase in tax revenue. If this increase does 
not materialize, the deficit for that year will be $46.9 billion. We 
see the same scenario applied to the projected deficit for 
1995-96.
<P>
	The Department of Finance expects the 1995-96 deficit to be 
$32.7 billion. This would require an increase in tax revenues of 
$8.1 billion-another increase for the second consecutive year. 
The government hopes to bring the deficit down to $32.7 billion 
by March 31, 1996. To do so, it is projecting a total increase of 
more than $17 billion in tax revenues over the next 24 months. 
However, it has yet to deal with the problem of smuggling and 
the underground economy, most tax shelters have been 
maintained and taxpayers' ability to pay has already been 
stretched to the limit.
<P>
	The adjustment of Canadian companies to the new global 
economy, with all the industrial restructuring and manpower 
adjustment that involves, is not yet complete. There is also the 
much needed conversion of military infrastructures to viable 
civilian projects, but instead, the government has decided to 
close or downsize a number of military bases in this country.
<P>
	At a time when rapid change is making new directions 
mandatory and a new economy is emerging that will impose 
certain costs before it can be viable, can we expect a real 
increase in tax revenues as projected by the government? The 
government's projection is based on a 15 per cent increase in tax 
revenues over the next two years, in the uncertain climate we 
have just described.
<P>
	The deficit will not go down. It will not reach 3 per cent of 
GNP by the end of this government's mandate. It is clear the 
government has missed the boat. Like Tory ministers Wilson 
and Mazankowski, the government is depending on a putative 
increase in tax revenue to deal with the deficit, while the only 
way to reduce the deficit in the short term and eliminate it in the 
medium term is to make drastic cuts in government spending.
<P>
	The revenue forecasts are unrealistic, and even if they prove 
to be true, the federal government's net debt would still be $511 
billion by March 31 this year, it would go up to $551 billion by 
March 31 next year and would reach $583 billion by March 31, 
1996.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	The government has failed completely in its much-awaited 
initiative to reduce its own operating expenses. Imagine, 
trimming $413 million from a program budget of $122.6 billion 
for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1895"> 1895 </A></B>
<P>
1994-95. This represents a reduction of roughly one-third of 1 
per cent. The government has failed to make the kinds of deep  
budget cuts demanded by taxpayers during the last election 
campaign.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance tells us that he has begun to put in 
place the principal components of a plan which should reduce 
the deficit to 3 per cent of GDP by the end of this legislature. 
Cutting operating expenditures by one-third of 1 per cent cannot 
be viewed as a serious deficit reduction effort.
<P>
	The government will never meet its target. It has pulled the 
wool over the voters' eyes. Departmental operating budgets will 
be trimmed by $1.6 billion over three years, while 
unemployment insurance and social security transfer payments 
to the provinces will be reduced unilaterally by $7.5 billion over 
the same period.
<P>
	Quebec, which has its considerable share of unemployed, will 
be especially hard hit. Is this what is meant by viable 
federalism? Having failed to clean up its own house, the federal 
government will demand from the unemployed and the least 
privileged an effort nearly five times greater than that which it 
will be asking of its five federal departments.
<P>
	In conclusion, this budget does not solve anything. It does 
nothing to ease the tax burden of middle-class families who 
clearly could have boosted the level of consumption. The budget 
also fails to deal with the problem of administrative laxity 
repeatedly criticized by the Auditor General. Once again, in 
moving to broaden the tax base, the government has ignored 
family trusts and the idea of a minimum corporate tax. The 
problem of administrative overlap and disagreements between 
Ottawa and the provinces will be fuelled when Ottawa sits down 
at the bargaining table with $800 million to invest unilaterally in 
occupational training.
<P>
	This budget only postpones the hard choices. They will be that 
much harder to make and the provinces will have an even 
heavier burden to bear, whereas the federal government will be 
shifting responsibilities onto these same provinces' shoulders 
without transferring to them the relevant tax fields. The entire 
tax base will be barely adequate enough to support the federal 
debt which has grown to prohibitive proportions.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to suggest to the 
member that the single biggest factor that could contribute to the 
government's reaching its revenue targets is the member's 
ceasing his campaign of trying to separate Quebec from the rest 
of this country.
<P>
	I listened carefully to the member's remarks. I believe the 
pressure that we are receiving from international borrowers 
right now has to be affected by the talk of separation that goes on 
in this country.
<P>
	Every economist in the world would agree that confidence is 
the most important factor in any economic equation. We must 
have confidence in the community, confidence in the country. 
When people look at our cities, I suggest right now especially 
the city of Montreal, the province of Quebec, there has to be a 
nervousness when members here talk about separation.
<P>
	I would like to ask a very simple question of the member. 
Does he agree that the talk about separation is the most 
damaging factor in putting confidence back into the economy of 
this country?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bélisle:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question. I would like to tell him that in 1984, the Conservative 
Party of Canada was elected in Ottawa.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	In 1985, the Liberal Party was elected in Quebec, and I can tell 
you that there has never been more constitutional stability than 
during those years from 1984 to 1993. As the then Conservative 
Prime Minister used to say, the reason Quebecers had supported 
his party in 1984 was to give a last chance to federalism in 
Quebec and, in his own words, bring Quebec back into the 
Canadian Confederation with honour and enthusiasm.
<P>
	A period that I would describe as a calm spell in terms of 
constitutional matters followed the election of the Bourassa 
Liberal government in 1985. Mr. Bourassa and the Conservative 
Prime Minister got along very well. Those were truly calm times 
with regard to the Constitution, but the federal debt grew from 
$200 to $500 billion just the same from 1984 to 1993. In fact, the 
federal debt more than doubled over that period.
<P>
	I think that those were the calmest times. Then, as you will 
recall, we had the referendum on the Charlottetown Accord in 
October 1992, and for Quebecers and Canadians in general, this 
was a really calm spell. Yet, the federal debt never grew so much 
as during those years.
<P>
	I think that the point the hon. member made about the effect 
talk about Quebec's separation could have on investors and 
interest rates is really-today, interests and confidence come 
into play much more at the global or North American level. It 
has nothing to do with the people of Quebec expressing a 
preference for the Bloc Quebecois or another party or opting for 
sovereignty in a referendum. I think that, in the medium term, 
this will have very little influence on the economic situation.
<P>
	There may be some short-term effects, but in the medium or 
long term, I do not think that it will do much.
<P>
	We have had a nine-year or so calm spell, both in Quebec and 
in Canada. Yet, never has the federal government debt increased 
so much.
<P>

<HR>
<B><A NAME="1896"> 1896 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am also 
pleased to speak on this motion concerning a ways and means 
bill, which deals with the government's budget intentions as 
well.
<P>
	Of course, I will take the same position as the previous 
speaker and say how disappointed my constituents and I are with 
the budget.
<P>
	This morning, I watched the Liberals enter the House and I 
understand why their heads hang low. I understand their 
disappointment. They have just spent a week with their 
constituents in their ridings and I suppose that they had the same 
reactions as voters in my riding. They probably said, ``What 
kind of budget is that?''
<P>
	Yesterday, I met a doctor, who said to me, ``I was expecting to 
pay, I was expecting to be taxed, but no, they did absolutely 
nothing, even though I was prepared to make an effort as long as 
it covered the deficit''.
<P>
	I also met officials from the labour movement in the Sorel 
region, including Mr. Lachapelle, who told me: ``Why did the 
government not present a budget? It presented intentions''.
<P>
	The Conservatives were always consulting and you push 
consultation to an extreme. That is what people in my riding told 
me.
<P>
	Some thirty committees will be formed to consult, but 
throughout the election campaign, they went around with the red 
book saying, ``We have a solution for everything. Elect us and 
you will see us present a budget with the government's 
intentions for each department''. But no. They tell us: We will 
consult you, we will go off on consultations again and consult 
the same people who were consulted before the red book was 
prepared.
<P>
	Now they do not have the courage to react. They are falling 
into the same problem as the Conservatives, presenting the same 
kind of budget as Mr. Mazankowski or Mr. Wilson, with 
economic forecasts of 2.5, 3.5 and 4.2. The Conservatives did 
the same thing. They made overly optimistic budget forecasts 
and, as the previous speaker said, we will wind up with a budget 
deficit of $46 to $48 billion, just as the Conservatives were 
doing.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	Those words are full of promises and consultations, but 
contain nothing concrete. Worse-and that, hon. minister, is 
unacceptable-is the fact that a quarter of the $4 billion in cuts 
are made on the backs of the unemployed, who are not lazy. 
When former minister Valcourt attacked the unemployed, he at 
least announced his intention to go after those who take 
advantage of the system. At that time, the Liberal members 
opposite, led by the Deputy Prime Minister, rose to express their 
indignation. But what have we here? A regular attack against 
honest people who have lost their jobs.
<P>
	It is not true that, when a plant closes, these people choose to 
go on unemployment. According to the minister, the 
government's intention is to encourage people to stay in their 
jobs for longer periods by reducing the number of weeks of 
benefits. People are told to expect 30 or 20 weeks of benefits 
instead of 40, maybe 35 if they work for 50 weeks. They reduce 
the number of weeks while telling people this will encourage 
them to keep their jobs. These people do not go on 
unemployment by choice but because of the recession, because 
of plant closures. It is unemployment, not the social fabric that 
must be tackled.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, we are witnessing not a cut but an increase in 
expenditures and revenues due to a wider tax base. What a nice 
new thing to say, ``We will increase taxes in other sectors, just 
like the Tories did''. We hope-like the previous speaker 
said-for Canada's salvation. We are told it will come from 
external demand, from our exports. But they refuse to change 
the system. As I was saying earlier, with these hopes, we will 
end up with a $46 billion to $48 billion deficit. One year lost.
<P>
	But I understood when they talked about the red book, 
because the Liberals are expert at using words with a double 
meaning. Remember Trudeau when he fought against Stanfield 
over price and wage control. He said, ``Never!'' Six months 
after coming to office, he implemented Stanfield's very policy. 
Remember when the Liberals talked about the just society. I 
remember my father shopping for shoes; when the salesman 
asked him how they fit, he replied that they were a little tight or 
``juste'' in old French slang. It is like the just society they were 
talking about. We thought they meant a just society in social 
terms. But they just meant ``tight''. That is their vocabulary. 
Today they talk about the red book. I thought it was named after 
the party with the red logo. But no, it is because they want to 
write Canada's economic history in red. However, our financial 
book should be written in black. Then I would understand.
<P>
	They tell us they will be good managers, good administrators. 
I remember that, after going to see my 92-year-old aunt Laura 
on her deathbed, my father told me, with tears in his eyes, ``Son, 
we need a priest to administer the last rites''. They use the word 
``administer'' in the same sense, to administer the last rites. 
They want to bury-but we are used to their language. They can 
remove their masks now that we have recognized them.
<P>
	I can see the disappointment on your faces because you are 
back from a week of consultations in your constituencies which 
was extremely disappointing for you. Yet, when you first arrived 
here in January, you proudly said that votes would now be 
different. Indeed, you were going to comply with the good 
intention and resolution of the Prime Minister and vote 
according to your conscience. The time has come to do so. The 
vote will take place in the next few days, so now is the time to  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1897"> 1897 </A></B>
<P>
express yourself, to represent your constituents the way you said 
you would during the first week of the session.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, this budget does not respect at all the 
commitments made during the election campaign. Contrary to 
what the red book said, there is no incentive for small 
businesses, there is an increase of the tax burden, there is no job 
creation initiative, no employment strategy and no help to 
exports, but there are cuts to regional development. This budget 
is a disappointment and does not satisfy anyone in my riding nor, 
for that matter, in the whole of Quebec. This is a budget which 
takes deadly aim at the unemployed, the elderly, the regions, 
and, which is even worse, at the have-nots, the low-income 
workers, and particularly the jobless. At the same time, the 
minister's friends, who are millionaires like he is with a fortune 
estimated at $40 million, will not suffer at all. At the same time 
too, the Prime Minister attends banquets at $200, $300, $400 or 
$500 a head. He says to his friends: ``See how good we are to you 
because you financed our party. We acknowledge that and the 
budget does not adversely affect you. We go after the 
unemployed, the have-nots, the elderly, but you the wealthy 
with family trusts and money hidden in tax shelters, we protect 
you''. The Prime Minister then gets an ovation from his business 
friends and forgets about Canadians in general.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	However, all of you ordinary members of Parliament who 
were elected by Canadians should tell the minister that you have 
uncovered his ploy.
<P>
	We thought the minister would give the example and deliver a 
budget to eliminate waste, but it does not even propose solutions 
to the unemployment problem. Instead, the government targets 
the middle class as well as seasonal workers and forgets about 
family trusts.
<P>
	What are some of the measures which could have been taken 
in this budget? Let me give you examples of cuts. Former 
minister Séguin in Quebec said this: ``The decision not to give 
$1.2 billion to Gulf is a conflict triggered by the interpretation 
of the definition of petroleum development revenue and it could 
have been avoided by simply amending the act''. How was the 
government able to think and decide to eliminate the helicopter 
contract in Quebec yet not do so in the case of Hibernia? Why 
was there no in-depth review of the construction of a fixed link 
between Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick? Why did we 
not make an in-depth review of tax havens, foreign affiliates 
which cost us $25 billion, the reduction of the government 
capital expenditures, cuts to non-restrictive grants provided to 
major corporations which total almost $18 billion, the reduction 
of the government vehicle fleet, the application of the GST on 
listed shares, which are all recommendations made by the 
Auditor? We could have cut $5 billion right there.
<P>
	Because of a flawed resource allowance income tax provision, 
the government lost $1.2 billion, as was also mentioned in the 
report. That is all I will say on this issue. I could give you many 
other examples where we could have cut, but the lack of a rigid 
process to analyse government spendings is quite obvious. The 
federal system is completely out of whack and the government is 
unable to manage it. Instead, it is launching new programs and 
increasing the tax burden by more than $18 billion for the next 
two years.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Hamilton West):</B> Mr. Speaker, if I have 
learned anything in the last 100 days from the party opposite, 
Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition, it is that we certainly have to 
ignore much to get on with something. That is something we 
have learned over the last 100 days from that party.
<P>
	That member has the nerve to accuse this government and this 
party of saying one thing and getting on with something else. 
That member over there is the chameleon of chameleons. He can 
certainly talk about Progressive Conservative ideas. He sat in 
this House and got elected as a Conservative, did he not? Then in 
chameleon-like fashion, for some cause he moved from this side 
of the House to sit on that side in the back row. Then he went on 
to fight an election not for Canada and not to represent his 
province in this great country of ours, no. He got elected in this 
country to promote what? To separate his province from the rest 
of Canada. That is what he wants to do. That is the agenda of the 
member opposite. He has nothing to add to this budget.
<P>
	To quote the member opposite, he says it is a budget that 
disappoints everyone, that satisfies no one. Obviously the 
member does not keep in touch with constituencies outside his 
own.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	There was a multitude of comment made following the budget 
like: ``Canadians still show a high support for the federal 
Liberals even after a budget that tightened restrictions on 
unemployment insurance and closed military bases across the 
country''. Before February 28 the following comment was 
made: ``Nearly six in ten adult Canadians surveyed by the 
pollster Angus Reid last Tuesday through Thursday said they 
preferred the Liberals, a 17 point increase over the party's share 
of the vote in the October election''. Imagine that.
<P>
	This is the period for questions or comments and those are my 
comments. Even in Atlantic Canada where the budget cut the 
deepest, as the member pointed out, Liberals have the support of 
65 per cent of decided respondents. That is quite amazing. We 
just do not know where the member is coming from.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1898"> 1898 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> Mr. Speaker, after this budget, I would 
worry about the next opinion polls. If they want to talk about the 
fact that I was a Conservative, we will talk about it. And I may 
remind you that the hon. member in the Chair today, who is a 
member of your party, was a member of the Conservative Party 
when I was. However, he had the guts to leave. He was just a 
backbencher, but when the GST came out, with some of its 
applications, he crossed the floor.
<P>
	I may remind you that when I was a Conservative, I voted 
against my government on a number of occasions. I voted 
against Bill C-22, which went against the interests of Quebec 
farmers. I walked the picket line with postal workers when my 
government wanted to pass legislation against the postal 
workers and letter carriers. I often voted against my 
government, and when that government intended to go back on 
the promises I made to my constituents, I had the guts to cross 
the floor.
<P>
	Would you? You just went back on your own promises. Would 
you have the guts to vote no and cross the floor to say: I will no 
longer sit with this government? Yes, I was a Conservative. Yes, 
I am proud I left and had the guts to do it. I wonder if you would.
<P>
	A government that attacks the unemployed the way you are 
doing, with $4 billion in cutbacks, including $1 billion at the 
expense of the unemployed-not cheaters but <I>bona fide</I> 
unemployed workers, as I said earlier-is hypocritically passing 
the buck to the provinces. Shortening the unemployment period 
by several weeks will put people who are no longer eligible for 
unemployment insurance benefits on welfare and will cost 
Quebec $280 million annually. In the rest of Canada, this will 
cost about $600 million.
<P>
	This comes after the government made a formal commitment 
to conduct full public consultations on social services before 
making a decision. And yet, the strategy of the ministers of 
finance seems to be to proceed regardless. In concluding, as I 
believe my time has expired, I would say that giving this 
minister of finance responsibility for the finances of Quebec and 
Canada is worse than letting Dracula run the Red Cross Blood 
Bank.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Murray Calder 
(Wellington-Grey-Dufferin-Simcoe):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome the opportunity to speak today on Bill C-14, an act to 
provide borrowing authority for the government for the 
upcoming fiscal year.
<P>
	The borrowing authority is based on the financial 
requirements set out in the budget delivered by the Minister of 
Finance last Tuesday. The critics have been unfair and often 
contradictory in their assessment of the bill. Criticism is easy. 
Hard work and tough choices are not.
<P>
	The budget presented Canadians both with a vision and a 
balanced approach to deal with our financial problems. This 
balanced approach of deficit reduction, economic renewal and 
social reforms contains all elements of the government's top 
priorities: jobs and growth.
<P>
	I would like to discuss deficit reduction. During prebudget 
consultations Canadians told the government that the deficit 
should be reduced by cuts to spending, not by increasing or 
introducing new taxes. There are no new taxes in the budget. 
Clearly the budget signals the end to tax and spend government.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	Over the next three years more than $3 billion will be cut in 
government operational spendings over and above the cuts of 
the 1993 budget. The salary freeze for public servants will be 
extended for two years and applies to all politicians. Budgets for 
ministers' offices have been reduced by $13 million annually. 
There will also be a review of every government appointed 
agency, board and commission.
<P>
	There have been cuts to all areas but defence has received 
some of the most intense scrutiny and criticism. There are those 
who have tried to turn these closures into a regional or a 
language issue or use them to support their own agenda. This is 
truly unfortunate. We all have to share the pain. In my riding the 
closing of the Angus depot will have implications for future rail 
service to the area and for the local economy. Everyone is 
calling for spending cuts as long as they do not affect them. We 
must all share in the difficult decisions.
<P>
	The budget has employed other measures to reduce the 
deficit. Subsidies to businesses have been cut in excess of $225 
million as set out in the red book. Also numerous tax loopholes 
have been closed which will target incentives better and bring 
greater fairness to the tax system.
<P>
	As part of the government's balanced approach focus has been 
given to economic renewal. The Canada infrastructure works 
program has received considerable attention. In my riding of 
Wellington-Grey-Dufferin-Simcoe there are over 30 
municipalities including county governments. Critics of the 
infrastructure program say that the municipal governments 
cannot afford the program. I find it strange, with all the 
municipalities in my riding, that none have indicated a plan to 
take less than full advantage of the opportunity provided to 
them.
<P>
	Why should they not? Thirty-three cent dollars are better than 
any other arrangement they have been able to work out with a 
senior level government. The infrastructure program is one of 
the first concrete examples we have seen in many years of a 
recognition of federal government responsibility to lower tier 
governments. In many municipalities economic recovery cannot 
begin without upgrades to the infrastructure. In my riding, for 
instance, the town of Mount Forest where  I live cannot issue any 
further building permits; no new houses or industries can be 
constructed without upgrades to the municipality's sanitary 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1899"> 1899 </A></B>
<P>
sewer system. The spinoff effects of this program are twofold: 
first, the construction jobs created by the building of the 
improved sewer facility and, second, the jobs that will be 
generated by the subsequent growth that can now take place.
<P>
	A number of other initiatives will lead the economic growth: a 
rollback of the unemployment insurance premium rate to the 
1993 level for 1995 and 1996, saving businesses $300 million a 
year that can be reinvested in new jobs; a Canadian technology 
network to help small businesses gain access to new 
technologies; making the homeowner's plan permanent; and 
allowing first time home buyers to use RRSPs to buy homes.
<P>
	One of the most important initiatives is the improvements 
being made for access to capital, specifically a Canadian 
investment fund to provide venture capital for innovative 
companies, and specific plans to work with banks to establish a 
code of conduct for small business lending, allowing 
entrepreneurs a recourse for unfair rejections of their 
applications.
<P>
	I wish to turn to the third component of the budget, reforming 
Canada's social programs. Many of Canada's social programs 
such as unemployment insurance and welfare were created 
decades ago and no longer meet today's needs. The primary 
objective is to ensure the programs are reoriented toward 
helping Canadians enter the workforce and away from 
dependency. We have already seen some experiments aimed at 
revitalizing our social programs taking place in the provinces.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	The government will provide $800 million to test innovative 
reform proposals to help give unemployed Canadians the 
practical skills they need for real long term jobs. The method the 
government plans to use to revitalize these programs will be the 
same as for prebudget consultations: open. The government is 
making the review process a co-operative one, ensuring input 
from all provinces and from all stakeholders.
<P>
	The three components of deficit reduction, economic growth 
and social reform are the components of the balanced approach 
taken by the government. The steps introduced are the 
foundation upon which we can build to ensure jobs and growth 
in the Canadian economy.
<P>
	I am under no illusion that despite the initiatives taken by the 
government we are still faced with certain realities. The bill 
before the House is indicative of the problems we are facing. 
The bill contains the basic principles of a borrowing bill: 
authority to cover financial requirements for the 1994-95 fiscal 
year and a contingency reserve. In total the government is 
requesting the authority to borrow a sum of $34.3 billion. This 
figure is part of the government's realistic approach to deficit 
reduction. The deficit will be reduced from the current $45.7 
billion to $39.7 billion in the 1994-95 year and $32.7 billion the 
year after that.
<P>
	The measures in the budget set us on a clear path to achieve 
our interim deficit target of 3 per cent of the GDP within three 
years. The budget delivers on many of the promises set out in the 
red book. It has laid the foundation to deliver on more. I ask 
members of the House to support the bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate you on your appointment as Deputy Speaker of the 
House. The understanding and welcome I have received from 
you and your staff has made my introduction to the House a 
pleasant transition, and for this I am truly grateful.
<P>
	It is with honour and a great deal of humility that I make my 
maiden speech on such an important issue as the budget, an 
economic plan for Canada laid before us by the Minister of 
Finance, a plan that is the culmination of extensive 
consultations and input from all sectors. That is the main reason 
I stand to express my support for the budget.
<P>
	I thank the residents of Scarborough Centre for entrusting me 
with their vote. I pledge to do my best to represent them and be 
their voice in Ottawa. They can be assured that the 
overwhelming mandate of October 25 will not be taken for 
granted.
<P>
	One does not arrive here simply by being a candidate. It 
requires a tremendous amount of hard work and commitment. 
Please let me use this opportunity to acknowledge and thank all 
the volunteers who believed in me and worked tirelessly on my 
behalf during the campaign. They believed in our agenda. They 
believed in our party. They believed in our program as outlined 
in the now famous red book ``Creating Opportunity''. They 
believed that with its implementation our country would be put 
back on the road to recovery.
<P>
	I also acknowledge my predecessor, Pauline Browes, who 
served Scarborough Centre well during the 33rd and 34th 
Parliaments.
<P>
<B>(1245 ) </B>
<P>
	The United Nations has designated 1994 as the Year of the 
Family and it is with great pride that I acknowledge my family 
and thank my wife Mary, my daughter Irene, my sons Paul and 
Daniel and the rest of my family for the encouragement and the 
tremendous support they have given me and continue to give.
<P>
	I would like to pay special tribute to my parents who instilled 
in me family values, the values of citizenship and hard work and 
who always urged me to strive for my dreams. My father arrived 
on these friendly shores as a young man with an innocence and a 
desire to work hard and diligently to make a good life for his 
family. I will always remember the story of what he asked for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1900"> 1900 </A></B>
<P>
when looking for work, not how much the job paid but if there 
was work.
<P>
	Like many other ridings, Scarborough Centre encompasses 
people from many different backgrounds and is reflective of the 
reality of Canada, a reality that has brought people from all 
around the world and retained the best of their culture and 
heritage. Added to the Canadian experience, it strengthens and 
enriches us as a nation and makes us all proud to say that we are 
Canadian.
<P>
	The city of Scarborough derived its name from the diary of the 
wife of Lieutenant-Governor John Graves Simcoe. It was 
settled by Europeans in the late 1700s. In fact, one of the first 
homesteads in Scarborough is located in Scarborough Centre 
and a local collegiate is named for those first settlers, David and 
Mary Thomson.
<P>
	Prior to that, the First Nations often settled in Scarborough 
and there are recorded village settlements dating back to the 
year 1000 AD. On the edge of my riding is a native burial site 
uncovered in August 1956 during the building of a housing 
subdivision. That site has been dated to 1250 AD. The motto of 
Scarborough is: ``The city of the future'', and that is what this 
debate is all about, the future.
<P>
	This bill has been a source of considerable discussion in 
Scarborough Centre. My constituents have great hopes for this 
government and believe that we are the best vehicle if Canada is 
ever to rediscover that which has made this country great.
<P>
	A government budget is not just a report on the financial 
status of a country. It defines the path to achieve change.
<P>
	The riding of Scarborough Centre has been hard hit during the 
recession. There are empty store fronts and unoccupied plazas 
throughout my riding. The people of Scarborough Centre have 
suffered and are suffering and this budget gives them what we all 
so desperately need. It shows them the path toward renewal.
<P>
	To assist job creation the government is prepared to roll back 
unemployment insurance premiums. Payroll deductions have 
long been the most punitive burden that small businesses could 
experience. It removes incentive for job creation and economic 
growth. The proposed rollback will save businesses $300 
million.
<P>
	I campaigned on family values, on reducing crime and on 
deficit reduction, but the emphasis was on job creation as a 
result of economic stimulation. I am very happy because there 
seems to be a climate of co-operation and understanding in the 
House, a feeling of wanting to do things right.
<P>
	We put forward a recovery plan to the people of Canada which 
they overwhelmingly endorsed. The people know that we intend 
to keep our promises and commitments to them, but they also 
know that it will not happen overnight. ``Stick to the plan'', they 
have said to me, ``show us leadership''. I say, through you, Mr. 
Speaker, to the residents of Scarborough and to the rest of 
Canada that we have shown leadership and we have  kept our 
promises. We shall make decisions for the benefit of all 
Canadians.
<P>
	We cancelled the helicopter deal. We cancelled the Pearson 
airport deal. We launched the national infrastructure program. 
We reduced the size of cabinet and cut PMO and ministerial 
staff. We began the process to replace the most regressive tax 
this country has ever seen. The GST has hampered economic 
growth, job creation and is far too complex for small businesses 
to endure. These are but a few examples.
<P>
	The government will not put off for tomorrow what it can do 
today. We have charted a course to prepare our youth, the future 
of our country. We have charted a course to rebuild and 
modernize this nation so that we can be competitive and ready 
for the 21st century. Let us not be shortsighted. Japan, Germany, 
the U.S. and Ireland are all preparing and investing heavily in 
infrastructure programs and development.
<P>
	Let us not repeat the shortsightedness the North American 
auto industry showed in the past. I have spent the past 20 years 
of my professional life in the employment industry and I have 
seen firsthand the devastation of our labour force. I have seen 
companies turn a cold shoulder to loyal and dedicated 
employees for the sake of a better bottom line. This cannot 
continue.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	The government has a responsibility toward the improvement 
of the country and its people. Our country needs us now more 
than ever before. We need to tell the world that we are one united 
country. We are dealing with a global economy that changes 
every day, where trade occurs at the press of a button, where 
stability swings to instability at the utterance of a single phrase. 
During these turbulent times we must put Canada's interests 
first. We must show commitment and co-operation.
<P>
	I stated earlier that the world is watching us very closely and 
that we must not allow other countries to determine our national 
agenda. There is a tradition in our family that family differences 
are resolved and stay within the family.
<P>
	In conclusion, allow me to emphasize that the task at hand is 
to rebuild our country. We must make it once again a beacon of 
hope to its people and to the world. No one should undermine its 
stability. If anything we must show the world that we are and 
intend to be one united country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by 
congratulating my colleague from Scarborough Centre on his 
maiden address to the Parliament of Canada. I know that the 
words he delivered to Canadians today are not only words with 
this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1901"> 1901 </A></B>
<P>
member but they mirror the action that he has taken not only 
during the last four months as a member but also in his previous 
role in the community.
<P>
	I have a very specific question I would like to put to the 
member for Scarborough Centre and it has to do with an issue on 
which he campaigned vigorously during the last election. It 
concerns access to capital for small business.
<P>
	I would like the member to elaborate to the House and to the 
rest of Canada about some of the discussions I know he has had 
with me and others in our party about that particular frustration 
and what he recommends we can do to help rectify the problem.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cannis:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the 
excellent question.
<P>
	As a small businessman I must say that one of the stumbling 
blocks any small or medium sized business has today and has 
had for quite some time is access to capital, access to the right 
doors.
<P>
	In our discussions over the past several months, in meeting 
with the various representatives from the financial institutions, 
the government is not just talk and no action. We have brought 
these people down. We have specifically expressed the concerns 
we have heard from the extensive consultations that have taken 
place in our ridings.
<P>
	I spoke with Mr. George Gigis not too long ago. He sent me a 
letter indicating how he wants to expand but he needs the help of 
a financial institution. The government has taken a proactive 
approach to not just asking these institutions to co-operate. We 
have said to these institutions, no more talking. We want results. 
They are opening up the process. Male and female, they will 
have equal opportunities to access to capital so they can invest 
in modernizing and retooling and hiring staff. In this way they 
can expand their business, increase trade as trade pacts 
throughout the world are expanding and we can have our fair 
share.
<P>
	I am confident that these institutions are now starting to turn 
around. We have seen the signs. They have said directly and 
indirectly they are prepared to co-operate. They are prepared to 
lower their demands on loans and so far I am quite pleased that 
we are on track to help the small and medium sized businesses 
and with the payroll deductions as well to help them expand.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too 
extend my congratulations to the hon. member on his maiden 
speech. It is a very special moment in your political life when 
you stand before your colleagues and express yourself in that 
way. I do acknowledge that and I congratulate the hon. member.
<P>
<B>(1255 ) </B>
<P>
	I would like to give a slight preamble to my question. The 
member presented a fairly brisk overview of the initiatives in 
the budget. My assessment shows 18 new programs and 15 
program reviews will be undertaken by the Liberal government. 
This is going to lead to pressure to increase spending.
<P>
	It is incredulous to me that a realistic approach to deficit 
reduction is to borrow more money. I do not understand that kind 
of financial management. That is not how I manage at home.
<P>
	I acknowledge all the consultation but consultation is not 
analysis. Therefore my question to the member is this. What 
analysis, if any, of the impact of the budget on sustainable job 
creation has been undertaken by the government?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cannis:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am puzzled. They indicated we 
have not cut enough. Last week one member from the Reform 
Party bombarded this side stating that we did not do enough. The 
critic for defence got up and congratulated the government on 
how it cut so deeply but that it did too much. I am really 
confused.
<P>
	I have a simple philosophy: we must invest a dollar to make a 
dollar. The government has not increased taxes and this is the 
good news I bring to Scarborough Centre. We have taken from 
other sources to invest in our economy. We know there have 
been no tax increases. It is spelled out in the budget. We have 
taken resources from other areas to invest in programs.
<P>
	For example, the infrastructure program is one that all the 
municipalities have embraced warmly. We know that the jobs 
are coming but it just does not happen in 100 days. This program 
is a two-tier program as well. Therefore a phase of it will unfold 
as each day goes by.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Time has expired. Perhaps the member 
would indicate, when he starts, if he is going to share his time 
with the member for North Vancouver.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yes it is the intention of the Reform Party to share time during 
this debate.
<P>
	Given the financial situation facing our country today, it is not 
appropriate for anyone in the House to use the debt crisis for 
partisan political purposes. We should really be taking a much 
more bipartisan view of this whole thing and saying that if we 
were being attacked by a third party, what we would we do as a 
nation. How would we respond if, rather than the incredible debt 
we have facing us, it was a third country. What would we do? 
Would we run off into our separate little factions and think that 
we each have the best idea? Or would we come together and say 
that we have a genuine problem here, folks? How would we go 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1902"> 1902 </A></B>
<P>
about solving it? That is the approach Parliament has to take. 
That is the vision many Canadians have of the 35th Parliament.
<P>
	If we are going to cut into corners of partisan bickering over 
questions which impact the country, whether we are members of 
a federalist group or members who have the intention of taking 
Quebec out of Canada, we have a common problem. If we 
approach this problem from the perspective of not in my 
backyard, the nimby process, we will never achieve it.
<P>
	If I see a disappointment in this Parliament, it is that the 
representatives of the Bloc never seem to look at Canada as a 
whole. Whether it likes it or not, it is part of Canada. The Bloc 
and Quebec are part of Canada today. If that changes in the 
future, which I hope it does not, we will deal with it in the future.
<P>
	However today we have a common problem, the incredible 
debt we have facing us as a nation. We cannot look at every line 
and say we were not treated fairly and moan and bitch and cry 
about it. We have to look at the nation's problems as a whole.
<P>
	The government did two things right in the budget presented 
the other day. The first is the defence cuts. This was a difficult 
project for the Liberals as many of the cuts were in Liberal 
country. They are cuts which should have been made long ago 
and are now finally being done. All parts of the country suffered 
from the defence cuts, including Quebec but to a lesser degree 
than other parts.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	Another good move in the budget was the planned cuts to UI 
payroll taxes. It might have been a far better move not to put the 
tax on payrolls in the first place. In any event, the government 
has seen the folly of increasing payroll taxes which is really a 
tax on jobs and does nothing to create employment.
<P>
	There is no doubt our country is at risk because of our chronic 
overspending. I am sure everyone in this House agrees our 
generation is living beyond its means. It has been doing so for 
the last 20 years and is doing so at the expense of future 
generations. What can we do about it? We can deal with the 
problem as it is and not as we would wish it to be. We have to be 
honest about it.
<P>
	In this budget the Minister of Finance talked about removing 
$5 of spending for every $1 of increased revenue. When you 
front end load spending so that it is not recurring spending and 
then say it is being taken out of the budget thus reducing 
spending, that really is a smoke and mirrors trick. All that does 
is feed the already existing cynicism in Canada toward all 
government institutions. We have to be honest about things and 
deal with them as they are. Unfortunately, the quicksand of 
wishful thinking is the reason we find ourselves in this mess in 
the first place.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier we have endured about 20 years of 
chronic overspending by governments of all stripes in this 
House and in every House across the nation. This House, this 
government and this budget are no different from us personally, 
from most businesses and most other governments when 
revenue is chronically overestimated and expenditures are 
chronically underestimated. That is the Achilles' heel of this 
budget and the one parliamentarians should be most concerned 
about.
<P>
	This budget calls for an increase in revenues of approximately 
15 per cent over the next two years. This comes after a decline in 
revenues of 5.6 per cent this year over last. At the same time the 
budget calls for an increase in expenditures of about .3 per cent. 
It is going to be particularly difficult to restrain the growth in 
spending, particularly if there is any negative change in the cost 
of money. If interest rates go up there is nothing the government 
can do about it and it will cost a fortune and will blow everything 
out of the water.
<P>
	I fear that we have déjà vu all over again. Sooner or later we 
are going to have to deal with the problem of chronic 
overspending. We are going to have to deal with the problems as 
they are and not as we would wish them to be.
<P>
	To be fair, this government has done a much better job than the 
previous government did in being realistic. However the 
government should carefully consider suggestions coming from 
this side of the House and the government side to actually start 
reducing and cutting programs.
<P>
	Put sunset clauses into programs. Rather than talking about 
reducing the increase in the amount of planned spending and 
calling that a reduction in spending, actually look at last year's 
bottom line and say that less will be spent next year. Maybe we 
should consider some sort of zero based budgeting so that all 
departments have to justify what they are doing every year, just 
like a business would have to do it.
<P>
	We must live within our means. Canadians must make the 
distinction between their wants and needs. We can afford our 
needs but we cannot afford everything we want.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	As an example the International Centre for Human Rights, 
commonly known as the Broadbent centre, has sucked up 
millions of dollars since its inception around five years ago. 
What value has that centre given or brought to Canadians that 
could not have been done by another already existing 
department, other than providing Mr. Broadbent with something 
to do?
<P>
	At the same time we have frozen the salaries of civil servants 
regardless of their income. Not all civil servants live like kings. 
Gilles Éthier is the maintenance worker who looks after my 
office in the West Block. I asked him what he thought of this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1903"> 1903 </A></B>
<P>
salary freeze. I asked him if I could raise this and talk about it in 
the House today.
<P>
	Here is a real live person whom we see every day around this 
House. He makes about $24,000 a year. Ladies and gentlemen in 
Edmonton, with the expense of living in Ottawa $24,000 a year 
is not a whole lot of money. His salary has been frozen for two 
years and will now be frozen for another two years. How is it that 
we have $22 million or thereabouts to spend on the Ed 
Broadbent centre and at the same time we freeze the income of 
people at the bottom end of the income scale?
<P>
	If Mr. Broadbent were standing right here in my shoes today 
speaking to this issue he would probably ask the same question. 
In all those years as the leader of the New Democratic Party did 
he not champion the little guy? How is it now that the little guy 
finds himself paying the salary of the big guy? No wonder so 
many Canadians are wondering who is in charge and what end is 
up. We need to do a line by line review of the actual spending in 
all departments and ask: Is or is this not necessary? If it is not 
necessary we must cut it.
<P>
	How is it that Canadians in a lower income bracket whether 
through unemployment insurance premiums or whatever end up 
subsidizing people who earn dramatically more? I am talking 
about seasonal workers who might make $50,000 in a season but 
get unemployment insurance for four or five months of the year, 
while someone working for $18,000 or $23,000 annually pays 
unemployment insurance all year long and ends up subsidizing 
the person making twice as much. These are the things our 
Parliament has to look into so that we end up having equity and 
fairness. Then people will not feel as if they are being ripped off 
by the system.
<P>
	It is time our government set goals and priorities for what we 
can afford and what we want. There must be more in it for people 
as individuals to contribute to society rather than to take from it. 
We should use this as a bottom line as the foundation of 
everything we do when we talk about income support and that 
sort of thing. We must become a people who think in terms of 
our responsibility to our country rather than our entitlements 
from the country.
<P>
	Finally for the sake of our children, let us be the Parliament 
that finally takes responsibility for our spending and finally gets 
the country on the right track. If this government fails in its 
responsibility to Canadians to be stewards of the nation, then it 
will surely reap the same bitter harvest that befell the previous 
government which also had a mandate to deal with the problem, 
but neither had the vision nor the guts to do the job.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I share the hon. member's view that 
all of us in this House of Commons have a collective 
responsibility to address the nation's debt. I do not think we 
could find a member of Parliament who would disagree with that 
objective.
<P>
	I would like to illustrate for the hon. member where we 
disagree on how to reduce that debt. The Reform Party has said 
day after day in this House of Commons that we have not made 
enough cuts in the current fiscal framework of this nation. There 
may be some areas where we could have made some more cuts 
but I would like to illustrate an example of where I think we have 
cut too much.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	It is in the tourism sector. Tourism is this country's largest 
employer. It is a $28 billion industry. The national and 
international marketing budget for Tourism Canada is only $15 
million. I personally think if we invested a couple of hundred 
million dollars and encouraged people to come here that would 
be a way of creating jobs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sure that as a nation we 
spend a whole lot more than $15 million for tourism. Perhaps we 
should be looking at how we go about spending the collective 
money. All the provinces have separate tourism budgets. The 
federal government has a separate tourism budget. Air Canada 
and Canadian have separate budgets to try to get people to use 
their airlines to come to Canada.
<P>
	The hon. member may have a point. If we get a better return on 
our investment by getting people to come to Canada, then that is 
certainly where we should be spending our money and perhaps 
we should not be spending our money supporting a business that 
would not be in business if the government was not supporting it 
financially. It is a matter of setting priorities, of where we can 
get the best bang for our buck and then sticking to it.
<P>
	Perhaps we should be spending more money encouraging 
people to vacation in Canada going from one end of the country 
to the other so we can keep some of that money in Canada. 
Perhaps if our hon. friends from the Bloc spent more time in the 
rest of Canada and we spent more time in Quebec we would not 
have this problem in communicating with one another.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
comment and a question for the hon. member concerning an 
observation he made at the start of his speech.
<P>
	He stated that the deficit and the debt crisis must transcend 
partisan political purposes and I agree with him. He 
subsequently said that we must not fall victim to the 
``not-in-my-backyard'' syndrome and that we must avoid 
saying that we do not want to be singled out for these types of 
cuts.
<P>
	I have an example for him. Consider a family with four 
children that is having financial problems and has decided to get 
a handle on its finances. Suppose that each child is involved in 
several recreational activities, but that one child participates in 
fewer activities than his  siblings. Obviously, if his or her 
activities were cut to the same extent as those of the other 
children, he or she would react. The principle that I am trying to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1904"> 1904 </A></B>
<P>
illustrate is that of fairness or equity. In addressing the deficit 
and debt problems, the government must ensure that fairness 
and justice for all prevail. That is why from time to time, one 
must react to certain cuts.
<P>
	I am referring to cuts in the military field. This explains a 
little why people often react somewhat more forcefully. Does 
the hon. member not feel that the notion of equity and justice 
must be central to the issue of getting a handle on the deficit, 
regardless of whether the objective is to raise revenues or cut 
expenditures.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker, obviously equity has to 
be the foundation upon which all these cuts are made. Not only 
should equity be the foundation but it should be leadership by 
example and leadership from this House. The reason I have 
volunteered to take a 10 per cent reduction in salary is to show 
leadership by example.
<P>
	The hon. member talks about children in the home and all 
children realizing the same impact of the cuts. We should first of 
all take into consideration that perhaps some of the children 
have gone their own way and are in a better position or are more 
financially able and capable of taking cuts than the others.
<P>
	When we look at equity we have to look at the bottom line. 
Individuals and provinces in Canada that have the resources and 
the wherewithal to pay it are going to have to pay it. That is the 
bottom line.
<P>
<B>(1315 ) </B>
<P>
	Let me use the French military college in St. Jean as an 
example. There has been much said in Quebec about the closing 
of this college and it being a slap in the face to Quebec. The 
military college in Victoria closed as well. We cannot afford, on 
a reduced military as suggested by the Bloc, everything we 
want. I think this an area in which we are going to have to do 
with less. We must accept this.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, in speaking 
to Bill C-14, the borrowing authority act, it is important to look 
back and review the budget that was presented to this House on 
February 22 by the hon. Minister of Finance.
<P>
	On February 23 a Vancouver television station, UTV, 
conducted a poll of 3,000 people in the Vancouver area asking 
whether the budget was too tough, not tough enough or just 
right. The results of that poll indicated that 65 per cent of the 
people felt the budget was not tough enough, while only 17 per 
cent felt it was too tough.
<P>
	Clearly the people wanted the government to act. They 
wanted the government to act decisively and make meaningful 
and substantial cuts.
<P>
	During the budget presentation, the hon. minister stated that it 
was the fifth time he had risen in this House to speak on a budget 
and it was the first time there had been anyone in the House 
when he spoke.
<P>
	A constituent of North Vancouver called me to say that based 
on what he heard on the fifth occasion he was not surprised that 
there was nobody here on the other four. He said the minister 
was fortunate to have a captive audience to clap like trained 
seals for a budget that was badly flawed. I agree with the caller. 
There are terrible flaws in the budget that will have to be 
recognized by the members of the government as time proceeds.
<P>
	The plain fact is that today we are debating a bill that plans to 
borrow up to $37 billion only because the Minister of Finance 
failed to do his job properly on February 22.
<P>
	Before the government members become too depressed, I feel 
I should in all fairness do as my colleague did and mention that 
there were some good proposals in the budget. I agree with my 
colleague that the decision to freeze government salaries has 
some major inequities and it is a shame that there were not 
provisions put in there to deal with those.
<P>
	However, the overall impact is beneficial to small business 
because an extensive survey taken recently by the Canadian 
Federation of Independent Business showed that on average 
most salaries in the government sector are still above those for 
similar positions in the private sector. By having this freeze for 
the next two years it will take pressure off of the small business 
sector to have to increase its own salaries.
<P>
	Many workers in the private sector have taken wage rollbacks 
over the past few years as their businesses struggle with the tax 
burden and increasing costs. I think it is entirely appropriate that 
the government sector be seen to take some of the load while the 
economy recovers.
<P>
	Moving to another item that came up in the budget, in my 
speech to this House on January 24 I commented on the 
government's red book proposal to establish a Canada 
investment fund. I suggested that permitting RRSP investment 
into some sort of mutual fund that invested in venture capital 
would be a good way to create finance for small business 
without involving taxpayers' money.
<P>
	However, I also suggested that if the government went ahead 
with the fund anyway, which it has now done, it should at least 
put private sector management in place to look after that fund 
rather than make patronage appointments.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1905"> 1905 </A></B>
<P>
	Who knows whether others were also urging the same thing of 
the member, but maybe the Minister of Finance was watching 
my speech that day. If he was and the suggestion of a private 
sector management fund appealed to him I congratulate him for 
including it in his budget.
<P>
	I hope that the privately managed venture capital fund will be 
required to return a profit to the public purse while it helps new 
and innovative businesses get established.
<P>
	In terms of the ongoing viability of small business, I was also 
pleased to note that the capital gains exemption for the sale of 
small business shares was retained. I would like to quote from a 
recent issue of the <I>Times</I> of London in which former Chancellor 
of the Exchequer, Norman Lament, writes: ``To grow, 
businesses and individuals need to plough back their profits, but 
capital gains tax and other business taxes work against this. 
They encourage proprietors to drain their businesses of cash. 
This has weakened small businesses and has made it difficult for 
many of them to survive the recession''.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	Small business owners who provide most of the jobs in this 
country were encouraged to see that their investments in their 
businesses were protected.
<P>
	Unfortunately just as the government members are starting to 
feel all warm and fuzzy about this budget I have to go back to 
talking about the appalling bill that is before us which asks for 
authorization for up to $37 billion more to be spent.
<P>
	Did any member of this government ask their children and 
grandchildren whether they wanted us to borrow another $37 
billion? How will the government members explain to their 
children and grandchildren that they sat here on a Monday in 
February 1994 and supported a mortgage on the future of the 
next generation? How will they explain the higher taxes and the 
reduction in government services or even a possibility of a debt 
crisis in the future as a result of this borrowing?
<P>
	Some of the government members are pretty decent people. I 
even like a few of them, despite their permanent mind block 
against deficit reduction. Surely they cannot in good conscience 
support this bill knowing that it condemns their children and 
their grandchildren to a lifetime of debt and interest payments.
<P>
	I am going to refer to a letter in the <I>Financial Post</I> of February 
16, 1994. The writer says: ``A <I>Post</I> article of February 1 quotes 
Jean Chrétien as stating Canada's deficit is not out of line with 
international deficit levels and that his government will take a 
gradual approach to cutting it. What on earth does it take to 
make these people realize we have no God given right to live 
beyond our means on other people's money? Every businessman 
or businesswoman in this country knows very well that we 
would have been bankrupt years ago if we all handled our 
personal affairs as the previous Liberal and Tory governments 
have done for over 25 years. Millions of Canadians are fed up to 
the eyeballs with politicians  blaming past politicians who 
blamed politicians before them''.
<P>
	It is very disappointing to note that while they sit here 
blaming the politicians before them, government members 
opposite will vote in favour of a budget which does nothing to 
right the wrongs of the past.
<P>
	They will vote in the hope that personal income tax which 
plunged by $6 billion last year will miraculously bound by $7 
billion this year.
<P>
	As I sat listening to the budget presentation I had a feeling of 
great sadness for I have already seen another country follow this 
same pathway. I have seen the denial and I have seen the failure 
to act and I have seen what happens when the bills finally have to 
be paid.
<P>
	On the afternoon of February 22 I felt a little bit of anger and I 
felt a little bit of despair but the overwhelming feeling was 
sadness.
<P>
	I know that many of the government members do not feel the 
same sense of urgency about the deficit that I feel and if I could 
just have one wish it would be somehow to transfer my 
experiences from New Zealand so that collectively we could 
start down a pathway to recovery instead of continuing down the 
slippery slope of disaster.
<P>
	It would be a miracle if government members would vote 
down this borrowing bill but I truly wish they would.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
carefully to my hon. friend and I listened to my hon. friend's 
colleague, the previous speaker.
<P>
	I would normally go to some length to defend the institution 
that Broadbent heads up at a time of globalization and the need 
to have guidance for many countries now seeking the 
democratic tradition, particularly the former Soviet Union. If 
Canada could play a leading role in bringing democracy to those 
jurisdictions I think it would certainly not only be in their best 
interests and our best interests but indeed the world's.
<P>
	I think it would be very much a role for Canada to play.
<P>
	Earlier one of the member's colleagues indicated a concern in 
terms of the freeze on public employees' salaries and wages and 
the suggestion that people making in the mid-$20,000, $24,000, 
actually had a wage increase while others had them frozen.
<P>
<B>(1325 ) </B>
<P>
	I am simply seeking clarification in terms of the position of 
the Reform Party. Are its members suggesting that certain 
public employees, I guess maybe 200,000 or something of that 
nature, ought to have received a salary and wage increase and 
others either a freeze or perhaps even a decrease?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1906"> 1906 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Reform 
Party is always interested in addressing inequities or problems. I 
think what we wanted to point out here is that in any situation 
where you freeze a situation you also freeze inequities or 
unfairness. If you extend that freeze further without addressing 
the problems that your freeze created I think that is something 
we should all oppose.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Saskatoon-Dundurn):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
was with interest that I listened to the hon. member speak about 
the blaming of previous governments for our woes. I simply 
wish to remind the hon. member that is exactly the position we 
have not taken.
<P>
	We have taken the position that we will not blame anyone 
because we came in and we simply have a problem to deal with.
<P>
	My question for the hon. member is with respect to the cuts 
that are being suggested. It is very vague as to what cuts should 
take place. Can the hon. member perhaps enlighten us as to the 
specific areas where cuts will be made? In particular, is one of 
these areas transfer payments to provinces?
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
see that the hon. member has agreed that the government should 
take the blame for whatever happens as a result of this budget.
<P>
	By 1995 our debt is going to be 75 per cent of our gross 
national product. That is a little like billing $22,500 to a credit 
card when one only earns $30,000 a year. Sooner or later one is 
in deep trouble.
<P>
	The Reform Party has a very comprehensive plan, an 
alternative budget. The Chair will not give me the two hours I 
would like to be able to give my own budget speech, but I invite 
the member to come across to our side and see all the details on 
the way we would cut.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Hamilton West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
begin my first formal speech of this 35th Parliament with a 
message to the constituents of my home town of Hamilton who 
put their trust in me to represent their views and concerns here in 
the highest court of the land. I thank them. I consider it a 
privilege and an honour to serve.
<P>
	To you, Mr. Speaker, I extend my congratulations and to the 
man we call Gibby. People in the Golden Horseshoe are very 
proud of him because we know him to be a man of patience and 
kindness. I pledge my full co-operation and support.
<P>
	On the bill that is before us, Bill C-14, the task of keeping 
Canada's fiscal house in order should have nothing to do with 
merely preparing oneself for re-election. On the contrary, the 
fiscal responsibilities facing our government today require us to 
have the courage to make prudent decisions that are in the long 
term social and economic interest of our nation. In doing so, as 
stated by the right hon. Prime Minister, government should be 
lean but not mean.
<P>
	After conducting the most exhaustive and open pre-budget 
consultation in Canadian history the federal government has 
managed to substantiate its commitment to job creation and 
economic renewal while reversing the trend of tax and spend 
economics that has gripped Canada's economy.
<P>
	During the past nine years of careless government spending 
under the previous administration Canadians have watched the 
public debt balloon from $168 billion in 1984 to over $460 
billion in 1993. This represents an increase of almost $300 
billion or an average of about $30 billion per year.
<P>
	To give everyone an idea of how enormous that figure is, 
picture the public debt as a hole in the ground. A $1 coin is a 
mere two millimetres thick. Two millimetres is rather thin in 
comparison with the thickness of the earth, for example, which 
is 6,411 kilometres from the surface to the centre.
<P>
	However, if the previous finance minister were to dig a mere 
two millimetres into the ground every time the deficit increased 
by $1 he would have reached the centre of the earth after his first 
month in office. If the former finance minister continued 
digging at that rate until 1993, he would have tunnelled right 
through the centre of the earth, would have penetrated the 
opposite surface and would have continued flailing hopelessly 
in outer space for another 587,178 kilometres. Of course the 
space odyssey would have been cut short by the October 25 
general election.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	The government has an obligation to ensure that both the 
public debt and deficit are kept under control. We can no longer 
continue to mortgage the nation's future and the future of our 
children.
<P>
	By restructuring and streamlining various government 
operations we will be able to reverse the growth trend of 
Canada's spiralling deficit and reduce it from $45 billion in 
1994 to $32.7 billion in 1996.
<P>
	In the process of reducing the debt the Minister of Finance has 
taken some serious measures by cutting government 
expenditures by $5 for every $1 of net revenue increases. That is 
worth repeating. Through reductions in defence spending, 
reductions in government handouts and the creation of a 
responsible social security system, we will achieve our goal of 
$2.1 billion in spending cuts by 1995, $5.4 billion in 1996 and 
$7.3 billion in 1997.
<P>
	Although these are bold measures they appear to be supported 
by the majority of Canadians. I raised this issue in the House a 
little earlier. The following appeared in the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> of 
February 18, 1994:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1907"> 1907 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Canadians show a high support for the federal Liberals even after a budget that 
tightened restrictions on unemployment insurance and closed military bases across this 
country.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The <I>Gazette</I> of February 26, 1994 indicated: ``The Angus 
Reid-Southam News survey says that 55 per cent of respondents 
nationally believe the Liberals are on the right track with the 
February 22 budget''.
<P>
	How about the Canadian Medical Association news release or 
communique? It indicated: ``Budget provides health care 
stability, says doctors. Canada's doctors are pleased with 
Finance Minister Paul Martin's decision not to make any 
changes to existing federal government health transfers to the 
provinces''. It is so much good news I am not sure members 
opposite can stand it.
<P>
	As part of our commitment to deficit reduction we have gone 
so far as to freeze our own wages for the next two years. The 
extended public sector service salary freeze announced by the 
Minister of Finance on February 22 also applies to the Prime 
Minister, all cabinet ministers, every senator, my 294 fellow 
MPs in the House, as well as all appointed federal officials and 
employees of various crown corporations. Clearly the 
government is putting its money where its mouth is. As a result 
we will save over $3.1 billion during the next three years in 
government operations alone.
<P>
	What about investing in people and stimulating the Canadian 
economy? I am proud to say that the budget presented by the 
Minister of Finance has stayed true to the so-called red book 
platform on which we were elected.
<P>
	Under the $6 billion Canada infrastructure works program the 
federal government, in co-operation with the provincial and 
municipal governments, will be able to accelerate economic 
recovery by creating short and long term employment through 
investment in local communities while enhancing Canada's 
infrastructure at the local level. Speaking of which, the 
following appeared in the <I>Gazette</I> of February 23, 1994: 
``Provincial Finance Minister André Bourbeau is giving the 
federal budget a passing grade because of Ottawa's job creation 
plan''.
<P>
	Through the infrastructure works program my riding of 
Hamilton West and the surrounding region of 
Hamilton-Wentworth will see an investment of over $27 
million in federal funding. This will translate into hundreds of 
new jobs created in the region.
<P>
	The government is committed not only to job creation but also 
to education and the training of Canada's youth. Last summer 
youth unemployment reached a startling 22 per cent for young 
Canadians between the ages of 15 and 24. Through the Canada 
youth service corps and youth internship and apprenticeship 
programs, we will provide thousands of young people across 
this great country with meaningful work experience through 
public service in their local communities. Furthermore the 
budget will provide $800 million over the next two years to test 
innovative new training techniques in co-operation with the 
provinces for re-entry workers. This can only strengthen our 
human resource base in the long run by providing Canadians 
with valuable skills and retraining. When we said we would 
invest in jobs and in people we meant it.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	It is a well established fact that a key component of a strong 
national economy is a well educated workforce. In light of this 
the federal government will be restoring $5 million in funding 
cut from the national literacy program by the previous 
administration. We will also maintain regular levels of EPF 
funding for post-secondary education over the next two years.
<P>
	As we approach the 21st century it is becoming increasingly 
apparent that Canada must remain on the cutting edge of science 
and technology in order to stay competitive in the global 
economy and to tap into the emerging high-tech growth 
industries. To this end the government will be investing $60 
million in new science and technology programs.
<P>
	The government has also decided to maintain funding for 
Canada's research granting councils. The Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> of 
February 25 indicated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``They (the Liberals) appear to understand the importance of science'', said 
Howard Dickson of the Coalition for Biomedical and Health Research- 
``Overall it is good news'', said Claude Lajeunesse, president of the Association 
of Universities and Colleges of Canada. ``Research has been identified as one 
area-and there aren't many of them-where the government will put 
additional money in over the next few years'', Lajeunesse said.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In keeping with a fair and balanced approach to fiscal policy 
the government has shown support not only for science and 
technology but for the arts as well. The <I>Globe and Mail</I> of 
February 23, 1994 pointed out:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``The government has affirmed the importance of the arts'', said Keith Kelly 
speaking from the Ottawa office of the Canadian Conference of the Arts. ``It 
appears the art community's message has found receptive ears. It is almost too 
good to be believed. Ottawa seems to have kept its promise to give the CBC 
stable multi-year financing''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In terms of stimulating the economy one area that is often 
overlooked is small business. The government believes in small 
business and recognizes the important role played by small 
businesses in the national economy in terms of job creation and 
innovation.
<P>
	By initiating the creation of a task force to address lending 
policy for small business the government has proven its 
willingness to exercise leadership and challenge the banks and 
other financial institutions to develop concrete ways to help 
small and medium sized Canadian businesses to find the capital 
they need.
<P>
	My time is short. I want to conclude by saying that people 
across the country told us not to place a new tax on group health 
and benefit plans and presented us with compelling and well 
researched reasons to support their arguments. We listened. 
Canadians advised us that lowering the RRSP contribution 
would harm those who  have insufficient levels of funding for 
their retirement. We listened. We were told to close off tax 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1908"> 1908 </A></B>
<P>
loopholes and try to eliminate frivolous government handouts. 
We listened.
<P>
	The people who elected us did so on faith, that we would stay 
true to the platform, to the agenda we outlined in the so-called 
red book. It seems only fair that we should be reflective of our 
commitment to those principles and ultimately to the people of 
this great country.
<P>
	In closing I simply point out this is not a budget for a single 
province, a single region or a single interest group; this is a 
budget for Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened to 
the hon. member's speech with attention and interest. At the 
beginning of his speech, he made the following statement:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``The government has been putting its money where its mouth 
is''. With all due respect the government does not have any 
money. It is in the red. It has only debt.
<P>
	Am I to understand that the government has been putting the 
people's money in its mouth? That is a great concern to me.
<P>
<B>(1340 ) </B>
<P>
	Furthermore I listened carefully to the hon. member when he 
said that Mr. Bourbeau gave us a passing grade. I was a teacher 
and a passing grade is nothing they should be proud of. They 
should be doing a lot better. That was what I expected from the 
Liberal government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	For years, I have heard budget forecasts claiming that the 
deficit would be reduced year by year. I remember a 
Conservative government about ten years ago saying similar 
things to what we have been hearing for several days. I 
remember a Conservative government then telling us year after 
year that the deficit would be reduced within five years. We will 
be able to judge a year from now if this budget was on target. In a 
year, we will know if the deficit was indeed kept below $40 
billion. I am far from convinced by the rhetoric of our 
colleagues opposite that we will get there, that they will 
succeed.
<P>
	In conclusion, they talked about job creation. The real test 
will be how many new jobs will be created in a year. I am 
concerned and I remain concerned and I am waiting to hear what 
the hon. member has to say.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague opposite 
for his question. With the deepest of respect, the money we are 
spending is the money provided to the government by our tax 
dollars and the tax dollars of our constituents who are sitting at 
home watching this debate. I get the same money as my hon. 
colleague opposite gets. There is no difference in the money. It 
is all coming out of the same pocket, and that is the pocket of 
Canadians.
<P>
	He went on to mention the passing grade given to us by 
provincial finance minister André Bourbeau. I sat in the House 
for the previous five years. The marks the previous government 
got on budgets past were so dismal that to come all the way up 
from negative to a passing grade is a great achievement.
<P>
	I might go on in the article the member mentioned. On 
February 23 the quote from Mr. Bourbeau was: ``It contains 
interesting job creation measures''. Then he brushed aside 
criticism from the Parti Quebecois that the budget was short on 
any new ideas on helping the jobless. That is a pretty good 
answer to the hon. member's question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with some interest to the hon. member's talk. I have a 
question for him.
<P>
	Our country is far in debt. The deficit is running high and the 
government is asking for trust from the people. How can we trust 
a government that spends millions topping up their own pension 
plan while the rest of society suffers?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> Mr. Speaker, unless the hon. member has been on 
holiday for the last hundred days he would know that the party 
which I am proud to represent and the government of the land are 
committed to a review of the pension the hon. member is talking 
about. A majority of us not just on the government side but on all 
sides of the House of Commons are sitting back and asking 
exactly how it works and how it compares to other industrialized 
nations of the world.
<P>
	Hon. members take great pride in saying: ``I cut my pay by 10 
per cent''. I do not know about that hon. member, but I serve 
between 70 hours and 80 hours a week for my constituency here 
and at home. With all the telephone calls and extra hours I put 
in-and I am taken away from my family, et cetera-I have to 
tell him that our job function here and the responsibility given to 
us to serve in the highest court of the land do not compare 
favourably-it is not even close-to someone in the private 
sector with that level of responsibility and serving that many 
hours in Ottawa and in the constituency. There is just no 
comparison. A 10 per cent cut on a pay that really does not 
compare is no big deal.
<P>

<HR>
<B><A NAME="1909"> 1909 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hopkins:</B> You give that away and don't brag about it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> Yes, of course. I will not repeat the remark. It was 
a brilliant remark by my friend from 
Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
privilege to enter into the debate today, after listening to all of 
the eloquent speeches that have gone before I have had the 
opportunity to take part in it. By taking part in this debate I am 
taking part in a process which marks the beginning of a new era.
<P>
	We were presented with a budget document on February 22 
which shows a fundamental change in the attitude toward the 
future of the country and shows the government means what it 
says and says what it means. The address was a triumph of 
reality over rhetoric and it laid out in clear and concise terms the 
direction the minister and the government wishes to take the 
country.
<P>
	As has been said in the last couple of hours that I have been 
listening, everybody knows the state of our financial affairs. 
They showed in the October election their belief in us by the 
majority they gave this party in the House. Now that that issue 
has been settled for a good many years to come, it is time for a 
realistic and pragmatic approach to the governance of Canada 
and a time to turn away from the ruinous economic policies 
which brought us to the state we are in today.
<P>
	Canadians told us during last fall's election that the first issue 
we must address is jobs. The unemployment rate is completely 
unacceptable. Canadians are a proud, industrious and 
hard-working people who will not accept a continuing double 
digit unemployment rate.
<P>
	The national infrastructure program will create jobs in the 
short term. The measures announced in the minister's budget 
will contribute to a more positive environment for businesses to 
create jobs in the future. The $800 million budgeted for strategic 
initiatives will test new ways for social programs to help people 
get back to work and will reduce duplication.
<P>
	In my own region more emphasis will be placed on training 
and getting people and communities back to work. In my 
province of Prince Edward Island, and in my region, one of the 
greatest problems faced over the past few years has been the 
uncertainty faced by provincial governments with respect to 
what they could expect in federal transfer payments.
<P>
	I know that many people in the House are opposed to the 
system of transfer payments. Many people believe that they 
should not happen. However, as one who comes from a part of 
the country that has been devastated over the last few years with 
various disasters-the latest in the fishery-transfer payments 
are a must. Under this budget there will be a period of stability 
so that provinces can rationally plan for the future.
<P>
	The sad state of the federal financial scene has significantly 
contributed to problems being faced by the provinces where, 
without exception, they too are forced to look at many long term 
policies and programs with a view to reform.
<P>
	The Liberal Party has always been at the forefront of reform 
and this time we are showing that fact has not changed. There 
have to be changes made to some of our social programs. We 
know that and we are working on it because they are not working 
as well as they should be. They are getting older and it is time to 
change them. In making changes though, the minister has, as 
always, remembered to protect the weaker and more vulnerable 
members of our society.
<P>
	It is no secret that unemployment insurance is an extremely 
important factor in the economy of my province. The interim 
changes announced recently are causing a great deal of 
discussion. I can assure everyone that last week when we were 
out of the House that the topic was brought to my office and to 
my house, through phones calls and by personal contact on many 
occasions.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	The changes will better protect low income earners and will 
strengthen the link between work history and unemployment 
insurance. They will continue to provide assistance to regions 
such as mine of high unemployment, but they do foresee the day 
when we must become less dependent on unemployment 
insurance and other government programs.
<P>
	I firmly believe that the residents of my province would 
gladly forgo the benefits afforded them by UI if there were more 
opportunities for them to work. Our unemployment rate 
approaches 20 per cent during some seasons and this is 
indicative of the challenge facing each of us. It is also facing the 
minister.
<P>
	No one thought unemployment insurance would become a 
guaranteed annual income and very few people thought the 
unemployment rate would be as high as it is today. Nobody ever 
thought that. That was never planned for, certainly by the people 
who are drawing unemployment insurance.
<P>
	Another major problem in my region has been the total 
collapse, as I have mentioned, of the groundfishery. Close to 
50,000 people are potentially affected by this disaster and new, 
innovative solutions must be found to the problem. The 
government must, in consultation with the Atlantic provinces, 
find a solution based on sustainable development and 
restoration of the environment. I hope Canadians realize the 
magnitude of the problem and how vitally important it is that 
long term solutions be found.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1910"> 1910 </A></B>
<P>
	The other issue of great importance in Atlantic Canada has 
been the closure of some military bases. The adjustment 
assistance promised will help the affected communities set up 
redevelopment plans and fund alternative economic activities. 
The closure of a base is a traumatic event for a community, but it 
does open a window of opportunity for the community to get 
involved in economic activity which will grow and develop in 
the years to come.
<P>
	As we all know, this was only the first step in the process of 
rebuilding the economy. There will no doubt be changes in our 
social programs over the next few years, but they will be 
changes which will come about as a result of careful and 
compassionate planning. Those people who most need the 
facilities and services to be provided will be treated even better 
in the future than they have been in the past because the 
government cares and will see that all Canadians regardless of 
where they reside receive equal services.
<P>
	The challenges faced by the minister are huge. The economy 
of Canada and indeed much of the world is going through a very 
difficult period. News reports this morning said that world-wide 
unemployment is at its highest rate since the 1930s and it is the 
most pressing problem facing the G-7 nations.
<P>
	I feel we are most fortunate to have a Minister of Finance and 
a government prepared to squarely face the problems and 
dedicate themselves to finding solutions. As I said at the 
beginning of my remarks, Canada is entering a new era with the 
presentation of this budget. It is not an era which will be easy. It 
is one which will see the country grow and develop and finally 
reach the full potential for which we have been striving.
<P>
	No one expects the answers to our problems to be found 
easily. No one expects to have a free ride. Canadians have 
always been ready to put their shoulders to the wheel and get the 
job done. The challenges facing us are many. The first step has 
been taken. Under the guidance of the Minister of Finance, the 
other ministers and our leader we will move along very quickly.
<P>
	I support this borrowing bill. I thank you, Sir, for allowing me 
these moments to put forward my case.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate the hon. member opposite for his presentation this 
afternoon. I have a question and would appreciate his 
comments. The budget presented by the Minister of Finance 
indicated there was a $5 reduction in spending for every dollar 
increase in revenue.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	Would the hon. member care to comment on the fact it would 
appear that much of the $5 decrease in spending is merely a 
reduction of spending anticipated by the former Tory 
government and not a reduction in actual spending.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Proud:</B> Mr. Speaker, when the Minister of Finance put 
forward his budget, as has been said here many times today, it 
was put forward after many consultations with the people of the 
country.
<P>
	The program we put forward in the fall that everybody refers 
to as our famous red book said that we would be fiscally 
responsible. We have said that the formula just alluded to would 
be one we were going to live with. I believe the minister is doing 
this. He has laid down his plan and it is not a program adopted by 
the former government. This is a Liberal program which will 
lead the country-it is not going to be easy at first-back to the 
time when unemployment was down. We will see government 
spending decrease and we will see less government. We will also 
see an economy that is much more healthy than in the last decade 
or more.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to make a comment followed by a question.
<P>
	During the election campaign, we heard at every turn that job 
creation would be the number-one priority of a Liberal 
government. Now that we have a Liberal government, this 
should be reflected in the budget. Furthermore, the Liberals 
have often spoken of the infrastructure program announced 
since the election as the key element of their job creation plans.
<P>
	My question to the hon. member is this: How does he explain 
the fact that, despite this much-praised program, the 
unemployment rate forecast for next year will only go down by 
one tenth of 1 per cent. The rate will be reduced from 11.8 per 
cent to 11.7 per cent, if I am not mistaken. In any case, it will 
only go down by one tenth of 1 per cent, with an infrastructure 
program in which a lot of money will be invested. Why did we 
not get something else to raise the employment level after being 
told ``jobs, jobs, jobs'' during the election campaign? Is he 
satisfied with the unemployment rate going down by only one 
tenth of 1 per cent, and how does he explain this in the Liberal 
government's budget?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Proud:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for 
his comments and his questions.
<P>
	No one feels great about an unemployment rate in the double 
digits. I said that during my remarks. The member says it is only 
going to go down by a certain percentage point. It is better to 
have it going down than what was going on in the last number of 
years when it continually rose.
<P>
	The government has come forward with an infrastructure 
program which we predict will create as many as 65,000 jobs. 
Along with that the Liberal government is committed to working 
with the private sector, the banking industry, to make sure that 
capital is there for small business to do the things they have been 
<P>

<B><A NAME="1911"> 1911 </A></B>
<P>
trying to do for a number of years. If the hon. member has not

business people coming to his door looking to get funding made 
available to them. They are not asking for it for nothing. They 
are willing to pay the going rate, but they are asking to have 
capital loosened up so they can get working capital and put 
people back to work.
<P>
	This is the jobs, jobs, jobs creation we talked about during the 
1993 election. This is what is going to happen. The

	I listened to the hon. members speaking on the budget this

spending, the only area where cuts were visible in this budget.
<P>
	First of all, I would like to congratulate the Minister of 
Defence for standing bravely by the cuts made in the defence 
budget. He even took offence with some questions other 
members of the Bloc and myself have asked him. I must 
however point out to the hon. Minister of Defence that, 
unfortunately, he thinks he has the monopoly of consistency 
with regard to the role the Bloc Quebecois members have given 
themselves. He said: ``I seldom get angry, but when I hear this 
kind of partisan remarks, I cannot help but react. When they 
speak like that, they-he is referring to us, the Bloc 
Quebecois-have only one thing in mind, and that is to destroy 
our country. We refuse to have anything to do with their game''.
<P>
	I am generally considered in my riding as a moderate, not a 
fanatic sovereigntist, or separatist as the Prime Minister prefers 
to call us, one who tries to base his analyses on facts and figures. 
I quoted the Minister of Defence because he has decided to get 
involved, in conjunction with members of the Bloc Quebecois-

	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
March 6 to 12 is Vision Awareness Week in Canada. Its theme, 
``Good Vision and Literacy: There is a Clear Connection'', is 
timely. Canada faces a staggering 25 per cent rate of illiteracy.
<P>
	One of the major roadblocks standing between citizens and 
their ability to read is poor vision. Since one in six children has a 
vision problem and since at least 80 per cent of learning is 
visual, early detection of vision problems becomes an important 
part of preventing illiteracy.
<P>
	Let us work to make certain all of Canada's citizens are 
literate for this wondrous information age.
<P>
	With literacy comes access to information, employment and 
prosperity. If Canada is to realize its vision of a prosperous 
future it must ensure that in the future its people have good 
vision.

<P>
	An important priority of this government is the 
implementation of measures to stimulate small and medium 
sized businesses which we know have accounted for 85 per cent 
of new job creation since 1979.
<P>
	Between 1973 and 1993 the number of self-employed women 
skyrocketed from 89,000 to 323,000. In 1991 over 30 per cent of 
the self-employed workforce was made up of women. The 
success rate of women entrepreneurs is twice that of men.

	We have every reason to applaud the women in this land who 
have taken the plunge into self-employment, thereby providing 
themselves employment and employment for others. Despite 
obstacles, many more will join their ranks.

research on workplace safety and health issues.
<P>
	It is estimated that the cost of occupational injuries and

a fiscal and social responsibility to ensure that the general

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is directed to the Prime Minister.
<P>
	In their analysis of the impact of this government's first 
budget, three economists at the Université du Québec à 
Montréal stated that the government was asking the 
unemployed, and I quote: ``to make an entirely disproportionate 
contribution by obliging them to shoulder 60 per cent of the 
cutbacks announced in the budget''. In fact, the benefit rate and 
benefit period of more than eight unemployed workers has been 
reduced, which illustrates the extent of this unprecedented 
attack by the government on the unemployed.
<P>
	Could the Prime Minister explain why the government, 
instead of cutting operating expenditures and getting rid of 
widespread overlap in its administration, has deliberately 
decided to come down hard on the unemployed?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification): </B>Mr. Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition left 
out all the important parts of the budget. First of all, we 
increased benefits for low-income Canadians and those with 
dependent children. We reduced unemployment insurance 
premiums to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1915"> 1915 </A></B>
<P>
create jobs. In fact, we said that as a result of this budget, 40,000 
people would get jobs.
<P>
	When the hon. member was in the Conservative government, 
he reduced and cut benefits under programs that had been 
created to fight unemployment. He raised premiums and 
increased unemployment at the same time. That is the 
difference. Our objective is to create jobs for Canadians, while 
when the hon. member was a minister in the Conservative 
government, the objective was to reduce employment.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister has a selective approach to recent political 
history. I saw in this House, and I shared, the fervour, intensity 
and indignation with which he attacked Bill C-113, which took 5 
per cent of their unemployment insurance benefits away from 
the unemployed. We all condemned this legislation and we 
voted against it. Today, I see the same minister working as part 
of a cabinet that has launched a wholesale attack against the 
unemployed.
<P>
	I want to ask the Prime Minister or his deputy whether the 
government will admit that without genuine measures to boost 
employment, the government's decision to reduce the benefits 
of nearly 85 per cent of the unemployed will have the effect of 
putting several thousand of these people on welfare?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, I plead with the hon. Leader of 
the Opposition to read the budget carefully.
<P>
	When he says there are no measures to create employment, I 
just mentioned a very important one which is by reducing the 
premiums on unemployment insurance there is a very 
substantial stimulus, especially for small business. That was the 
message from small business during the consultations: ``You 
reduce the payroll taxes, we will create jobs''.
<P>
	At the same time we have reallocated expenditures to initiate 
a major infrastructure program across Canada of $6 billion.
<P>
	In addition, to make sure we can establish brand new ways of 
getting people off social assistance, off dependency and back to 
work, we have added an extra $800 million in the budget to work 
with the provinces to establish a series of initiatives 
strategically placed across Canada to help the very people the 
hon. member says he is concerned about.
<P>
	That seems to be a very big difference from the actions he 
took when he was in government which was simply to cut, slash 
and burn and do nothing to help those who needed help.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to ask the Prime Minister whether he realizes 
that by zeroing in on unemployment insurance, he is putting the 
burden of the deficit on the shoulders of the provinces, which in 
the coming year are already faced with spending an additional 
$1 billion on welfare, which works out to $280 million in 
Quebec alone.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sure the hon. member will 
be very happy to know that last week we had a series of meetings 
with provincial ministers in education and labour.
<P>
	They have all agreed to become part of a major effort to 
reform the social security system. We agreed we would begin to 
tackle the very serious problems of duplication and overlap of 
services which do create waste.
<P>
	We are now dealing with the provinces. We believe we can 
make substantial savings at both the federal and provincial 
levels to reduce administrative costs and reduce the kind of 
overlap that creates additional cost. It is not to reduce the money 
going to individuals, not to reduce the direct delivery of 
programs, but to reduce the amount that goes to bureaucracy 
administration. That is the objective of this government.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, the ranks of 
those opposed to the closing of the military college in 
Saint-Jean are growing every day: francophone associations 
throughout Canada, the Commissioner of Official Languages, 
Mr. Goldbloom, General Jean V. Allard, the college's alumni, 
and even the Liberal Premier of Quebec, who finally changed his 
mind and now wants the college in Saint-Jean to remain open.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Is the government 
willing to use common sense and go back on its decision to close 
the college in Saint-Jean, to allow French-speaking students 
who wish to pursue a military career to train as officers in 
French, in their own environment?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to reply to the hon. member that the problem must be 
put in a real context. Only 16 per cent of French-speaking 
Canadian military officers are graduates of the college in 
Saint-Jean.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	Many officers who have pursued a career in the Canadian 
Forces went to other universities. There are flexible programs 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1916"> 1916 </A></B>
<P>
allowing them to choose their universities. We will have only 
one military college in the future. The Canadian Forces will 
have about 70,000  members and only one military college. The 
American armed forces have only three colleges for 2 million 
soldiers.
<P>
	As we have to make cuts, we decided to close the military 
college in Saint-Jean. We are sorry but we had to cut 
somewhere. We made cuts in every province, including Quebec. 
We told the Quebec government and all the people that, if they 
wanted to keep the college in Saint-Jean as an institution of 
higher learning, we were ready to help them, as we help other 
provinces hit by base closures and, very often, by cuts much 
more severe per capita than those made in Quebec. We are ready 
to help but the decision is final. A country with 70,000 soldiers 
cannot have three military colleges when the American armed 
forces have three colleges for 2 million soldiers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, now that we 
know that Kingston is not a region where the Ontario law on 
francophone areas applies, that a Kingston French-language 
high school is even housed in portables without running water, 
and that the Kingston mayor's policy for integrating 
francophones is to let the English marry the French, does the 
Prime Minister still have the audacity to say that Kingston is the 
best possible place to integrate French-speaking communities 
into the armed forces?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would reply to the hon. member that francophones can now 
receive their whole training in French at the college in Kingston. 
This morning, I was looking at the file of a young woman who 
was able to take in French at the military college in Kingston 38 
of her 40 engineering courses.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> As a francophone in 
Kingston, she functioned so well that, at the end of her course, 
her fellow students voted to give her the prize awarded to the 
student who contributes the most to his or her faculty's 
development.
<P>
	So, Mr. Speaker, I think there is a way to organize the college 
in Kingston so that francophone students can be served in 
French. And, if there is a need to improve the local situation in 
Kingston, we will try to help, just as we are now trying to help 
the people who want to keep in Saint-Jean an institution that, 
unfortunately, can no longer serve the military.

	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Many Canadians, including federalists in Quebec, were 
outraged last week when the Leader of the Opposition made an 
official visit to Washington and New York to sell Quebec 
separatism. The purpose of this visit was made very clear by the 
opposition leader. He went to lay the groundwork for future 
relations between a separate Quebec and the United States.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister not agree that by having the 
Canadian embassy involved the Canadian government 
legitimized the purpose of this visit?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the people of Canada voted in one election. They elected a 
separatist party as the Official Opposition and we are treating it 
as the Official Opposition.
<P>
	Not only bad things came out of that trip, there were a lot of 
good things too. The Leader of the Opposition told the 
Americans he was Canadien français, just like me. That is great. 
He said he wanted the Americans to understand his position. 
Rather than using the confusing term of sovereignty he wanted 
them to know the truth and the truth will now be known by 
Quebecers. He said: ``I am a separatist,'' and I was very happy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, traditionally 
the primary objective of opposition leaders has been to defend 
the interests of Canada. The present Leader of the Official 
Opposition has been forthright that this is not his primary goal. 
His objective is to lead Quebec out of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1430 ) </B>
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister believe that in this case the Leader of 
the Official Opposition misused his office to promote the 
breakup of Canada?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Again the Chair is having a little difficulty with 
the questions in that they seem to be attacking individual 
members. I do not know that this is really the administrative 
responsibility of the government.
<P>
	I would let the Prime Minister answer the question if he so 
wishes, but I would hope the questions would be rephrased so 
that they deal with the administrative responsibility of the 
government.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
believe I can speak about national policies that can be useful in 
keeping Canada together.
<P>
	I urge the member of the Reform Party to recognize 
generously that it is a very good thing in Canada to have two 
official languages.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Canadian 
taxpayer picked up some of the tab for the visit. Does the Prime 
Minister believe that Canadians received good value for the 
money spent?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
was pleased to hear the premier of Alberta say on Friday that he 
was in favour of two official languages in Canada. They like to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1917"> 1917 </A></B>

be noted.

dinner for the Leader of the Official Opposition. I just hope it 
was cheaper than the party for the Governor of the Bank of 
Canada.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
before tabling his budget, the Minister of Finance told us 
repeatedly that he would be cutting expenditures, but he did not 
have the courage to follow through. Now he is telling us that it is 
going to happen next year, as part of a second phase. Even the 
Prime Minister, on tour in Western Canada, contradicts him on 
that point.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Finance expect us to believe that he 
does want to reduce spending when the Prime Minister flatly 
contradicts him by saying that all cuts the government planned 
to make were made this year?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, if I may quote from the 
speech I made to this House, the decisions we are making today 
are clearly putting us on a path leading to the government goal of 
reducing the deficit to 3 per cent of the GDP within three years. 
That is the position I stated here in this House and the Prime 
Minister took the very same position last week in Western 
Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
in light of the minister's answer and the budget, are we to 
understand that the Minister of Finance has abandoned the idea 
of cutting government spending and will deliberately maintain 
the squandering and tax leakage denounced by the Auditor 
General, relying solely on economic growth to curb the deficit?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, again, as I told this 
House very clearly, and the Prime Minister and I myself said in 
New York City and the Canadian cities I visited last week: 
``Actions contained in the budget will reduce the deficit to 3 per 
cent of the GDP within three years''.
<P>
	Also, we are presently reviewing a number of programs with 
the Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal. We are 
reviewing all committees, public affairs, all kinds of 
government policies and programs, and we are confident that 
this will promote a better than forecast economic situation.

<P>
	In my constituency in central Alberta as I travelled around 
this past week outright disgust was expressed for the separatist 
message delivered to our major trading partner, the United 
States.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
of course I will work very hard to make sure the policies of the 
government are so good that the people of Quebec will not have 
any hesitation to stay in Canada.
<P>
	It will be very useful when I am able to report to the 
Americans that I have convinced members of the Reform Party 
to support the two officials languages of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer):</B> I have a supplementary question, 
Mr. Speaker. I wish the Prime Minister would stop trying to pass 
the buck and show some leadership.
<P>
	Could the Prime Minister please tell us what he is going to do 
to convince the grass roots of Quebec what it really means to 
separate?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is very important to have the guts to present candidates in every 
province of Canada and to have one message for all Canadians, 
not one for one part of Canada and one for another. That is why 
when I was in Alberta last weekend I received a fantastic

question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	According to reports, the withdrawal of Canadian 
peacekeepers from Srebrenica has been held up because of the 
reluctance of Bosnian Serbs to let them leave. On January 13, 
the Minister of National Defence promised that Canadian 
peacekeepers would be relieved within thirty days, a deadline 
that has since passed. For his part, the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs informed us on February 16 and 21 that their 
replacement was imminent.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1918"> 1918 </A></B>
<P>
	Can the minister confirm to us whether the withdrawal of 
Canadian peacekeepers from Srebrenica has been held up by the 
refusal of Bosnian Serbs to allow Dutch soldiers to relieve the 
Canadian contingent?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we have made considerable progress. Of course, we would have 
liked to have had our soldiers out of Srebrenica by the end of 
February. Dutch soldiers arrived as expected; 500 of them are in 
theatre and Canadian troops are preparing to withdraw. Trucks 
are currently on route to Srebrenica. Bosnian Serbs have 
expressed some reservations, arguing that the roads were not 
very passable. Nevertheless, we believe that our troops will be 
able to leave within a few days.
<P>
	Admittedly, they are several days behind schedule, but the 
operation is proceeding as expected. As for the rumour reported 
in the weekend newspapers to the effect that some 
demonstrations had taken place and that Srebrenica's Muslims 
were holding Canadian soldiers hostage, there is no truth to it. 
Muslims were merely staging a demonstration to thank 
Canadian soldiers for having protected them so valiantly during 
the past two years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg):</B> If I understand 
correctly, Mr. Speaker, they were prevented from leaving 
because they were being thanked.
<P>
	I, along with the families of the soldiers, would like to know 
what approach the government is planning to take with Bosnian 
Serbs to ensure the departure of Canadian troops as scheduled? 
What does the government intend to do to ensure that the Serbs 
allow the withdrawal of Canadian peacekeepers?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> In response to 
the hon. member's question, Mr. Speaker, I would say that 
throughout last week and the weekend, negotiations for the 
withdrawal were being conducted, mostly under the direction of 
Commander Rose, the officer in charge of UN troops. According 
to the information we received a few minutes before entering the 
House, we have good reason to believe that Canadian solders 
will be leaving Srebrenica within the next 48 or 72 hours.
<P>
	As I said, the operation is a few days behind schedule. It may 
take a little more time, but we hope that the process will be 
completed in less than 72 hours.

	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the Prime Minister. It is further to the question by the 
member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot and is with regard to the 
Prime Minister's visit to Edmonton last week.
<P>
	The Prime Minister said that Canadians would see no further 
spending cuts in the next three years. He also said that was 
according to the budget presented in the House.
<P>
	Could the Prime Minister confirm whether or not that is true 
at this point, or whether there will be cuts as has been inferred by 
the Minister of Finance on other days?
<P>
<B>(1440 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would say exactly what the Minister of Finance said. In the 
budget that was presented in the House we made provisions for 
cuts over the next three years.
<P>
	If we have 3 per cent and 3.8 per cent growth in the next two 
years, we will be at 3 per cent of GNP in relation to the deficit. 
The programs cuts for the next three years have been announced. 
They are the big programs like defence, social expenditures and 
so on.
<P>
	In the meantime we have asked the minister responsible for 
federal-provincial relations to work very actively to find some 
duplications between provincial governments and federal 
government and to reduce the duplications, and to look into all 
the boards within government operations and to reduce them in 
order to find further cuts.
<P>
	These will not be the major cuts as mentioned in the budget. 
When we talk about the cuts in defence and other cuts announced 
in the budget, they were very serious cuts indeed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
supplementary question for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The impression I have is that the reason we are doing the 
studies in social security programs, health, defence and some 
other areas is that we are looking at better priorities and 
reduction in spending by the government.
<P>
	I have a question for either the Minister of Finance or the 
Prime Minister. What is the purpose of those studies if it is not to 
reduce and redefine those expenditure areas?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are very conscious of the 
seriousness of the financial situation in which Canada finds 
itself with the debt and the deficit.
<P>
	There is no doubt that in the budget we have embarked upon 
cuts that are necessary for us to bring our deficit within an 
acceptable range in the next three years, certainly the target we 
have set out.
<P>
	At the same time it is very important to understand-and the 
Minister of Human Resources Development has been explicit 
and very articulate on this matter as have the Minister of 
National Defence and a number of other ministers in the 
House-that we are Liberals. We understand the absolute 
necessity of public policy evolving along with the needs of the 
country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

Heritage.
<P>
	The Canadian Development Investment Corporation has just 
agreed to sell its 51 per cent share of Ginn Publishing Canada, a 
Toronto company specializing in the publication and 
distribution of educational materials, to the American company 
Paramount Communications. This sale has caused an outcry of 
indignation in the press and the publishing world.
<P>
	Could the minister confirm the suggestion made by <I>Maclean's</I> 
magazine that the secret agreement made it possible for the 
American company to take control of Ginn Publishing as soon as 
the book publishing policy was changed? If not, how does he 
explain the fact that the government has used certain unresolved 
questions such as the distribution agreement as excuses for not 
actively seeking potential Canadian buyers?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the question is long and complicated but the answer is 
simple.
<P>
	A previous government entered into certain commitments. 
They were no secret; they were known. The commitment as 
described by our colleague was that if a policy occurs the 
Canadian government which had acquired 51 per cent of the 
shares of Ginn would sell them back to the American parent 
firm. This is what happened.
<P>
<B>(1445) </B>
<P>
	I am pleased to say that while it is cleaning up past business, 
the policy of protecting our book publishing industry has not 
changed.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister will agree that meanwhile the Baie 
Comeau policy was changed to make it possible.
<P>
	Is the minister aware that he is losing his credibility as a 
defender of Canada's cultural interests and can he reassure the 
House that he intends to review this unacceptable decision?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if we were to reverse the decision, which is in keeping 
with a contract, it would lead us straight into judicial action.
<P>
	As I said, the policy of protection, not the Baie Comeau 
policy, is going to be sustained. Of course everyone is entitled to 
one's judgment about the credibility of the minister of heritage 
but a number of people in the industry have understood that this 
was an exception confirming the rule and that the industry will

<P>
	As the minister knows, groundfish licences that were inactive 
in 1991 and 1992 were frozen for 1993. This freeze affected 
approximately 4,000 fishermen and has in effect penalized them 
for acting responsibly in the face of declining groundfish stocks. 
It was stated at the time that the freeze would not have a negative 
effect on anyone pursuing a licence renewal in 1994.
<P>
	I would like to ask the minister if he will be acting quickly to 
resolve the issue of inactive licences and honour the pledge 
made by his predecessor to treat all licence holders as equals.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the member for his question.
<P>
	As the member knows, the freeze in question was 
implemented by the previous administration. I indicated when I 
spoke to the MFU convention on February 4 that I was going to 
review the consequences of the freeze on inactive groundfish 
licences.
<P>
	This past week we visited New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, P.E.I.

<B><A NAME="1920"> 1920 </A></B>
<P>
	Recently the minister told the House the Premier of Quebec 
could reduce unemployment by 1 per cent because of actions 
taken by the federal government. The budget predicts national 
unemployment to remain around 11 per cent.
<P>
	Can the minister explain how the national unemployment rate 
can remain unchanged if in Quebec it falls by one full per cent?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would first like to tell the hon. 
member that the budget did not simply create jobs for Quebec. It 
will create jobs for all Canadians.
<P>
	We have a national program and a national approach to these 
issues and do not try to discriminate between regions in any way.
<P>
	What happens with the unemployment rate, as the hon. 
member probably knows, is that once you begin to create 
economic growth, once you begin to create jobs, it draws people 
back into the labour market, people who under the Tory regime 
simply gave up and no longer bothered to look for a job. 
Therefore the statistical survey results do not reflect their new 
found confidence and that people have now come back into the 
job market.
<P>
	We intend to create jobs. It may not be immediately reflected 
in a serious decline in the unemployment rate per se simply 
because more people are coming into the labour market. They 
now have confidence they will have a job.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Moose Jaw-Lake Centre):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the promise of the Premier of Quebec and the

the Minister of Finance has.
<P>
	The real issues which should be at the centre of the hon. 
member's question is how do we create jobs for everybody and 
how do we get unemployment down. It is not how we play games 
about what one premier in one region says versus what happens 
in the another region. It is about time members of the opposition

<P>
	The United States are threatening to terminate the beer 
agreement signed last August. They question, among other 
things, the fixing of a minimum price on beer by the province of 
Quebec. Even if the minimum price being considered by Quebec 
is lower than the one in effect in Ontario, the United States are 
putting pressure on Quebec to make additional concessions.
<P>

Quebec be forced to lower its minimum price to satisfy the 
demands of major American brewers, and what does he intend to 
do about it?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roy MacLaren (Minister for International Trade):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, throughout the discussions we have supported the 
Government of Quebec in seeking a GATT consistent minimal 
price. We have done so not only directly ourselves but with the 
participation of the officials of the Government of Quebec in 
meetings in Washington and last week here in Ottawa.
<P>

hope to make further progress in the resolution of this issue.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières):</B> Mr. Speaker, while 
the Americans are forcing Canada and the provinces to meet the

discriminatory measures affecting Canadian beer. What

<P>
	<B>Hon. Roy MacLaren (Minister for International Trade):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, yes, the member opposite is quite right. The GATT 
found that American beer practices were discriminatory and 
against the interests of Canada. They are implemented mainly 
by states rather than the federal government.
<P>

for the Prime Minister. It was inspired by Mr. Frank Filek of 
Toronto.
<P>
	It was reported last week that taxpayers are on the hook for 
another $12.2 million shortfall in the MP pension plan. This 
follows the $158 million contribution made by taxpayers in 
1992.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister commit to convincing his caucus 
colleagues to the immediate elimination of this gold-plated 
pension plan for members of Parliament?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there will be a report tabled very soon concerning this problem. 
We said we want to review the program. We have some months 
before an election so we have plenty of time. We will look at 
what is wrong with the program and try to make it more in tune 
with reality.
<P>
	On the other hand, we do not want to create the impression 
that some of us might think we are not value for the money we 
are paid. When members of Parliament make $64,000 a year and 
the worst hockey player for the Ottawa Senators is paid 
$135,000, I do not think that we are overpaid.
<P>
	It is very bad to create a wrong impression of members of 
Parliament with the public because most members of Parliament 
work very hard, earn their money here and make sacrifices to be 
in Ottawa. The hon. member is creating the impression we are 
not worth the money we receive. I for one will not apologize to 
anyone because I think I earn every cent of my pay.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are talking 
here about a pension plan and in the private sector we have to 
match dollar for dollar. In this House, the taxpayers have to pay 
$6 for every $1 MPs put into their pension. It is gold plated, it is 
exorbitant and it is too extravagant.
<P>
<B>(1455) </B>
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister tell Canadians why he and his 
government support lifetime pensions for members of 
Parliament after only six years of service?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we know that life expectancy in the House of Commons is not 
that great. Judging by the number of members of the Progressive 
Conservative Party in the House, we know there is no security of 
employment around here.
<P>
	I just want to say that some people come to Parliament and 
when they quit it is not necessarily easy to get re-established in 
private life. When we look at other pension plans, we have to be 
fair too.

	<B>Mr. John O'Reilly (Victoria-Haliburton):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Canadian farmers from all regions have been waiting for several 
months now following the conclusion of the GATT negotiations 
for definitive word whether resolution of our various bilateral 
trade disputes with the Americans will be possible.
<P>
	What can the minister say to the House to reassure Canadian 
producers and farmers that their interests will be protected.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member pointed out in his 
question, there are several outstanding issues in bilateral trade 
in agriculture between Canada and the United States. Those 
have been under discussion since last November. The work on 
those issues is still ongoing. They have not been resolved to 
date, nor have they gone away.
<P>
	My preference would be to have a solid framework agreement 
between Canada and the United States to lay to rest those 
outstanding issues once and for all. Such an agreement, 
mutually acceptable to both countries, would clearly be 
preferable to ongoing trade actions and reactions that could have 
the effect of undermining the $10 billion worth of agricultural 
trade between our two countries.
<P>
	However, it is important to note two points. First of all, in our 
discussions with the United States, Canada will not trade off one 
commodity against another. Each must be dealt with 
independently on its own merits.
<P>
	Second, any agreement we might contemplate with the United 
States must be fair and reasonable and in the Canadian national 
interest. A bad deal for Canada will not be acceptable to this 
government.

<P>
	During the election campaign the Prime Minister promised to 
clean up the business of influence peddling in government. It is 
widely recognized that one of the best ways to address this 
problem would be to eliminate the tax deductibility of lobbying

be allowed as a tax deductible business expense?

there will be a statement made in this House about legislation on 
lobbying on the Hill very soon. I hope the minister in charge will 
address this problem.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island):</B> Mr. Speaker, because there is 
such widespread concern among Canadians that the proposed 
changes to this lobby legislation will be so weak that they will 
have very little effect, would the Prime Minister be willing to 
give a commitment to eliminate the tax deductibility for 
lobbyist fees?

is for the Minister of Transport. Seven hundred and twenty CN 
workers will lose their jobs soon. With the agreement of the 
National Transportation Agency, the company has already 
begun dismantling the rail system in Quebec. Two thirds of 
Quebec's rail system is thus threatened, although the impact of 
such a decision on the economy, tourism and the environment 
has not been thoroughly evaluated.
<P>
	Can the minister say whether he will agree to set up a special 
parliamentary committee to evaluate the impact of dismantling 
the rail system in eastern Canada and if he is prepared to order a 
moratorium on the abandonment of rail lines until the 
committee has completed its work?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
CN and CP must follow a very well-known process for 
abandoning activities in certain regions of the country. We do 
not intend to impose a moratorium. The hon. member is no doubt 
aware that the railways have already disappeared from some

per cent of Canadians support the federal government's 
initiative to fundamentally redesign and restructure the social

to deal with the serious problem of child poverty, the serious 
problems families face and the high long term unemployment of 
older workers is to have contemporary programs that meet those 
needs where the funding goes toward the people who need it and 
not simply to those who administer it.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>What steps have been taken by Revenue Canada since the decision of the 
Supreme Court of Canada regarding the Glenn Williams Case (92 DTC 6320) 
requiring Revenue Canada to reconsider its interpretation of the scope of the 
exemption from income taxation due to Indians under the jurisdiction of the 
Indian Act?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, following the decision rendered by the Supreme Court, 
the department reviewed the decision and issued a preliminary 
position near the end of 1992. A period of transition was put in 
place to allow Revenue Canada time to assess the scope of any 
negative impacts of the case and to allow affected individuals 
and organizations time to reorganize their affairs.
<P>
	To clarify the application of the Indian tax exemption, 
revenue officials received input throughout 1993 from Indian 
organizations and individuals regarding the types of situations 
that could be affected by the Williams decision. Between June 
and October 1993, meetings were held across Canada with 
interested parties. Inaddition to the input obtained at the 
meetings, the department has received close to 250 letters and 
submissions from interested parties.
<P>
	The department, based on all the input obtained and a sound 
analysis of the case, developed proposed guidelines for the 
interpretation of the Williams decision. The  guidelines are a 
fair and liberal interpretation of the tax exemption provided by 
the Indian Act.
<P>
	The draft guidelines were sent to some 200 Indian 
organizations and individuals on December 15, 1993. The 
department will accept comments on the draft guidelines until 
the end of March 1994. As the guidelines were not issued until 
near the end of 1993, the government is extending the transition 
period for existing employment arrangements to December 31, 
1994. This will allow those who may be adversely affected to 
study the guidelines and rearrange their affairs if they so wish.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-14, an act to provide borrowing authority for the fiscal year 
beginning April 1, 1994, be read the second time and referred to 
a committee.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The Chair recognizes the hon. member 
for Charlesbourg, who has eight minutes left.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
not easy to pick up where one left off, but I will try.
<P>
	I said earlier that I would concentrate on the impact on 
defence spending. In this connection, for the benefit of the hon. 
member for Kingston and the Islands who said that Kingston is a 
bilingual city, I have here an article dated March 3, which says 
that the military base's French school is not allowed to post its 
name in French on the outside of the school. I think that is rather 
revealing. ``We wanted to emphasize the French character of the 
only place in Kingston where our children can speak French. In 
town, everything is in English''. It is easy to say Kingston is 
completely bilingual, but this is not borne out by the facts.
<P>
	My next point is that when the Department of National 
Defence and the Department of Finance made cuts in the defence 
budget, there were plenty of things we did not bother to mention 
and accepted without a murmur, because in Quebec we have 
always been somewhat deprived in this respect. In fact, the 
Minister of National Defence admitted that Quebec was at a 
disadvantage as far as defence spending was concerned.
<P>
	I remember what was said in this House by the Prime Minister 
and the Minister of National Defence, when the former painted 
an idealistic picture of Canadian bilingualism and the latter, the 
Minister of National Defence, was upset that Bloc members 
refused to believe in the bilingual character of Kingston. How 
could we when we consider that at the time, Prime Minister 
Trudeau ordered the Royal Military College in Kingston to 
become a bilingual institution? And what is the situation now, 
20 years later?
<P>
	Kingston graduates are ``officially'' bilingual. In fact, 
francophones who attend the institution are perfectly bilingual. 
Anglophones have a very limited knowledge of French, so 
limited that they do not feel comfortable speaking French and 
lose that limited knowledge as soon as they graduate. This is 
from a report by the departmental committee on Canadian 
military colleges released in May 1993. These statements were 
not drafted by Bloc members, sovereigntists or separatists. This 
was in a report on military colleges by the Department of 
National Defence.
<P>
	The Prime Minister said that Canada's linguistic duality was 
not exclusive to francophones in Quebec and included all 
francophones outside Quebec as well. When making these 
decisions, he probably overlooked the following: If 
bilingualism is the rule, why do the vast majority of officers 
from the Maritimes go to the Saint-Jean military college to 
become truly bilingual?
<P>
	We should also remember-and I want to include the Royal 
Roads College in Victoria as well-that if we consolidate 
military training at a single college, there are many people in 
Western Canada who will not opt for a military career because 
they would have to leave the West and come to Ontario. The 
same applies to the Maritimes, because most officers who 
studied at the Saint-Jean Royal Military College were from the 
Maritimes and the province of Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jacob:</B> I have the figures. You can ask questions when I 
finish my speech.
<P>
	At the Saint-Jean military college, anglophone students are in 
immersion for five years. Francophones have a chance to 
practice their English on a regular basis and, unlike the 
anglophones, are motivated to learn English because later they 
will have to work in other anglophone provinces or on 
peacekeeping missions within the international community, 
where English predominates.
<P>
	The Saint-Jean military college is the only college that 
produces francophone and anglophone officers who are truly 
bilingual and who understand the linguistic and cultural duality 
which has been on the Prime Minister's lips since the beginning 
of the 35th Parliament.
<P>
	This government has just made a decision which, according to 
all concerned, has no sound economic basis, because an 
institution of higher learning, a university that must embody the 
four pillars of officer-training, which are military instruction, 
university training, second-language training and physical 
education, should not have to meet narrow financial criteria.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	The Minister of National Defence has stated that I had 
encouraged him to make cuts in military spending, but 
definitely not in Quebec. The minister said I was applying a 
double standard. But I want to remind him that, in terms of the 
money spent on infrastructures, Quebec, with only 13 per cent of 
those expenditures, was not getting its fair share, whether from a 
per capita or a budget point of view. In the document entitled 
<I>Budget Impact</I>, the minister himself clearly illustrates what I 
said in my previous presentation in this House.
<P>
	Indeed, the minister tells us that in 1993, Quebec only 
received $302 per capita, while the Canadian average is $398. 
For a population of 6.7 million people, this translates into an 
annual loss of about $600 million, and this for more than 20 
years now. This money not invested in Quebec represents more 
than $10 billion, a sum which surely would have helped create 
permanent jobs.
<P>
	When we asked for cuts in the defence budget, we were 
convinced that this kind government, which wants to keep the 
bad Bloc Quebecois members from destroying the great country 
that Canada is, would show us that Quebec had suffered such a 
prejudice because of this imbalance in the defence budget, and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1926"> 1926 </A></B>
<P>
that this injustice would be corrected by not eliminating what 
little our province had got in the first place.
<P>
	Again, when confronted with figures quoted by the hon. 
member for Saint-Jean, the Minister of National Defence said 
that indeed Quebec's percentage of the defence budget was 
smaller. The minister also said that he appreciated the hon. 
member's arguments to the effect that Quebec is at a 
disadvantage, but added that it was because of its geographical 
location in Canada. How can the minister and his government 
confirm that Quebec is at a disadvantage and ask us to put up 
with yet more cuts, when we have already suffered a prejudice 
for  more than 20 years? If our location put us at a disadvantage 
during the Second World War, how can it once again put us at a 
disadvantage today?
<P>
	Moreover, it is misleading to say that 22 per cent of military 
spending is now made in Quebec. Again, the Minister of 
National Defence pointed out that after the budget under study 
the percentage of military expenditures in Quebec has in fact 
increased, because of major cuts in the rest of the country. That 
share, which was 19 per cent yesterday, is now 22 per cent, this 
in spite of the closing of the Collège militaire royal de 
Saint-Jean and the downsizing of the military base.
<P>
	Indeed, how can the minister say that when the figure of 22 
per cent is only an estimate for 1997? To imply that this is the 
estimate for the present is to stretch things quite a bit. The same 
goes for the statements made concerning the Royal Military 
College in Kingston, and that concerns me.
<P>
	I also want to say something about the comments made by the 
Prime Minister and the Minister of National Defence who said 
that if the government had listened to the Bloc Quebecois and 
cut 25 per cent of the defence budget, it would have been 
necessary to make even greater cuts in Quebec. In fact, if the 
government had made such a cut without affecting Quebec it 
would only have brought the expenditures made in our province 
in line with the per capita average spending for the rest of 
Canada. It would also have provided an argument for the few 
federalists still waiting for a justification of the Canadian 
federalism.
<P>
	Not only was the Liberal government quite prepared to make 
cuts in Quebec, but it also showed its arrogance and its 
unfairness by closing the military college which is the least 
costly to run. It decided to close the Collège militaire royal de 
Saint-Jean in spite of the departmental report which I quoted 
earlier and which recommends that all three military colleges 
remain open and that operations be streamlined.
<P>
	In my opinion, the recommendation made by the departmental 
committee is certainly a good one, considering that the closure 
of Royal Roads and the Collège militaire royal de Saint-Jean 
will only translate into savings of $34 million. By comparison, 
the hon. member for Waterloo, who is one of the minister's 
colleagues, mentioned that if we put restrictions to the 
relocation of military personnel moving from one base to 
another, which cost $118 million last year, we would easily save 
$35 million.
<P>
	I am not done but unfortunately my time is up.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réjean Lefebvre (Champlain):</B> Mr. Speaker, in light of 
the budget tabled two weeks ago and the additional information 
provided by the Minister of Finance since, it would seem that the 
Liberal government has taken no serious action to prevent 
duplication between certain federal departments as well as 
between levels of government or to check squandering in the  
public administration. We know full well that year after year the 
Auditor General unearths outrageous cases of waste.
<P>
	Of course, the Minister of Finance says he is reducing the 
operating budgets of the federal bureaucracy, but that is not 
enough if we are to stop living above our means. The 
government cannot expect, with the kind of expenditure level it 
is forecasting, to lower the individual tax rate in the medium 
term, a move which would really contribute to restore the 
confidence of Quebecers and Canadians in the economy.
<P>
	Basically, the government is not addressing the chronic 
government deficit problem when it fails to rationalize its 
spending. Moreover, it is relying on a very slight economic 
recovery to reduce the deficit. With the underground economy 
constantly gaining ground and given, among other things, our 
level of taxation, there is no way that government revenue can 
increase faster than the sum total of revenues generated by 
economic activity, the GDP. In fact, the government is only 
moving funds around from one budget item to another without 
reducing expenditures as a whole.
<P>
	As for the unemployment insurance reform, it reflects the 
contempt of Liberals for the jobless. Minister Axworthy admits 
to be pursuing the following objective, namely to force 
recipients to work longer to continue to qualify for the same 
number of weeks of benefits. As if people chose to be 
unemployed and to work only a given number of weeks. This 
program is intended to provide income support to workers and 
must not be seen as a way of life in combination with work.
<P>
	This reform without any job creation incentive results in 
pushing the unemployed toward welfare, thus passing the buck 
to the provinces. The young will bear the brunt of this reform as 
they are the ones having a hard time finding long-term jobs.
<P>
	The problem with unemployment in Canada and Quebec is the 
lack of available jobs and increasing numbers of temporary jobs. 
The government must promote work and make it accessible to 
all.
<P>
	The infrastructure program will do nothing to address job 
insecurity as only temporary employment will be created with 
the billions sunk into it.
<P>
	With regard to the implementation of this program, many 
rural municipalities in Quebec feel left out because they have 
done infrastructure work in the past two years. Take for example 
the municipality of Saint-Maurice, with a population of 2,195. 
In 1991-92, this municipality spent $413,000, or $95 per 
person, on non-subsidized infrastructure work. The standard for 
work not covered by the new program is as follows: the cost of 
work done over the past two years, divided by the total popula-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1927"> 1927 </A></B>
<P>
tion, up to a maximum of $80 per person, $80 being the 
provincial average for municipalities in this category.
<P>
	Such a criterion clearly favours municipalities which have not 
done capital work during the period covered by this 
administrative requirement. One way to resolve this problem 
would be to abolish this criterion and thus not penalize anyone.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	Although the Quebec Department of Municipal Affairs is 
responsible for applying the program, I wish to point out to the 
Liberal government the situation of many small Quebec 
municipalities, which is cooling their enthusiasm for this 
program and its economic benefits.
<P>
	For nearly ten years, I was mayor of a small municipality in 
my riding, and every budget item was minutely examined by my 
council so as not to burden our constituents with a deficit. All of 
a sudden, the federal and provincial governments are urging the 
municipalities to borrow, which will endanger their future 
budgets because of the famous calculation based on spending 
and investment in 1991 and 1992. What I conclude is that both 
the federal and provincial governments want our small 
municipalities to go further into debt. I wonder if these 
governments are not jealous of how these municipalities 
operate. I think our governments have some lessons to learn 
from these municipalities, which can restrain themselves and 
balance their budget.
<P>
	The municipality of Saint-Maurice which I took as an 
example has to spend $175,000 in 1994 and $175,000 in 1995 
before it receives a cent in subsidies, which will be allocated one 
third, one third and one third.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to deal with one last subject: the 
reduction in the age credit. As we all know, taxpayers aged 65 
and over can claim a tax credit of 17 per cent of $3,482 from the 
federal government and 20 per cent of $2,200 from Quebec. This 
credit reduces federal income tax by about $610 a year for all 
seniors who have to pay income tax. In Quebec, this credit also 
reduces provincial income tax and the combined reduction is 
about $1,050 in Quebec. The change made in the latest budget is 
intended to reduce this credit for seniors whose net income 
exceeds $25,921; the credit will be reduced by 15 per cent of the 
individual's net income which exceeds this amount.
<P>
	This government measure will affect 800,000 people, 
including 600,000 middle-income people in our society. As we 
can see from several examples, the Liberal government is saving 
money at the expense of the unemployed, young people and 
seniors. What is even more striking in this budget is the lack of 
any long-term planning for lower deficits and job creation 
incentives.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
ask the hon. member what he thinks of the fact that, a few weeks 
ago, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce surveyed its 
members. It asked whether federal policies encourage 
businesses to leave the country. As mentioned in the headline, 
Canadian business people are not satisfied with the way this 
country is governed. You see, Quebec sovereigntists are  not the 
only ones thinking that the country is poorly managed at the 
federal level; the Canadian Chamber of Commerce and its 
members think so, too. According to surveyed members of the 
Canadian Chamber of Commerce, 22 per cent of these business 
people have partly left the country, are in the process of leaving 
it or have left it entirely. It is because of federal policies that 
business people gave such a straight answer to the questions 
asked by the Canadian Chamber of Commerce in its survey.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	This proves that Canada is poorly led, that the policies of the 
federal government, of the finance minister, do not meet 
business people's requirements. When the Minister of Finance 
says he wants to create jobs, he does not talk about what 
business people need to survive. It is business people who create 
jobs. It is businesses that create jobs. Why are they telling the 
minister that 22 per cent of them would rather leave Canada than 
continue to work and create jobs in Canada?
<P>
	It is so serious that we in the Bloc Quebecois have decided to 
promote Quebec's sovereignty. We sincerely believe that 
Quebec's sovereignty will enable us to manage our affairs with 
honour and dignity, to meet the needs of Quebecers and those of 
our small and medium-sized businesses so they can survive, to 
reduce unemployment and create prosperity. Does the hon. 
member agree with my comments?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lefebvre:</B> Mr. Speaker, of course, when the Chamber of 
Commerce expresses an opinion on certain issues, we must 
listen to it. I think that we in the Bloc Quebecois work to keep 
our people in Quebec. In that sense, I support the hon. member's 
comments.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I acknowledge the hon. member's credentials from 
municipal politics, from the parish councils. I too have a 
background.
<P>
	Having said that, we must realize that the member's 
experience would indicate the reason this government brought 
in the infrastructure program was that the municipalities 
requested it. For some 10 years the municipalities requested that 
the federal government cost share with the provincial 
governments and the municipal governments in infrastructure 
development.
<P>
	If the municipalities are so jealous or so negligent as to not 
want to share, I am sure that the other provinces would gladly 
accept their allotment of money for infrastucture programs. We 
have found in all of the provinces that the requests far 
outnumber the ability to begin infrastructure. I would remind 
the member as well that this is not short term work, it is long 
term infrastructure that every town, every municipality in 
Canada requires to sustain economic development.
<P>

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lefebvre:</B> Mr. Speaker, the Bloc Quebecois agrees in 
principle with the infrastructure program, but we do not agree 
with the calculations done for the years 1991 and 1992. We 
support the rest of the infrastructure program and we agree that 
municipalities should have this kind of program.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jon Gerrard (Secretary of State (Science, Research 
and Development)):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am proud to speak today on 
Bill C-14, the borrowing authority bill to implement the 
budgetary measures.
<P>
	In this, my first speech in this Chamber, I would like to begin 
by thanking the people of my riding of Portage-Interlake for 
their support and their confidence in me.
<P>
	From Long Point, a finger-like extension which juts out into 
the north end of Lake Winnipeg, jusqu'à l'usine de beurre de St. 
Claude; from Denbeigh Point on Lake Winnipegosis past 
Fairford, Ashern, St. Laurent to Winnipeg Beach, Stony 
Mountain on to La Salle and Domain, this is my constituency of 
Portage-Interlake, Manitoba.
<P>
<B>(1540 ) </B>
<P>
	In some ways it is a microcosm of the problems and of the 
opportunities that exist today in our country. There are large 
commercial fisheries on Lake Winnipeg and Lake Manitoba. 
The fisheries, like those on the east coast, are having difficulty 
at the moment.
<P>
	Last year we had a very wet summer and our farmers 
experienced serious difficulties, many of them with fusarium 
head blight infection. In spite of these difficulties there are 
many positives such as beautiful scenic spots, some high quality 
soils, good pasture for cattle, the creative imaginations of local 
leaders who have produced the Interlake interactive television 
network, perhaps the most advanced distance interactive 
network for high schools in Canada.
<P>
	Let us face facts. For 60 years for much of this region large 
numbers of young people have been moving away because we 
have not done enough to create job opportunities and we have 
not done enough to develop an environment which allows the 
local entrepreneurial spirit to develop new and diversified 
businesses.
<P>
	For those who live in the 11 First Nations communities there 
are staggeringly high effective levels of unemployment; 60 per 
cent to 90 per cent plus in most of the communities.
<P>
	It is time for change. The budget and the estimates have 
started that change, a change from the reliance on the old 
economy to the development of the new.
<P>
	Today I want to speak specifically about the role of science, 
technology, research and development in the promotion of the 
new economy. As outlined in the budget and the estimates, our 
government has put considerable emphasis on this area. Because 
of considerable fiscal restrictions we have had to do less than we 
might otherwise have wanted to do in supporting some specific 
projects, the space station or KAON, for example.
<P>
	In our approach to science, technology, research and 
development we have laid out our plans within the context of the 
philosophy embodied in the Liberal election platform, 
``Creating Opportunities'', our red book:
<P>
	``First, by stressing the notion of partnership with all sectors 
of society we think we can re-organize our total national 
resources, public and private, not only to be more efficient but to 
take advantage of strategic economic and social opportunities 
that can only be realized when all of us are working together.
<P>
	Second, we wish to focus our efforts on leverage points to 
enable the impact of federal efforts to be as large as possible, 
particularly in times of tight fiscal resources.
<P>
	Third, if we want to have a country that works we have to 
measure whether specific government programs actually deliver 
results over time. Whether it is in health care or regional 
development, it is important to measure the long term outcomes 
and consequences of our policies and our programs. That is why 
we have placed so much emphasis on evaluation, innovation and 
finding best practices''.
<P>
	Over the course of the next several months our government 
will be undertaking a series of new federal initiatives in science, 
technology, research and development. We will be consulting 
with Canadians over the course of this period as we develop 
these initiatives, as we review the current federal spending in 
science and technology.
<P>
	A primary aim of our research and development approach will 
be to lay the foundation for the generation of both short term and 
long term wealth.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	One of the main objectives of our approach to research and 
development is to do the necessary groundwork to attract more 
research to Canada, both in the long and short term.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We have an urgent need to find solutions to present high 
unemployment. We need to emphasize research and develop-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1929"> 1929 </A></B>
<P>
ment in parts of the economy with great potential for growth, 
including information technology, telecommunications, 
broadcasting, computer services,  especially software 
development, environmental services and in medical and 
biotechnology areas.
<P>
<B>(1545 ) </B>
<P>
	It is also important to continue to have a solid foundation of 
support for basic untargeted research because the precise source 
of the next advance is never fully predictable. At the same time 
we must pay particular attention in developing or enhancing 
programs which are effective in converting advances in basic 
research into jobs and economic opportunities, whether they lie 
in advance materials, in information technology, biotechnology, 
agriculture, fisheries, transport or other areas.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Initiatives aimed at establishing partnerships based on the 
lever principle to maximize our efforts, are important.
<P>
	Another important goal of our strategy is to develop a culture 
of innovation in Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Our second important objective is to create a culture of 
innovation in Canada. Creating this culture means showing 
leadership by being innovative. It means showing leadership by 
including research and development components as central 
elements in the way our government works, whether in the way 
we promote industrial development, in the way we achieve 
effective change to our income support programs, or in our 
innovative development of pilot programs, for example, like the 
Canada Business Service Centre in Winnipeg to ensure we have 
the research and development base to ensure high quality and 
cost efficiency.
<P>
	A third goal of our research and development strategy must be 
to make better use of sophisticated current research and 
development approaches to design and implement government 
programs and to assess outcomes of these programs.
<P>
	This goal must apply to new programs as well as existing 
programs including those involved with health care, income 
support, learning, resource management and so on. We as a 
government must use our resources with the greatest possible 
efficiency. This means continually assessing and testing our 
approaches.
<P>
	A fourth and final goal of our research and development 
strategy is to integrate all our approaches to maximize the 
quality of life for Canadians. An enhanced quality of life is an 
important result of research and development efforts. Research 
into health care, child development and environment is an 
important component of this thrust.
<P>
	It is our objective to work with Canadians from one end of the 
country to the other to utilize research and development and to 
support the development of a new economy in Canada. We have 
some marvellous models, some shining examples of success. 
One is the city of Waterloo, a community which has been hurt 
over the last  several years with the loss of thousands of jobs in 
traditional sectors.
<P>
	I visited there recently. Through an extraordinary research, 
development and training partnership between the university 
and business, the largest co-operative program in the world, the 
community has built upon the opportunities of the new economy 
to replace the large majority of the lost jobs through the 
development of new businesses and new industries.
<P>
	Initiatives such as the information highway will play key 
roles in promoting growth in the new Canadian economy. To this 
end I spoke at the beginning of February in Toronto at the 
Information Technology Association of Canada to outline the 
government's goals in developing a Canadian strategy for the 
information highway. Our goals are threefold.
<P>
	First, we want a strategy which emphasizes employment 
opportunities through innovation and investment. Opportunities 
for Canadians are our top priority.
<P>
	Second, we want a strategy that emphasizes Canadian culture 
and Canadian values. In essence we believe the cars and the 
trucks of the information highway, the information packages, 
may be as important or perhaps even more important than the 
highway itself. We want to be sure that Canadians can learn 
about Canadian achievements and Canadian success stories 
through the information highway.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We want to make sure that Canadians can be made aware of 
Canadian successes and achievements through this information 
highway.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Third, we want a strategy which will give Canadians universal 
access at reasonable cost. All Canadians, whether rich or poor, 
whether rural or urban, must be able to take advantage of the 
opportunities of the information highway. Initiatives like the 
media centre in the constituency of the hon. member for 
Broadview-Greenwood and Larry Geller's freenet in rural 
Sprague, Manitoba, may be very important in bringing these 
dreams to reality.
<P>
<B>(1550 ) </B>
<P>
	The information highway provides extraordinary 
opportunities for communities to take control of their own 
destiny wherever they may be located. The example of North 
Bay is inspiring.
<P>
	Ten days ago on February 25, just three days after the budget 
which will result in a considerable reduction of personnel at the 
base in North Bay, the community was going full steam ahead 
with plans to make North Bay a central hub on the information 
highway, to create an integrated community network for health, 
education and business, and to bring the benefits to North Bay 
and surrounding areas of the emerging technological 
opportunities. I was there that day and felt the  excitement as 
participant 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1930"> 1930 </A></B>
<P>
after participant put forth ideas and suggestions for new job 
opportunities in tourism, health, education and real estate. The 
opportunities are enormous.
<P>
	I felt a similar level of enthusiasm recently in Pinawa, 
Manitoba. I know a number of my constituents are moving 
forward in developing new initiatives for the information 
highway. Late last week at a Manitoba Trucking Association 
meeting to which I was invited there was talk of what happens 
where the freight highway meets the information highway.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Late last week, we discussed with members of the Société 
franco-manitobaine the incredible potential of a Trans Canada 
French language information network, in which Quebec would 
have a key role, of course, and which would link all francophone 
communities across Canada.
<P>
	In my own riding, I could feel the enthusiasm of people who 
would love to belong to such a network, when I mentioned it in 
Saint-Claude, Saint-Laurent, Saint-Eustache, Fannystelle and 
La Salle. These communities will finally have access to the tools 
they need to deal in French with the problems they face 
regarding learning, health care and business, as well as to other 
opportunities which otherwise would not have been available to 
them.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We shall shortly be setting up an advisory council to provide 
advice on our Canadian strategy for the information highway. 
We are still open to suggestions for names for this council and 
those suggestions can be imaginative.
<P>
	I have even made one suggestion myself, remembering the 
words of our Prime Minister when campaigning in Shawinigan. 
Il a dit: ``Je vais faire mon possible''. I will do my best. I have 
suggested that perhaps the council could be called the council of 
the possible, le conseil du possible, transforming the world of 
dreams into the realm of the achievable, for that is what our 
government is about: helping Canadians to start dreaming of the 
possibilities of the information age and then working in 
partnership with other Canadians from coast to coast to turn 
these dreams into reality.
<P>
	Finally let me reiterate my government's commitment as laid 
out consistently in our election platform, the throne speech, the 
budget and the estimates. We will work with Canadians to 
develop a more innovative economy. We will use and harness 
the benefits of science and technology to create new job 
opportunities, to help Canadians develop the skills to find 
meaningful work, and to enrich the lives of all Canadians 
whatever riding they may live in. Whether in Burin-St. 
George's, Madawaska-Victoria, Hochelaga-Maisonneuve or 
my own community of Portage-Interlake, we are about 
transforming Canada through science, technology,  innovation 
and creating jobs. That is what our goal is and we are well on the 
way.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
carefully to my colleague and, at a time when the deficit and the 
debt are so much talked about, I am shocked and puzzled that all 
they are talking about is consultation. At various times, we were 
told that Canadians would be consulted on this or that.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	As far as I am concerned, and especially with regard to the 
budget and its preparation, there was too much consultation; and 
yet, unions, senior citizens, the unemployed complained that 
indeed they were consulted but that the Liberals only took what 
they liked.
<P>
	My question to my colleague has to do with the fact that every 
year the Auditor General makes a series of recommendations 
and as he said himself, as a general conclusion to his report, that 
there are no controls and that his recommendations are not 
followed. Would it not be better to stop travelling from coast to 
coast, given the cost of such an exercise, and instead focus on 
implementing the Auditor General's recommendations?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question and concern. We are going to proceed in two fashions. 
On one hand it is important to consult Canadians from coast to 
coast. On the other hand it is important to listen to people like 
the Auditor General and to take a look at how the federal 
government works and spends at the moment.
<P>
	We have a global science and technology expenditure in the 
federal government at the moment of about $6 billion which 
when including tax expenditures reaches a total of about $7 
billion. It is important even as we proceed to look at how we can 
develop an innovative economy, how we can use the principles 
of leverage, and how we can look at outcomes of government 
programs. It is also important to review how we are making our 
current expenditures to make sure they are up to date and are the 
most effective they can be.
<P>
	Even though we have committed very substantially in the 
budget to research and to new dollars for research, for 
innovation, for a Canadian technology network, for a Canadian 
investment fund, for dollars to put together an engineers' 
program and a variety of other contributions and initiatives, we 
intend to review how we are currently spending those dollars 
that go toward science and technology across the broad 
framework of departments.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1931"> 1931 </A></B>
<P>
	It is not necessarily an easy task. It will need a lot of 
co-operation among departments, but we think it is important to 
do so because it is very important to spend wisely even as we 
move forward on important initiatives to promote innovation 
and research.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières):</B> First of all, Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to congratulate my colleague, the 
Secretary of State for Science, Research and Development, for 
his maiden speech in which he demonstrated a broadness of 
outlook.
<P>
	I would like to ask him to what extent he is sensitive to the 
drastic changes presently occurring on the geopolitical scene 
and which mean that the whole defence industry is being 
transformed.
<P>
	We know that thousands of jobs have already been lost and 
thousands more will be lost in the next few years, and they were 
highly technical jobs as the red book of the Liberal Party pointed 
out. I would like to know to what extent his government is 
sensitive to that phenomenon, since it was in the red book, but it 
has not been mentioned since October 25. In my opinion, it 
would take some strong and courageous action by the 
government to help the companies affected switch from military 
to civil applications.
<P>
	In this context, I would like to ask him whether he considers 
that the construction of a high speed train in the 
Quebec-Trois-Rivières-Windsor corridor could compensate, 
technically and financially, the cancellation of the helicopter 
program? Also, does he not think that MIL Davie of Lauzon, 
builder of military ships, mostly for the Canadian government, 
which has set its own plan of conversion to civil work, should be 
given immediately the contract to build the ferry for the 
Îles-de-la-Madeleine, to offset current economic pressures? 
These initiatives would be in line with the proposals of the red 
book.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is very important for us, in 
Canada, to consider what is going on in the world. The things 
you mentioned, that is the changes in the military situation, are 
really important. There is more than one answer.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There are all sorts of opportunities which have to be looked at 
very carefully. I gave the example of North Bay. North Bay is a 
community very significantly affected recently by the decrease, 
the reduction in the base.
<P>
	When I was there what was phenomenal was that three days 
after the budget, in the wake of this announcement that this base 
was going to be reduced and the NORAD headquarters was 
going to be moving, people from the health area, the education 
area and the business area were brought to the community to 
work together to build an integrated community network, to 
build a strategy for  the information age that would put North 
Bay at the hub of the information highway in northern Ontario.
<P>
	That is but one example and the examples that the hon. 
member chose were different. We have to look at these 
opportunities as we build for the future and we have to look at 
new technologies, just as the member suggests. Perhaps in this 
way we can move forward together to build for Canada the new 
highways, some of those information highways, other highways 
and trains, perhaps, that will join this country together in new 
ways and build a better country for all of us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Comuzzi (Thunder Bay-Nipigon):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
compliment my colleague for his maiden speech in the House of 
Commons. It was well put and very thought provoking.
<P>
	We know how important the information highway is and will 
be for all of Canada in order to develop our educational 
resources and our health resources. I wonder if my colleague 
would mind spending a few moments to tell the House, and 
through the House the rest of Canada, how the information 
highway that he envisages will assist the small and medium 
sized businesses in this country in which we have all conceded 
the jobs that Canadians so sorely need are going to be developed.
<P>
	The question is how would the information highway assist 
these small entrepreneurs in order that they may benefit from 
this remarkable technology?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a big question and a complex 
one. In point of fact, the information is enabling in whatever 
domain, whether in farming, fishing or tourism. In tourism, for 
example, using the internet we can tell about the beauties, the 
opportunities of our areas, and reach 30 million people more 
easily than we might in any other way.
<P>
	In real estate, we can take clients through a tour of a farm 
house, a factory, a residential house without having to be there. 
Thus, we may be able to better market the properties to people 
who are interested in moving and better show people areas 
without having to travel around quite the same way.
<P>
	There are opportunities that people have already begun to 
take. In Newfoundland, for example, with the TETRA network 
there are individuals who have been able to move their fish 
culturing, their aquaculturing, much further ahead because they 
were able to talk on computer networks with people in British 
Columbia and learn about techniques which would move their 
business forward faster.
<P>
	The information, the libraries, the possibilities of the future 
are endless. What we need to do is look at those opportunities, 
build on them and make sure that our communities are able to 
profit from them.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, hon. members' statements were quite interesting 
today. I could not help but think back to two conversations that I 
was engaged in over the last couple of weeks. The first 
conversation took place during a meeting I attended at which 
one of the speakers was talking about the information highway. 
The question from the group of people who were there came 
back: ``What does that mean to me, I am still on a party line?''
<P>
	In other words, what the person was saying was that our 
telephone system and the links that connect all of our homes in 
this country have not yet reached the technological level at 
which the benefits of an information highway can reach all 
Canadians.
<P>
	Last week I visited one of the 22 Indian reserves in my 
constituency. On that reserve we were talking about the 
municipal infrastructure program and the ability of that program 
to fit a telephone system for the reserve. There are only three 
telephones on this reserve of 400 people. They cannot even call 
out their fire department. We talk about communications 
breakdown in this country. That community cannot even call out 
its fire department because it is not linked.
<P>
	The municipal infrastructure program may not help with a 
communications infrastructure.
<P>
	I am just wondering, to the hon. member who just spoke about 
the information highway and the growing technology that we are 
developing in this country, how we can apply the fairness of a 
good idea to all communities where our technology has not yet 
reached.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> Mr. Speaker, what the hon. member speaks of 
is very important. However, we have made significant strides in 
Canada. We have 90 per cent plus of the people on digital phones 
already, which is much higher than the United States. Although 
we have a long way to go we can apply our existing 
infrastructure program to the electronic highway as well as to 
routine infrastructure.
<P>
	It is important for each community to look at how it can best 
position itself and use the infrastructure and other opportunities 
to bring it into the future and into the 21st century.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The question and comment period has 
expired. We just ended five hours of debate on Bill C-14.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The rules require us to go to 10-minute speeches without 
questions or comments. It happened while the minister was 
speaking and therefore it takes effect after he finishes the 
questions and comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to debate on Bill C-14. I wish to speak to this bill in the 
context of the overall budget presentation by the Minister of 
Finance.
<P>
	On the eve of the presentation of that budget the Prime 
Minister gave to the Minister of Finance a new pair of boots. 
Work boots, they were. By that act the Prime Minister said: ``I 
am with you, Mr. Minister, and we want to get the people back to 
work''.
<P>
	The boots have no direction in and by themselves. The 
minister provides the direction and that is where things went 
awry. He created great expectations. A new process was 
presented to this House of Commons. We had a prebudget debate 
as never before. We had cross-country consultations from one 
end of this country to the other. It all turned out to be nothing 
more than smoke and mirrors. The individual Canadian felt 
uninvolved and unconnected.
<P>
	Only an elite group of people was involved in the prebudget 
consultations. The Minister of Finance came back and told this 
House that the people were not opposed to broadening the tax 
base. It really meant increasing taxes. The people said: ``You did 
not hear us. We do not want our taxes to increase''.
<P>
	He raised another expectation that this was going to be a tough 
budget. The people paid attention when the minister said that. 
They expected that the budget cuts would be tough and deep and 
that the budget cuts would be cutting particularly to the big 
spenders. They were willing to accept a tough budget not 
because they wanted less but because they knew it was the right 
thing to do.
<P>
<B>(1610 ) </B>
<P>
	It was right for them. It meant hope for jobs. It meant less 
government and interference in their business. It meant hope for 
a decent return on their investment and it contained prospects 
for continued prosperity. They also thought it was good for their 
children. In addition to those things they would get, their 
children would benefit through lower taxes, through a stronger 
dollar and a stronger economy.
<P>
	What did we get? We got a blurred vision. We expected 
fairness and equity in cuts. While there were some cuts they 
were neither fair nor equitable. We got cuts in research which 
cut the KAON project in western Canada without a 
corresponding cut in central Canada. Research funds were 
increased for central Canada.
<P>
	When one of the politicians in Ontario was told about the 
benefits and the characteristics of the KAON project, he was 
overheard to say that if it is that good it should be in 
Ontario-some foundation for equitable distribution of funds 
across Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1933"> 1933 </A></B>
<P>
	Second, we expected the budget to have an overall decrease in 
government spending. Instead, we got an increase of $3 billion. 
That increase adds to the national debt and smashes the hopes 
for lower taxes in the future.
<P>
	Third, we were told that jobs would be plentiful. We 
discovered that the infrastructure program was to be the flagship 
that would start the economic engine and provide jobs. We 
looked for evidence as to where this would happen. There was 
none. The projected unemployment rate remains virtually 
constant throughout the projected budget years. Six billion 
dollars of infrastructure but no change in unemployment-what 
gain in jobs?
<P>
	Fourth, we were promised that interest rates would remain 
stable, a little hope at last. We were suspicious. With increased 
spending and a larger debt could it be that interest rates would 
not rise? Last week the financial markets began to scold us and 
other borrowers globally. Especially in the United States 
interest rates began to rise.
<P>
	The world around us is changing and Canada will be affected, 
whether the minister admits it or not. Rising interest rates spell 
bad news for a country that depends increasingly on foreign 
creditors to finance its government habit, annual deficits of $40 
billion to $50 billion.
<P>
	Our little calculators and computers showed us very clearly 
that as interest rates rise, interest payable rises, the deficit goes 
up, the proportion of the GDP required for interest payments 
goes up and our taxes go up, the very opposite of what we 
wanted.
<P>
	The Prime Minister at various times in this House used words 
to tell us in effect that it is not good, indeed it is not moral, it is 
not carrying out our responsibility as guardians of the public 
purse if we do not pay increased spending with an increase in 
taxes.
<P>
	It is immoral and irresponsible, he said, to place the burden 
for paying for our uncontrolled spending on the shoulders of our 
children and our grandchildren. He is the same Prime Minister 
who said to the finance minister: ``Here is a new pair of boots''. 
What for? To kick us and our children into an increasingly 
dismal future? We got a budget that destroyed both the vision 
and the promise of the Liberal red book as well as the promise 
for a tough and fiscally responsible finance minister.
<P>
	Some say that is just a bunch of partisan rhetoric. Let us look 
at the international markets. Both stock and bond markets have 
taken a fright to the present prospect of higher U.S. and global 
interest rates. In this frightened market the finance minister 
added $40 billion of debt. That brings it now to a total of $550 
billion by 1995. That is $20,000 for every man, woman and child 
in this country. As the interest rate rises the Canadian taxpayer 
must pay more. The discretionary spending decreases, the 
number of jobs is reduced and our consumer confidence  goes 
down. Add that together and it is no surprise that people talk 
about a tax revolt.
<P>
	However, it is not only interest rates. It is also confidence in 
the Canadian dollar. On March 2 and 3 the Canadian dollar 
dropped to below 74 cents. It is still there today. That increases 
the difficulty to borrow money from foreign creditors. All this 
adds up to an abrupt re-evaluation of Canada because the rest of 
the world is changing. Canada is not.
<P>
	For example, the U.S. economy is growing at more than twice 
the rate of the Canadian economy. Its debt ratio to GDP is about 
half that of Canada. Hence, a rise in interest rates affects the 
market economy much less than it does Canada.
<P>
<B>(1615 ) </B>
<P>
	Within this context, the Minister of Industry said: ``Many of 
our fellow citizens approach the future with more anxiety than 
hope. Our mission as a government is to offer hope but if hope is 
to be meaningful, it must be realistic. And so we have put forth 
in this budget a plan for the revitalization of the Canadian 
economy, a plan which I believe addresses the challenge and 
recognizes the opportunities that await Canada''.
<P>
	He then details a number of significant proposed plans and 
initiatives, many of which I agree with and commend him for. Of 
particular merit is the Canadian scholarship program of $24.7 
million and the action agenda to help small business growth and 
to continue to generate jobs for Canadians.
<P>
	I applaud him as he emphasizes ``the need to change the 
culture and attitudes of employers and employees alike to the 
adoption of new technology. Advances in science and 
technology are driving productivity improvement everywhere in 
the world. In the 1990s no country can insulate itself from these 
new developments. We must organize ourselves to keep up with 
cutting edge technology and where possible move ahead. This is 
the essence of creating well paying jobs and growth in this 
decade.''
<P>
	He promises $100 million for the Canadian investment fund 
over four years and adds: ``We will continue to seek additional 
funds in the private sector''. The government will seek 
additional funds in the private sector. Where does he think the 
$100 million contribution came from? Did he create it? Did it 
fall from heaven? Did it come from the Prime Minister? No, it 
came from Canadian taxpayers, the most private sector there is.
<P>
	The greatest catalyst for business is a reduction in taxes, a 
reduction in regulations, an elimination of interprovincial trade 
barriers, common standards of excellence in education and well 
trained personnel.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1934"> 1934 </A></B>
<P>
	I challenge the minister. Will the Minister of Finance admit 
that this budget will not decrease government spending, will not 
decrease the tax burden of Canadians, will not lead to deficit 
elimination and will not meet the Liberal red book deficit 
reduction entirely? Will he instead challenge every 
parliamentarian and every committee to examine the estimates 
and then ask them to provide amendments that will decrease 
total government spending, that will at least not increase taxes 
to Canadians and lead to deficit elimination. Then the Minister 
of Finance will give Canadians a clear mission to provide hope 
and build confidence. He will be able to walk with pride in the 
new boots the Prime Minister gave him and we will have a 35th 
Parliament that will be democratic.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> To the member for 
London-Middlesex who perhaps was not here before the 
speech began, under Standing Order 74 we have to go to 
10-minute speeches with no questions and answers. It throws 
everything out for everybody.
<P>
	For example, the next speaker is not a member of the Reform 
Party. It is the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Parliamentary Secretary 
to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is the 
first opportunity I have had to make a speech in the House. I 
want to congratulate you on your appointment.
<P>
	On February 22, Canada's finance minister stood before the 
House to release the first budget of Canada's 35th Parliament. 
By doing so, the government took the next step toward 
completing a process that began for us a long time ago, a process 
that originated with the desire to bring economic prosperity 
back to Canada and to bring personal dignity back to Canadians.
<P>
	The recent election made evident that Canadians shared the 
Liberal vision of a better tomorrow, a tomorrow where a top 
priority of government is jobs and economic growth, a 
tomorrow where government acts with integrity, with respect 
for the constituency that it represents, a tomorrow where social 
programs are reinforced and strengthened by a caring 
government and not sacrificed under the banner of deficit 
reduction, a tomorrow where the government believes that 
tomorrow begins today.
<P>
	In the recent speech from the throne we confirmed our 
determination to deliver on the commitments we made to the 
people of Canada during the last election campaign.
<P>
	On February 22, we demonstrated our commitment by 
introducing decisive measures to reduce the deficit, by showing 
Canadians where and how we are going to pay for our program 
of economic renewal. We are taking the next step toward 
implementing that vision of a better tomorrow which Canadians 
overwhelmingly supported on October 26.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	In my riding of Vancouver South my constituents have placed 
a tremendous amount of confidence and trust in me. They have 
entrusted me to come to Ottawa and to work with the 
government to ensure that their voices are heard as Vancouver 
residents, as British Columbians and as proud Canadians. They 
have asked me to battle for the interests of small and medium 
sized businesses. The majority of businesses within my riding 
are small and medium sized.
<P>
	Whether those businesses are located on Main Street or 
Marine Drive or whether they sell groceries in the Punjabi 
Market or process lumber on the banks of the Fraser River, they 
all have one thing in common. For the past nine years they have 
been frustrated and feeling excluded from the economic 
decision making process that has shaped the country.
<P>
	As a small business owner for most of my life I have promised 
small business in my riding that I would work with this 
government to promote positive initiatives, initiatives which 
will encourage growth and security for Canada's small and 
medium sized business sector.
<P>
	Traditionally the Liberals have focused much of their 
attention on the enhancement of the small business sector. I am 
proud to say that this budget reaffirms our commitments to 
small business by providing it with tax relief and by improving 
its access to capital. This budget provides the two ingredients 
crucial to building a vibrant business culture. Most important, 
however, the budget allows small business owners to do what 
they do best; manage their businesses.
<P>
	While this budget makes significant progress in addressing 
the key issues for the smaller business sector, some challenges 
still remain. One of the most significant challenges that small 
businesses face is attitude, the attitude that big is better. This 
must change. If small businesses are to flourish the measures 
taken in this budget will make substantial progress toward 
eroding this attitude.
<P>
	Another significant challenge to the small business sector is 
the increasing paper burden. This burden has hindered growth 
and reduced productivity for many businesses. We must find a 
way to alleviate the paper burden.
<P>
	A further challenge to growth in the small business sector is 
the GST, long seen as a thorn in the side of small business. We 
must find an alternative to the GST so that Canadians will once 
again have the confidence to invest and to take risks, a process 
which is essential for growth.
<P>
	My constituents have also asked me to be frugal with their tax 
dollars. British Columbians are honest and hard working people. 
They are angry with the way they have seen governments spend 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1935"> 1935 </A></B>
<P>
their tax dollars. During the election the people of Vancouver 
South asked me to work toward putting an end to the waste and  
mismanagement of past governments and to act responsibly 
with their tax dollars.
<P>
	The government knows we cannot ask Canadians to pull 
together in hard times if we are not ready to make sacrifices. The 
budget demonstrates that we are willing to make those 
sacrifices: a smaller, less expensive cabinet, the Gagliano plan, 
and a ``just the facts'' budget all demonstrate the government's 
commitment to ensuring that the hard earned tax dollars of 
Canadians are not wasted. The government knows that we must 
continue to work with Canadians to make the tough choices 
needed to get our financial house in order.
<P>
	My constituents have asked me to ensure that we do not 
compromise when it comes to our environment. I consider 
myself very fortunate to come from British Columbia, a 
province that has both a mild climate and unparalleled beauty. 
After experiencing my first winter here, I am confident that 
when I initiate a private member's bill to move the national 
capital from Ottawa to Vancouver I will receive tremendous 
support.
<P>
	British Columbia offers a unique natural environment which I 
humbly submit is unequalled in the rest of Canada. It is a 
combination of mountains, oceans and forests, which ensures 
that British Columbians remain conscious of the impact our 
actions have on the environment.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	No government owns the oceans, land or air, yet every 
government has a responsibility to protect our natural 
environment for present and future Canadians. We must never 
forget that we are only the trustees of this world. Our challenge 
is to pass it along to our children in a cleaner and healthier state 
than it was passed to us.
<P>
	I hope to work very closely with cabinet, both in my capacity 
as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans and as a representative of a constituency very much 
concerned about protecting our environment.
<P>
	My constituents have also asked me to ensure that 
government remains compassionate, both nationally and 
internationally. During the election my constituents asked me to 
ensure that despite the pressure to cut back on government 
expenditures, a Liberal government would maintain Canada's 
record of compassion and continue to provide for those areas of 
our society which need our help.
<P>
	February's budget announcement allowed me to return to my 
riding and show my constituents that the government, while still 
acting responsibly, has remained compassionate. Whether it 
means ensuring fair pensions for the elderly or providing 
opportunities for less fortunate Canadians, the government will 
not abandon those in need.
<P>
	But compassion does not end at home. In some countries in 
the world freedom is not a right, it is a dream. In some countries 
in the world human rights abuses continue regularly unchecked. 
Many of my constituents come from countries which have track 
records of human rights abuses. They know first hand the 
difference between good and bad democracy. They are confident 
that Canada as a role model for human rights and compassionate 
government will not lose sight of its international responsibility 
as a facilitator for justice. They are confident that this country 
will never allow itself to be silenced by commercial interests 
when speaking out on human rights issues.
<P>
	My constituents asked me to represent their diversity. Like 
Canada, my constituency has a diverse ethnic and cultural base. 
Many of my constituents are first generation Canadians. They 
have come here with their hopes and dreams and have become 
part of the Canadian mosaic. They offer us diversity, a diversity 
which I believe contributes greatly to Canada's national 
identity. It is our responsibility as the Government of Canada to 
ensure that we continue to represent our nation's diversity, that 
we continue to represent the constituency which we serve.
<P>
	The Liberal government is proud to be working to include a 
truly representative cross section of Canadians. I am proud to be 
a part of that change.
<P>
	I inherit a proud tradition in my riding of Vancouver South. 
Nestled between West 41st to the north, Canada's largest 
fishery, the Fraser River to the south, and Boundary Road to the 
east, my riding has had a long history of demanding a high 
quality of representation from their elected members. John 
Fraser served Vancouver South for 20 years and during that time 
was distinguished with being the first member of Parliament to 
ever be elected Speaker of the House. It is in that tradition of 
strong parliamentary representation that I am privileged to 
follow.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to humbly thank my constituents 
for placing their trust in me to represent them at the federal 
level. My constituents have placed a tremendous challenge 
before me which I am proud to meet. Every long journey begins 
with the first step. On October 26 we took our first step on the 
journey toward economic prosperity for Canada. On February 
22 we took another long stride.

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is my duty, pursuant to Standing 
Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be raised

member for Capilano-Howe Sound, Immigration; the hon. 
member for Rimouski-Témiscouata, National Arts Centre; the 
<P>

<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to have this opportunity today to voice a different opinion on the 
last budget and on the impact it will have and not have on people 
in Canada in general and in my riding in particular.
<P>
	The Canadian budget exercise is something extremely serious 
and we cannot speak about it lightly. It very often means life or 
death for projects or economic activities on which individuals 
depend. For example, in my riding mining is very important and 
generates income for the whole country.
<P>
	Some people have criticized the budget because it does not do 
enough to create jobs for Canadians. Others have criticized it as 
well because it does not deal strongly enough with the national 
debt. Very often, deluged by figures, Mr. and Mrs. Average 
Citizen, do not know who to believe and why they should trust 
anyone. A budget should inspire confidence.
<P>
	Although the budget is an accounting tool which allows the 
government to evaluate its financial capabilities for the coming 
year, it is often perceived by Canadians more as a means of 
taking more money out of their pockets than a tool for 
improvement and progress.
<P>
	With an accumulated debt of over $500 billion, and consistent 
deficits, year after year, how can Quebecers and Canadians have 
any confidence in their government? What should we do so that 
this exercise, which is so important to the country's economy, 
does not always, or nearly always, end up being a source of 
frustration but rather a tool of choice to fire up the country, if not 
bring it back to life?
<P>
	Canada's economic situation does not allow the finance 
minister to give presents to taxpayers, they understand that, but 
to give the budget a positive image does not necessarily require 
presents.
<P>
	Following the last budget, I heard many Canadians say on 
open-line shows how disappointed they were with it. I am not 
going to say whether they were right or wrong. Obviously, the 
Minister of Finance cannot please everyone, but he must try to 
correct inequities.
<P>
	When listening to these people on the radio, one realizes that 
the budget could have a much more positive image if people 
could see in this accounting exercise the promise of some 
changes for themselves and people around them.
<P>
	During one of these open-line shows, a lady gave her opinion 
of the budget saying that even though she was personally 
affected by it, she agreed to pay more taxes, as a retired senior, 
to improve the country's financial situation. But she also said 
that, with a deficit still that big, and despite her willingness to 
pay more taxes, it might be an exercise in futility.
<P>
	Another caller, who introduced himself as a federal civil 
servant, said that he was also obliged to do his share for the 
country, without being asked to, by accepting a further wage 
freeze, but added that he would have hoped that major 
companies would also have done their bit.
<P>
	I only gave the example of two citizens in the Hull-Ottawa 
area who, even though they were disappointed, accepted to 
support the last budget, knowing probably that their efforts 
would help control the deficit.
<P>
	I am certain that there are other members in this House who 
could give as many if not more examples of Quebecers and 
Canadians who agreed, willy-nilly, to support the fight against 
the deficit. Faced with such examples of courage among our 
fellow citizens, I wonder if the government is really trying as 
hard as they are to control the deficit.
<P>
	How are Mr. and Mrs. Joe Public to believe that the 
government is truly making an effort to curb the deficit when 
year after year, the Auditor General of Canada tables a report 
rife with examples of waste and mismanagement and when no 
serious attempt seems to be made to reverse the situation?
<P>
	How are we to believe that things will change and that people 
will put their trust in this new government and in the new 
budget?
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	In its recent budget, the Liberal government indicated that it 
would be considering ways of replacing the GST with another 
tax, one that would not, of course, be less expensive since the 
government still needs revenues, but one that would be more 
efficient. Unfortunately, people heard the same song and dance 
from the Conservative government when the GST was 
introduced. Yet, it cost more today to administer the GST that 
the former tax, besides which the GST does not really generate 
more revenue. All this after taxpayers were forced to spend 
millions of dollars to meet GST requirements.
<P>
	How are we supposed to trust the government once again 
when it speaks of a new tax, when all of the experts are saying 
that we should wait until this same GST is improved before we 
think about bringing in a new tax. How are we to restore the 
public's trust in its institutions? The steady increase in taxes 
gives the public all the more reason to turn to the underground 
economy and to contraband. The government has to start by 
finding a way to make legal work viable.
<P>
	High levels of public expenditures and government 
indebtedness impede economic growth to the same degree as the 
underground economy and smuggling.
<P>
	If it is to enhance the government's credibility, the budgetary 
process must be transparent. High-income earners would be 
willing to make additional sacrifices provided, of course, they 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1937"> 1937 </A></B>
<P>
saw in the budget that the government was prepared to do 
likewise.
<P>
	In the past, governments have always favoured tax increases 
or taxing target groups, the aim being not to hit everyone at the 
same time. The preferred approach seems to be: divide and 
conquer. With the result that those who are penalized are 
frustrated with those who are not and vice versa the following 
year, except that we remember only of those years when we are 
personally affected.
<P>
	Such a policy may be profitable for a government in want of a 
new mandate, but this is not the kind of policy which promotes 
solidarity among fellow citizens or confidence in their elected 
representatives, if they think that taxation policies are often 
arbitrary and selective if need be.
<P>
	The Canadian people would agree to make an effort if the 
government was demonstrating by its actions the firm will to 
tackle its pattern of expenditures instead of cutting a little in this 
or that item.
<P>
	The Liberal government could have shown a great deal of 
openness and transparency to restore the confidence of 
taxpayers by accepting that the committee requested by the 
Official Opposition on many occasions be set up to review all 
government programs as well as their budgets.
<P>
	I think it was easier for the government to say that we already 
have the Standing Committee on Public Accounts than to accept 
to be faced with questions from the public through the Official 
Opposition.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance himself said in his budget speech that 
it was not enough to cut here and there, that fundamental 
changes were required. Does this means that the government 
intends to do as much to reduce its own spending as it is asking 
from the taxpayers?
<P>
	On the subject of joint efforts to reduce the deficit, would the 
taxpayers not find that the thing to do on the part of the 
government, when they are facing a drain of over $14 billion in 
taxes over the next three years, would be to cut government 
spending further instead of announcing that it will increase by 
another $4.4 billion during the same period?
<P>
	Taxpayers would be proud of their government if it took the 
initiative of streamlining government structure not from the 
bottom up, but the other way around and reviewed its programs, 
because only 12 per cent of government programs are actually 
assessed and, even then, not always with regard to performance 
but only to ascertain that funds are well administered, that is to 
say that they are going to the right place. Savings of only a few 
percentage points on a budget of $123 billion-without taking 
interest into account of course-resulting from a review of 
operating budgets and the rationale of certain programs, would 
put a very substantial amount back in the public purse, and the 
taxpayers would appreciate that.
<P>
	In closing, Mr. Speaker, the people of Canada as well as those 
of Quebec have the right to require from their government more 
transparency in its budget, more fairness, more self-assessment 
and that its make as much of a sacrifice as it asks from the 
taxpayers.
<P>
	When that has been achieved, the vast majority of Canadians 
will trust their government more and certainly accept to make 
all necessary efforts to fight the deficit.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Marlene Cowling (Dauphin-Swan River):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as I stand before this House to deliver my maiden 
speech I want to say how honoured and proud I am to be part of 
this new Liberal government in this 35th Parliament.
<P>
	I firmly believe our Minister of Finance has delivered a 
budget which lives up to our campaign promises in the red book. 
This budget will bring back a renewed sense of confidence and 
hope to the people we serve.
<P>
	I come to this House as a farmer from a rural constituency on 
the prairies. My constituency is Dauphin-Swan River. I would 
like to take a few moments to tell hon. members in this House 
about it.
<P>
	Mine is a rural constituency in the northwest region of 
Manitoba. It is very large geographically. The major industry is 
agriculture with all of the infrastructure and necessary support 
services that go along with that. In addition we have forestry, 
commercial fishing and tourism.
<P>
	Within the boundaries of Dauphin-Swan River are two 
major parks, one federal and one provincial. Our agricultural 
base is well diversified. Our land base is one of the most fertile 
and productive in western Canada.
<P>
	Even more diversified than our economy are our people who 
derive from a broad and diverse cultural and ethnic base, 
including 13 native reserves. It is this very diverse group of 
people who on October 25 placed their confidence in me to 
represent their interests in this place. I thank them for this 
marvellous opportunity to serve. I assure them I will do 
everything in my power to live up to their expectations.
<P>
	Of course the good people of Dauphin-Swan River did not 
just vote for me. They also voted for a party and a leader who had 
a plan. It is a plan to create economic growth and put Canadians 
back to work, a plan to stabilize the agri-food industry with a 
national food security policy, a plan to establish a new 
partnership with aboriginal peoples, a plan to preserve and 
enhance our social safety net, a plan to lead Canadians into the 
21st century with a renewed sense of confidence, optimism and 
hope.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1938"> 1938 </A></B>
<P>
	That is what the people of Dauphin-Swan River voted for. 
They have a right to expect no less. That is what we will deliver.
<P>
	There are a number of initiatives already undertaken by the 
government which I am sure the people of Dauphin-Swan 
River will view favourably. The cancellation of the helicopter 
deal was a campaign promise that was kept. The conclusion of 
the GATT negotiations will be a particularly encouraging sign to 
the farm families involved in the grains and red meat industries 
in Dauphin-Swan River and in western Canada. These 
industries require ready access to export markets and cannot 
help but be pleased at the prospect of an end to the international 
grain trade wars.
<P>
	The hon. minister of agriculture should be complimented on 
his handling of the very sensitive final stages of the GATT 
negotiations.
<P>
	The mayors, the reeves and their respective councils of the 
towns and rural municipalities in Dauphin-Swan River are 
anxiously awaiting responses to their applications on the 
infrastructure program so that they may use the jointly funded 
program to the advantage of their communities and of course to 
create jobs.
<P>
	Let us now look at some of the additional provisions of the 
budget speech itself.
<P>
<B>(1645 ) </B>
<P>
	In addition to the infrastructure program there are a number of 
provisions which will be viewed favourably by the people of 
Dauphin-Swan River: the government's commitment to 
economic renewal and job creation through the establishment of 
a new internship and apprenticeship program and the 
establishment of a Canada youth service corps; the 
government's commitment to research and development, 
particularly agricultural research; the government's 
commitment to the development of an information highway 
which could be of great consequence to the future development 
of rural Canada; the government's commitment to establish a 
centre of excellence for women's health; the government's 
commitment to establish a national forum on health chaired by 
the Prime Minister; the government's commitment to a 
consultation process to replace the GST; the government's 
commitment to enhance the opportunities for small and medium 
sized businesses in the Canadian economy; the government's 
commitment to provide stability in transfer payments to the 
provinces.
<P>
	All of these commitments are clearly reflected and are 
provided for in the budget. All of these provisions will be 
viewed positively by the people of Dauphin-Swan River. They 
will be seen as a constructive step forward in fulfilling our 
election promises.
<P>
	Finally we have a government which will restore honesty and 
integrity and openness to our institutions of government.
<P>
	Finally we have a government which is prepared to give the 
highest priority to job creation and economic growth.
<P>
	Finally we have a government which is committed to 
strengthening the social fabric of Canada.
<P>
	Finally we have a government which is committed to the 
sound management of our nation's financial affairs not to just 
talk about it, but to do it.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Congratulations to the member on her 
maiden speech.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to represent my own convictions, those of my constituents and 
millions of other Canadians.
<P>
	I rise to voice my profound concern over an issue of the 
highest import. Other issues pale into insignificance compared 
with the substance of Bill C-14, an act to provide borrowing 
authority for the next fiscal year. If it is passed the bill before us 
will authorize the government to borrow up to $34 billion, 
adding still more to the debt that is already without precedent in 
Canadian peacetime history, an astronomical sum which is 
difficult for us to even comprehend.
<P>
	It troubles me deeply that this bill has received so little 
attention and so little talk on the other side of the House. We 
need the attention of the nation today. We need all members in 
this House, members who are watching on television or reading 
<I>Hansard</I> to sit up and notice the incredible event that is taking 
place.
<P>
	It is obvious that the government considers this bill a fait 
accompli, a routine proceeding, just a boring formality to thrust 
this legislation in the face of an indignant opposition, listen 
awhile to its useless tirades and then pass it without second 
thought. The government has adapted easily to the incredulous 
thought of borrowing $34 billion.
<P>
	We all enjoy the ability to adapt to new situations. 
Adaptability is a coping mechanism and it allows us to live in 
truly abnormal ways and yet somehow develop a frame of mind 
which sees a situation as normal even though circumstances are 
far from it.
<P>
	We see people with major disabilities get on with their lives 
and live happily. On TV we watch the kids in Sarajevo 
tobogganing the day after the shells stop falling. This is a good 
quality. It allows us to make the best of a bad situation.
<P>
	This ability to adapt also has its downside. We can become 
desensitized, unable to detect the lowering of standards about 
things which would have shocked us just a few short years ago. 
That same adaptability allows soldiers to shell children in 
Sarajevo and find it acceptable.
<P>
	Somehow I fear that this ability to adapt has enabled this 
government to descend into a fiscal frame of mind that allows us 
to think the unthinkable and accept it as normal. To illustrate, let 
me quote from the Auditor General's report of 1976. He said: ``I 
am deeply  concerned that Parliament and indeed the govern-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1939"> 1939 </A></B>
<P>
ment has lost or is close to losing effective control of the public 
purse''.
<P>
<B>(1650 ) </B>
<P>
	The deficit in 1976 was $6 billion. The debt was just $37 
billion but it was not considered normal at the time. The 
situation was regarded as nearly out of control.
<P>
	Consider for a moment the Lambert commission, a royal 
commission on financial management that reported in 1979. The 
commissioners noted that our debt to GNP ratio was twice the 
figure of the U.S. government, and what was the deficit in 
Canada in 1979? It was just $13 billion. The debt was only $61 
billion, a pittance today. The government was so alarmed that it 
appointed a royal commission to investigate it.
<P>
	The words that this government speaks merely echo those that 
have been spoken over the last two decades of deficits, seeking 
to cast the deficit and debt in the light of normality, trying to 
save face, attempting to lull the electorate into believing that our 
situation is somehow acceptable.
<P>
	Little by little, year by year we spin neat phrases and explain 
it with eloquent phrases and words and clever accounting tricks 
that merely hide the deadly truth a little longer. We are like frogs 
swimming in a pot of hot water. We do not know that we are 
going to be the supper until the water is boiling. It may be too 
late if this bill and this budget are passed by this House of 
Commons.
<P>
	Governments often, for example, pull out their shabby 
comparison between debt to GNP ratio with our ratio just after 
World War II, saying that our situation was the same then, do not 
worry. They do not mention that the entire world was different. 
The baby boom was beginning. The U.S. was the unchallenged 
economic world leader with a burgeoning economy and an 
insatiable demand for our natural resources.
<P>
	There was no global competition, no necessity for intensively 
trained workers as there is today. Our position today is uniquely 
perilous. A child could see it, but this House continues to hide its 
eyes.
<P>
	In February this government brought in a budget and acted in 
precisely the same way as its old political enemy, the 
Conservatives, who took no real action against the deficit, and 
demonstrated that they had no will to change the status quo. 
What are the consequences of maintaining the status quo?
<P>
	A few weeks ago I attended a seminar with the senior 
economist of Burns Fry Limited. After comparing our economy 
with the state of other world economies, he stated that he 
believes we may well have come to the point of no return. There 
is no way we will ever be able to pay our debt back. Our 
economy will become permanently hampered by our debt and 
we will become progressively poorer as a nation. That is the 
result of maintaining the status quo.
<P>
	When we see the size of the debt and the size of the deficit, 
governments past and present should hang their heads in shame. 
It is a debt of $20,000 for every man, woman and child in 
Canada. The plan is to add another $100 billion to that debt. This 
is a virtual guarantee that future budgets will be able to offer 
Canadians even less in the way of essential services, even less in 
the way of job creation, less tax relief and even less of a future.
<P>
	In the 10 minutes it takes for me to finish this short 
presentation we will have piled another four million dollars on 
our national debt.
<P>
	How could we have come to this? I believe we are all sincere 
and reasonably intelligent men and women. Could it be a 
systemic problem, a deep rooted problem with our political 
process that in some cases derails the public interest?
<P>
	I believe our problem is systemic. It is a difficult, pernicious 
problem that threatens to engulf this nation in a sea of debt. The 
problem is the strict discipline that political parties impose on 
their own members. It is a shame, really, especially since 
political parties were originally formed in response to the public 
demand for good government, government that would not cater 
to special interests or be bought with the taxpayers' own money.
<P>
	Party affiliation has allowed Canada to have stable 
government, but in recent years it has also led to governments 
whose agendas have been set by a select few people at the top. 
Something has gone wrong. Voters have come to the conclusion 
that strict party discipline has paralysed Parliament, making a 
mockery of true democratic principles. Members are not free to 
vote for what they know is right. They have to vote for what their 
leaders tell them is right.
<P>
	Today we are considering a historic bill, an infamous bill. It 
may be the bill that renders our fiscal situation truly impossible. 
We are grinding our economy into mincemeat and offering little 
to hundreds of thousands of desperate and frustrated workers.
<P>
	I know that many members opposite and those watching on 
television disagree with the course of this government and I 
want to speak directly to them today.
<P>
<B>(1655 ) </B>
<P>
	Listen to the stinging indictment of the <I>Globe and Mail</I> 
editorial from last week: ``This generation of Canadians in this 
Parliament is imposing a lower standard of living on the next 
generation through sustained, profligate borrowing. The 
national government is turning into a large and feeble creature, 
sapped of the power to take initiatives, presenting a caricature of 
leadership. This budget makes a mockery of Jean Chrétien's 
promise of a return to the good old days. In the good old days the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1940"> 1940 </A></B>
<P>
future was not mortgaged to the selfishness and cowardice of the 
current generation''.
<P>
	This government speaks words, words and more words; words 
of calm assurance to its backbenchers that all is well. However, 
the backbenchers should be aware that those words are also 
accompanied by the not so subtle warnings of the school yard 
bully: ``If you don't vote how we trained you to vote, no more 
favours. If you don't go through the motions, jump the party 
hoops, bow and scrape to our policy of disaster, you're out of the 
club''.
<P>
	Many government members will remember a few short weeks 
ago when they were told by their party how to vote on the 
selection of the vice chairs of the standing committees of this 
House. They will not quickly forget how some of the party 
veterans worked the committee rooms using their influence to 
ensure that backbenchers did as they were told, forcing them to 
vote for separatist MPs as vice chairs of every single committee.
<P>
	How quickly the die is cast. How easily they have been poured 
into the mould that we had hoped was broken after the last 
election.
<P>
	Now on Bill C-14 they have been told once again not to vote 
for what is obviously in the public interest, not to vote for their 
conscience, vote the party line even if it means stealing from 
their grandchildren. Members opposite have been lulled into a 
sense of false security by the calm demeanour of their party 
handlers. They have been deceived by smooth words and bullied 
by quiet party threats to think that borrowing $34 billion in 
addition to the $500 billion we already have is somehow 
acceptable.
<P>
	I hope their adaptability serves them well. I hope they will be 
comfortable when the debt rises to $600 billion and the IMF 
moves in and imposes cutbacks on Canada. I hope they will be 
flexible when the dollar falls through the floor and Canadians 
begin to live with a crisis similar to the one that engulfed New 
Zealand only a few years ago. I trust they will calmly adapt when 
their grandchildren ask why they did not vote for their interests, 
why they thought only of themselves. I hope they have already 
formulated a plan to cope with an enraged electorate after it has 
experienced the effects of Liberal actions.
<P>
	There is a way out. I understand and agree that the 
government is charged with bringing in a budget and ordering its 
legislative priorities. That is as it should be. Let there be no 
mistake. The vote on Bill C-14, and even the next generation 
will see it as such, is a vote of conscience as much as any other 
vote in this Parliament could be. It deserves the treatment that 
the Reform Party has been calling for for years. It deserves a free 
vote in this House.
<P>
	I truly believe that if government members looked into their 
hearts they would say it is not in the public interest to add this 
much debt and deficit on to the Canadian people.
<P>
	There is a simple answer. If only 40 backbench MPs wanted 
action and not words they could alter the course of Canadian 
history, they could defeat Bill C-14 and the Reform Party would 
not request dissolution. The government could try again and 
bring down a more acceptable budget. Those few members 
could revitalize this House and the economy and Canadians 
would be spared the shock that they will otherwise feel in the 
years to come.
<P>
	We are engaged in a battle today, an economic struggle 
against poverty and want. At this critical time when we need to 
marshal all of our national resources for the fight, the Liberal 
leaders have laid down their weapons and ordered their troops to 
raise white flags. It is too soon for any member to surrender to 
anything but the national interest.
<P>
	The Reform Party of Canada calls upon all members to take 
courage, to take up the power of the votes and fire an opening 
round against the deficit by defeating Bill C-14, not for any 
party or for any low political purpose. Do it because conscience 
compels it. Do it because the good of the nation demands it and 
do it because our children's tomorrow depends upon some 
discipline today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there are several models of governing which a society 
or a community of people could choose in order to determine 
how it wishes to be governed and how it hopes to achieve its 
common goals. Of all the models, the democratic model 
demands the longest period of time for identifying, clarifying, 
implementing and assessing these goals. Without any doubt, it is 
the most expensive in terms of time and human energy required 
for the tasks that are essential for its maintenance and survival. 
It could also be the most expensive financially. However, there 
is no other model of governance that is superior to the 
democratic one, for it is in the democratic process that the very 
nature of man is recognized and taken into consideration.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	Over a lengthy period of time a network of systems has 
emerged that have attempted to meet the individual's physical, 
mental, social and spiritual needs. But all of this is taking place 
in local, national and global environments which are in a 
constant state of flux, constantly changing.
<P>
	It is imperative for our society to be in harmony with these 
fluctuations. It is not always an easy task to identify the 
changing forces and the long range directions. It is equally 
difficult to determine the emergent needs of our peoples and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1941"> 1941 </A></B>
<P>
their institutions. A dictator could readily solve these problems 
according to his own whims or fancies.
<P>
	However, in a democratic society we must turn to the people 
for guidance and that is exactly what this government did. With 
a new leader the Liberal Party of Canada proceeded on an 
uncharted course, one in which every constituency had the 
opportunity to provide their perceptions and recommendations 
through representatives, not only from every facet of our society 
but from a multitude of other foreign sources. All this resulted in 
the Liberal plan which our Prime Minister stated ``is a plan for 
Canada, anchored in the principle that governing is about people 
and that government must be judged by its effectiveness in 
promoting human dignity, justice, fairness and opportunity''.
<P>
	No doubt the opposing political parties in this House of 
Commons subscribe to similar principles. However, the big 
problem is how are these principles to be achieved. As an 
example the Official Opposition has clearly revealed it must 
devote all of its energies to the accomplishment of one goal, that 
being the separation of Quebec from Canada no matter what the 
cost might be. The third party, the Reform Party, is obsessed 
with the state of the national deficit and the national debt. It 
feels it can effectively promote human dignity, justice, fairness 
and opportunity by slashing federal programs and services in 
order to eliminate the deficit within three years.
<P>
	Economists throughout the entire world warn that such a 
move would wreck the social network and play havoc with our 
economy, leading to unimaginable social and economic 
problems. Both opposition parties maintain policy positions of 
special interest groups and in no way do they reflect the needs of 
the vast majority of Canadians. The Liberal government is here 
to serve all Canadians.
<P>
	The consultative process has never ceased to operate and in 
fact it intensified as we prepared for the presentation of the first 
budget. This government received input in a variety of ways 
from all over Canada. This government read and analysed the 
written communiques. This government listened to the people. 
This government acted in a responsible and constructive 
manner. This government, in light of all the problems with 
which it had to deal, set out a budgetary plan which has its 
foundations in people.
<P>
	As an example I would like to share part of a letter received 
from several constituents in my riding of Thunder 
Bay-Atikokan. They state:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Our knowledge of politics and economics is very limited. But we don't think 
it takes a masters degree to realize that when the taxes go up, consumers don't 
buy; it is as simple as that. A reduction in taxes will give consumers more money 
in their pockets and they will be more likely to go out and spend it. Taxing 
benefit packages will serve to remove more money from the economy and stifle 
whatever remaining consumer interest there might be.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	That is from a letter received from Messrs. Thompson, House, 
Boyd, Wolotko and Brodie from the city of Thunder Bay. The 
government heard these concerns and did not raise basic taxes. It 
did not tax benefit packages.
<P>
	They also, like millions of their fellow Canadians, expressed 
their anxieties related to the unemployment-employment 
situation. These concerns were heard and collectively they 
determined where the major thrust of the 1994 budget would be: 
in a host of programs and measures that would enhance the 
prospects for the creation of jobs and continued economic 
growth.
<P>
	I would like to give a few examples of budget initiatives that 
will have an early impact. First, the rollback of unemployment 
insurance premiums to the 1993 level of $3 for 1995 and 1996. 
This represents a saving of $300 million a year for the 
reinvestment in new jobs. The revival of the residential 
rehabilitation assistance program will make $50 million a year 
available for the construction industry. Making the home 
buyer's plan permanent allows first time home buyers to use 
RRSP funds to buy homes.
<P>
	With the reallocation of budgeted existing expenditures, jobs 
will be created with the national infrastructure program, youth 
internship and apprenticeship programs. The government 
intends to renew and revitalize Canada's outdated social 
security system within two years and to deliver better service to 
those in need, thus ensuring the social safety net remains 
affordable.
<P>
	These are but a few of the many budgetary measures 
stimulated by the Liberal plan for Canada, as found in ``Creating 
Opportunity,'' the red book, a plan that promotes human dignity, 
justice, fairness and opportunity for all Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
Tuesday, February 22, the hon. Minister of Finance delivered his 
budget speech in this House. That day, announced a few weeks 
earlier, was awaited with interest by Quebecers and Canadians 
alike. The people of Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, who 
elected me to represent them in the House of Commons, were 
also expecting a lot from this budget. They expected the 
government to start by living within its means and allow people 
to earn a decent living for themselves and their families, as 
every citizen is entitled to. They also expected the government 
to respect seniors who contributed to the development of 
Quebec and Canada, which, a few years ago, was among the 
most prosperous countries.
<P>
	Like myself, the people of my riding are disappointed and 
cannot understand how, after democratically rejecting a 
government that did not meet their expectations, they are now 
governed 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1942"> 1942 </A></B>
<P>
by Liberals who are proud to have the same policies as the 
previous government, the Tory government.
<P>
	The real solutions to restore the confidence of Quebecers and 
Canadians lie in tackling the deficit, reducing departmental 
waste and duplication, reviewing tax measures, and creating 
permanent jobs.
<P>
	This government put in place, before the budget, a municipal 
infrastructure program, which will create some 45,000 
temporary jobs. Once the roads and sidewalks have been paved, 
the workers will go back home to live off whatever is left of the 
unemployment insurance program. However, this program will 
cost Quebecers and Canadians $2 billion in federal taxes, $2 
billion in provincial taxes and $2 billion in municipal taxes.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	Quebec and Canada need stable permanent jobs that generate 
progress and development. Has this government thought of 
developing the transportation industry in Canada? As transport 
critic for the Official Opposition, I listened carefully to the 
finance minister's speech. When I heard him present his 
forecasts to us, I said to myself that a government cannot build 
the future of a people on temporary projects. Maybe in a few 
minutes, he will announce a major project, something that will 
excite the people's enthusiasm, one that will serve several 
provinces or all of Canada, but the speech ended and I heard 
nothing, except the following paragraph that I quote from 
<I>Hansard</I> of February 22: ``The Minister of Transport will 
implement needed improvements to the surface freight 
transportation system with his provincial colleagues and 
stakeholders''.
<P>
	When the Minister of Finance presented the government's 
policies for the next few years to this House, I expected him to 
give more importance to one of Canada's basic industries, 
namely transportation. Since this House opened, we have 
suggested possibilities to him.
<P>
	Several projects could develop the economy, and I mention 
some that I would have liked to see in the budget speech: the 
future of the rail system, the high-speed train, the future of air 
transport and the future of the merchant marine in Canada.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance had no concrete solution in his 
budget speech for improving transportation and thus solving the 
problems of economic development and unemployment.
<P>
	If you allow me, Mr. Speaker, I would like to tell this House 
about the benefits of these projects for economic development.
<P>
	First, there is the rail system. Canada's railways have brought 
the people together from the Atlantic to the Pacific. They 
developed the Canadian West. They also enabled Canada to 
become one of the world's largest wheat producers and to 
transport this product from coast to coast across the country. Yet 
today, at a time when other countries use railway transport as the 
basis for their development, the Canadian government is 
abandoning it everywhere in the country and particularly in 
Quebec.
<P>
	The National Transportation Agency authorizes the 
dismantlement of numerous lines by CN and CP while, as I said 
earlier, these two carriers keep coming up with projects, 
especially in Quebec.
<P>
	Without a drastic move to support railway transport, both for 
passengers and for freight, Quebec and Canada are going to be 
stuck with a spiralling increase of costs, not only because of the 
maintenance of the road network and the accidents which occur, 
but also because of the energy inefficiency and the pollution 
associated with automotive transport. The government, and the 
Minister of Transport in particular, must urgently develop a 
policy which will first take into account the public interest and 
which will be firmly turned towards the next century. Most 
industrialized countries, including the United States, are 
already doing so. I formally ask for a moratorium on any new 
abandonment of lines, as well as for the setting up of a 
parliamentary task force to conduct an in-depth review of the 
impact on the economy, tourism and especially the environment, 
of transport services as a whole in Quebec and in Canada.
<P>
	Let us now talk about the high-speed train. I mentioned that 
our party had made suggestions to the government to develop 
the transport sector and improve the economy. Yet, the 
government and the Minister of Finance did not take our 
suggestions into account in the budget. What a surprise to hear 
the Minister of Transport tell a CBC reporter that setting up a 
high-speed train link between Quebec and Windsor was not a 
priority. Yet, on February 1, I described to this House all the 
benefits a high speed train along the Quebec City-Windsor 
corridor would have for Quebec and for Canada.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	I have read and reread the report the Working Group 
submitted on May 31, 1991, to the Premier of Quebec, Mr. 
Robert Bourassa, and to the Premier of Ontario, Mr. Bob Rae. 
This report bears the signature and meets the approval of key 
figures known to be influential members of the Liberal party 
now in office.
<P>
	I do not think that I have to convince anyone in this House that 
Canada does need short-term jobs to boost the economy, but it 
also needs long-term jobs to solve the economic problems it is 
facing. The Working Group mentioned in its comments that it 
had the distinct impression, like a great many representatives of 
the industry, the business community and the population in 
general, that a high-speed train providing hourly service 
between the cities of Quebec, Trois-Rivières and Montreal and 
the cities of Ottawa, Kingston, Toronto, London and Windsor 
would 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1943"> 1943 </A></B>
<P>
encourage interprovincial travel and reinforce business and 
travel activities.
<P>
	The success of high-speed trains in other countries was 
proportionate to the will of the governments to change the 
attitude of consumers by regulating mass transit and providing 
direct financial support.
<P>
	It is also important to note that improvements to the 
commuter-rail system and regional rail services could reduce 
the use of private cars, particularly where there are traffic jams 
on highways close to urban areas.
<P>
	When we analyzed the proposal for construction of a fixed 
link between New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, we 
agreed, while pointing out that certain precautions were 
necessary because of the strong involvement of the private 
sector. We approved of the proposal for a high-speed train for 
the same reason we approved of building a fixed link between 
New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, because this project 
will help inject $5.3 billion in private investment into the 
Canadian economy, and this does not include indirect spin-offs.
<P>
	There is another very important component of Canada's 
transportation industry, and I am referring to air transportation. 
Our two major carriers are now restructuring after reaching 
agreement on a number of contentious issues. We must now do 
everything we can to help them get ahead and become major 
players on the world market.
<P>
	I believe we have two dynamic companies that are capable of 
opening up new markets and participating in Canada's economic 
development, and we must give them every opportunity to do so. 
For instance, would it not make sense to speed up and facilitate 
Air Canada's access to Hong Kong, a market that is bigger than 
all European markets combined? There are forecasts that in the 
next five years, there will be incredible growth in air 
transportation to and from Hong Kong, the most significant 
source of air traffic in Asia.
<P>
	Finally, I would like to mention marine transportation. The 
budget speech refers to improving surface transportation but 
does not say how.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you are signalling that my time has expired. In 
concluding, I want to say that together we can prepare the future 
of the generations of tomorrow and leave them a legacy that will 
be more useful than a deficit of over $5 billion.
<P>
	We must work together in the interests of our fellow citizens 
and ensure that future generations will have a better life. For the 
first time in North America, statistics tell us that our children's 
standard of living will be lower than ours. We cannot accept that 
without doing anything to change it, and change it we must, not 
by attacking the weakest members of our society but by building 
on the legacy of past generations.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Don Valley North):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
today I am privileged to rise to speak about the first Liberal 
budget of the 35th Parliament. I might add that this is the first 
budget I have had the pleasure and honour to address.
<P>
	Today we are considering Bill C-14 respecting the borrowing 
authority for 1994-95. The passage of the bill will raise funds 
for public works, for general purposes and for the operations of 
government. I fully support the bill because it limits the 
government's borrowing authority. The people of Don Valley 
North and many other ridings across the country voted for cuts 
in government spending. They gave their approval to the 
government's plan for fiscal responsibility.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	The budget is only the beginning of a new process which 
started on October 25, 1993. This process will deliver a major 
promise made to Canadians in the red book. We are committed 
to bringing down the deficit to 3 per cent of GDP in the next 
three years. A great deal of credit must be given to the hon. 
Minister of Finance for his part in consulting with Canadians 
from all regions and all walks of life before bringing down the 
budget.
<P>
	This first budget is a good beginning as I said earlier. It 
tackles the problem in three ways. First, it is building a 
framework for economic renewal to help small businesses and 
create jobs. Second, it is a reduction in the spending on 
government operations, on defence operations, on subsidies to 
businesses and on international development agencies. Third, it 
is a progressive reform of Canada's social programs which will 
include unemployment insurance reform, review of services for 
our aging population and social justice issues.
<P>
	On February 17 I made a statement in the House in support of 
full funding for the national literacy program. I am especially 
pleased today that the Minister of Finance pledged on budget 
day to restore full funding to this program. No budget can please 
every Canadian and this budget is no exception.
<P>
	On October 25 the Canadian people gave the new government 
a mandate for change. I am very happy to be part of the mandate. 
I will take the challenge very seriously.
<P>
	I represent the riding of Don Valley North which is located in 
the city of North York at the northeastern boundary. There are 
approximately 90,000 constituents from all corners of the world 
resulting in a diverse mixture of cultures and languages. Don 
Valley North is a riding we can all take pride in. It is a success 
story for our government's multicultural policies.
<P>
	I came to Canada in 1970 after three years in Chicago, 
Illinois. I first joined my parents in Montreal, Quebec. 
Afterward I moved to Toronto. I married in 1975 my wife, Zaza, 
and we are proud parents of four children: Raffi, Tamar, Vatche 
and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1944"> 1944 </A></B>
<P>
Gacia. I thank all of them for  their continued and generous 
support over the last few years.
<P>
	My election to the House of Commons is a significant part of 
Armenian history in Canada. The first Armenian immigrant 
came to Canada in 1887 and settled in Port Hope, Ontario. I am 
the first Canadian of Armenian descent to have the honour of 
serving in the House of Commons.
<P>
	On the first day I came to the House as a new member of 
Parliament I was so moved that I had tears in my eyes, tears of 
joy and happiness. I reflected on 127 years of Canadian history. I 
remembered former prime ministers, past leaders of the 
opposition and members of Parliament. I noticed the flag on the 
Prime Minister's bench and the Speaker's chair. There were so 
many significant symbols of this House of Parliament that I felt 
overwhelmed to be a part of its history. I rise to the challenge to 
do my best to change the course and prepare Canada for the 21st 
century.
<P>
	It has been a long journey for me, over 20 years, but I can say 
it was worth every day of it. I am no longer dreaming the 
Canadian dream. I am living the Canadian dream. I thank first 
and foremost the residents of Don Valley North for their trust 
and confidence in me. Second, I would like to thank the Don 
Valley North executive, my campaign manager, the team and the 
hundreds of volunteers. I would not have been here without the 
support of my colleagues and the captain of the A team, the right 
hon. Prime Minister. During the campaign I was very honoured 
to have my leader visit my riding of Don Valley North on a 
Sunday morning for breakfast. Over 600 constituents came to 
breakfast and learned firsthand what a great leader the Prime 
Minister of Canada was.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	In the next four or five years we will be judged by the people 
who gave us our mandate. We have been asked to bring back 
Canadian values. We have been challenged to bring prosperity 
and hope to Canadians. The budget is an important step for 
ourselves and for the next generation. I fully support the budget. 
I invite Canadians to join us in formulating the next budget. The 
process was started today. Let us work hard hand in hand and 
shoulder to shoulder toward a better future.
<P>
	In closing I remind the House of President Lincoln's speech 
on his second inaugural address when he said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Let us have faith that right makes might, and in that faith, let us to the end 
dare to do our duty as we understand it.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I congratulate the hon. member on his 
maiden speech as well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to address the House today 
on the important matter before us, the matter being the 
borrowing authority bill. Bill C-14 provides the government 
with the opportunity to borrow some $34 billion to see us 
through this fiscal year.
<P>
	I have stood in the House many times over the last five years. 
In each of those years I have seen the government come forward 
about this time, shortly after the budget was brought down in the 
House by a finance minister, and ask the House for the authority 
to borrow money in order to get it through the year.
<P>
	Each year these funds address the central problem of the past, 
that program spending has been greater than the revenues 
received by government. We have now reached a point where as 
a nation we are borrowing money simply to pay the interest costs 
on the debt that has accumulated over a number of years.
<P>
	Every Canadian manages debt of one kind or another. Many 
Canadians who purchased homes have gone to the bank and 
borrowed money in order to mortgage the facility and be able to 
live in it. Many Canadians with businesses have borrowed 
money or have incurred debt either to maintain the capital of the 
business or maintain an inventory for the business. Many 
Canadians have borrowed money for furnishings, holidays or 
whatever they want on credit cards. In each case, whether a 
home owner, a business person, a farmer who borrowed money 
for equipment to operate his farm or a consumer on a credit card, 
the debt is always considered in terms of manageability.
<P>
	As a nation we continue to ask ourselves how much money we 
need in a given year and then borrow to make up the total over 
and above what we have. The difference between us as a nation 
and us as homeowners, farmers, business people and consumers 
is that as a government we are not managing our way through. 
We have no specific plan to deal with the accumulated and 
accumulating debt other than to talk about reducing the annual 
deficit to the point where we might come to a percentage above 
our GNP. In and of itself that certainly is not good enough.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	Looking at the public debt charges we see right off the bat that 
last year the government's budgetary spending was $161 billion 
with revenues of only $121 billion, resulting in a shortfall of 
over $40 billion. This year, 1993-94, the government is adding 
$45 billion to that total. The spending will reach $167 billion 
and revenue is only $115 billion, resulting in that $45 billion 
shortfall. Of course the next couple of years continue along 
those lines.
<P>
	As I said, in and of itself that is a horrible situation. Debt itself 
when it is manageable is acceptable. When it is unmanageable, 
it is unacceptable. The situation here is the government is not 
prepared to manage that debt accordingly.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1945"> 1945 </A></B>
<P>
	When that is combined with other initiatives it leaves us in the 
position that we are rapidly losing our ability to care for the 
citizens and residents of our nation. We are rapidly reaching the 
point of losing our economic sovereignty because of the 
programs, policies and debt that have accumulated around us. 
Let me give a couple of examples of what I mean by this.
<P>
	On the debt side of all of this we recognize that much of our 
borrowing today is coming from the foreign marketplace. We 
continue to sell treasury bills and bonds to ourselves in Canada. 
However of the some $400 billion accumulated debt at the end 
of 1992 more than $80 billion was held outside Canada. It was 
held by governments or banks or others outside Canadian 
borders.
<P>
	Of that $80 billion, $8 billion a year in interest payments 
alone is leaving this country. That is $8 billion earned in this 
country by those people who are still working. It is earned and 
paid in taxes to this government, only to find that the money is 
put in buckets so to speak and transported across the border 
ending up in the hands of foreign banks or foreign governments.
<P>
	Those tax dollars which leave Canada are of no use to us. 
Everyone knows that money earned in Canada and spent in 
Canada creates a nice little circle allowing for the money to be 
used several times. However when it is put in those buckets and 
sent on trucks outside this country so to speak, that money is not 
used again in Canada. Add that to other policies of the 
government and policies of past governments that remain in 
place and it is creating a very difficult situation for all 
Canadians.
<P>
	We recognize from the Auditor General's report of two years 
ago that our tax system rewards companies that invest outside 
our borders. Canadian companies and American and other 
foreign multinationals operating in Canada and paying, one 
would hope, income taxes in Canada, that take Canadian profits 
and invest those dollars in other countries and create jobs in 
those other countries can then reduce their income tax or 
corporate tax paid in Canada.
<P>
	When foreign companies operating in Canada make their 
investments, and there have been fewer investments in recent 
years, the investments made are generally in existing Canadian 
operations. They are businesses that are producing products and 
employing Canadians. When they invest, companies are 
inevitably downsized. Foreign investment has resulted in 
unemployment in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	We used to encourage foreign investment to the point where 
jobs would be created. It would create new product. It would 
create new investment in our country. But the investment taking 
place today simply removes jobs from Canada. Of course with 
that downsizing and the so-called greater efficiency in that 
marketplace the profits earned end up going outside Canada as 
well.
<P>
	The Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement has spurred 
investment from Canadian companies into the United States. 
There is a greater influx of Canadian capital into the American 
marketplace for investment. That is not something the business 
community has criticized because of course it is very excited 
about expanding Canadian opportunities in a larger 
marketplace.
<P>
	That means that money invested in the United States employs 
workers in the United States at the expense of Canadian 
workers. If that money were invested inside Canada instead of 
inside the United States the return for Canadians would be much 
greater.
<P>
	The economic circumstance taking place is one where 
government tax policies and other policies and government debt 
make it very difficult for this country to participate in building 
jobs, what the government says is its main mandate out of this 
budget.
<P>
	Our economy is almost bent on self-destruction. This 
economy will not create jobs while we continue to support 
corporations, particularly transnational and multinational 
corporations which create jobs outside our borders. It is time 
this government took a long hard look at the way the creation of 
debt, the tax policies and the Canada-U.S. Free Trade 
Agreement have diminished the government's ability to control 
the types of jobs that can be created in our country.
<P>
	I do not want to leave the impression that perhaps all is lost. 
The important thing for government to understand is that, to use 
the language of the prairies, it must have some guts to stand up 
in the international marketplace and support Canadian industry 
and Canadian workers. It must support Canadian citizens who 
want to create a better life in Canada and to have some economic 
sovereignty within the North American and the world context.
<P>
	Canada's tremendous resources in the past have simply been 
cut down and put on boxcars, fishing boats or whatever and 
shipped off some place else to allow for job creation and sales to 
take place in other parts of the world. For years we have 
forsaken a tremendous opportunity to create jobs and wealth, 
create new wealth in Canada that circulates in this country 
creating additional jobs and additional support.
<P>
	If we continue to allow the marketplace to tell us what to do 
throughout Canada, through government, through the private 
sector, then our economy will slowly work itself down to the 
point where the only jobs left will be those servicing the 
unemployed or people on welfare. We have to find a way to pull 
ourselves out of that. Our economy cannot be allowed to shrink.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you are signalling that my time is almost up. I 
will not abuse the privilege of the Chamber, although there are 
<P>

<B><A NAME="1946"> 1946 </A></B>
<P>
probably two dozen other things I would like to mention. I thank 
you very much for your patience this afternoon.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-14, an act to provide borrowing authority for the fiscal year 
beginning April 1, 1994, be read the second time and referred to 
a committee.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Before recognizing the hon. member 
for Gaspé I would indicate for the record since there seems to be 
some misunderstanding that my list says only Bloc Quebecois 
members were to speak because of an error and there were also 
Liberal members to speak. In order to accommodate the member 
from the New Democratic Party who is allowed to speak and in 
fairness, based on my understanding of what has happened, I 
will now go to the hon. member for Gaspé.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will try not to go 
beyond my speaking time in order to allow my colleagues to 
speak in turn.
<P>
	There are two points I want to underline in the budget of the 
Minister of Finance. First off, fishermen, be they from Canada 
or Quebec, are again the ones who have to bear the brunt of the 
federal's bad management. Secondly, the Maritimes are also 
penalized by a way of management which is ignoring the people. 
I will deal with these two points.
<P>
	My first comment is about the fishermen of Canada and 
Quebec. They are among the most affected by this budget. 
Minister Crosbie had allocated a billion dollars to support 
fishermen over the last two years. The Liberal government 
reduced that amount to 340 million a year over five years, a cut 
close to 30 per cent. Under the Conservative government, we 
witnessed a drop in fish stocks and it seems that, under the 
Liberal government, we will witness a drop in the financial 
support offered to the fishing industry's victims.
<P>
	The cut in the fishermen's support envelope should have come 
about naturally, through the industry's reorganization or the 
redeployment of workers in other lines of business, not as a 
consequence of Liberal cutbacks. Will the government give to 
fishermen the means to adapt to their new reality or will it go on 
reducing their financial support without giving them any means 
on which to build their future?
<P>
	If no financial envelope is created for the purpose of opening 
new avenues to the fishermen, the relief measures, such as the 
$1.7 billion that will be invested, will necessarily have to be 
recurrent ones. They will have to be repeated over and over until 
the government puts an end to it without ever solving the 
problem.
<P>
	The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans must tell the fishermen 
exactly what financial measures he intends to implement in 
order to reorganize the industry and reassign workers to other 
areas of activity. Will the minister put some money into that 
program or can we conclude, as the budget seems to indicate, 
that he has abdicated and that fishermen will be left to fend for 
themselves? The minister must let us know what he intends to do 
after the May 15 deadline. He owes that to the thousands of 
people who are now living in doubt. It is even more pressing for 
him to act now that his colleague, the Minister of Finance, has 
presented his budget.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We have not yet said it enough. This budget is an outright 
attack on the far regions and the poorest regions of Quebec and 
Canada. The maritimes are among the hardest hit by the Martin 
budget. There are three examples.
<P>
	The Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency received cuts of 
$90 million over three years. The federal government created 
this agency to stimulate and diversify the economy of the 
region. It pretends now that it will restart the economy by 
cutting this agency's budget.
<P>
	The government goes even further. The Department of 
Industry which finances the larger projects not handled by 
ACOA has also received drastic cuts. What is the good of having 
development instruments if they are not given the means to 
succeed?
<P>
<B>(1745 ) </B>
<P>
	The second example is the military. Following the federal 
election the government promised to re-evaluate  its role in 
defence. We were pleased by its sensitivity as the world changed 
significantly even from what it was five years ago. The role and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1947"> 1947 </A></B>
<P>
the budget of the military have to be reviewed. The government 
has to be sure to study the ministry to make all the necessary 
modifications and cuts.
<P>
	The government's mistake is in proceeding with the cuts 
without the smallest concern for the people it will be affecting. 
The Bloc believes in the government cutting military spending. 
However, it believes in converting the military industry. We 
cannot tell thousands of people that one day or the next they will 
lose their jobs without giving them other alternatives. The 
extent of the cuts requires that we proceed while simultaneously 
proceeding with a plan to convert the private sector. The 
government has not done this. It has not taken responsibility for 
the people of the maritimes.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The third example: unemployment insurance. The extending 
of the eligibility period from 10 to 12 weeks is an extremely hard 
blow for the Maritimes and, I should say, for all eastern Canada. 
For instance, only in the areas of Gaspé and the Magdalen 
Islands, there are about 11,000 seasonal workers who will be 
affected by that decision. In the middle of an economic crisis, 
the government will take $725 million next year only and more 
than $6 billion in the next three years in the pockets of the 
unemployed, the victims of the lack of jobs. In the meantime, it 
reduces its spending by only $400 million. Big deal!
<P>
	Moreover, the Minister of Finance announces that the 
regional rate of unemployment will have less impact on the level 
of benefits. The Minister has found yet another way of attacking 
the people who already have trouble getting by. Raising the 
number of weeks required to be eligible to unemployment 
insurance without proposing a catalyst to restore the economy is 
utopian. Besides, as some renowned economists mentioned this 
morning in <I>La Presse</I>, the federal budget is like, and I quote: 
``shovelling the snow into the provincial yards''. Effectively, 
since a lot of people will go directly from unemployment to 
welfare, the provinces will have to pay at least $1 billion more in 
welfare. I call that ``shovelling''.
<P>
	In conclusion, I will draw a parallel between the situation of 
fishermen and that of the Maritimes in general. People who fish 
see their income shrink, but the government is not proposing 
anything to revitalize fishing. For their part, the Maritimes see 
their defence installations close, their unemployed under attack, 
but the government is not proposing anything to diversify the 
economy in general or transform the defence industry into a 
civilian industry. There are people behind all those moves. The 
Chrétien government had set for itself the goal of giving hope to 
people, but hope is what is sadly lacking in this budget.
<P>
	I do not know how long I still have-three minutes, Mr. 
Speaker.
<P>
	I would like to add that during the week of Parliamentary 
recess, I met with some of my constituents. I have one of the 
largest ridings in the country. There may be larger ones, but 
mine covers three county regional municipalities. So, in a riding 
where unemployment in December was 27 per cent and where 
employment is highly seasonal, the big question that the mayors 
of the three municipalities were asking was: What are we going 
to do? What can the government do for us? We want to work for 
the longest possible periods, but they prevent us from doing so. 
Mr. Speaker, the great question in this financial balance the 
Minister of Finance, Mr. Martin, tried to achieve is what came 
first, the hen or the egg? I have the feeling though that at the 
present time he is eating both. How can we make it? I will work 
and form a committee with these people; we are thinking about 
the issue. However, we will need some financial assistance. 
When you are out of gas at the bottom of a steep hill, you need 
gas if you want your car to climb. Right now we have none.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	I hope we will find other ways, Mr. Speaker; I hope we will 
succeed in influencing this government and make them listen to 
the people in my riding, the people of Gaspé, because I know the 
problem will be the same all over Eastern Canada: seasonal jobs. 
I am not asking for charity; all I am asking is that they give us 
the financial means of reaching our goals. All I personally want 
is for the Gaspé Peninsula not to be a burden anymore. And we 
will not be a burden; just give us the proper means and we will 
say goodbye to you and your social programs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
speak in support of the budget. The budget is about jobs. It is 
about opportunity. It is about a new path away from the past, the 
path of unemployment, of poverty, of stress. It is about a new 
path for the future which involves new technology and growth 
for our economy.
<P>
	It is about new initiatives such as the Canadian investment 
fund. This fund will be sponsored by the banks as well as 
governments in a supportive partnership to find and finance new 
technology for new jobs.
<P>
	It is about a technological network, where we encourage the 
use of technology and people getting these technologies 
together to create new wealth.
<P>
	It is also about a study into our pension funds, how we invest 
our money, and how we can utilize that money in our economy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1948"> 1948 </A></B>
<P>
	If we reduced unemployment by 4.5 per cent we would create 
$70 billion, more than enough money to pay off our deficit, to 
create a surplus, to put people back to work. That is the long 
term goal of the budget.
<P>
	We talk in the budget about a new code of ethics for the banks 
and how they deal with small businesses. We have heard 
constantly of how small business enterprises are having 
difficulty raising capital. Why should this be? After all, that is 
what banks do for a living. One thing we have not focused on 
very effectively is that the government is competing in the 
capital markets with small business. A $500 billion deficit 
means the government competes in the market for the same 
supply of funds to finance small businesses.
<P>
	People have not realized how our economy has changed over 
the years. When we think of British Columbia, we think of the 
forestry. There are more people employed in medical research in 
British Columbia than in the forestry. When we think of Nova 
Scotia, we think of the fishery. There are more people employed 
in teaching in Nova Scotia than in the fishery. The banks we talk 
about have only 6 per cent of the capital base of the country.
<P>
	In some ways we are going at this in the wrong way. I suggest 
that we need to take the studies that are mentioned in the budget 
to review pension funds and how the savings of Canadians can 
be more effectively used to support the economy. The budget 
refers to research and development initiatives, more 
expenditure on things like the space program. This will put 
Canada into the 21st century.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	My hon. friend, the minister of state talked earlier today about 
the information highway and how this is going to bring Canada 
into the 21st century, linking up our small communities, 
linguistic groups and things of commonality throughout this 
country, making this nation strong and whole again.
<P>
	Why does the government have to get involved in all these 
things? Why has this become a problem? Why have we come to 
this point in our history where we are living through this deep 
recession? I suggest it is partially the psychology of Canadians 
in general. We have not invested in our own economy.
<P>
	The economy is probably typified more than in any other 
country in the world by foreign ownership. Canadians have 
allowed foreigners to control major sectors of their economy. I 
am talking about automobile manufacturing, aluminum 
smelting, big sections of the forestry industry and on and on it 
goes. What has the effect of this done to us? We have not had 
significant investments in research and development. We have 
short changed our future by allowing others to take over the role 
of investment.
<P>
	Fortunately the world has changed in a very effective way for 
Canada. We are now seeing the end of what I and many have 
called the smokestack economy. The larger companies in our 
economy are getting smaller every day. Many of us in our 
ridings feel this very much as these companies shed 
employment. These are the things that make the headlines in our 
local newspapers. However, this is also an opportunity. It is an 
opportunity for Canadians to take control of their economy once 
again.
<P>
	Why is it that someone living in a home on a particular street 
is complaining about receiving 5.5 per cent interest rate on a 
guaranteed investment certificate and someone else in a 
company is laying off workers because they cannot get capital to 
finance their business. This is the dilemma and the strange 
aspect that affects Canada today.
<P>
	Why is it our small businesses cannot get access to equity 
capital? What is it that prevents them from raising funds in the 
open market? It is very costly to get access to our market 
exchange. Many TSE and other stocks are foreign owned.
<P>
	For the small businessman it is almost impossible to jump 
from his small business entrepreneurial investment and get 
access to registered stock exchanges.
<P>
	What is the solution to some of these problems? I suggest that 
the budget has started us on the path to a new definition of access 
to capital and how Canadians have to take control of the 
economy into their own hands.
<P>
	We have a number of institutions we can utilize to create new 
capital and confidence for Canadians by investing in the 
economy. The National Research Council, as members know, is 
very interested and has been very involved in new technology.
<P>
	My review and discussions with some people at the National 
Research Council leads me to the conclusion that 75 per cent of 
all inventions the council has created over the years are still 
resident in Ottawa. We are not involving this kind of technology 
in the marketplace. I am happy to say that the industry ministry 
has talked about departmentalizing and moving some 
departments out into the areas where businesses are affected. I 
believe that the National Research Council could be an effective 
method of certifying processes.
<P>
	Another agency we now have is the Federal Business 
Development Bank. I believe it can act as a secondary marketing 
tool creating pools of minority interests in small businesses to 
sell these pools to registered retirement savings plans and other 
pension funds. In this way Canadians will have some assurance 
and liquidity from the aspect of investing their money in 
Canadian small businesses.

<P>
	How many times have we as members of Parliament watched 
some of our clients come before us, our constituents, and talk 
about the fact that they have a good process, that everybody 
wants it, that it is marketable, but they cannot receive funding 
for it and they have to go south of the border? What happens to 
most of them is they fail. We have to do better.
<P>
	I believe that the budget is only the first step in the long 
process of creating new capital for Canadian businesses and 
ending our drudgery with unemployment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières):</B> Mr. Speaker, during 
the last election campaign the Liberal Party of Canada, wishing 
the Canadian electorate to be well informed of its intentions, 
published an important document entitled ``Creating 
opportunity''. As you have probably guessed, the ultimate 
purpose of that paper was to kick Progressive Conservatives out 
of power and replace them by a team determined to create jobs, 
fight unemployment and not the unemployed, and make sure 
that the deficit would not be tackled at the expense of the 
poorest. That document is the red book.
<P>
	Millions of Canadians, in particular in Ontario and in the 
Maritimes, believed in it and were deluded. Quebecers and 
Westerners proved to be more cautious and shrewd. Only 30 per 
cent of Quebec voters, for instance, trusted the Liberal Party.
<P>
	Now that they have reached their goal, the Liberals who are in 
government must act and show concretely that they really are 
different from the bad Conservatives.
<P>
	However, they missed a first opportunity to prove it with the 
speech from the throne, a text rife with clichés, pious hopes and 
vague declarations of intent. Subsequently, Mr. Speaker, the 
government, under the finance minister's leadership, embarked 
in extensive consultations with a view to outlining the first 
Liberal budget, a much touted about exercise which was to bring 
hope back to Canadians from coast to coast.
<P>
	This great event took place on February 22, 1994, at 5 p.m. 
What a disappointment! The red book is becoming increasingly 
valuable. Never since, have the Liberals being able to find 
free-lance writers with such lucidity, such imagination, such 
insight, and so able to develop new solutions.
<P>
	As a matter of fact, one must accept the obvious, that this 
government is following right in the previous government's 
footsteps by attacking not unemployment but rather the 
unemployed, when it announced that it intended to renew and 
revitalize, to use its own words, Canada's social security system 
within two years.
<P>
	And yet, the red book did say, on page 73 and 74 of the English 
version:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The failed economic and social policies of the Conservative regime have left 
1.6 million people out of work and 4.2 million Canadians living in poverty, of 
whom 1.2 million are children; and 62 per cent of families headed by single 
mothers are living in poverty with their incomes falling.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Since 1984, the Tories have systematically weakened the social support 
network that took generations to build. [-]they have taken billions of dollars 
from health care and from programs that support children, seniors, and people 
who have lost their jobs-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	And yet, in its first budget, this government announces to us 
that henceforth, people will have to work longer in order to 
collect 5 per cent less in unemployment insurance and that the 
revitalization of social security will mean savings of roughly 
$7.5 billion at the expense of the least fortunate.
<P>
	Another example that is particularly interesting to me, in my 
capacity as industry critic, is that of industrial conversion as 
mentioned on page 55 of the red book.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The defence industries today employ directly and indirectly over 100,000 
Canadians. The end of the Cold War puts at risk tens of thousands of high-tech 
jobs. A Liberal government will introduce a defence conversion program to 
help industries in transition from high-tech military production to high-tech 
civilian production.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	Since being elected, this government has not mentioned this 
subject again, except once, very cautiously, in the budget plan 
when it stated that it would not proceed until 1996-1997. Yet, 
two projects that have been shelved could satisfy the need for 
diversification by utilizing both human resources and budgets. I 
am referring to the establishment of a high-speed rail link 
between Quebec City and Windsor, via Trois-Rivières, and to 
the awarding of a contract to MIL Davie of Lauzon, a company 
which specializes in the building of military ships. Having 
drawn up its own plan to convert from military to civilian 
production, this company needs the encouragement of the 
federal government, which it would get if awarded the contract 
to build the Magdalen Islands ferry.
<P>
	Not a word about these two issues, Mr. Speaker, in the budget 
speech or elsewhere.
<P>
	So what are we to make then of such behaviour by the 
government? Is it cynicism or contempt? Is it just a way to fool 
the people so that they can take power by saying or promising 
anything? How can one reconcile such behaviour with the 
parliamentary integrity mentioned in the red book on page 90, 
where it says that cynicism about public institutions, 
governments, politicians, and the political process is at an 
all-time high? Is this government not giving Canadians and 
Quebecers new reasons to be cynical?
<P>
	But that is not all. So far, we have seen some commitments 
made during the election campaign which have not been kept by 
this government. It will also do some things that it never 
mentioned before. I am  thinking, for example, of the decision 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1950"> 1950 </A></B>
<P>
announced in the budget speech to close the military college in 
Saint-Jean.
<P>
	Since Quebec receives only 15 per cent of national spending 
by the defence department, we think that it is an unfair and 
unacceptable decision that we can only denounce.
<P>
	Moreover, if we think back to the reasons and the historical 
background for setting up this institution, it is an unjustifiable 
decision which shows the failure of a certain Trudeau-style 
federalism where bilingualism would be recognized everywhere 
and francophones and anglophones would have equal 
opportunities in this great united Canada.
<P>
	To suggest that French-speaking Quebecers can get along 
easily in Kingston and go ahead as if nothing had changed, as the 
Minister of Defence suggests, shows naivety or bad faith.
<P>
	Here is what an eminent citizen of Trois-Rivières, a 
constituent of mine whom I salute gladly, the first francophone 
chief of staff of the Canadian armed forces, General Jean Victor 
Allard, said in the local daily <I>Le Nouvelliste</I> of February 26, 
1994: ``It is ridiculous to think that Kingston can offer bilingual 
training''.
<P>
	The front page of <I>La Presse</I> yesterday, March 6, carried the 
following headline: ``No services in French in Kingston''.
<P>
	Unless this is an operation brilliantly orchestrated to allow 
the current Premier of Quebec, Mr. Johnson, to make political 
capital out of this event in complicity with his Liberal cousins in 
Ottawa. That is what awaits French-speaking Quebecers in the 
increasingly unitarian, centralized and impoverished Canada of 
tomorrow, where Quebec will weigh less and less in 
demographic terms.
<P>
	This federalist complicity is also remarkable with regard to 
one impact of the changes to unemployment insurance 
concerning the percentage and duration of benefits. 
Unemployed workers will go more rapidly from the federal 
unemployment insurance program to provincial social 
assistance programs. It is estimated that the bill will reach at 
least $1 billion for all the provinces, including $280 million for 
Quebec.
<P>
	The Liberal Premier of Quebec, Daniel Johnson, a federalist, 
has been very silent on this question so far, in spite of leading a 
government whose deficit will amount to close to $5 billion and 
which cannot afford to give presents to the federal Liberal 
government.
<P>
	It is this same federalist brotherhood that will come to Quebec 
in the next few months to preach the Canadian gospel to the 
people of Quebec, to try to sell the merits of financially viable 
federalism, to say that francophones have their place 
everywhere in Canada and that the doors are wide open from the 
Rockies to Percé Rock.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	This brotherhood includes Mulroney, Trudeau, Johnson, 
Ryan, the hon. member for Saint-Maurice and even the hon. 
member for Sherbrooke who, united by the Holy Spirit and by 
mutual interests, will explain to Quebecers that dependence is 
better than independence, that it is better to be a minority than a 
majority, that Quebec cannot be anything but a province and, 
what is more, a province like any other. That is their opinion but 
it is not ours. We will talk about this again, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport):</B> Mr. Speaker, the budget 
proves that this government has rejected the economic theories 
of the Reform Party and that it has put most of its emphasis on its 
belief, and quite rightly so, that what we are facing today in our 
economy is a crisis of revenue. It is not a crisis of expenditure as 
the Reform Party would like Canadians to believe.
<P>
	At the next election we will be able to demonstrate to those 
who voted for the Reform Party that they placed their 
confidence in the wrong party. Let me stress the fact that the 
crisis of revenue is going to be tackled by this government by 
stimulating the economy, by creating jobs and by bringing back 
confidence in the economic system of Canada which for many 
years has been the object of decreased confidence. This has 
resulted in the formation of an underground economy.
<P>
	The budget places an emphasis on increasing revenue through 
a number of initiatives, not believing that our economic 
situation can be remedied through cuts alone. It is an 
encouraging and well received statement by Canadians at large.
<P>
	The budget also contains a green strategy, so to speak. It is 
modest but it is timely. It is the first step but it promises others 
because the minister announced changes that will encourage 
companies to contribute to mine reclamation funds, 
commitments to improve the tax treatment of a certain type of 
tax conservation equipment and enhanced incentives for newer 
and cleaner technologies.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance announced that the strategy for 
encouraging the growth of environmental technology and 
services will be revealed later this year. These announcements 
outline the fact that there is a willingness and a commitment to 
turn our budget making into a green colour as the years go by.
<P>
	There are many items that are still to be considered in future 
budgets. One is the introduction of green taxes. Time does not 
permit me to go into detail. Let me only say that a graduated 
taxation system which would recognize the environmentally 
friendly role of certain products would be helpful and well 
received by Canadians.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="1951"> 1951 </A></B>
<P>
	Lower taxes, for instance, for products approved by the 
environment choice program would be a highly desirable step 
which has been adopted in other jurisdictions. In the United 
States, to give members another example, there is an annual 
vehicle registration fee that is geared to the weight of the 
vehicle. There is a recognition that the tax system should reward 
those who use vehicles that weigh less and are more fuel 
efficient.
<P>
	There is a whole range of initiatives that could be taken and I 
hope will be taken under the general heading of green taxation.
<P>
	It is interesting to note, when it comes to natural resources, a 
white paper produced by the European communities a few weeks 
ago. It states: ``Market prices do not incorporate sufficiently the 
limited availability of natural resources and the environmental 
scarcities related to their consumption''. The result is a 
systematic overuse of our national resources. Here again a 
graduated taxation on a resource demanding products and 
services would serve as an incentive and would be highly 
desirable.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	Next the minister announced in the budget speech his 
commitment to create a task force to examine certain subsidies 
and taxes which are harmful to the environment. They are 
commonly called perverse subsidies. Although they are well 
intended, over time we have discovered they are damaging.
<P>
	This task force has a terrific opportunity to examine existing 
and major federal subsidies, programs, expenditures and the 
like, including federal-provincial agreements from the 
perspective of development and growth that is sustainable 
environmentally speaking.
<P>
	There will be an opportunity for the task force to examine, for 
instance, the budget of the Canadian International Development 
Agency and the budget of the energy department. The incentives 
that have been and are being provided in agriculture, in forestry, 
in fishery and in trade will be examined with the hope in mind or 
with the intent of ensuring long term sustainability through 
fiscal and other measures, including policies in the field of 
energy. Fossil fuel subsidies and programs will be at the core of 
the particular task force.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="IMMIGRATION">IMMIGRATION</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
frequent contacts with my constituents indicate that the two 
areas of greatest concern to them are the deficit and 
immigration. The two issues are related.
<P>
	My constituents wonder about the costs which immigrants 
impose on Canadian governments during this period of fiscal 
crisis. Even though on average and over their lifetime 
immigrants historically have made a net contribution to the 
coffers of the government, they are concerned about those who 
enter Canada under the family unification program.
<P>
	The minister has announced that next year he has ordered the 
admittance of 110,000 individuals in this category. Under 
current laws these family unification immigrants are almost 
exclusively the elderly parents of persons already in Canada as 
landed immigrants. We know from past years that the bulk of 
these parents are of an age where they are likely to pay only 
small if any premiums to the provincial medicare program. Yet 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1952"> 1952 </A></B>
<P>
as landed immigrants they are entitled to free medicare for the 
rest of their lives.
<P>
	A distinguished newspaper columnist had obtained 
information on the numbers and age distribution of family 
unification immigrants admitted during the period 1988 to 1992. 
Using data on the average cost of medicare services required by 
older people, the columnist estimated that the family 
immigrants admitted during this period added about $1 billion 
to the annual cost of the Canadian medicare system.
<P>
	I think it is legitimate to ask an equivalent question about the 
family immigrants to be admitted next year and in future years 
once their levels have been decided. In fact I believe that the 
government should be required to publish regularly estimates of 
the costs immigration policies are expected to impose on public 
services.
<P>
	If the costs are as high as some experts think they are, the 
government might consider changes in existing policy. One such 
change might involve the rule now existing in Australia 
according to which parents are admitted only if they do not leave 
at home more of their children than they join in their new 
country of residence.
<P>
	Another perhaps somewhat more radical policy might be to 
admit only immigrants who agree to live in Canada without 
having their parents join them. There are large numbers of 
foreigners willing to come to Canada under these conditions, I 
am sure.
<P>
	I should note that no one expects a definitive answer on the 
dollar costs. Canadians are sophisticated about the uncertainty 
surrounding all such estimates involving social and economic 
magnitudes. They want an estimate accompanied by 
explanations of the underlying data and the assumptions. They 
will interpret it with the proper caution.
<P>
	I thank you, Mr. Speaker, for allowing me to bring forth these 
issues again in the House. I am sure the people of Canada will 
appreciate having the answer to the question I raise.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration has launched a public consultation 
process that will help shape the country's immigration policy 
for the next decade. His intentions are clear, and that is to hear 
from Canadians.
<P>
	Family reunification has always been a cornerstone of 
Canadian immigration policy. We must never underestimate the 
advantages of family based immigration. Family members help 
to integrate and settle newcomers successfully with little 
associated costs.
<P>
	In a 1991 study the Economic Council of Canada stated that 
immigration had a positive albeit small impact on the real per 
capita income of Canadians. Thus if the impact is not negative it 
cannot be used to argue that levels are too high. Economic 
neutrality in fact supports the current levels of humanitarian 
immigration.
<P>
	In addition the Economic Council also made the point that an 
increase in immigration did not increase unemployment neither 
in the short nor the long term. This was verified by examining 12 
OECD countries.
<P>
	We on this side of the House tend to agree with the council's 
findings when it says that everyone benefits economically and 
otherwise from immigration.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	Another study by Samuel and Conyers in June 1986 entitled 
``The Employment Effects of Immigration: A Balance Sheet 
Approach'' concluded that the net impact of immigration from 
the perspective of job creation was positive and that immigrants 
were net creators of jobs.
<P>
	Studies using the 1986 census data have concluded that 
immigrants collect less welfare. Since they also pay taxes they 
are contributing positively to maintaining our social safety net, 
which in turn helps pay for Canada's social programs including 
and perhaps most especially our health care system.

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on February 22 last, I put a question to the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage concerning the $350,000 in severance pay 
awarded to the Director General of the National Arts Centre 
following a putsch organized by the Mayor of Ottawa.
<P>
	As a supplemental, I asked him whether it was true, and I 
quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>that the person responsible for the placement agency in the Prime Minister's 
Office, Mrs. Collenette, is desperately looking for a new job in the federal 
public service for Mr. DesRochers?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The minister answered as follows, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>there is...an announced vacancy that is not yet effective but will become so a 
little later in the year.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	What are we to make of the minister's response? He listened 
to my question and he answered it. I must therefore interpret it 
and draw a connection between it and my question. So, by 
informing me that there will be an opening later this year, the 
minister led me to conclude that the director of appointments in 
the Prime Minister's Office intends to keep this position for Mr. 
DesRochers.
<P>
	If my interpretation of the minister's answer is correct, then 
we in this House have the right to wonder whether the Liberal 
government plans to replace all senior public servants with 
Liberals because, if it is so, we will be paying compensation for 
a long time. Let us just remember all the political appointments 
made by the previous government in its dying days.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1953"> 1953 </A></B>
<P>
	I sincerely hope that, even though the answer was written in 
advance, the minister will reassure the House and make a 
commitment to take the necessary steps to address the problem 
of mismanagement in government agencies, which is extremely 
costly to Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	We have to remind ourselves of the difficulties encountered in 
1987 in securing the appointment, for the first time, of a 
French-speaking director at the National Arts Centre. As Mr. 
Leroux, the Chairman of the Advisory Committee on 
Francophone Affairs for the City of Ottawa, mentioned, and I 
quote: ``The dismissal of Mr. DesRochers is a step backward for 
the Francophone population which can no longer deal with the 
senior management of the National Arts Centre in its own 
language''. Mr. Leroux resigned to show his disapproval, and we 
can expect further resignations.
<P>
	Furthermore, the minister hides behind the managerial 
autonomy of these agencies to avoid responding to the real 
questions and the real issues raised by the Bloc Quebecois. If the 
minister wants to be responsible, he must tell us clearly without 
further ado what concrete measures he intends to take to address 
the problem of mismanagement in government agencies, 
particularly in the Canadian Museum of Nature and the National 
Capital Commission.
<P>
	The minister must regain control of these agencies, ensure a 
more transparent form of management and, this time, answer the 
questions that are put to him with all the intelligence that I am 
willing to give him credit for, otherwise he could very well lose 
his credibility once and for all.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Albina Guarnieri (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Canadian Heritage):</B> Mr. Speaker, in answer to the 
question asked by the hon. member for 
Rimouski-Témiscouata, first of all I have to make it clear that 
the National Arts Centre's director general is appointed by the 
corporation's board of directors. Moreover, the director 
general's salary is set by the Governor in Council; so, all the 
terms and conditions of employment of the director general 
come directly under the responsibility and authority of the 
National Arts Centre's board of directors, as provided under the 
National Arts Centre Act. As for the first part of her question, 
the hon. member for Rimouski-Témiscouata can therefore see 
that it is not incumbent on the government in this specific 
instance to determine the working conditions and the severance 
pay of NAC employees.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The director general position is classified by the Privy 
Council at the GIC-8 level which currently has a salary range of 
$110,100 to $129,700. Mr. Yvon DesRochers was appointed 
director general of the National Arts Centre in 1988 for a 
five-year term and was reappointed for another five years in 
May 1993.
<P>
	His salary was fixed by the Governor in Council subsequent to 
negotiations between the board of trustees and Mr. DesRochers 
at the time of his appointment. Specific information on Mr. 
DesRochers' salary is protected under the Privacy Act as it is for 
all Canadians protected by this legislation.
<P>
	The Minister of Canadian Heritage would also like to point 
out that the salary of the director general was set by the previous 
government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Finally, Mr. Yvon DesRochers' contract has been terminated 
following the decision made by the National Arts Centre's board 
of directors on January 14, 1994.

	<B>Mr. David Iftody (Provencher):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise in the 
House today to refer the Minister of Human Resources 
Development to a question that I raised in the House on February 
7 concerning the issue of labour disputes at the port of 
Vancouver.
<P>
	As history has proven, free and unimpeded movement of 
goods and services is the cornerstone of an economy that relies 
on a free market. Western Canada in particular was opened by 
our exports almost 100 years ago. In 1896 the wheat boom was a 
creation principally by a transportation system and security of 
labour relations which allowed us to export our grain to markets 
around the world.
<P>
	When the free flow of these goods and services of any type is 
obstructed the Canadian economy is harmed and indeed 
weakened. In any kind of labour dispute which brings about 
these kinds of work stoppages there are no winners but everyone 
loses.
<P>
	This was most definitely the case in this instance. Grains and 
other exports were stored in warehouses while 74 ships in the 
port of Vancouver were idle without any stock and not moving 
out of the port at all.
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board said that this backlog of ships cost 
the prairie farmer $6 million in penalties. I want to point out that 
this is a cost Canadian farmers cannot afford to bear in these 
times. The storage fees alone for keeping that grain outside 
those ships was $300,000 a day.
<P>
	I want to point out that this strike affected personally the 
people in my riding of Provencher. Outside of the grain farmers I 
want to draw members' attention to a manufacturing firm that 
has Japanese customers and is shipping over finished products 
in the lumber industry. It faced over $50,000 worth of late 
<P>

<B><A NAME="1954"> 1954 </A></B>
<P>
penalties and an additional $13,000 in air freight charges to ship 
those goods to the Japanese customers to get them there on time.
<P>
	Above and beyond this, one of the principal concerns of these 
kinds of labour interruptions is the fact that they call into 
question Canada's reputation as a good trading partner. The day 
before the actual strike the marketing director for the port of 
Vancouver in Beijing, China was receiving hundreds of calls 
questioning Canada's ability to deliver its goods to its trading 
partners on time.
<P>
	China is Canada's largest importer of grain and it is a very 
valuable market to Canada. What sort of message are we sending 
to our international trade partners, to China and to the Asian 
Pacific rim in particular?
<P>
	At a time when we are linking our economic trade to 
international relations it is critically important that Canada have 
security in our transportation systems and in our labour systems 
to ensure that business people in Canada, in western Canada and 
in Provencher in particular have their goods and services 
transported to their destinations without interference.
<P>
<B>(1835 ) </B>
<P>
	This is why I am asking the minister on behalf of the people of 
Provencher what specific measures were taken since the 
government introduced its legislation to bring the parties back 
to the table? What specific measures are being taken to ensure 
that we will have easy and unimpeded access to international 
markets throughout the world and the Asian Pacific Rim?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to respond to the hon. member's question concerning 
the recent dispute on the west coast between the British 
Columbia Maritime Employer's Association and the 
International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union.
<P>
	The West Coast Ports Operations Act, 1994, passed by 
Parliament on February 8 and given royal assent the same day, 
called for the immediate resumption of longshoring operations 
on Canada's west coast upon the coming into force of the act and 
provided for the final settlement of those items remaining in 
dispute between the parties by the final offer selection process.
<P>
	While disappointed at the inability of the parties to resolve 
their dispute through collective bargaining, the Minister of 
Human Resources Development did not hesitate to act in the 
public interest and take measures to ensure the resumption of 
important export shipments through the west coast ports.
<P>
	During the House debates on Bill C-10 the minister 
committed to consulting members of the opposition parties 
regarding the selection of an arbitrator. I am pleased that 
members of the Bloc Quebecois and the New Democratic Party 
supported Mr. Allan Hope's appointment as arbitrator.
<P>
	Prior to the recent disruption there had been indications of 
reasons to hope that labour and management in the port of 
Vancouver had moved away from the dismal pattern of the 1970s 
and the first half of the 1980s when Parliament was forced to 
provide for resolution of their disputes. Settlements arrived at 
through the collective bargaining process in the two previous 
rounds gave some reason to believe that the pattern had changed 
and that the parties were entering a new era of constructive 
labour relations.
<P>
	It is hoped that the current difficulties do not represent a 
reversion to previous form and that the parties will endeavour in 
future to find better ways of resolving their differences. The 
competitive future of our west coast ports and consequently the 
livelihood of those involved in the longshoring industry relies 
on their ability to approach the bargaining relationship in a spirit 
of common interest.
<P>
	Reports from the west coast indicate that grain shipments are 
being loaded at a brisk pace in order to fill outstanding export 
commitments. While it is unfortunate that export commodities 
were impacted upon by the work stoppage, the government 
realized that through co-operative initiatives such as the 
Vancouver Ports Corporation stakeholders conference and the 
government's involvement with the western grain storage and 
handling industry, solutions can be found to industry concerns 
which will allow for improved relations between the parties and 
the fast, efficient movement of export commodities through the 
west coast ports.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TOBACCO">TOBACCO</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
February 16 I posed two questions to the Minister of Health, 
essentially asking what steps the department will take to ensure 
that the network of health care volunteers, professionals and 
organizations will be involved in the design, implementation 
and monitoring of any blueprint to ensure that the anti-smoking 
education campaign is successful.
<P>
	Since that question, we had a report last week of a survey 
indicating that the anti-smoking campaign has not had much 
influence on the habits of young smokers. Therefore, I ask the 
minister again, what specific steps will she take to ensure that 
any anti-smoking education campaign will have the input of 
health care professionals. By using their expertise and skills we 
will ensure greater success for any such campaign.
<P>
	A second point relates to what specific new regulatory 
framework the government envisions taking to ensure that the 
Government of Canada has greater control over tobacco 
manufacturers and to ensure again that we prevent young 
Canadians from starting the habit of smoking.
<P>
	What a turn of events. Only last week we heard the report that 
tobacco manufacturers might have added nicotine deliberately 
during the manufacturing of  cigarettes. That almost strengthens 
<P>

<B><A NAME="1955"> 1955 </A></B>
<P>
the urgency of the need to move with a new regulatory 
framework.
<P>
	Today the regulation allows manufacturers greater latitude 
and freedom to do things other than those prohibited by law. The 
focus must be changed. When tobacco manufacturers envision 
doing something new or something unknown to us as yet, they 
should submit their proposals and then the government will say 
yes, it is okay or no, it is unhealthy for Canadians. We need that 
kind of new regulatory framework to ensure that we truly take to 
heart the health of Canadians foremost.
<P>
	On that note I would beg the minister and his parliamentary 
secretary to bear before Parliament the steps they will take to 
ensure that health care network of the country will be involved 
in the design, implementation and monitoring of any new 
blueprint to combat smoking in the country and at the same time 
indicate the new regulatory framework the government is 
prepared to take to ensure that the health of Canadians is 
foremost and that we prevent the smoking habit that only creates 
illness, disability and ultimately death.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on behalf of the Minister of Health I welcome the 
opportunity to respond to the question raised by the hon. 
member about our anti-smoking campaign.
<P>
	I know how much he is committed to it. I can assure my hon. 
colleague that his government's determination to reduce and 
eventually eliminate tobacco use particularly among Canadian 
youth is very much in force. We will not stand idly by allowing 
young people to be exploited and to become addicted. The 
unnecessary tragedy of premature death and the burden of 
disease caused by smoking with which he is very familiar must 
not be inflicted on another generation.
<P>
	We are well aware that smoking is already responsible for 
approximately 40,000 preventable deaths in Canada each year. 
We realize that with lower tobacco prices additional work very 
seriously needs to be done now.
<P>
	I am pleased to report on behalf of the minister that much of 
this work is in progress. As the member may be aware, stronger 
more visible messages will be appearing on cigarette packaging 
by September 1994. The Tobacco Sales to Young Persons Act 
came into force in early February 1994. It is now unlawful to sell 
tobacco products to persons under 18 years of age. If we go into 
local stores we should be able to see federal signs to this effect.
<P>
	In addition, legislation has been introduced to ban the sale of 
kiddy packs. As well the Minister of Health recently announced 
the tobacco reduction strategy, an $185 million dollar initiative 
over three years with which innovative legislation is combined. 
That is to say targeted health activities will develop appropriate 
prevention and smoking cessation efforts. This will be 
combined with media campaigns aimed at younger people.
<P>
	The Minister of Health has had preliminary discussions with 
her provincial and territorial counterparts as well as the 
National Health Organization. Within weeks she will meet again 
to discuss joint approaches on this very serious subject. There 
can be no doubt about the need to convince people to stop 
smoking, not because it is politically correct, environmentally 
friendly or fiscally prudent, but because it will be healthier.
<P>
	We will save our limited health resources and more important, 
as my hon. colleague is well aware as a physician, it will save 
lives. I know my hon. colleague will offer his support to further 
ensure the success of these efforts.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Pursuant to Standing Order 38(5) the 
motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been 
adopted. The House therefore stands adjourned until tomorrow 
at ten o'clock.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.42 p.m.)
