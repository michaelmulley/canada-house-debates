<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA NATIONAL PARKS ACT

<A NAME="LINK3">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (for the Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-27, an act respecting the national parks 
of Canada, be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I will take the next 
few minutes to give an overview of Bill C-27, in the hope that 
members of the House will decide today to refer it to committee 
for further consideration. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-27, the Canada national parks act, in its short title, 
will provide enabling authorities to legislate the boundaries of 
the park communities, to define the commercial zones within them, 
and to set caps on commercial development.  The scale of such 
actions will depend on the nature of the communities as they 
range from the towns of Banff and Jasper to the small summer 
community of Waskesiu in Prince Albert National Park.   These 
actions recognize that commercial development in national park 
communities must always be tempered in the interests of 
ecological integrity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The seven communities will remain as special places.  We will 
work to ensure their continued sustainability.   Residents are 
part of the equation and the communities must provide for 
economic opportunities and services along with strong cultural 
and social services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone will recognize that these are not average communities. 
These are federal lands and part of the national parks and 
parliament has a duty to see that they are managed accordingly. 
Therefore, under the provisions of Bill C-27, the community plans 
would be guided by the principles of no net environmental impact, 
responsible environmental stewardship and heritage conservation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Legislation can do little to create a culture of respect and 
caring for wildlife but it can create a deterrence to the wilful 
destruction of wildlife.   Accordingly, the bill proposes to 
increase the penalties for poaching rare, endangered or trophy 
species of wildlife.   Such offences would be punishable by fines 
of up to $50,000 and five years imprisonment.   The penalties are 
appropriate it seems, given that the trophy head of a Dall sheep, 
for instance, can reach up to $150,000 on the black market. 
Multiple offences would be counted separately so that the taking 
of two grizzly bears, for example, would double the penalty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, a particularly gruesome type of poaching is aimed 
at feeding the international trade in wildlife parts and organs 
for exotic medicine.   For example, bears have been slaughtered 
solely for their gallbladders, and elk for their antler velvet. 
This will be fought by a new provision against trafficking. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-27 proposes a number of important measures related to the 
seven communities located within national parks.  In order to 
understand these provisions, we should examine the history of 
the communities and the prospects for their future. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1010"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All seven communities have their origins in the last part of the 
19th century and the earlier part of the 20th century.  In the 
Rocky Mountain parks of Banff, Jasper and Yoho, the development 
of communities is tightly linked to the development of our 
national railway and road transportation corridors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note these facts in order to underscore the context within 
which the communities were established.  It was at a time in 
Canada's history when we looked upon our nation as having 
unlimited wilderness.  The extraction of natural resources was 
not perceived as being in conflict with that belief. 
Consequently, forestry and mining were allowed within some 
national parks and communities were established to serve those 
particular interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, Anthracite and Bankhead were coal mining towns 
established in Banff National Park of Canada.  And Oil City—the 
name says it all—, in Waterton Lakes National Park of Canada 
served the first of our oil drilling operations.  Although these 
extractive activities and the communities of Bankhead, 
Anthracite and Oil City have long since vanished, they remind us 
of an era when such activities were deemed appropriate within 
national parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, we know that our wilderness is limited and we understand 
the need to preserve representative areas within our national 
park system.  We no longer allow the commercial exploitation of 
natural resources within national parks.  Moreover, we 
understand that any development within a national park should be 
carefully limited so as to avoid impairment to its ecological 
integrity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We understand too that high quality environmental conditions are 
the foundation for the tourism industry and the very reason 
millions of people from all over the world, and primarily from 
Canada, visit our parks annually.  Therefore, no new communities 
will be located within national park boundaries and the existing 
communities will be managed in ways that support park values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Canadian Heritage has put great effort and 
thought into the drafting of the community provisions in the 
bill before us.  She has been diligent in analysing the key 
studies which identified problems and solutions within the 
national park system.  The reports of the Bow Valley Study and 
the Ecological Integrity Panel contained wide-ranging 
recommendations which have served as the basis for making 
ecological integrity the first priority in national parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that the Government of Canada is responsible for the 
conservation of national parks for all Canadians, it is 
important that parliament retain an overview of the communities' 
role and development.  To that effect, Bill C-27 proposes that 
community plans be tabled in each House as soon as possible 
after proclamation of the new Canada National Parks Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The plans will respect the provisions in the act.  They will be 
consistent with the park management plan; accord with guidelines 
for appropriate activities; and provide a strategy for growth 
management.  The shaping of these plans will also be guided by 
principles stated in the bill; namely, no net environmental 
impact, responsible environmental stewardship and heritage 
conservation. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Growth management will be achieved by describing the boundaries 
of the community and its commercial zones, along with the measure 
of the maximum commercial floor area permitted within those 
zones.  Each of these key elements of the community plans, the 
boundaries, the commercial zones and the maximum commercial 
square footage, will be enshrined within the schedule to the 
Canada National Parks Act and thus, become part of the act. 
Implementing the provisions of Bill C-27 will ensure a proper 
evolution of the communities from the past centuries into the 
next one.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have gone from logging and mining to the prime purpose of 
maintaining the ecological integrity of the national parks for 
the benefit, education and enjoyment of present and future 
generations.  The communities have an important role in this and 
in serving visitors.  They will remain.  They will be supported. 
We look forward to their becoming models of environmental 
stewardship. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It can never be said often enough, ecological integrity will be 
the key principle applied in our national parks.  I urge members 
of the House to refer this bill to the Standing Committee on 
Canadian Heritage so that it can be further examined and so that 
we may protect our national parks for the future.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am delighted to rise in the House on this beautiful 
morning to debate an issue which is of great importance to 
Canadians.  I am talking about the preservation of our natural 
heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am privileged to have been born in Saskatchewan and even more 
privileged to have been able to move to Alberta early in my life. 
For many years we lived within four hours of two of Canada's most 
pristine and loved national parks, Jasper National Park and Banff 
National Park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We spent time in other national parks, including the park at 
Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, Waterton Lakes National Park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was chosen to speak on behalf of my party today because the 
name of my riding is derived directly from the national park in 
it, Elk Island National Park, which is located just a few miles 
outside Edmonton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Elk Island is a unique park because of the fact that it is 
basically a marsh area.  Indeed, the word elk implies that there 
are elk in the park.  There are also bison and many other 
different forms of wildlife. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the privilege last year of hiking with some of the people 
in the park and, as the good song says“Oh, give me a home where 
the buffalo roam”, we roamed with the buffalo.  We had to be 
careful not to interfere with them lest they take exception to us 
and attack us because at certain times of the year they can be 
dangerous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My love of the parks extends over the last 40 years.  Some of 
the best memories I have include visits to the parks, both in 
Banff and Jasper.  We went camping for a week in Jasper for our 
25th wedding anniversary.  When asked by my friends how our week 
had gone, I told them it was the worst week I had ever spent.  I 
told them that the problem was, when we entered the park there 
was a big sign that said “Do not feed the wild animals”, so my 
wife starved me all week.  Camping was not as much fun when I got 
hungry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I love the park.  Saskatchewan, as members know, has many acres 
of flat land.  Every time I go to the mountains I am completely 
awestruck by their grandeur, their magnificence.  I cannot come 
up with the words which could adequately describe the mountains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there are members of the House who have never visited 
Canada's Rockies between Alberta and British Columbia, they owe 
it to themselves to see one of the most beautiful parts of 
Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Being campers, when we visited these camps we encountered a 
number of people from around the world.  I remember one couple 
who were quite a bit better off than we were because they had 
travelled all over the world.  One of the things they said was 
that they had been everywhere in the world, including the Alps in 
Switzerland, but the most beautiful scenery they had encountered 
was along the Banff-Jasper highway.  Having travelled there 
several times I would certainly attest to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the general idea of a national parks system in 
Canada.  I very profoundly agree with the concept that we must 
preserve the pristine character of our parks and our beauty 
spots, not only for ourselves and visitors from around the world, 
but for future generations; not only for future generations of 
Canadians, but also for future generations of people around the 
world who come to visit and enjoy the beauties of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned earlier that when we were a young couple with young 
children we spent some time camping in the national parks.  Lest 
I give the wrong impression, I might as well indict my wife on a 
very important issue.  I have always loved the outdoors and 
camping under the stars.  I remember as a young university 
student being out near the Rocky Mountain house area.  We were 
preparing a youth camp for summer activities.  I remember going 
to sleep that night, which was beautiful, clear and starry. We 
did not use the Celsius scale back then, but converting it to the 
Celsius scale it was probably about minus five degrees in the 
morning and there were about 10 inches of new snow.  That is a 
picture of beauty which is etched permanently in my mind.  I will 
never forget it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a young family I would have loved to have carried on with 
that camping tradition, but my wife was not so much inclined. 
She said that she did not really look forward to leaving her nice 
home, sleeping on the ground or in a tent and being vulnerable to 
wild animals, insects and all of that.  Being the kind, loving 
husband which I clearly am, I made a concession and we purchased 
a travel trailer, one that would keep us off the ground, give us 
some protection when it rained and so on.  We made that little 
compromise.  We had wonderful times in our trailer at the 
campsites of the different parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I am saying this is because those are such wonderful, 
warm memories for me; the environment in which it occurred, the 
hikes we took and the admiration that we had for the beauty that 
was given to us.  I feel very strongly that we should preserve 
that and preserve its accessibility, which will be one of the 
themes of my talk this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we were a young couple, believe it or not, we could afford 
to go to Banff for a week.  I was not a well paid person.  Very 
early in our marriage we made the decision that my wife would be 
a full time mom.  We have always lived on my income and will 
retire on my non-pension, since I am one of the members of the 
House who has opted out of the lucrative MP pension plan.  We 
made the decisions on principle and I do not regret that, but we 
have never been well off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I truly am a member of the House of Commons in the sense that I 
am a commoner.  As a young family we were actually able to go 
into the parks of Banff and Jasper.  Those were the ones that 
attracted us because of their proximity to where we lived.  We 
were able to enjoy them.  At that time the fees for camping and 
for using the amenities were within our budget.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I regret to say that the policies of the federal government over 
the last number of years have become, really, a case for the 
elites.  It probably dates back to the end of the Liberal era 
before the Conservatives took over for nine years.  It is now 
really only for the very rich. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were at the campground not very long ago.  I was rather 
saddened to see that most of the people there were the ones with 
the big motor homes.  Obviously those who were independently 
wealthy could afford to spend time there, but there were not many 
people who came from what I would call the rank and file, 
ordinary middle income Canadians.  That is a policy which is very 
regrettable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For us as a family it was a wonderful experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I regret that the new generation, the moms and dads of today, 
the young couples, cannot really afford to go to Banff and to 
Jasper because the daily costs are so high.  Many of them are 
spending time in the area just outside the parks.  In southern 
Alberta we have a couple of areas which are really expanding very 
quickly.  Canmore is probably the best example. It is a large 
area which is five or six kilometres outside the boundary of the 
park.  That is where people are going because they can enjoy the 
beauty there.  Perhaps they can take a day trip into the park, 
but they cannot stay in the park because this government and the 
government before it chose to set an entry fee structure that is 
beyond the reach of ordinary, overtaxed Canadian families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a mistake as far as I am concerned.  I think it is a 
very large error which I would like to see corrected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking today about national parks.  I have no interest 
whatsoever in arguing against the desires of the people in Parks 
Canada and the Department of Canadian Heritage to preserve both 
plant and animal life, to see that it remains undisturbed as much 
as possible.  However, we used to say in Saskatchewan when I was 
growing up that if someone overdid something they were swatting a 
fly with a shotgun.  It was a huge exaggeration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to be very careful because I do not want to be 
misunderstood, but I believe that to some degree the ecologists, 
the biologists and the people at Heritage Canada and others are 
greatly overstating the degree to which the area needs to be 
protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that we need to respect the land.  I believe that we 
need to respect the parks.  We have taught our children to obey 
rules like staying on the paths in order not to harm the 
vegetable life that is off the path.  We have always done our 
part to keep the campgrounds clean.  Our motto was:  when a 
camper leaves he should leave nothing but the sound of his 
footsteps.  I think that is important.  It is a matter of 
individual responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the extreme measures that are being taken by the people 
who claim they are protecting the parks are making them 
inaccessible to ordinary rank and file Canadians.  I have already 
mentioned the fee structure which they are using to keep ordinary 
folk out.  That is an error. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other things as well.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of the considerable number of letters and presentations 
I and my colleagues have received because of Heritage Canada's 
insistence on closing down the little grass strips for private 
airplanes in Banff and Jasper. It is impossible to defend the 
closing of those airstrips if we look at it in balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It can be said that the elk used to go across the field and now 
there is an airstrip and of necessity, there is a big 10 foot 
fence around it to protect the airstrip so the animals cannot go 
on the airstrip. Sure, but I have had the occasion to fly over 
those parks in a jet plane at 25,000 or 30,000 feet.  When I 
looked down I really had to strain my eyes to see the little 
thread down there that is the Trans-Canada Highway.  The towns of 
Banff and Jasper can hardly be seen from that height simply 
because there are as many trees in the towns as there are outside 
them. People live there and tourists come from all over the world 
to visit there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To me when I look at it in balance there is a little pin spot 
which is a town, a little thread which represents a highway and 
perhaps a railway in the middle of miles and miles and miles of 
wilderness. Some people are concerned about one more little pin 
stripe just one-tenth of a millimetre long in the perspective of 
looking at it from that height.  They say, “We do not care if a 
person in a small airplane gets into trouble.  We will not have 
an emergency airstrip.  Let him fly into the mountain”.  I think 
it was the Minister of Canadian Heritage herself who said to let 
them land wherever they can. People in a small airplane cannot 
just land it anywhere on the side of a mountain without killing 
themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a totally misdirected set of priorities.  When it is 
more important for the elk and the deer to have a path to walk 
along than to preserve a human life which may be in danger, that 
is misplaced priorities.  I simply say to the government that 
there is nothing lost by keeping open a small airstrip.  There is 
nothing lost by that; there is only gain in terms of safety and 
accessibility to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have talked about the airstrip.  I have talked about the fact 
that there are miles and miles of wilderness available for the 
wildlife and we as humans are surely able to also enjoy a part of 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to come back just for a second to the almost 
sacredness of the space in our parks.  It is not a great secret 
that I am a person who believes in God.  One of the songs I have 
sung many times is “How Great Thou Art”.  I do not know if 
anyone here knows that song. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger:</B>  Please do not sing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  I will avoid the temptation to sing it on 
the prompting of the member opposite but it has a phrase, “When 
I consider the world that You have made, I see the stars, I see 
the awesome grandeur of the mountains”. It is very seldom that I 
go into the mountains that I do not think to myself and often say 
to my wife or other family members who are with me, what 
grandeur, what extravagance God used in creating this part of the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our native friends have that same affinity.  They often express 
in their religious faith the grandeur of God's creation.  We need 
to make sure that Canadians of all different backgrounds and 
visitors to our wonderful country have an opportunity to stand in 
awe of this huge monument of creation when we observe what our 
parks are.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some misdirected points in the bill before us.  One of 
the things Parks Canada and Heritage Canada try to do is to run 
roughshod over the taxpayers and citizens of this country.  That 
is a totally misdirected priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are limitations in the bill which say arbitrarily that we 
are not going to permit a park to grow beyond its existing 
boundaries.  Boom, just like that.  There is no consultation, no 
input from the people, no input from the stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger:</B>  That is total nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  No, it is not nonsense.  The member opposite 
says that what I said was nonsense.  What I am saying is not 
nonsense.  I am talking about Bill C-27.  There is no requirement 
for meaningful consultation among the stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is wrong.  There are situations in Banff for example.  A 
place which hosts visitors to our country and tries to be 
hospitable to them is now required to have buses to run its staff 
out of the park for overnight stays because it is not permitted 
to construct a building for the staff to stay overnight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Talk about ecology, talk about the environment.  What is better: 
running a bus an extra 100 kilometres a day, or having a building 
right next to where the people work so that they can walk or ride 
their bicycles to work? It is case of using a sledgehammer to 
solve a problem instead of trying to be reasonable about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very concerned about the way in which changes to parks can 
be made if we pass Bill C-27. It used to be that under the old 
Canada parks act, establishing a new park or adding land to it 
required an amendment to the act itself.  It would have to be 
debated in parliament.  It also required that notice be given in 
the Canada <I>Gazette</I> as well as in newspapers in the local 
area. That is not the case anymore.  Now it allows simply for 
orders in council.  The minister could make a declaration and 
whatever the minister said would be the new law.  No public 
notification is required. I think that is an error. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe very strongly that the ministers in many, many of the 
bills which the Liberal government is passing are being given way 
too much power.  We are losing that thread of accountability 
which comes in a good democratic system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no mention made in the bill of required public 
consultation, co-operation or support from local governments or 
provincial or territorial governments in which the parks exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to not only provide for those points of consultation, 
but I would love to see a government with the humility on many 
occasions actually to accept what the people out there are 
saying.  Most of the time the people who are working day to day 
in the parks and the area know the situation very, very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things we are going to hear is that it would be 
turned over to commercial interests.  I want to talk a bit about 
that.  I do not believe for a moment even if we turned the parks 
over totally to commercial interests that their task would be to 
completely destroy them.  Why would they destroy that which 
attracts people from all around the world? I believe they are 
very capable people who in conjunction with local, provincial and 
federal governments could consult and come to an agreement as to 
the degree of expansion required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tourism is so important to our country. 
It is economically important.  I will not negate that.  It is 
important.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have already spoken about the importance of allowing other 
people to come to our country to share in its grandeur, but it is 
also important that we provide decent Canadian hospitality and 
that will come in balance.  I am simply not prepared to say I 
trust the federal government fully and I trust the commercial 
interests not at all, because what we need is a balance.  We need 
a dialogue between them.  We need to come to agreements. 
Sometimes the federal government may have to give a little.  I 
simply do not believe in the high handed, autocratic, dictatorial 
government.  That is what we have in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very concerned about the long term future of our parks 
under a bill like this one.  The interests of the government in 
proposing Bill C-27 seem to be much more to preserve its little 
fiefdom, its little kingdom, its control.  That seems to be what 
the largest interest the government has in this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is not interested in preserving the beauty of the 
parks and their accessibility to ordinary Canadians. That is most 
important.  I would not begin to put a human being at the level 
of an animal although some would, but if an animal has a right to 
be in a park, in my view so does a human being, so do Canadians 
and so do visitors from around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like a parks policy which would permit co-operation 
among the commercial interests, the interests of tourism and the 
interests of allowing our Canadian citizens to enjoy the beauty 
of our parks.  That balance is missing in this very one sided, 
give all the power to the government, in fact, give all the power 
to the minister bill.  We should have one that would be balanced 
and which would serve Canadian people so much better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am aware that I could have more time to speak.  I have 
certainly emphasized the most important things that have been on 
my mind and in my heart.  I appreciate very much the attention 
all members in the House have given today. Only two of them have 
dared to squawk at all in protest about what I have been saying. 
The others have been blissfully silent.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased, on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois, to address at second 
reading Bill C-27, the Canada National Parks Act. This bill is an 
overhaul of the existing act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main changes proposed in this bill are a new process for 
the establishment of future parks, a substantial increase in 
fines relating to poaching, and ways to restrict the development 
of communities located within park boundaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois supports the principle of the bill. However, 
it will listen carefully to the comments and proposals by the 
various groups appearing before the heritage committee. The Bloc 
Quebecois also intends to raise certain major concerns, 
including some that have to do with the wording of a fundamental 
provision of the Canada National Parks Act, namely clause 4, 
which deals with public use of parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois also notes that while the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage claims to want to put environmental protection 
at the core of this legislation, she does not provide adequate 
funding to Parks Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, when it comes to funding, the minister is more inclined 
to implement procedures that do not concern her department, such 
as the increase in fines and in lease rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Worse still, while Parks Canada is faced with an urgent need to 
radically change its culture to protect the parks' environment, 
Parks Canada's net budget will be reduced from $313 million in 
1998 to $283 million in 2001.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like review the main amendments to the National Parks 
Act and, in passing, indicate the Bloc Quebecois' position on 
each. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us begin with the changes to the procedure for establishing 
new parks.  The current legislation calls for any new national 
park to be created by legislative means.  Bill C-27, however, 
proposes a new procedure involving an order in council.  This is 
to be tabled in each House of Parliament and then referred to 
the appropriate standing committees, but they will not have much 
time to address it.  Parliament will then be able to refuse to 
endorse it, and thus it will be rejected. 
As well, the area of a national park may not be reduced except 
by legislative means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have two comments to make on this section of the bill.  First 
of all, we appreciate the fact that the government makes a 
commitment in clause 5 not to create any new park without 
provincial consent.  This is very important.  Respect for the 
sovereignty of Quebec over its territory is essential to the 
Bloc Quebecois' support in principle of this bill.  We do, 
however, feel that the time limit for examination of the order 
by taxpayers and parliamentarians is too short. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, clause 7 of the bill stipulates that, from the time a 
proposal for a new park or expansion of a park is tabled in the 
House, the House and the committee will have just 20 days—that is 
right, 20 days—to reach a conclusion on the proposed modification 
set out in the order. 
We do not think that is enough to enable parliamentarians to do 
their work and taxpayers to organize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also proposes the establishment of seven new parks: 
three in Nunavut, one in the Northwest Territories, one in 
Newfoundland, one in Manitoba and one in Saskatchewan.  It also 
proposes the establishment of a reserve, at Pacific Rim in 
British Columbia.  Finally, it proposes the expansion of the 
Point Pelee to include Middle Island.  This park is located in 
Ontario on Lake Erie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One important thing, the bill proposes to increase fines and 
establish new offences.  The existing legislation provides fines 
for poaching wildlife.  These fines vary from $10,000 to 
$150,000 and may involve imprisonment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With Bill C-27, the fines for poaching would increase from 
$50,000 and/or six months' imprisonment on summary conviction to 
$150,000 and/or up to five years' imprisonment on conviction on 
indictment as the result of a charge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These fines for poaching are in keeping with those found in the 
Wild Animal and Plant Protection and Regulation of International 
and Interprovincial Trade Act, the Canadian Wildlife Act and the 
Migratory Birds Convention Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill contains a new offence for trafficking.  This offence 
will apply to fauna, flora and natural resources.  Thus the 
possession of rare plants and fossils for trade or barter and 
the possession of objects with the intention of trafficking 
constitute an offence. 
The maximum fine will be $10,000, but it could go as high as 
$150,000 with imprisonment when endangered or protected species 
are involved.

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-27 also proposes penalties for repeat offenders. Its 
provisions allow for the imposition of fines for each specimen 
of wildlife species taken, and for each day during which an 
offence is committed. Finally, the bill will allow authorities 
to recover the costs of cleaning up the damage caused by 
substances spilled in a park. The Bloc Quebecois cares about the 
parks' environmental integrity and supports all of these 
measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also seeks to restrict the development of communities. 
Currently, the existing act does not include any mechanism to 
restrict the commercial development of communities located in 
parks. 
The proposed new legislation corrects this flaw by providing 
that parliament will approve community plans that will become 
schedules to the act. These plans will have to be consistent 
with the management plan for the park in which the community is 
located and with any guidelines established by the minister for 
appropriate activities within the park community, provide a 
strategy for the management of growth within the park community, 
and be consistent with principles of no net negative 
environmental impact and responsible environmental stewardship 
and heritage conservation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The plan will include a description of the lands comprising the 
park community, a description of the lands comprising the 
commercial zones of the park community, and an indication of the 
maximum floor area permitted within the commercial zones of the 
park community. This means that commercial growth will be 
subject to ceilings, and any change will require passage of a 
new act, which means a national debate in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus all opinions on the matter could be expressed at that 
time. We note, however, that the bill has nothing to say on many 
points relating to these communities.  There is no reference to 
who will draw up these community plans, nor to how the 
communities will finance standard utilities.  There is no 
assurance of an elementary respect for municipal bylaws or 
provincial regulations.  This is a point of considerable concern 
to the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 16, moreover, gives the governor in council considerable 
powers over the communities.  It is stated in 16(g) states that 
the governor in council may make regulations respecting: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(g)the issuance, amendment and termination of leases, licences 
of occupation and easements or servitudes, and the acceptance of 
the surrender or resiliation of leases and the relinquishment of 
licences of occupation and easements or servitudes, of or over 
public lands 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(i) in towns and visitor centres, for the purposes of residence, 
schools, churches, hospitals, trade, tourism and places of 
recreation or entertainment, 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(ii) in resort subdivisions, for the purpose of residence. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This clause disconcerts us because there is a total lack of 
recourse for those living within national parks against 
potential abuse of such regulatory power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois intends to listen to what community 
representatives have to say when the Standing Committee on 
Canadian Heritage meets. 
In the opinion of the Bloc Quebecois, their point of view must 
be taken into consideration, and a proper balance struck between 
their interests and those of conserving the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Above and beyond this bill, a change in corporate culture is 
required.  Unfortunately, the bill shows no evidence of this. 
In fact, the focal point of the bill, clause 4, states as 
follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>4.(1) The national parks of Canada are hereby dedicated to the 
people of Canada for their benefit, education and enjoyment, 
subject to this Act and the regulations, and the parks shall be 
maintained and made use of so as to leave them unimpaired for 
the enjoyment of future generations.

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois considers that this bill puts the focus more 
on the benefit and enjoyment of the people of Canada than on the 
ecological protection of the national parks.  The former appear 
first, while ecological integrity comes second.  We should 
reverse the order of this provision and strengthen the wording 
to make clear the primary purpose of a park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, in a recent report, the auditor general pointed out 
that the national parks were used more for tourist purposes than 
to preserve their ecological integrity.  He deplored the fact 
that the protection of the natural setting was at the mercy of 
visitor traffic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to quote the auditor general: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Delays in preparing management plans and ecosystem conservation 
plans reduce Parks Canada's ability to preserve the ecological 
integrity of national parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thirteen parks reported that they 
did not have a fully completed ecosystem conservation plan. The 
management plans of the six parks that we reviewed did not 
provide a clear link between ecological integrity objectives and 
initiatives. We are concerned that in some instances, management 
plans emphasize social and economic factors over ecological 
factors.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Last month, the Panel on the Ecological Integrity of Canada's 
National Parks released its report in which it said:

year is “The Future Starts Here”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Composting, a natural means of recycling, decomposes and 
transforms organic matter into humus, a product that can be used 
to improve soil texture and fertility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Food, agricultural and gardening waste, and paper, wood, manure 
and leaves are excellent organic matter for composting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Quebec is a leader in this field, having 
adopted, in 1998, an action plan on the management of residual 
fertilizers so that by the year 2008 up to 60% of recoverable 
putrescible matter will be recovered annually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What explanation can there be for the absence of any reference 
to composting on Agriculture Canada's website except this 
government's deplorable lack of sensitivity with respect to the 
environment, which is clearly demonstrated by its stand on 
organic farming.

</I></B></P><P align=left>These brave soldiers fought for our country and now they must

indifference from our military.  It is only after the death of

took an interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now learn that the Royal Military College did a study on

what was going on there, saw that she was totally responsible for 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister is going to make a claim, she must be prepared

</I></B></P><P align=left>Deloitte & Touche criticized the draft plan and there are no

there is a long term problem here and it is simply not being 
addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unbelievable how a minister of the crown can say that 
everything is incorporated and everything is going just fine. Her

</I></B></P><P align=left>Deloitte & Touche said that there was not even, and I quote, “a

revealing the billion dollar bungle was kept under wraps until an 
access request forced its release.  Now access requests are being 
routinely withheld.  Deloitte & Touche's condemnation of the six

Minister of Transport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the inauguration of the St. Lawrence Seaway system 40 
years ago, the creation of a marine transportation system became 
a shining example of international co-operation between Canada 
and the United States that is the envy of the world. Canada has 
maintained the option of building an all Canadian seaway system 
throughout this period. Can the minister please tell the House 
whether or not this option is still necessary? 
<P><A NAME="LINK142"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is unnecessary and that is why this morning in 
Cornwall I announced the termination of plans for an all Canadian 
seaway route. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that this was a negotiating tactic used by the 
former Liberal government headed very successfully by Mr. St. 
Laurent against the U.S. in the early 1950s to overcome 
Congressional objections to the building of the seaway.  As a 
result, the seaway is working very efficiently today and we do 
not need all of the land for an all Canadian route. That is why I 
made the announcement today.  Three hundred acres of land, some 
of it very beautiful along the shores of the St. Lawrence, will 
be returned to its natural state and will be used for the benefit 
of future generations of Canadians.  It will enhance that 
beautiful city.

Speaker, I have given notice of a question of privilege and I 
want you to refer first to Joseph Maingot's second edition, 
chapter 12, wherein it is made clear that a question of privilege 
is a proper vehicle for bringing to the attention of the House a 
matter which the House may consider to be a contempt of this 
House.  I particularly direct your attention to pages 224 and 
225.

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I make this point at the outset, Mr. Speaker, to remove from 
your mind any consideration of the usual test that you would 
apply for any breach of the immunities of parliamentary 
privilege.  I am compelled to use the vehicle of a question of 
privilege to ask that you find there is evidence of a prima facie 
contempt of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a letter on House of Commons stationery, which was 
procured at the expense of the Canadian taxpayer.  The letter 
solicits attendance at a meeting to meet representatives for the 
leadership race for the Canadian Alliance.  The letter was signed 
by the member of parliament for New 
Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby.  It was sent out using first 
class postal frank, which is again using a publicly financed 
facility.  I am prepared to table that letter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apart from the hypocrisy of using public funds by a member of a 
party who says it is for fiscal responsibility, or stands for 
fiscal responsibilities, and less use of public expenditures, 
this is a gross misuse of the facilities put at the disposal of 
members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a place for partisan activity in every member's office. 
However, I submit that it is a gross impropriety for a member to 
finance his party's leadership race using publicly paid for 
facilities and supplies.  Supporters of the member's party should 
pay for this sort of message not every Canadian taxpayer, whether 
it is my riding, your riding, Mr. Speaker, or any other member's 
riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit that every member knows that this is wrong and that 
there has been a deliberate abuse of the system by the member for 
New Westminister—Coquitlam—Burnaby.  This offends the unwritten 
practices of the House and, as such, constitutes contempt of the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question that arises is just how much more of the Canadian 
Alliance leadership race is going to be publicly financed by the 
Canadian taxpayers?  Why should I, as an MP, have to defend to my 
overtaxed constituents this sort or abuse?  This brings into 
disrepute the reputation of every member of the House.  This sort 
of action brings public life into disrepute and, for this reason, 
it is contemptuous of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Party leadership races should be financed through the party or 
private contributors.  By abusing the trust which every member 
has to use public supplies and services in a proper manner, the 
member for New Westminister—Coquitlam—Burnaby has, in my 
opinion, brought the House into odium and public disrespect.  As 
members of parliament, we are all offended by this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should you, Mr. Speaker, find that there is a prima facie case 
to be answered by the member, I am prepared to move the necessary 
motion to refer the matter to committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that, I rest my case.  I am sure other members will also want 
to engage in the debate on this question of privilege.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Before I hear any other interventions,

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speaker does not interfere to tell Hon. Members in what 
instances they may use their frank or may not use their frank. 
This is up to the Hon. Member to determine.  He does it within 
his own conception of what is or is not proper.  If something 
improper arises, Hon. Members usually discuss it in the 
Committee. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where this usually comes up is in the committee for internal 
economy and would possibly be sent to the committee for 
procedure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think what you are asking, if not me, the House to do is to 
look at all the material that members send out under their frank. 
This would be extremely difficult.  The House, or a committee of 
the House, or the Speaker would become a censor to what members 
can or cannot send out.

<P><A NAME="LINK162"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, during question period, the Minister of Industry 
suggested that it was the first time I had asked a question of 
him since becoming the industry critic for our party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>Hansard</I> will show that is not true, and I— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  That is not exactly a point of order, but I 
am sure the hon. member has made his point.  Of course I did not 
like the words “not true”, but we will let it roll for today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK163"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, as the foreign affairs critic of the official 
opposition, the Canadian Alliance, I asked a question today.  In 
his response, the Deputy Prime Minister gave some information 
which, in my view, did not justify the situation.  I would like 
this clarified so that the Deputy Prime Minister can retract the 
baseless information and the wrong premise that was said about 
me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the last election, one newspaper, which did not do the 
proper research, published some comments about me in the 
newspaper.  I contacted the newspaper and, at the same time, I 
contacted the ambassador of Liberia to Canada.  The ambassador 
wrote a letter to me justifying the truth and giving the 
information surrounding the circumstances.  Thereafter, I 
contacted the newspaper.  The newspaper confessed that its 
research was not right and it verbally retracted the information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the House, and the media, which are not doing their 
research properly, to know that I was an assistant professor of 
management at the University of Liberia.  As an assistant 
professor, I had absolutely no connection with the government. 
The ambassador's letter indicates that for one to participate or 
get involved in Liberian politics, one has to be a Negro by 
origin.  That is what the ambassador wrote in the letter and I 
have a copy of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lastly, I had a business which dealt with agricultural 
products. People in that country were dying of hunger because 
they did not have enough food to eat.  I wrote a letter to the 
president of the country, simply to launch a green revolution.  I 
wanted them to invest in the soil so that people could be 
self-sufficient in producing food, which would alleviate poverty, 
malnutrition and hunger.  Is that a crime?  I would suggest— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I think the hon. member has moved his point, 
that the information which was alluded to in the House was not 
absolutely accurate.  He has given ample information for us to 
make up our own minds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have 15 more seconds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  All right, I will give you 15 more seconds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I want to ask 
the Deputy Prime Minister to retract his statement.  Rather than 
appreciating someone who is helping a poor country, he is 
accusatory.  That is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  That is what happens in debate.  Sometimes 
people misinterpret things, but we are here to debate.  The hon. 
member is going to be on record and I am sure all hon. members 
will read his explanation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>For the fiscal years from 1995-96 to 1998-99, can the Canadian 
Security Intelligence Service, CSIS, indicate whether one or more 
employees of the House of Commons or the Senate of Canada and/or 
federal member(s) of parliament, cabinet minister(s) or 
senator(s) received money from CSIS, and if so, can CSIS produce 
the documentation and the names of the individuals in question? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK184"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> 
Based on precedents of the House of Commons followed for many 
years and noted at paragraph 446 in Beauchesne's, when responding 
to inquiries or parliamentary returns, the Canadian Security 
Intelligence Service, CSIS, does not comment on operational 
activities nor release specific details of its budget and 
expenditures for reasons of national security. This practice is 
consistent with the policy set out in section 19 of the Canadian 
Security Intelligence Service Act that requires that the service 
not disclose information obtained in the performance of its 
duties and functions under this act.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA NATIONAL PARKS ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK187">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-27, an 
act respecting the National Parks of Canada, be read the second 
time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK188"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, when I 
was interrupted by oral question period, I was referring to the 
Panel on Ecological Integrity report—and had reached the third 
statement: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Panel concurs with the conclusions in the State of Parks 
1997 Report.  Ecological integrity in our national parks is in 
peril. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the following page, the Commission continues as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parks Canada currently lacks the necessary capacity in both the 
natural and social sciences to effectively manage for, and 
inform society about, ecological integrity in national parks. 
With notable individual exceptions, all levels of Parks Canada 
lack a well-established culture for conducting, using and 
appreciating science as part of park management, interpretation 
and regional integration. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This eloquently and clearly demonstrates that Bill C-27, which we 
have before us, ought to clearly give priority to the mission of 
protecting the integrity of the natural environment instead of 
to visitor enjoyment, as clause 4 states very directly.  This is 
yet another clause in the bill which shows a certain lack of 
concern for ecological issues.  I refer to clause 8(2), which 
states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>8(2) Maintenance of ecological integrity through the protection 
of natural resources shall be the first priority of the Minister 
in the consideration of park zoning and visitor use. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that, in the French version of the bill, the phrase 
“s'efforcer avant tout” is not strong enough to ensure the 
ecological integrity of the national parks. This phrase is a 
joke when we know that currently the national parks system 
receives 14 million visitors a year and that, with a 4.5% 
expected growth rate, the number could double in the next 15 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why the Panel on the Ecological Integrity of Canada's 
National Parks is suggesting Parks Canada radically modify its 
corporate culture. The following are some of its 
recommendations: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Parks Canada transform itself and change its training, 
staffing, decision-making and accountability structures to 
reflect the central importance of ecological integrity 
throughout Canada's national parks and make ecological integrity 
the core of every Parks Canada employee's job; that Parks Canada 
upgrade its social and natural science, planning and 
interpretation capacity to be able to manage national parks 
according to the principles of ecological integrity and better 
educate the public, and that Parks Canada cease the product 
marketing of national parks and  concentrate instead on 
marketing in keeping with parks values and focused marketing 
when necessary. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, the concept of ecological integrity must be made the 
priority of the bill. Moreover, we must see to it that 
ministerial statements are translated into action in the field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While calls for a change in the corporate culture of Parks 
Canada are coming from everywhere, year after year we see a 
steady decline in the financial resources Canadian Heritage is 
allocating its national parks system.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the Liberals took office, Parks Canada had a $410 million 
budget. Today, its budget is $350 million. Its staff has been 
reduced from 4,000 to 3,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parks Canada paid dearly for budget cuts, as Kevin McNamee, of 
the Canadian Nature Federation, stated in evidence before the 
Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage, during the study of the 
bill creating the Parks Canada Agency. He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it's important to recognize that there has already been 
a tremendous loss of experience in corporate knowledge from 
Parks Canada across this country. 
Three rounds of budget cuts, the Mazankowski budget cuts, the 
loss of Green Plan funding programs I and II, the reorganization 
of Parks Canada and the Department of Canadian Heritage—all have 
had a toll on the agency. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could continue quoting Mr. McNamee, but I will move on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, it is worth reminding the House that some people 
saw in national parks an opportunity to play petty politics. For 
instance, the November 22, 1972 edition of the <I>Montréal Matin</I> 
reported that, on November 19, the then Minister of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development, the current Prime Minister, 
speaking about the Mauricie park, had stated, on CTV, and I 
quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I used this park to break the Quebec government's back. And I 
tell you I am proud of this. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a quotation from the former Minister of Indian Affairs 
and Northern Development and present Prime Minister. It was not 
me who said that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such attitudes are revolting. If we want to protect the 
integrity of the environment, we must do what it takes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed legislation also provides for the designation of 
historic sites. However, it provides nothing about consulting 
the provinces, and that is very disturbing. That is 
unacceptable. Clause 42 of the bill provides that the Governor 
in Council may set apart any land, the title to which is vested 
in Her Majesty in right of Canada, as a national historic site 
of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While generally it is only natural to do as we please on our own 
turf, certain initiatives must be taken in consultation with 
local people and their local and provincial elected 
representatives and in accordance with existing acts and 
regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently, the transport department ignored the Quebec moratorium 
on road advertising and allowed one of its agencies to take out 
a lucrative contract for the installation of two dozen 
billboards along well-travelled roads in Montreal, thereby 
jeopardizing the safety of Montrealers and visitors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois will call for an amendment to that provision 
of the bill in order to ensure the conformity of federal actions 
with those of other levels of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I repeat that the Bloc Quebecois supports Bill 
C-27 in principle. But before principles can be turned into 
reality, there are often practical considerations that have to 
be taken into account, the first one being the respect of 
interested populations and their local governments. That is why 
the Bloc Quebecois will listen to the representations that they 
will make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First and foremost, this bill cannot and must not perpetuate the 
overuse of national parks resources for recreational purposes. 
On the contrary, it seems to us in the Bloc that the 
preservation of the ecological integrity of these parks should 
be the priority in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The weather is nice and warm today. I encourage Canadians to 
visit their national parks; a word of caution however: respect 
the environment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to enter the debate on Bill C-27. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to start my remarks by reading section 4.(1) of the 
bill, which seeks to amend the National Parks Act.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>4.(1)  The national parks of Canada are hereby dedicated to the 
people of Canada for their benefit, education and enjoyment, 
subject to this Act and the regulations, and the parks shall be 
maintained and made use of so as to leave them unimpaired for the 
enjoyment of future generations. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think there is a person in Canada who would argue with 
those sentiments regarding what we consider to be one of our 
national treasures, which is our national parks system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, throughout the notes and the newspaper clippings 
regarding Bill C-27 people use the term national treasure.  The 
word treasure seems to come up very freely in people's minds when 
they think of Canada's parks.  It is probably very Canadian that 
our greatest national treasure, our parks system, has no monetary 
value.  It is a very Canadian thing.  Perhaps it is ironic that 
we cannot put a price on our national parks.  Nor should they 
ever be commercialized in any way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the sentiment that most Canadians have brought forward 
to the committee that is dealing with Bill C-27.  If we stopped 
most Canadians on the street, I think they would emphasize over 
and over again that the last thing they want to see is the 
over-commercialization of what we consider to be our heritage and 
our national treasure, which is our national parks system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The original National Parks Act was passed in 1930.  The most 
recent changes were as long ago as 1988.  The National Parks Act 
sets out legislative mechanisms for preserving our national parks 
system.  It exists solely to preserve our national parks, and we 
must keep that in mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the comments made earlier today by members of other 
parties frankly worried me in that both the tone and the content 
of those remarks would lead people to believe that maybe there 
should be a movement afoot to expand the commercialization or 
even to expand access to the national parks, which would put into 
jeopardy their greatest quality, the wilderness aspect and the 
truly pristine nature of the parks, which is a tourist attraction 
not just to Canadians, but to people all around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On his radio program not long ago Peter Gzowski said that every 
year he goes to our newest national park in the high Arctic, a 
remote, inaccessible, fly-in type of wilderness reserve.  He has 
done this annually since the park was a created a number of years 
ago.  He was saying that he has yet to run into another Canadian 
tourist there.  The people who visit the park are the Japanese, 
the Germans, the Swiss, the British—people from densely 
populated areas of the world who value and cherish the pristine 
nature of the true wilderness of the Canadian north and the 
Canadian parks system.  That sort of struck me.  I think maybe we 
do not appreciate what we have here.  I think we undervalue the 
true resources we have in ecotourism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be like killing the goose that laid the golden egg to 
allow an advanced level of commercialism into a park.  It would 
deter from the ecotourism opportunities that should exist for 
generations and generations.  Those opportunities would become 
more valuable as the settings became more rare and more 
threatened by expansion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are parts of the world, and I have travelled to many of 
them, where human beings have soiled their nest to the point they 
can no longer lie in it.  These people want the peace and 
serenity that comes with communing with nature to a degree that 
we can only do in our national parks system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very pleased that Bill C-27 will amend the National Parks 
Act to streamline the process of establishing new parks.  We feel 
this is very important. 
We feel that the current system of establishing new parks has 
been cumbersome and lengthy.  We believe that the system could 
benefit greatly if the early stages of the research necessary to 
establish a new park could be done by order in council instead of 
parliament.  Ultimately, the final choice has to be made by 
parliament, but the intermediate steps could be done by order in 
council.  This would streamline the process for creating new 
national parks.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the NDP are very pleased that Bill C-27 will control the 
commercial development within park communities.  There are seven 
communities within our national parks.  All communities, by their 
very nature, wish to grow, prosper and develop.  However, we have 
to treat these seven communities very differently.  There has to 
be a different set of rules because of the very sensitive 
surroundings they find themselves in.  They are unique in Canada. 
We have to allow these communities to prosper and flourish as a 
community without the normal type of expansion that we see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Steps have been taken to limit the population in Banff National 
Park for that very reason.  The town of Banff has to be curtailed 
because of its immense international popularity.  People 
naturally crave and seek to live in those types of beautiful 
surroundings.  This has to be dealt with by government.  We are 
glad to see that Bill C-27 will expand and enhance the ability of 
the government to regulate that sort of thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments in Bill C-27 will increase the protection of 
wildlife and other park resources.  I know the hon. parliamentary 
secretary used some examples of the horrific impact of poaching, 
whether it is for trophies for hunters or whether it is for the 
trafficking of animal parts for medicinal purposes and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member used the example of Dall sheep.  I am well aware 
that the value of a Dall sheep trophy head is upwards of 
$150,000.  There is an enormous temptation for those who are 
leaning that way to abuse the system and poach these animals. 
Sheep Mountain is within Kluane National Park, where I used to 
work, where Dall sheep are very famous.  They are hunted 
legitimately by hunters with permits, but they are also poached. 
I am very glad to hear that Bill C-27 will take steps to further 
punish those who would threaten our wildlife resources through 
poaching. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the NDP believe that Bill C-27 is a Liberal reaction to 
what has been allowed to become an absolute mess.  I spent the 
first few minutes of my speech pointing out the things that we 
appreciate about Bill C-27, but I would be remiss not 
to point out the fact that devastating Liberal budget cuts year 
after year have decimated the ranks of our Parks Canada staff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cuts have decimated the parks in the sense that staff no 
longer have the ability to control the traffic through our parks 
or the number of people using our parks.  Our national parks in 
Canada are in desperate need of repair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I blow its horn or sound its virtues too loudly, Bill 
C-27 is the bare minimum that the Liberal government could be 
doing to address what we consider to be an abrogation of 
responsibility.  Some cuts just do not heal, and the cuts made to 
national parks personnel have really threatened and jeopardized 
the integrity of our national parks system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill formally establishes seven national parks, most of them 
with names that I cannot say, as they are in a language I do not 
speak.  Three of them are in Nunavut, I am pleased to say.  One 
is in the Northwest Territories.  One is in my home province of 
Manitoba, on the shores of Hudson's Bay, and is called Wapusk. 
Wapusk in the Cree language means white bear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This area on the shore of Hudson's Bay, in the federal riding of 
Churchill, is one of the very well known breeding grounds and 
calving grounds for the polar bear population. 
I am very pleased to see this area recognized and protected 
within the parameters of a national park.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be a new park called Grasslands in the province of 
Saskatchewan, which will preserve some of the native prairie of 
the great prairie region that I come from.  There will also be a 
new park in Newfoundland called Gros Morne.  I should point out 
as well that in British Columbia the Pacific Rim National Park 
will occupy the area currently occupied by the West Coast Trail, 
a very popular tourist destination.  This area has such a degree 
of traffic and such an interest for international travellers that 
it is only fitting it should be preserved and enshrined as a 
heritage area and designated as one of our national parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a great deal of interest in the bill.  I have 
various newspaper clippings in which journalists have commented 
on the action that will be taken by Bill C-27.  One interesting 
comment which was made in an Ontario newspaper pointed out that 
under the current legislation, unbelievably, there are no 
legislative controls on commercial development in park 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People took it for granted that our parks were being cared for 
better than that, that successive governments would have been 
seized of the issue adequately enough to make sure that there 
were some legislative controls on commercial development within 
our parks, but this article points out that all that exists is a 
provision whereby the boundaries of Banff and Jasper may be fixed 
by adding them to a schedule of the act.  That is a pretty modest 
intervention; not really enough to be satisfied that our national 
parks are being cared for or that commercial expansion is not 
threatening the integrity of our parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are pleased that within the proposed legislation community 
plans based on legislated principles will be proposed for each 
park community and that those community plans will be tabled in 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation would control commercial development in the park 
communities by providing the authority to entrench in a schedule 
of the National Parks Act the boundaries of each park community, 
the boundaries of the commercial zones and the maximum commercial 
floor space allowed.  We are really getting quite specific.  We 
are defining how big we will allow these communities to get 
within our national parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one wants to see the beauty of our national parks trivialized 
by turning them into a Disneyland.  We do not want Dolly Parton 
setting up some kind of a theme park within one of our national 
parks.  In my opinion, that would cheapen those parks for all 
future use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, there are seven communities within the 
national parks.  Everyone is aware of the towns of Banff and 
Jasper, and the visitor centres of Lake Louise, Field and 
Waterman Lakes, but not many people know that Wasagaming and 
Waskiseu are also within national parks.  All of these 
communities experience to varying degrees internal pressures to 
develop.  As I said, it is only natural for a community and for 
the town councillors to want to promote and expand their 
community.  We have to caution them that they have the great 
privilege of living within one of our national parks, among the 
scenery, the beauty and the serenity of our national parks, and 
that they have a unique obligation to maintain their community, 
perhaps even to a higher set of standards than we hold for people 
outside the national parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That will be in the legislation.  It will no longer be an 
option.  It will be deemed to be law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The community plans will have to be tabled in the House of 
Commons.  Most Canadians agree that a community plan for a 
community within a national park has to be consistent with the 
management plan for the park, first and foremost.  A town or 
community will have its own objectives and goals.  Those goals 
will have to be harmonized with the long term interests of the 
park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the aboriginal community there is a saying that no decisions 
should be made until we consider seven generations back and seven 
generations forward.  I think that would be a good motto or theme 
for people who are considering the future of our national parks. 
We have to consider with any changes we make what they will do 
for at least seven generations forward.  That would be our 
obligation. If every generation adopted that, we would move 
forward with some cohesive plan.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have already talked about the poaching penalties.  I am 
pleased to see in another newspaper article that the penalties 
range from a $10,000 fine on summary conviction to a $150,000 
fine and/or imprisonment of up to six months on indictment.  I 
approve of that wholeheartedly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having lived in the north and having seen poachers in action 
even within the boundaries of our national parks, our party 
supports thoroughly the idea that penalties should be increased 
to be commensurate with the crime.  As our natural wildlife 
resources are depleted and get more and more scarce, that crime 
is becoming more and more severe than it ever was before.  It 
should be viewed that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-27 could be considered to be the Liberal response to a 
series of damning reports on Canada's national parks.  It is no 
secret to the general community what 10 years of negligence has 
done to the national parks.  It has been well documented and well 
recorded in a variety of reports, not the least of which is the 
1996 Banff-Bow Valley task force report and Parks Canada's own 
1994 and 1997 state of the parks reports.  Another very damning 
and condemning report was the landmark report of the Panel on the 
Ecological Integrity of Canada's National Parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The term ecological integrity comes up often. I noticed the 
minister borrowed this language when she first announced Bill 
C-27.  In her statement of March 16, 1999 when she tabled this 
legislation and spoke to it on introduction, she said, and this 
is one comment with which I agree, “Our national parks are 
treasures that we must protect for all Canadians and for all 
future generations”.  Nobody can argue with that kind of lofty 
principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She went on to say, “The tabling of the bill fulfils my June 
26, 1998 commitment to take further steps to preserve the 
ecological integrity of the country's national parks”.  That is 
where we have to blow the whistle.  It is really stretching 
things to say that the tabling of Bill C-27 fulfils her June 26 
commitment to take further steps to preserve ecological 
integrity.  I cannot agree with that and I am surprised the 
minister had the nerve to say that Bill C-27 achieves that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, the term ecological integrity sums up the prevailing 
wisdom of environmentalists in regard to development within 
parks.  It is common language usage and it has a very specific 
meaning to those who are experts in the field.  It is not just 
two words thrown together.  People recognize the term as meaning 
a certain thing.  I do not believe the minister can convince 
anybody that Bill C-27 is going to have the effect of actually 
preserving the ecological integrity of our parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The person who currently chairs the environment committee, and I 
am unable to remember which riding he represents, but when he was 
a member of the opposition in 1988 he was also a member of the 
environment committee. He proposed an amendment to the Canada 
Parks Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Davenport. 
<P><A NAME="LINK190"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, he is 
the member for Davenport.  I thank the member who has just helped 
me with the riding name of the chair of the environment 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member put forward an amendment to the Canada Parks Act that 
would have given some satisfaction to the concept of ecological 
integrity but his own party voted it down because the language 
was too strong.  I guess the Liberal Party was frightened by the 
language.  He did not even get the support of his own caucus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The language of the amendment he put forward in partnership with 
the leader of the NDP was that “the ecological integrity and the 
protection of natural resources shall be the first priority when 
considering the uses and activities of and in our national 
parks”.  Had that language succeeded in 1988, the national parks 
of Canada would be in a far different state than they are today. 
It would have been binding in the truest sense of the word. 
This would have regulated and would have been the enabling 
language where the enforcement officers could have acted in the 
first interests of the national parks and not in the first 
interests of commercialization, expansion, development, real 
estate, and all the other competing interests for our treasured 
national parks.  Had the Liberal party supported its own member 
on the environment committee with that amendment, it could have 
carried the day and we would have been facing a different 
situation today.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am here to say on behalf of our caucus and on behalf of our 
national parks critic that the New Democratic Party believes Bill 
C-27 is a good start. We in the NDP are happy to say that we 
believe the basic tools for saving Canada's national parks are 
found in Bill C-27. However, like most Liberal legislation, we 
believe that Bill C-27 stops short of doing all that is really 
necessary to protect the ecological integrity of Canada's 
national parks system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be fighting for amendments to the act.  There is a long 
list of them here, but the first and only one I have time to 
express is that we want a definition of ecological integrity 
built into the act so that people fully understand the impact 
those words really have and what they mean to the environmental 
community. 
<P><A NAME="LINK191"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, my question deals specifically with two of our most 
notable national parks, namely Banff and Jasper.  Most Canadians 
would agree that those are the two that stand out in most 
people's minds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite valid for beautiful places like those to be 
accessible not only to Canadians of wealth, but ordinary 
Canadians as well.  They should be accessible to those who come 
here from other parts of the world simply because they want to 
enjoy and admire the grandeur of God's creation in this part of 
the world. It is highly desirable that these places be accessible 
to people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has indicated there should be no privatization in 
these parks.  Is the hon. member proposing that the government 
should operate hotels, lodging places and places which supply 
meals for visitors?  Should the government do it instead of 
private enterprise or is he simply proposing that we put up big 
fences and just keep people out altogether? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>   Madam Speaker, I thought I had made 
myself quite clear that we were against the expansion of 
commercialization of the national parks beyond what would be 
found within a community plan.  The community plan would be 
limited and regulated by parliament or by the department, 
certainly by government.  At no time was I saying that all 
private interests should be kept out of our national parks. We 
are not advocating the nationalization of motels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the hon. member that he opened his remarks by saying 
that these places should be accessible.  I agree that they should 
be accessible within reasonable limits.  He talked about people 
having the right to enjoy the beauty of God's creation.  I remind 
him that God's creation is a very fragile place.  The very 
ecosystems we seek to preserve so we can show our children a 
little bit about God's creation are very fragile.  Once lost, 
they are lost forever. Accessibility is one thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even revenue generating is not an evil thing.  If tourists wish 
to come here from other parts of the world and they have the 
wherewithal and the means, charging them a fee to get into our 
parks is not untoward.   Accessibility is a dual-edged sword.  We 
should not be pricing people out of enjoying the grandeur of our 
national parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To answer the twofold question of the hon. member, we cannot 
have unfettered access to the parks.  The hon. member used the 
example of an airstrip or future additional airstrips within the 
parks. I disagree wholeheartedly. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1255"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other side of the question was commercialization.  We are 
against the unfettered expansion of communities within the parks 
and the commercialization of retail stores, et cetera within the 
parks, if it exceeds the community plan that was put in place by 
the national parks act and the regulatory bodies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Madam Speaker, I suppose we could just step 
outside and have a conversation but we are doing it publicly 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member said specifically that he was against the presence of 
the small grass airstrips which are there.  It is not possible 
for large aircraft to land there.  The small aircraft strips are 
designed mainly for emergency and some recreational use by people 
who own small planes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a small plane in the area is in trouble, would the member 
rather have the pilot put his airplane into the side of a 
mountain or to have an accessible airstrip?  That is one 
question.  The second one is very short.  I would like him to 
respond to the present method of providing for the enlargement of 
a resort location. Presently it requires a change in the act by 
parliament. According to Bill C-27, it is going to be put 
entirely into the hands of the minister.  Is the member pleased 
with that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Madam Speaker, to answer the question 
about a small grass airstrip within the park, I used to be a land 
use manager officer within the parks system in the Yukon. Every 
national park or provincial park has airstrips, means of egress, 
and an emergency measures operation manual for getting people in 
and out if there is an accident, an emergency, a forest fire or 
any number of things.  Those provisions already exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understood the member to mean a sports and leisure access for 
hobbyists, for small plane owners to buzz around the national 
parks.  I can say that the ultralight craze was very disruptive 
to the porcupine caribou herd that used to go through the Yukon. 
Wealthy sports enthusiasts would buzz around the porcupine 
caribou herd so that they could get closer pictures of them.  I 
do not think we want to encourage that at all but I am satisfied 
that we have to have access into the park and a means of egress 
for emergencies, forest fires or whatever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of allowing the expansion of parks or the creation of 
new parks to be determined by order in council, I do not see that 
as negative at all.  I do not see it as taking away the authority 
of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clearly stated in Bill C-27 that only the initial stages 
of the expansion of a park or the creation of a new park can be 
done by order in council.  The ultimate choice and decision would 
still be made by elected officials in the House of Commons.  We 
are not threatened by that.  We do not think that is a devolution 
of powers to the bureaucracy or to the ruling party alone.  We 
think that will expedite and fasttrack the creation of new parks. 
Our party is very much in favour of that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK192"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, with some 
trepidation, it is a pleasure that I rise today as we begin the 
important process of examining Bill C-27, the Canada national 
parks act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize that changes are necessary if we are to protect and 
enhance Canada's national parks system.  Yet I am concerned, 
among other things, that Bill C-27 will lead to the reduced role 
of Canada's parliamentarians in the creation of future national 
parks and national historic sites. Furthermore, I believe the 
bill will seriously restrict the ability of local residents 
living in our national parks to have any meaningful input into 
the future of their communities.  For instance, clause 9 of the 
bill reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Powers in relation to land use, community planning and 
development in park communities may not be exercised by a local 
government body, except as provided in the agreement referred to 
in section 35. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreement in question is for the town of Banff, but what 
about the town of Jasper?  In the May 2 <I>Gazette</I> there was a 
story about the residents of Jasper who were very upset about a 
Parks Canada plan to more than double and even quadruple the 
annual rates residents and businesses paid for their land.

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about a figure of $2.2 million being suddenly 
increased to $5.2 million.  I would call that a very significant 
increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Canadian Heritage will likely point to the fact 
that living within one of Canada's national parks is a privilege. 
To live within one of Canada's most beautiful scenic areas in the 
world is probably a wonderful privilege, a privilege which I am 
sure the residents truly appreciate.  However, let us not forget 
that for many of these residents, this national park has been 
their home for many years.  They grew up there, as did their 
parents before them.  They have a vested interest in wanting to 
help preserve the natural beauty of the area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Dick Ireland, a chairman of the town committee that has some 
limited input into the way Parks Canada manages Jasper, bemoaned 
the lack of municipally elected officials by declaring that the 
existing system is basically a system by which the residents pay 
taxes without the benefit of representation. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of improving the situation, I am convinced that this 
bill will only make things even more difficult. Where will these 
people turn to? Who will be their advocate? Will the heritage 
minister be able to meet their needs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same problem exists in other national parks where people 
live on a permanent basis. I have received letters from some of 
those residents who want to express their displeasure with this 
bill. They are not satisfied with the way they are represented, 
even if they pay taxes. They see no solution in this bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it stands now, these residents feel like they are paying 
taxes without any representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I expressed concern about the lack of input being afforded 
parliamentarians in the creation of a new national park.  I can 
appreciate why the Liberal government would want to reduce the 
lengthy process involved with designating an area as a new 
national park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we recently witnessed with the creation of Tuktut Nogait 
National Park in the Northwest Territories, it can take virtually 
years before we can finally arrive at a satisfactory agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, I think it would be a mistake for us to shirk our 
responsibility simply in the name of expediency. Creating new 
national parks by an order in council will rob Canadians of an 
opportunity to witness some healthy debate.  It reduces the role 
of parliament by transferring more power to cabinet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To remove any lands from a national park would require an act of 
parliament.  If an act of parliament is required to remove lands, 
then perhaps it should also require an act of parliament to 
create new or expand existing national parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps my fears should be lessened by clause 7.1 of the act 
which states that any amendments to our national parks will be 
tabled in each House of parliament and then referred to the 
standing committee that considers matters relating to parks, 
which in this case would be the Canadian Heritage committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would welcome such a move since it would give our committee an 
opportunity to closely examine the proposed changes while also 
providing interested stakeholders another chance to voice their 
opinions on the amendments.  The government of the day would do 
well to heed the advice of committee members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that Canada's national parks are in decline comes as no 
surprise.  Successive studies conducted in 1990, 1994, 1997, and 
most recently the report released by the panel on ecological 
integrity of Canada's national parks, have all called for 
immediate action to help protect the ecological integrity of our 
national parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of the Canadian Heritage committee, I take these 
calls for help very seriously.  As I am sure all members of 
parliament know, the Progressive Conservative Party has a long 
history of wanting to protect our fragile ecosystem through the 
creation of national parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our first prime minister, Sir John A. Macdonald, recognized the 
intrinsic beauty of Canada's natural environment.  He also 
recognized, or perhaps he could foresee, the deep-rooted 
affection Canadians would have toward their environment, which is 
why he created Canada's first national park in 1885.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it would be very interesting to witness the reaction of 
our first prime minister if he could come back and see the 
changes that have occurred in the town of Banff since he 
designated those 26 square kilometres around the hot mineral 
springs.  He likely never envisioned the tremendous expansion 
that has occurred in this little area when he was contemplating 
Canada's first national park over 115 years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The town of Banff in particular, but also Lake Louise and 
Jasper, have grown tremendously over the years.  The natural 
beauty of the area has attracted tourists from all over the 
world.  These three areas are primarily responsible for the over 
four million visitors the park welcome every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This national park has provided a tremendous boost over the 
years to Alberta's economy.  The increase in tourism has brought 
about an increase in development within our national parks. 
Hotels, lodges, golf courses and ski trails have all contributed 
to the tremendous growth in the area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we now recognize that this growth has not come without 
a price.  The physical landscape has been affected and the 
wildlife has felt the ill-effects of the countless intrusions by 
humans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we all recognize that something has to be done.  Even 
the local residents who make Banff, Lake Louise and Jasper their 
home would agree that some changes are in order to help protect 
and preserve their environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us face it, local businesses are there to stay.  Therefore, 
it is imperative that we find some kind of workable balance that 
will respond to the needs of the local community while also 
managing to address the need to maintain ecological integrity. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I went to Alberta three times to visit our national parks. After 
discussions with the local people, I am convinced that they want 
to work with the federal government to find a solution that 
would meet their needs. They want to be part of the solution, 
not of the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government will have to work with these people to 
find a solution. Unfortunately, the minister seems more 
interested in imposing her solutions than in negotiating to find 
a reasonable agreement. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the introduction of this proposed legislation, the 
premier of Alberta responded angrily, accusing the federal 
government of failing to consult with them prior to formulating 
the bill.  With such critical decisions required to limit the 
further expansion of commercial interests within our national 
parks, it might have been better or more conducive to achieving 
agreements had the government entertained full public hearings in 
this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been the history of this minister to approach a situation 
in a very confrontational manner.  Rather than working together 
to find a solution to a problem, she is often quick to impose her 
own ill-conceived solutions that in the end satisfy no one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the proposed legislation, a community plan for a park must 
be consistent with the management plan for the park according to 
the guidelines set forth by the minister.  The community is 
effectively being dictated to as to how its community is to be 
run in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister seems to want to assume responsibility for all 
decisions affecting our national parks despite the fact that some 
of these decisions might fall within town jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have often complained that they are being regulated to 
death by government.  When I look at some of the regulations 
contained in clause 16(1) of the bill, I ask myself whether all 
those regulations are really in the best interests of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It says that regulations could be made respecting the protection 
of air quality and cultural, historical and archaeological 
resources.  First, the federal Minister of the Environment failed 
to live up to the Kyoto agreement so please do not blame me for 
being a little skeptical about the Department of Canadian 
Heritage somehow being more successful in protecting our air 
quality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to see the minister wanting to manage and regulate 
the fishery in our national parks.  Let me tell the members that 
she cannot do any worse than her colleague, the fisheries 
minister, who has yet to find a solution to the Atlantic 
fisheries crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for respecting culture, I can see where placing a life size 
photo of Wayne Gretzky and Lucy Maud Montgomery in downtown 
Banff will really improve the cultural or cultural component of 
the town. 
Is it not somewhat ironic when one thinks of it?  One of the 
problems identified in the state of the parks report is the 
overabundance of tourist traffic in our parks, yet we would have 
the minister introduce these life-sized figurines in Banff to 
attract tourists.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many positive elements to be found in this proposed 
piece of legislation.  The legislation, although flawed in a 
number of areas, should provide Parks Canada personnel with a set 
of rules that will provide them with the support they have been 
asking for to ensure the long term protection of Canada's 
national parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am personally encouraged by the government's commitment to 
conservation and protection of wildlife and other park resources. 
It was imperative that any new national parks act contains stiff 
penalties for poaching.  Each year we lose an unacceptable number 
of our wildlife and this must stop if we really are concerned 
with ecological integrity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our wildlife must be protected against offenders if we want to 
ensure that we maintain a representative assortment of wildlife. 
It is important that the fines associated with illegal poaching 
activity be significant enough that they will serve as a strong 
deterrent.  I believe the minister has taken this into 
consideration as demonstrated by the huge fines and the threat of 
a prison term incorporated into the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should identify boundaries for all communities found within 
our national parks.  However these boundaries have to be 
developed in partnership with all stakeholders.  By this, I 
include local environmentalists, Parks Canada officials, the 
federal, provincial and local politicians, as well as existing 
commercial interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have many concerns about this proposed piece of legislation. 
However, I and my party support sending this legislation to 
committee where witnesses from across the country have already 
expressed interest in appearing before the committee to share 
their views on the future of Canada's national parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After listening to the witnesses and studying the many 
interventions I suspect we will receive, we can then draft 
appropriate amendments that will allow us to get on with the task 
at hand of creating new parks across the country while protecting 
the ecological integrity of Canada's existing national parks.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should make 
labelling of genetically modified foods compulsory, and should 
carry out exhaustive studies on the long-term effects of these 
foods on health and the environment. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said: Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise today during this 
first hour of debate on the motion that I proposed, which I will 
repeat so that everyone is aware of what it is about; it reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should make 
labelling of genetically modified foods compulsory, and should 
carry out exhaustive studies on the long-term effects of these 
foods on health and the environment. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we calling for the mandatory labelling of genetically 
modified foods?  Why call for transparency in the process of 
evaluation and acceptance of GMOs?  Why this debate and 
reflection? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer is very simple.  First of all, we have a right to 
know what we are eating.  Every person is entitled to know the 
nature of the foods he is eating.  Second, 70% of the food 
available to Canadians contains GMOs in whole or in part. 
For the past five years, we have had GMOs in our plates and in 
stores. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the truth of the matter is that the public and consumers 
have known about it only for about a year. If they know now it 
is probably thanks to our representations here in the House. 
Previously, the topic was totally ignored. And yet, there are 
already some 42 genetically modified foods on the market. Far 
too many questions remain unanswered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada, genetically modified foods are regulated according to 
their stated characteristics and not the way they are produced. 
In other words, a novel food is accepted or rejected according 
to its substantial equivalence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is substantial equivalence? It is the comparative analysis 
of a biotechnologically derived food and a conventional 
non-modified food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a study entitled “Food Safety of GM Crops in Canada, Toxicity 
and Allergenicity”, Dr. Ann Clark reviews the process used by 
Health Canada to asses the level of toxicity and allergenicity 
of genetically modified crops. Her study shows that the level of 
toxicity was neither tested nor measured in 70% of the 42 
genetically modified crops that were approved in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is more, the allergenicity—and God knows how many allergies 
there are around us—of those 42 genetically modified crops was 
assessed neither through lab tests nor food trials. According to 
Dr. Clark, statements to the effect that these crops are neither 
toxic nor allergenic are based solely on deduction and 
supposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to her, “the absence of evidence is not evidence of 
absence”. In other words, the acceptance of GMOs, under the 
Canadian system, leaves room for doubt. If the risks to health 
seem plausible, what about the risks to the environment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me quote Elizabeth Abergel on this issue: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The applications of genetic engineering to agriculture have 
generated a strong controversy. Many consumers and a fair number 
of scientists view these technologies as risky and even useless. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, this person is a Ph.D. student at York University and she 
already has a master's degree in science. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The scientific community is divided as to the impacts associated 
with the introduction of transgenic plants in the environment. 
For many researchers, the scientific debate boils down to a lack 
of concrete evidence and adequate data to state that GMOs are 
innocuous. For others, the concern is with the methodologies, 
the scientific insertions, the objectivity of the criteria and 
parameters used by companies and governments to measure the 
impact of transgenic plants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The assessment of risks remains a difficult scientific issue. 
However, the marketing of transgenic foods is accelerating, in 
spite of these scientific uncertainties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada, the approval of transgenic products is based on data 
provided exclusively by the companies. The obvious lack of 
transparency of this regulatory system does not allow the 
Canadian public to see the environmental issues related to 
biotechnology. The Canadian system deems as probable the 
management and mastering of the risks generated by GMOs, even 
though these risks can be irreversible. This goes against the 
principle of prudence, which promotes the anticipation of risks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian regulatory framework is based on a scientific and 
legislative basis that ignores the inherent risks of genetic 
engineering. The expression “new form of plants” includes any 
new variety. Genetic engineering is associated with the classic 
methods of genetic selection, thus not generating new 
environmental risks. Only the product is subjected to government 
control, since the production method is not covered by existing 
regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The scientific studies on which the Canadian government relied 
in determining the ecological risk associated with GMOs are 
based on two criteria: familiarity and essential equivalence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These two concepts allow assessment of the environmental risks 
associated with new forms of plants. 
GMOs are treated the same way as the species from which they are 
derived, using the criterion of familiarity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, a GMO considered sufficiently familiar will not undergo 
any environmental risk assessment.  However, one that is not as 
familiar will be put through an assessment to establish its 
degree of essential equivalence compared to its counterpart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the scientific tests to which GMOs are subjected 
in order to meet the essential equivalence requirements are 
short-lived and often rely on criteria having to do with 
agronomical rather than environmental performance. 
It follows that essential equivalence limits the scope of the 
research needed to establish the safety of GMOs, thus 
eradicating scientific knowledge in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, commercialized GMOs are used as a point of reference for the 
approval of new transgenic foods, thus implicitly forcing the 
acceptability of ecological risks already present.

researcher, wrote the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ecological risks of applying genetic engineering to 
agriculture include the possibility that transgenic plants will 
become harmful and affect ecosystems.  Plants manipulated to 
express or tolerate toxic substances such as herbicides can 
poison untargeted organisms.  Other plants manipulated to carry 
viruses or virus fragments can promote the appearance of new 
viruses that will eventually be responsible for new diseases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The introduction of GMOs in the environment may seriously upset 
natural mechanisms regulating both evolution and ecological 
stability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that viruses and transposons can lead to mutations, 
strengthened vectors could be mutagens and be carcinogens for 
humans and animals. 
In addition, the presence of foreign genes in GMOs can promote 
the existence of new metabolisms. 
Thus, certain common foods modified by gene therapy could become 
dangerous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Persons with food allergies could be exposed to 
increased risks, because some common foods would become 
allergens through genetic manipulation.  These are more of the 
truly considerable ethical and cultural challenges raised by the 
new biologies and technobiologies.

<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—that large biotechnology companies may have their biotechnology

them too much power, since anyone who manipulates genes can

</I></B></P><P align=left>According to him, there are other risks: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The use of a new crop of mustard to produce plastic involves 
risks. What would happen to birds and insects during the seeding 
season? In many years from now, the ecosystem could be facing 
serious problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are numerous crops which are being genetically modified so 
that they can resist weeds without the usual use of pesticides 
by farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the problem? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Rifkin adds: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With pesticides you can at least spray and stop there. But with 
new plants, toxins are continuously released and filter into the 
ground. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He adds: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sooner or later, weeds will be able to resist the genes which 
are used to destroy them and we will always be forced to create 
new genes to fight them. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The questions raised are serious, but we still have found no 
answer. The future of agriculture and of the environment and the 
problems relating to health and biodiversity are at the heart 
of the reflection that we, as parliamentarians, have to do on 
the intrusion of GMOs in our lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to read a text written by Patricia Ramacieri, director 
of the seedling program at Heritage Canada, on the importance of 
biodiversity: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we observe our planet, whether from the human, animal or 
vegetable point of view, the common theme is diversity.  It is 
not happenstance, but a mechanism which makes it possible to 
maintain balance, complementarity and abundance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the 
plant world, with the exception of extreme climatic conditions 
such as the Sahara desert or the frigid cold at the poles, 
nature fosters exchanges between multiple agents in order to 
create an ecological and self-sustaining environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the past 50 years, our society has encouraged standards to maximize 
profitability. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The word profit is a constantly recurring one in this theory. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In agriculture, this has led to a more and more headlong rush 
toward optimum yields, through the selection and standardization 
of a few plants: soya, corn, potatoes, tomatoes, which 
constitute the basis of our diet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, monoculture is being practiced to an increasing 
extent and this artificially creates poor ecological and 
environmental conditions that demand more sustained human 
intervention via chemical fertilizers, pesticides, fungicides, 
and all those other “cides”, where an environment of 
biodiversity could meet these needs naturally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, when the limitations of human and chemical intervention 
have been reached, we are seeing a new wave of products that 
have been designed to change the genetic structure of the plant 
itself, which ought to prompt the following questions: Are we 
addressing the true problem?  Do we have the right to change 
nature to suit our needs?  Are we part of nature?  Why not adapt 
to nature? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every day, our planet is losing more and more of its 
biodiversity, whether consciously or through neglect. 
Whichever, the result is the same.  Are we prepared to watch a 
system slip through our fingers which has taken millions of 
years to develop to the stage of a delicate balance, merely 
because we do not value, or do not yet grasp, its wisdom and 
logic? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why, finally, should we put all our eggs in one basket 
with GMOs?

to stimulate thorough discussion and deep reflection. In other

to let people decide what they want to eat.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, 
Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to rise in the House 
today to respond to Motion M-230. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion, from the hon. member for Louis-Hébert has two parts. 
The first would make labelling of genetically modified food 
compulsory.  The motion also calls for the government to carry 
out exhaustive studies on the long-term effects of genetically 
modified foods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me begin by saying that the Government of Canada's 
commitment is always to safety first: safety for the protection 
of Canadians, safety for animals, and the safety of our 
environment. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada quite rightly prides itself on its regulatory systems. We 
know that Canadians, whether they are consumers, producers, 
distributors or health professionals, rely on and value these 
safety systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of labelling, Canadian federal legislation calls for 
Health Canada to set the requirements for mandatory labelling. 
Health Canada sets the data requirements for the safety 
assessments of all foods and undertakes comprehensive pre-market 
reviews of new foods, including those derived through 
biotechnology.  Every new food goes through a rigorous and 
thorough review process before being allowed on the market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Food Inspection Agency, the CFIA, carries out 
inspection and enforcement activities relative to the food safety 
standards set by Health Canada.  The CFIA also has responsibility 
for the environmental safety assessment of a number of 
agricultural products derived through biotechnology, including 
plants and animal feeds. Based on its safety evaluations of 
foods, Health Canada determines if and when labelling is 
required. As I am sure the hon. member would agree, any authority 
for labelling must be based upon science. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to emphasize that current labelling regulations in 
Canada require that all foods, including those developed through 
biotechnology, be labelled where a potential human health or 
safety issue has been identified, for example, for people with 
food allergies or if foods have been changed in composition or 
nutrition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me address the first part of the motion before us by 
reminding the House that there are already several initiatives in 
place to study the question of how and when to label a 
genetically modified food.  Canadians expect their views to be 
heard and the government is doing just that by listening to 
Canadians on how they want their foods to be labelled.  The 
government is committed to exploring how labelling can best serve 
the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government believes that all labelling must be credible, 
meaningful and enforceable.  For this reason the Government of 
Canada has strongly encouraged the establishment of a Canadian 
standard for the labelling of foods derived through 
biotechnology.  The Canadian General Standards Board under the 
sponsorship of the Canadian Council of Grocery Distributors is in 
the process of developing this standard through an open and 
inclusive process.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A committee composed of representatives and individuals from a 
broad range of Canadian interests has been established.  This 
committee has developed working groups to look at areas such as 
definitions, labels, claims in advertising, and compliance 
measures.  A completed standard is expected within the next six 
to 12 months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government continues to listen to all Canadians.  Canada is 
the first country in the world to actively engage such a broad 
range of stakeholders on this issue.  Canada is fully immersed in 
developing its own national standard in full consultation with 
stakeholders and in a way that is open and transparent to all 
Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues should be aware that by endorsing such a thorough 
process to develop a labelling standard, Canada is indeed a 
leader worldwide.  We can see that the Canadian public is 
already strongly engaged on the issue of genetically modified 
foods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to note that the Standing Committee on 
Agriculture and Agri-Food raised this issue of labelling in 1998 
when it tabled its report “Capturing the Advantage: Agricultural 
Biotechnology in the New Millennium”. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On May 18 the standing committee will begin a series of hearings 
on the labelling of genetically modified foods.  I would like to 
point out that in Tuesday's debate on this very same issue my 
colleagues from the Canadian Alliance called for a joint study by 
the health and agriculture committees on the issue of labelling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, Canada is playing a strong role on the international 
stage to promote standards for labelling these foods.  For 
example, Canada chairs the Codex Alimentarius committee on food 
labelling.  We are also heading a subcommittee of this 
organization which has worked to draft recommendations for the 
labelling of biotechnologically derived foods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Around the world Canada is regarded as a leader on this issue. 
In short, there are processes currently under way to address the 
information needs of Canadians on the issue of labelling.  These 
processes must be given an opportunity to provide the 
recommendations before we hastily embark on another course of 
action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government recognizes that consumers want choice.  We 
believe, and I am sure hon. members would agree, that Canadians 
want informed choice and labels which are meaningful. It is the 
government's goal to ensure that the information provided to 
Canadians enables them to make informed choices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House should vote down Motion No. 230 on the basis of the 
first part of the motion.  Let me now turn to the second part, 
which urges the government to carry out exhaustive studies on the 
long term effects of genetically modified foods on health and the 
environment. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to emphasize again that food safety and consumer 
protection are priorities for the Government of Canada.  We are 
strongly committed to the safety of Canadians, animals and our 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has certainly built a strong reputation as a producer of 
foods that are consistently safe, clean and of high quality.  We 
built that reputation by putting very rigorous regulatory 
systems in place. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our approval systems are science based and transparent.  Our 
government's decision to accept or reject a product is based on 
sound science and proven facts.  Our regulators include experts 
in nutrition, molecular biology, chemistry, toxicology, and 
environmental science to name just a few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These regulators use the best available science from Canadian 
and international experts to determine whether these products 
pose any hazard to people, plants, animals or the environment. If 
there is any question as to their safety, we do not approve them 
for use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even after a product has been approved, its case is never 
closed.  New scientific evidence is always taken into account and 
appropriate action taken immediately if any problems are 
detected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The regulatory system assesses products on a case by case basis. 
The research on safety required for evaluation directly addresses 
the potential risks of the product to human health and the 
environment.  The Government of Canada takes pride in advocating 
this science based approach around the world.

issues.  With that in mind, I believe the House will applaud the 
efforts the Government of Canada has undertaken to maintain and 
even enhance the safety of genetically modified foods. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is committed to a regulatory system that is based on 
sound science—a regulatory system that meets the highest 
scientific rigour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why, for example, the Minister of Health, the Minister 
of Agriculture and Agri-Food and the Minister of the Environment 
asked the Royal Society of Canada to appoint an expert panel on 
the future of food biotechnology.  The Royal Society named its 
expert panel last February.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This proactive forward looking body will look ahead over the 
next 10 years to forecast the types of food products that are

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada's commitment to open an inclusive 
dialogue with Canadians has also resulted in the formation of the 
Canadian Biotechnology Advisory Committee, CBAC.  The committee 
will bring stakeholders and interested parties together to advise 
the government, raise public awareness and engage Canadians in an 
open and transparent dialogue on biotechnology matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the House will support the government's initiatives to 
make sure the regulatory system can effectively assess the health 
and environmental safety of genetically modified foods. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>]

<P><A NAME="LINK206"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak to Motion No. 230. 
The motion calls for the compulsory labelling of genetically 
modified foods and for exhaustive studies on the long term 
effects of these foods.  This is a topical debate and one which I 
think should take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to split this debate into three components. I will 
talk about science as it has been in the past, as it is in the 
present, and then I will talk about solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Traditionally we had used genetic modification to improve foods, 
crops and animals.  This was a natural process of slow selection 
which had few surprises.  With a plant or an animal that had good 
characteristics we would try and bring the characteristics 
through the genetic tree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an example, I think of new varieties of garden corn which 
have a short growing time and which can grow in a cool climate. 
There are early ripening varieties. 
I cannot imagine anyone being concerned or feeling negative about 
that process. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1345"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT45"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT45"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1345

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, even with this gradual process of improvement, we have 
occasionally had problems.  I would like to mention a plant that 
was brought to North America in the early 1900s called kudzu. 
This plant came from China.  It is a very powerful vine-type 
plant and there are no natural insects that prey upon it.  It has 
no natural enemies.  This plant has now taken over seven million 
acres of land in Texas and Louisiana.  We have what some would 
call a fairly natural process of planting a foreign plant in 
North America and having it grow quite wild.  There were concerns 
and problems even with the old mechanism of the natural, slow 
process of improving crops and animals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I could move toward science today, we now have the capability 
at the microscopic level of manipulating the genetic tree.  We 
have an intervention in fact, at the molecular level, going on. 
We are even capable of taking DNA from one species and linking it 
with the DNA of another species.  The difference between science 
today and science in days of yore is that these changes now can 
be quite rapid.  There are some scientific concerns on this issue 
and some scientific debate.  That is why I say that this debate 
is timely and worthwhile. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are some potential benefits of this new form of genetic 
manipulation?  I will not be exhaustive, because time is 
relatively short, but we could have seeds and crops that would 
not require pesticides or herbicides.  Most people concerned 
about the environment would say that is positive.  We could have 
new medicinal properties brought more quickly to the market from 
these processes.  We could also see land that is less fertile 
bearing crops and being productive.  Those are just some of the 
potential benefits.  As I said, this is not exhaustive at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do individuals see as potential hazards in this area? 
There are potential hazards if we had unsuspected effects on the 
human organism, on ourselves, from eating or being around such 
genetically modified foods.  We could have wild strains, much 
like the kudzu plant I mentioned, overwhelming some of our 
natural strains, having unsuspected effects on domestic plants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give an example from the medical field of changes that 
are going on in our environment, in our society, which might be 
related to these sorts of things.  If we look at population 
dynamics we see that young adolescents are going through changes 
earlier than they did some years back, specifically young 
adolescent females having the onset of periods earlier than they 
did some 30 years ago.  There is some medical information that 
this may be related to estrogen-like compounds that are 
circulating in our environment.  Here we have estrogen-like 
compounds that could come from genetically modified organisms, 
possibly changing the whole hormonal balance in a large 
population set, those of young adolescent women.  This is not a 
theory.  This is not a guess.  This is actually physically 
happening now and we have to figure out how and why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this scientific debate there is some legitimate argument on 
both sides and we should be open to those discussions and 
arguments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to the solution from my perspective, I believe that the 
consumer who has a concern about genetically modified foods 
should have that information available.  I believe that people 
who do not want to take genetically modified food into their 
bodies—a crop, a cereal or a product—should have that choice.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is technically very difficult to label all genetically 
modified foods.  For instance, pasta has constituents that come 
from various sources and a genetically modified component would 
be difficult to isolate.  It could be done, but it would be 
difficult.  I feel it would be better to modify genetically 
modified free food, rather than all those that have genetically 
modified components in them.  In my mind, this would give those 
who want to make the choice the ability to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would actually propose a mechanism to label those genetically 
modified free foods.  It would be a graphic label.  The one I 
have chosen is a microscope with an <I>x</I> across it, which 
would show all consumers that there is no genetically modified 
food in that product.  It would be a little similar to the 
marketing mechanism used for organic grains.  Those who do not 
want to have pesticides or herbicides in their growing process 
could choose that strain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, I would suggest that this be voluntary.  This is where I 
digress from my colleague a little.  The mandatory component is 
something that smacks of bureaucracy and of people telling us 
what to do.  I favour small where small will do when it comes to 
bureaucracy.  I would much prefer a voluntary process driven by 
the market.  As an individual, I could then choose genetically 
modified free foods.  That is the process I would use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of science is where I think we should try not to be 
political.  Good science is science that can stand close, careful 
scrutiny.  We should try not to have a big political debate on 
this.  I have listened to some organizations politicizing this. 
They seem to ignore good science on the one side and only pay 
attention to the science on the other side.  That does not make 
any sense to me at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principle that I would use on this issue is the principle of 
letting the consumer know.  Let the consumer be aware and let the 
consumer choose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of the long term studies that my colleague has 
suggested makes eminent sense.  We saw a big debate on 
recombinant bovine somatotropin, the substance used for 
augmenting milk in cattle.  rBST is being used in the U.S.  It is 
not being used directly in Canada.  What a perfect opportunity to 
look at the two populations.  Scientists are, in fact, able to do 
that.  I hope that those people in the U.S. who are using rBST 
would not be guinea pigs in this issue, but they are certainly a 
good case study for a long term debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My congratulations to my colleague for bringing this debate.  I 
hope the House will consider it carefully.  I appreciate the 
opportunity to speak on this subject. 
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
also want to begin by indicating my appreciation to the hon. 
member for Louis-Hébert for bringing this important issue 
forward.  It is certainly a topic that has been in the forefront 
of the minds of many Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many young people I know are dealing with the issue of what they 
call franken foods.  This is an issue that has the general public 
so concerned that they are calling my office and other members' 
offices.  They are looking to government for some direction in 
this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have clearly indicated in every poll, survey and study 
that they want to know what they are eating.  I would take that 
one step further.  They have a right to know what they are 
eating.  It is a basic, fundamental, health issue right.  They 
have made that abundantly clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would put it to the hon. member from the Canadian Alliance 
that voluntary compliance is not working.  He actually 
contradicted himself in the arguments we just heard.  He said 
that Canadians have a right to know and then they can make their 
own informed choice.  How would they know without adequate 
labelling on the package?  He is denying them their right to 
choose by not clearly stating what kind of product they are 
eating.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole premise of the argument I will be making is that 
Canadians are justifiably concerned about the quality of the food 
they eat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the government has abdicated its responsibilities in 
this matter by trying to promote voluntary compliance and by not 
clearly stating what government agency will have jurisdiction 
over this important matter.  At the present time we have a 
hodgepodge.  It is an absolute mess.  The government is readily 
conceding that Canadians have a right to know and that they need 
to know, but there are three different government agencies that 
have been partially responsible for telling Canadians what they 
need to know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Food Inspection Agency is involved.  It deals with 
the policing of plants and slaughterhouses, the storage of unsafe 
items and so on.  Health Canada has a role, but we are not sure 
where one jurisdiction starts and the other stops.  Health Canada 
approves products with respect to quality and safety. Agriculture 
and Agri-Food Canada assists in food production. Which 
jurisdiction is it?  If we could establish that first we could 
then move the issue forward by demanding that the federal agency 
do its job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from an area with a large agri-food industry.  In 
Manitoba agriculture is key and paramount to the health of our 
economy.  I hear stories from Manitoba farmers about their 
concern over genetically engineered and genetically modified seed 
crops and oilseed crops.  The hon. member mentioned canola oil as 
an example.  I have some personal knowledge of how concerned 
Manitoba farmers are about the genetic engineering of canola. 
One company had a monopoly on the seed stock.  If farmers wanted 
to buy seed they went to go to a certain company, but they also 
had to sign a contract with that company indicating that they 
would sell all of their yield to that company.  Farmers could not 
have the seed unless they promised to sell their yield to the 
company. The real stinger was that the seed had been genetically 
modified to have a terminator gene in it so it could not 
reproduce itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since time began farmers have set aside a certain amount of 
their crop for re-seeding in future years.  Farmers cannot do that 
any more.  They have to go back to the source company, a chemical 
company, and buy their seed for the following year, which turns 
out to have a genetic terminator.  Perverse is the word for it. 
Most Canadians are horrified when they discover how people are 
manipulating our food supplies through genetic engineering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the very least, the government owes it to Canadians to let 
them know whether the food they are eating is genetically 
modified.  Never mind if it is safe or not safe.  The jury is 
still out on that issue.  We do not know.  But let us not use the 
absence of absolute, hard scientific evidence as an excuse for 
not taking the precautionary measures Canadians are asking for. 
Canadians should be given the right to choose.  They should be 
able to look at the labelling on a package and decide for 
themselves whether they want to ingest the material. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been mistakes.  There have been recent examples which 
gave consumers cause for alarm.  Recently a gene from a Brazil 
nut was introduced to a foodstuff.  This resulted in people 
suffering a severe nut allergy, even though they were eating a 
product that had nothing to do with nuts.  People suffered severe 
anaphylactic asthmatic reactions from a product that had nothing 
to do with nuts.  People had no way of knowing because in Canada 
there is no obligation to tell. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rest of the world seems to be further advanced than Canada. 
That is ironic, as Canada is one of the leaders in agri-food and 
agri-business.  Europeans do not want genetically modified food 
on their shelves.  They demand to know if the food they are 
eating is genetically modified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United Nations biosafety protocol was negotiated in Montreal 
during the last week of January.  Several large and well known 
companies began taking their first steps away from genetically 
modified crops. 
They started to make noise in the right direction, but not on any 
moral or ethical ground or even out of fear for public safety.  I 
think what they were really afraid of was a consumer backlash. 
They know that consumers are becoming better informed about this 
issue and are demanding to know if a product is genetically 
modified, because if it is, they do not want it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do have large companies like Frito Lay, the big potato chip 
manufacturing company, which told its suppliers not to send any 
more genetically modified corn for their corn chips, but it 
stopped short of telling them not to send any genetically 
modified potatoes for its potato chips.  It produces about a 
thousand times as many potato chips as it does corn chips. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, the voluntary compliance side of things is starting 
to catch on but in a very marginal way not in a meaningful way. I 
do not believe in voluntary compliance measures in anything, 
frankly, whether it is workplace safety, health or whatever, 
because when the bottom line is profits to shareholders, 
corporations have a vested interest in doing whatever is 
expedient from a profit point of view and not doing what is right 
from a moral, ethical or even public health point of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seagrams, another major company, told its suppliers not to bring 
it any more genetically modified corn but it fell short of making 
a public announcement.  It did not want to rock the boat. It will 
not publicly say that its products are made without genetically 
modified corn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Loblaws has quietly made plans to stock its first genetically 
modified free products in some stores.  It will have separate 
shelves.  It will have genetically modified food on one shelf and 
it will have genetically modified free food on another shelf. 
Obviously it has sensed the concern in the general public. 
Loblaws of Canada is not stupid.  It has sensed that consumer 
awareness is growing to the point where many Canadians will 
demand pure food instead of frankenfood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who knows if our corn flakes might contain a gene from some 
mutant fish?  We just do not know the kinds of things that are 
being done.  The classic example is when some people got Brazil 
nut genes in food and ended up having nut allergies.  It is a 
terrible problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Borden Foods, which makes Catelli pastas and sauces, has issued 
a statement saying that its products are genetically modified 
free.  However, it has had to do that on its own as an individual 
initiative.  There is no obligation and no duty to do so. 
Personally, I will look for Catelli products when I go shopping 
because I appreciate what Borden Foods has done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have told hon. members about the impact that the whole genetic 
engineering industry is having on the farm community where I come 
from with the terminator gene.  I think there is a healthy 
distrust for the people who are engineering and genetically 
altering our foods.  It is an area of science that is new to most 
Canadians.  There is not a level of comfort yet for most 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even in the absence of absolute, hard, scientific fact that says 
genetically modified foods are bad for us—and I am the first to 
admit that we do not have that hard, scientific evidence—at 
least the government should be taking steps to err on the side of 
caution and err on the side of the well-being of Canadian people 
and not on the profit motives of the food producers in the 
agri-food business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let Canadians choose.  Let them know what it is they are 
actually eating.  Make labelling mandatory.  Yes, it is a burden 
and maybe even a cost factor for the producers.  They probably 
will not like it.  However, I would urge the government to show 
leadership and to show that it cares for the consuming public by 
mandating the labelling of foods so that we can make an informed 
choice. 
<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, what an interesting debate.  As I said the other day, 
there are many different points of view.  If any of us speak long 
enough we will probably disagree with ourselves at the end of the 
day because it is a very complex topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin by basically paraphrasing a former prime minister 
with regard to a position on an issue.  It might be ours and it 
could be about any party's position in the House of Commons: 
mandatory controls if necessary, but not necessarily mandatory 
controls, because we do not like to see that type of rigid 
enforcement.

</I></B></P><P align=left>With the demise of one of the big players in the field, 
Monsanto, there has been a slowdown in recent months in terms of 
genetically modified foods.  Monsanto's market share has 
plummeted as compared to where it was in the marketplace over a 
year ago.  One of the reasons for that is the so-called 
frankenfoods, to quote that term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to speak specifically to that.  The hon. member from 
Winnipeg mentioned the controversy surrounding the Brazil nut. He 
spoke about the crossing of genes from the Brazil nut with that 
of a soybean.  As members well know, the soybean is a major 
source of nutrition for many parts of the world and they had 
invented a product that would take on many of the characteristics 
of the soybean or the Brazil nut in terms of the strength and 
durability of the seed or the plant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, by crossing these genes they unknowingly brought in the 
same characteristics and allergic reactions from the Brazil nut. 
It was science doing one thing for a net gain to the public but 
inadvertently creating another problem, which was the allergic 
reaction to a new product that no one imagined would happen.  The 
good news is that it was, thankfully, pulled from the market 
shelves by the agricultural community before it actually reached 
the marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Michael Lipton, an economist at the University of Sussex in 
England, does research on poverty and the demographics of food 
distribution in the Third World.  He said that when electricity 
was first invented if the first two products of electricity was 
the electric chair and the electric animal probe where would we 
be today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that is one of the problems that this science has 
experienced in regard to genetically modified foods.  There have 
been some horror stories coming out and, suddenly, because they 
are the first products, there is some fear-mongering, and rightly 
so, and some uncertainty on the part of the consumer which is 
showing up in the marketplace, hence, I guess, the demise of 
companies like Monsanto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not to say that they are going to die a natural death. 
They will always be around because of some of the positive 
benefits of the alteration of species, plant breeding and so on, 
but what they have done in some of these cases is just taken it a 
step too far and that has cost them.  It has cost them a lot of 
confidence in the marketplace which, at the end of the day, will 
determine whether some of these products survive or not.  As 
consumers, we will determine that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Animal genes are being crossed with food products, or plant 
genes, to create a product that will withstand, for example, cold 
temperatures.  One of the recent discoveries was the taking of 
genes from a fish that lives in the North Atlantic, some of the 
coldest waters in the world, and crossing it with a strawberry. 
They are taking an animal gene and putting it into a food product 
with great success.  One of the biggest enemies of the strawberry 
plant is cold and frost, Madam Speaker, which you well know 
coming from the province of Quebec where there is a huge 
strawberry industry.  They have been very successful in doing 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens is that this conjures up all the fears we have as 
consumers.  I only have to mention mad cow disease.  What was 
being done there was that they were feeding cattle their own 
entrails, after going through a heat process.  They were feeding 
their own meat to their own species which in turn created a 
problem within the cow.  There is some evidence now that mad cow 
disease has jumped the species barrier.  I have asked the 
Minister of Health what the department was doing and how it was 
monitoring that.  We have evidence that the disease has entered 
the food chain and human beings are now being associated with 
that disease.  It seems to have gone from animals to people. 
That is the result of science gone crazy or the application of 
science not benefiting mankind as we would like it to do.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example of that is atomic energy.  Look at the gains we 
have made in this world when we cracked the atom.  Some of them 
are very positive and some of them are very disastrous.  The 
result is that atomic energy can produce a very clean power but 
because of mistakes made in the past, the atomic energy business 
is almost at a standstill.  It is almost dying on the vine, yet 
it is something that should be growing.  Scientists got off the 
track and the monitoring and procedures that would be used to 
keep people in check have not been there and we have seen a 
demise in that industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same is occurring in the genetically modified food industry. 
There are so many examples of where science can do good.  One of 
them is in a new product called golden rice.  A couple of 
scientists, one is from Germany and I believe the other is from 
Austria, have developed a gene which they placed into a rice 
plant.  It allows the rice plant to generate vitamin A, a missing 
ingredient in the diets of about two billion people on the face 
of the earth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year over 200 million people died because of malnutrition, 
because they simply did not have vitamin A in their diets.  We 
are talking about those societies that depend on rice crops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They put in beta carotene, or vitamin A; there is a connection 
between the two.  They call it golden rice because of the beta 
carotene which is what is in a carrot.  They have put it into the 
white rice crop with huge benefits.  None of us disagree with the 
benefit side of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to know where it will lead and where it will stop.  Is 
government going to put a check on these advancements and how 
rapid will these be? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other day I mentioned what they call the terminator seed. It 
comes from the famous movie, the <I>Terminator</I>. Think about 
it.  A company like Monsanto, with the power that exceeds the 
power of some governments, came up with a terminator seed. For 
example if we are talking about a wheat crop, the wheat would 
grow but the seeds that the crop would produce could no longer be 
used.  They could no longer reproduce because the seed had been 
genetically modified so only that company could sell the seed. It 
is a monopoly on seed and food production. That is what scares a 
lot of us in the House.  It is called the terminator seed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine the repercussions in the third world.  Countries would 
be forced to buy seed.  They could not save their own seed for 
the next year for planting and eventually harvesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are examples of science going too far.  None of us will 
deny the benefits of the science, but we want to see a check on 
it.  We hope that mandatory restrictions will not be needed and 
that voluntary compliance will work.  If it does not, we are 
suggesting that government at that point does have to step in.
