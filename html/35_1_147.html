	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, I wish to comment on the 
matter brought to the attention of the House by the hon. member 
for Kingston and the Islands on December 7 and 8, 1994.
<P>
	The hon. member explained that a serious omission had been 
found in a publication entitled ``The Prime Ministers of Canada, 
1867 to 1994'', a document prepared jointly by the House of 
Commons and the National Archives. Subsequently, other errors 
and inconsistencies were discovered and communicated to me.
<P>
	The hon. member for Kingston and the Islands was justifiably 
upset by the omission of references to Kingston and the entry for 
Sir John A. Macdonald and was absolutely correct when he 
pointed out that all Canadians associate our first Prime Minister 
with the limestone city, and in case some of you did not know 
that is Kingston.
<P>
	All members and their constituents recognize the importance 
a member's riding and its history play in a member's political 
identification. Some of the errors and omissions in this 
publication concerning members' constituencies may be the 
result of editorial decisions designed to simplify the rather 
complex evolution of our political and electoral systems.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	For example, at times in our history, certain constituencies 
have returned two members of Parliament in an election, or a 
member appointed to the ministry would have to resign his seat 
and seek re-election as a minister. Members were permitted to 
be candidates in, and be elected in more than one riding at a 
time, although these members ultimately would have to choose 
which riding to represent.
<P>
	Regrettably, other difficulties with this publication seem to 
have been the result of an apparent misunderstanding between 
the House and the National Archives when the publication was 
edited.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	An erratum has been prepared for the first edition and will be 
attached to all remaining copies of the book. A revised second 
edition is currently under production by the National Archives 
and members will receive their copies when it is available.
<P>
	I believe that these measures will rectify the situation and I 
thank the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands for bringing 
this matter to the attention of the House.

	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have the honour of rising in the House today to 
table the government response to the report of the special joint 
committee reviewing Canadian foreign policy.
<P>
	My duty as foreign affairs minister has given me many 
opportunities to observe the role that our country plays in the 
world. It has been said in some quarters that our privileged 
position on the world stage would be called into question by the 
end of the cold war.
<P>
	On the contrary, I am proud to note that our country continues 
to play an important role and that the international community's 
expectations of us have not diminished. Canada occupies a 
position of leadership among the open advanced countries 
which are becoming increasingly influential as world power is 
dispersing and becoming more defined in economic terms.
<P>
	Canada' geographic location gives it an important advantage 
as new poles of political and economic powers emerge in the 
Pacific and Latin America. Canada's cultural heritage gives it 
privileged access to the anglophone and francophone worlds as 
well as to the homelands of Canadians drawn from every part of 
the globe who make up its multicultural personality.
<P>
	Canada can further its global interests better than any other 
country through its active membership in key international 
groupings, for example hosting the G-7 summit this year and the 
Asia-Pacific economic co-operation forum summit in 1997.
<P>
	Canada's history as a non-colonizing power, champion of 
constructive multilateralism and effective international 
mediator underpins an important and distinctive role among 
nations as they seek to build a new and better order.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Canada, thus, is in a privileged position to influence change 
and to benefit from opportunities as we move toward the end of 
the 20th century. The government will exercise that influence 
responsibly to protect and promote Canada's values and 
interests in the world.
<P>
	The committee faced an enormous task, and I congratulate all 
of its members, in particular the two co-chairmen, Senator 
MacEachen and Senator Gauthier, who was then a member of 
this House and co-chair of this committee.
<P>
	I think that the government's response had to reflect the depth 
and quality of the work done by all committee members from 
both sides of the House.
<P>
	The government has kept the promise contained in the red 
book. It has made the development of Canadian foreign policy a 
democratic process by seeking the participation of Canadians 
and their members of Parliament. Both the joint committee and 
the government recognize that changes on the international 
scene will speed up rather than slow down. Unfortunately, the 
financial constraints that we face are not likely to go away in a 
hurry.
<P>
	A responsible government must thus constantly re-evaluate 
its strategies openly and clearly, to reflect the interests and 
concerns of Canadian men and women more effectively.
<P>
<B>(1010) </B>
<P>
	Canadians are increasingly aware that their actions, both 
individual and collective, have international consequences. The 
once-clear distinction between national and international 
affairs is quickly becoming blurred, forcing us to take a broader 
view of things. The number of stakeholders in foreign policy 
continues to grow.
<P>
	In short, international relations are no longer the concern of 
governments alone, but of all Canadian men and women who 
work in non-governmental organizations and play a very 
important role in representing one aspect of our foreign policy.
<P>
	The government is committed to continuing consultation and 
to giving members of Parliament and NGO officials a vital role 
in developing our foreign policy. Thus, in March 1994, the 
government invited Canadians from various walks of life to take 
part in the first national forum on Canada's international 
relations.
<P>
	I wish to confirm today that we intend to make this forum an 
annual event. Since our term of office began, we have held five 
parliamentary debates on key foreign policy issues. I can assure 
you that Canadian foreign policy will no longer be developed 
behind closed doors; all Canadians and especially all members 
of Parliament will be involved.
<P>
	With my colleagues, the two Secretaries of State and the 
Minister for International Trade, I held a series of consultations 
and round tables across Canada. I can tell you that we will 
continue these consultations throughout our term of office.
<P>
	Based on these consultations and the report of the joint 
committee, and recognizing the need for a flexible and effective 
foreign policy, the government has identified three key 
objectives that will guide its activities on the international scene 
in the years to come.
<P>
	These objectives are: first, to promote jobs and prosperity; 
second, to promote our security in a stable international 
framework; and third, to share our values and our culture. These 
objectives complement one another and reflect the 
government's national priorities.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9239"> 9239 </A></B>
<P>
	With regard to our first objective, I would like to begin by 
saying that the government is committed to implementing a 
foreign policy that promotes access of Canadian goods and 
services to foreign markets. The objective could not be clearer: 
to defend and increase Canada's prosperity, and to promote jobs 
and growth by diversifying our economic and trade relations.
<P>
	The Government recognizes the growing importance of the 
major international financial institutions and firmly intends to 
discuss this with its foreign parthers during the G-7 Summit in 
Halifax in June. I shall leave the task of providing a more 
detailed explanation of our objectives in this area to my 
colleague, the Minister for International Trade.
<P>
	I shall now discuss the second objective, an equally important 
aspect or our foreign policy: promoting our security in a stable 
international framework. The hostile environment of the Cold 
War kept us from concentrating our efforts on combatting other 
threats no less real.
<P>
	While the geopolitical upheavals of recent years have greatly 
reduced the immediate threats to our security, we must now, 
paradoxically, expand our definition of this concept.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	Today, security is no longer defined in terms of ideologies or 
boundaries. Environmental deterioration, massive, 
uncontrolled migrations, international crime, drug trafficking, 
AIDS, overpopulation and underdevelopment are the names of 
today's threats. Our security requires a deeper awareness of 
these new threats. The threat of war and armed conflicts may 
have diminished, but the modern world is just as threatened by 
the new problems that face people in every part of the world.
<P>
	It is therefore essential that we, Canadians, in seeking to 
protect ourselves, do our best to help resolve these problems, in 
the interest not only of the security of those who are facing them, 
but also of our own. I think that we can say, and everybody will 
agree, that Canadians are proud of their country's unique 
contribution to UN peacekeeping operation. Canada will 
continue to participate in these missions.
<P>
	But our decisions will be subject to specific criteria, as the 
committee recommended. As the UN and the regional security 
organizations have served us well, Canada will continue to serve 
them well. But to serve well also means identifying the 
structural problems, weaknesses and shortcomings of these 
organisations, and working relentlessly toward correcting them.
<P>
	As I announced last September, Canada is working diligently 
toward improving the efficiency of the United Nations. With 
this in mind, we are preparing, among other things, a study on 
the rapid reaction capability of the UN, which we will table in 
September at the next General Assembly in New York.
<P>
	The third objective of our foreign policy is to promote our 
values and our culture abroad. A country that isolates itself and 
fails to project its identity and values beyond its boundaries is 
doomed to anonymity and loss of influence. Our writers, artists, 
academics and researchers are the best ambassadors of our 
identity in all its diversity. They convey the creativity and 
knowledge essential to the prosperity, development and health 
of our country.
<P>
	I can assure you that the restructuring and staff redeployment 
within the department will emphasize this third major aspect of 
our foreign policy. Like our entrepreneurs, those involved in the 
cultural and educational sectors have a product to sell. Like our 
exporters, they have a market to conquer. And like our business 
people, they are known for the excellence of their product. For 
them too, internationalization is essential to success and 
competitiveness.
<P>
	The influence of the cultural and educational sectors on our 
economy is profound, as we can see. These sectors hold a good 
deal of potential for Canada, a potential that we must use wisely. 
The Government is committed to defending the competitiveness 
of our cultural industries and of the educational products and 
services of our universities and colleges, and to helping our 
artists penetrate foreign markets. To say that we have limited 
resources is no excuse for abdicating our responsibilities.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	On the contrary, it is an opportunity to consolidate our efforts 
and work with the departments and agencies concerned, and also 
with the provinces, to promote our culture and knowledge 
abroad.
<P>
	Vitality in our cultural, academic and scientific interchange is 
essential to our success in the new knowledge based world 
economy. It is also essential to our growth, prosperity and 
success nationally.
<P>
	In order to remain competitive, our institutions of higher 
learning, our students, our future workers need to adapt to a 
profoundly and constantly changing international labour 
market, to expose themselves to the new technologies, and to 
master new knowledge.
<P>
	Canadians know that our problems are insignificant compared 
to the intolerable situation in which too many of the world's 
people still live. Official development aid is another important 
and integral part of our foreign policy, for it strikes at the very 
roots of conflict and of threats to security. Aid reflects the 
values of Canadians, values of compassion, co-operation and 
generosity.
<P>
	In the statement we are tabling today, the government firmly 
intends to clarify the mandate of the Canadian International 
Development Agency, in order to give it a solid objective and 
clear priorities that will dictate the action it takes.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9240"> 9240 </A></B>
<P>
	These priorities are six in number: first, to address basic 
human needs; second, to support the participation of women in 
sustainable economic development; third, to develop in these 
countries the infrastructure services essential to a sound 
economic upswing; fourth, to defend human rights; fifth, to 
encourage the private sector in these countries, which need to 
prosper and take their place on the leading edge of the global 
evolution; and finally, a responsibility from which no one is 
exempt and which is fundamental to our collective future, and 
that is to protect our environment.
<P>
	It is clear that these objectives support the three main 
principles of foreign policy that I have just announced: first, the 
promotion of prosperity; second, the promotion of security; and 
finally, the promotion of our values and our culture.
<P>
	The government will encourage and help Canadians to 
participate and to continue to participate in co-operative 
development and will take measures to improve the 
effectiveness of the official development aid program.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In closing let me say that our country's foreign policy is a 
source of pride for all Canadians. Our foreign policy aims to 
bring people together to dialogue, to build bridges and to form 
ties. We must involve the people of Canada, including obviously 
their members of Parliament, non-governmental organizations, 
universities, provinces, cultural groups and those who are 
involved in the development of what we believe should be a 
good, proud, effective foreign policy.
<P>
<B>(1025 ) </B>
<P>
	Indeed we ought to meet expectations because it is quite clear 
as we travel throughout the world that other people expect a lot 
from Canada. They count on us to be a partner, to be friends and 
allies in their efforts to strive in a new world of peace and 
security and prosperity for their populations.
<P>
	The policy I am presenting today takes this into account. It is 
innovative in its openness to input from Canadians and from 
Parliament and it depends on continued support from Canadians 
to make it an effective foreign policy. It is innovative in its 
objectives which are more sharply focused than ever before.
<P>
	Economic and trade factors have a primary place in it. Risks 
to security are looked at in a broad perspective, something that 
has never been done before. It has been more or less focused 
exclusively on military dimensions. For the first time we now 
have something much wider and which takes into account the 
reality of today in dealings and in trying to strive for a security 
policy that corresponds to our objectives and needs, but it is very 
much in line with the tremendous changes which have occurred 
in the world in recent years.
<P>
	Finally, it also clearly sets out the particular importance given 
to the promotion of Canadian culture and values and the 
importance of working hard with others to ensure that the 
freedoms, the democratic system, the respect for human rights, 
and the promotion of individuals as we know in Canada will 
continue to make progress in many parts of the world where 
Canadians are asked to participate and influence the decision 
making process. Certainly that third dimension which deals with 
our values will be one on which we will work as hard as we are 
working on the two other dimensions of our foreign policy.
<P>
	I conclude by thanking all the members of the joint committee 
for their excellent work, with the hope that the already 
well-established dialogue among governments, the people of 
Canada and Parliament will continue to bear fruit.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to discuss the policy statement tabled in this House 
by the government. The numerous upheavals which occurred on 
the international scene over the last few years have made it more 
urgent than ever for Canada to review its position and to define 
what its new role should be.
<P>
	This morning, the government finally released the new 
objectives of Canada's foreign policy. Bloc Quebecois members 
played an active role in the work of the special joint committee 
reviewing Canadian foreign policy. Canada's participation in 
UN peacekeeping missions, its development assistance, as well 
as its efforts to promote human and democratic rights explain to 
a large extent our country's international reputation.
<P>
	Bloc Quebecois members hope that this will continue to be the 
case, and it is with that in mind that they took part in the work of 
the committee.
<P>
	However, I wish to remind the minister that the Bloc 
Quebecois felt it had to express a dissenting opinion regarding 
certain recommendations contained in the majority report. 
Indeed, we felt that these recommendations were not likely to 
promote major changes in Canadian foreign policy. 
Consequently, we made recommendations to the government, 
based on what we feel is a more adequate reflection of the notion 
which Quebecers, among others, have of the world surrounding 
them.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	We sought to propose to the government another foreign 
policy which would reflect our abilities, serve our real interests, 
and which would be based on our experience. It is obvious, when 
you look at the policy statement released today, that the 
government missed the boat. There is virtually no concrete 
commitment in that statement, except for a confirmation of the 
about-face made by the government, which is resolutely turning 
its back on the promotion of human and democratic rights,  thus 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9241"> 9241 </A></B>
<P>
relinquishing its historic responsibilities. I will get back to this 
later on.
<P>
	Let me take a few moments to discuss the key objectives 
which, from now on, will guide the government on the 
international scene. The hon. member for Verchères will deal 
more specifically with the government's first objective, which 
is to promote prosperity and employment, while I will mainly 
discuss the second and third ones, which are the promotion of 
security and of Canadian values and culture.
<P>
	First, as regards the issue of security, it is clear that the 
intentions of the Minister of Foreign Affairs are not supported 
by concrete action. Indeed, in spite of his being in favour of UN 
reform, which the minister feels is a pressing issue, he has no 
immediate steps to propose. Instead of immediately announcing 
the gist of the reforms this government will propose on the 
occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the UN, the minister has 
indicated he will wait until then to announce Canada's position 
on possible reforms.
<P>
	Meanwhile, the UN remains incapable of taking effective 
action in the field, to prevent tragedies like those we have 
witnessed in Rwanda, the former Yugoslavia, the Sudan, and the 
list goes on. The minister does not seem to realize that reforms 
are urgently needed at the UN. The minister has been musing 
about this for more than fifteen months, but when will we see 
some concrete decisions? In fact, the minister is postponing 
decisions that should be made today.
<P>
	What the minister had to say about some very important 
matters like the Arctic and non-proliferation of nuclear arms 
also merits careful scrutiny. The Arctic, the scene of constantly 
escalating militarism during the Cold War, should be given more 
serious consideration than what transpired from the minister's 
proposals. Instead of coming out in favour of a military 
withdrawal, pure and simple, from this territory, the minister 
proposes a plan for sustainable development to be implemented 
by the countries that share this immense territory.
<P>
	What is the use of supporting this kind of scheme, attractive 
though it may be, if it is not supported by a firm Canadian 
position on the demilitarization of the area? Canada's firm 
position is reflected in a decision to spend $1 billion on 
submarines, as provided in the latest white paper on Canada's 
defence policy. Is that what the minister means by sustainable 
development in the Arctic? Would it not be preferable to start 
discussions on this very worthwhile objective now with our 
partners the United States, Russia and the Scandinavian 
countries?
<P>
	The non-proliferation of nuclear arms is another case of the 
government not practising what it preaches. How can we expect 
Canada to have any credibility, when our position is in no way 
reflected in concrete policies? Would the minister not have done 
better to make exercising real control over our exports of 
nuclear products part of the government's trade policy?
<P>
	As a world leader in the production of these strategic 
commodities, Canada undeniably has sufficient clout among the 
nations that buy our products. Here again, the minister prefers to 
take refuge in comments that seldom have much more than a 
cosmetic impact. It is really too bad the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs obviously was not listening to the many 
recommendations made by a host of witnesses who appeared 
before the joint committees on foreign affairs and defence.
<P>
	Since it was elected, this government has constantly used 
consultations as an excuse, consultations that, unfortunately, are 
useless since the government lacks the political will to defend 
the convictions shared by Canadians and Quebecers.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	With respect to the government's third objective, culture, the 
spearhead of Canadian foreign policy, I would like to point out 
right off that, once again, the Government of Canada is refusing 
to acknowledge and to address the problem of Canada's two 
constituent nations.
<P>
	In their dissenting report, Bloc Quebecois members 
acknowledged that Canada needed anchoring against the 
overpowering culture of the United States. The government's 
approach in cultural matters, however, is based on the false 
premise that this is one nation with a single culture, a so-called 
Canadian culture. What is this Canadian culture, exactly?
<P>
	Clearly Canada is having great difficulty defining itself. Its 
existential problem is that it is being torn apart by a double 
identity. The government's only response to this difficulty was 
to introduce the policy of multiculturalism. The minister is 
doubtless aware, as a Quebecer, that this policy is based not so 
much on a sociological analysis of the place of ethnic groups 
within Canada as on a desire to impose a single and common 
vision of Canada.
<P>
	In our opinion, however, any policy intended to project the 
image of a homogeneous and unified Canada abroad can only 
lead to a denial of Quebec's culture. What the federal 
government is trying to do, in fact, is to use culture as a tool 
abroad to further marginalize and downplay Quebec's identity. 
Quebecers see through its scheme.
<P>
	Before broaching the subject of international aid, I would like 
to consider for a few moments the issue of human rights. In his 
policy statement, the Minister of Foreign Affairs indicated, and 
I quote, ``Human rights will remain a priority in the area of 
international aid''. And later on, ``The government will give 
priority to supporting democracy throughout the world in the 
years to come''. In fact there is nothing concrete to support this 
wishful thinking on the part of the government.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9242"> 9242 </A></B>
<P>
	What aspect of the policy statement released today 
establishes democracy and human rights as fundamental 
elements of Canada's foreign policy? Could the minister tell 
us this? What are the fundamental elements of foreign policy? 
The government simply dismissed this role, which suits its 
purposes, all the while refusing to truly entrench it as one of 
the basic principles of its foreign policy. It does nevertheless 
include some of the values shared by Canadians and Quebecers 
as a whole.
<P>
	Canada's foreign policy should instead demonstrate unfailing 
consistency and openness in this regard if it wishes to maintain 
the wealth of respect and prestige acquired by Canada and which 
a sovereign Quebec nation would like to perpetuate.
<P>
	The government quite simply lacked the will to ensure that the 
key elements of its foreign policy in respect of democracy and 
human rights be made into guidelines by the Department of 
Foreign Affairs and International Trade and by CIDA. The 
government could have done this with the collaboration of 
non-governmental agencies and commercial corporations.
<P>
	Such guidelines might have included a compulsory schedule 
for analyzing situations involving systematic and flagrant 
violations of human rights and could have been developed 
quickly. Instead, the government is satisfied with a statement 
that is meaningless since it suggests no concrete action.
<P>
	Regarding international aid, the government has once again 
missed the opportunity to be innovative in the renewal of its 
foreign policy. While, as we know, CIDA is being submitted to 
all kinds of pressures, preventing the agency from meeting its 
main objectives, the government failed to give it a constituent 
act clearly defining its powers and mandate. Currently, too 
many commercial considerations enter into some of the projets 
funded by CIDA.
<P>
	From now on, international aid will have to serve Canadian 
commercial interests first and foremost. The government made 
itself very clear on that. We believe, on the contrary, that the 
main objective of aid should be to provide the poorest nations of 
the world with the tools necessary to develop at a sustainable 
pace.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	What kind of mechanism is the government putting in place to 
ensure that public aid to development is only used to this end? 
No matter how hard we look, we cannot find any. Instead, the 
fact that priority will be given to commercial interests will 
result in cancelling the benefits of the Canadian public program 
of aid to development and contribute to widening the gap 
between rich and poor nations. The Quebec association of 
international co-operation agencies had also pointed this out to 
the governement.
<P>
	As far as enhancing the role of NGOs in the delivery of aid 
programs, the government is saying no. The Bloc Quebecois' 
dissenting report and the committee's majority report agreed, 
however, on this issue: NGOs should have been granted a larger 
percentage of official development assistance.
<P>
	In conclusion, I am inclined to say that the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs would have benefitted from attentively reading 
and taking into consideration the recommendations made by the 
official opposition in its dissenting report.
<P>
	The government preferred not to respond to the observations 
and recommendations made by the official opposition in its 
dissenting report; this did not enhance democracy. 
Unfortunately, the policy statement issued by the minister this 
morning gives very few specifics. It is incoherent and 
short-sighted and is another demonstration of the federal 
government's inability to respond to the vision that Quebecers 
have of the world that surrounds them.
<P>
	It is more important than ever that Quebec finally be able to be 
fully active on the international scene, to express its own hopes 
and to defend its own interests.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to address the government's response to the report of 
the special joint committee reviewing Canada's foreign affairs. 
This review and the work with the committee was certainly 
rewarding and enjoyable for the most part, but when it comes to 
the minister's response I am somewhat disappointed.
<P>
	I was very interested in looking at the government's response 
to the Reform Party's dissenting opinion in the final report. In 
this dissenting opinion Reform raised many important issues 
and areas of concern. We also made several constructive 
recommendations specifically intended to assist the minister in 
developing his program review. In other words, the Reform 
members of the special joint committee participated actively 
through eight months of meetings in the hope the minister would 
care about what we had to say.
<P>
	Our dissenting report represented the issues and ideas we felt 
had to be addressed by the government, but to my very great 
surprise the government report has no section on our concerns. 
In short, our views were totally ignored.
<P>
	When the final report was released we were suspicious when 
our dissenting paper and that of the BQ were included in a 
separate volume along with the lowly appendices. The 
government vehemently denied it was trying to marginalize our 
views and it claimed it was simply easier to include our paper in 
a second document because it was cheaper and easier to print 
two small documents rather than one large one.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9243"> 9243 </A></B>
<P>
	What seemed to be a lame excuse at the time now seems 
somewhat more sinister. Clearly our views were not important 
enough for the government to consider and this document 
proves it.
<P>
	Realizing there was no section on Reform's views 
specifically, I checked to see how the government was dealing 
with the recommendations we believed to be of particular 
importance. Again we were very disappointed.
<P>
	In the area of fiscal responsibility, which was our number one 
priority, I could not find a single spending cut or suggestion of 
cuts. While there was some acknowledgement that Canada faces 
tough economic times, there were simply no cuts, period. Even 
worse, there was a commitment to eventually increase our aid 
budget to 0.7 per cent of GNP, although the Liberals do not say 
when. This is misleading to NGOs, foreign governments and 
Canadians, and just impossible to achieve so why say it. If we 
were to do this today it would mean spending a couple of 
additional billions of dollars of borrowed money each year to 
finance this scheme. As Canada's economy grows and our GNP 
gets bigger, the target will only continue to get higher and higher 
as the years pass. Clearly this is not a realistic goal given 
Canada's $40 billion deficit and $550 billion federal debt. The 
taxpayers expect more accountability from the government than 
ever before.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	Another issue Reform very much hoped to see addressed 
involves CIDA. Reform and many Canadians want to give CIDA 
a true legislative mandate to increase its efficiency, 
accountability and transparency. A definite selling job has to be 
done to the Canadian public if we are going to continue to 
promote the ideas of CIDA. Unfortunately the government 
report rejects even the watered down recommendation in the 
special joint committee's report.
<P>
	The main problem with the true legislative mandate is that the 
government would no longer be able to use CIDA's $2 billion 
budget as a slush fund into which the minister or Prime Minister 
can dip their fingers when it is time to dole out goodies to the 
international community. Heaven forbid that the minister 
should go to a country in Africa, Latin America or the Middle 
East without having some multimillion dollar gift from the 
Canadian taxpayer to herald his arrival. That apparently is one 
diplomatic tradition the government is intent on keeping.
<P>
	In the government's response to the chapter on culture we 
were again surprised that the government, in a time of fiscal 
restraint, was willing to dole out cultural export subsidies to 
promote Canada's culture abroad. I guess this should not have 
come as too big a surprise, considering some of the recent grants 
doled out by the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	It strikes me as highly ironic that a government which has, to 
its credit, pursued freer trade world-wide and called for the 
reduction of other types of subsidies, would then go on to 
support cultural subsidies. Not to mention that when we are 
cutting back on social programs here, does it really make sense 
to be spending hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars to, for 
example, send the National Arts Centre orchestra to Europe so 
that, to quote the minister: ``European audiences will again have 
an opportunity to experience the creativity and quality of its 
music''. It does not seem to make sense.
<P>
	Reform would have much preferred to see a creative, modern 
partnership develop between the business community and the 
arts, facilitated by the government. In this way the strength of 
Canadian culture could be promoted to the fullest. How much 
better this would have been than the Liberal solution of big 
government.
<P>
	As an aside, if the government does as good a job of 
promoting Canadian culture as it has done with our economy, 
then the musicians and artists of Canada had been look out.
<P>
	Last, the government report makes a lot of hay about how 
great its consultation process has been. It claims to want to have 
real consultation with Parliament and parliamentary 
committees. What does the record show? I remember in the fall 
when parliamentarians were called for a special parliamentary 
debate on peacekeeping in Haiti. The government wanted to 
know what to do. Or did it really want to know what to do?
<P>
	The main problem with the government's consultation was 
that I had already read the government's firm plans in the 
morning paper. So much for the consultation process. We can go 
through the former Yugoslavian debate, through peacekeeping. 
The announcements are made prior to us even debating in the 
House, so what validity do they have?
<P>
	The report also goes on to indicate that the government will 
have future forums to help Canada's foreign policy to 
continually evolve, once again through consultation. While this 
sounds very nice on the surface, the Reform Party's concern is 
that only university professors, the friends of the Liberal Party 
and other elite will ever get invited to these. While we would 
love to be proven wrong, we will wait and see what happens to 
ordinary Canadians.
<P>
	I suppose the way this whole process started is an indication 
of that. If we take a look at who was at the Congress Centre, I 
think it proves my point. If the government is really serious 
about continuing the consultation process, then I hope it will 
invite the Canadian grassroots. Maybe then it would find out 
what the people really want. If it did this then maybe it will also 
consider drafting a new government report, one that address the 
specific concerns of ordinary Canadians, a report that is up front 
about what will be funded and what will be cut.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9244"> 9244 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1050 ) </B>
<P>
	I feel the government is as out of touch as it was in 1992 with 
the referendum and with many other issues that occur today. The 
report should give specific plans which the government will 
implement in a timely manner, not when economic conditions 
permit or any other such nonsense. Finally, the report should 
deal with the issues of greater efficiency, accountability and 
transparency for the good of all Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> A point of order, Madam Speaker. I wonder if 
I might seek the consent of the House to respond briefly on 
behalf of the New Democratic Party to the statement of the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry we do not 
have unanimous consent. I recognize the Minister for 
International Trade.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roy MacLaren (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, a year ago I rose in the House during the 
debate that launched the foreign policy review. Today we 
conclude the first and most important cycle on what must be an 
ongoing, continuing process of creative adjustment to a trading 
world always on the move.
<P>
	Yet at least one element remains constant. A year ago I began 
my speech by quoting from Lester Pearson's 1957 Nobel Peace 
Prize speech in which he wisely focused on the central role of 
free trade in achieving the intimately connected objectives of 
peace and prosperity. Today, one year later, the results of the 
foreign policy review reaffirm the enduring strength of that 
vision.
<P>
	Trade creates jobs and growth. Trade, investment and 
technology flows do not comprise a zero sum game that 
produces as many or more losers than winners. Rather, trade, 
investment and technology together comprise a creative, 
dynamic process that encourages innovation and provides 
opportunities for those wise enough to seize them.
<P>
	Trade rules, if carefully crafted, do not detract from 
sovereignty but rather add to it. International trade and 
investment rules extend abroad the rule of law. Rules inhibit the 
ability of those countries with the greatest market power to 
exercise that power unilaterally for their own narrower benefit. 
Rules provide greater certainty for producers, encouraging 
greater innovation and longer term planning rather than 
speculative activity. A rules based system permits a unified 
Canada to occupy a central place in shaping the outcome of that 
trade system's continuing evolution.
<P>
	The foreign policy review which we are discussing today 
drew on the views of many individual Canadians, 
non-governmental organizations, the private sector, 
parliamentarians. In the mid-1990s there is a broad recognition 
that something fundamental has happened to the global 
economy. Something is different in our global neighbourhood. 
There is greater consensus on economic  fundamentals; greater 
competition for market share and quality investment; greater 
interest in freeing markets through rules based systems, whether 
regionally or multilaterally; and greater diversity in the 
partnerships that we can and should use in order to shape the 
rules to reflect Canadian interests.
<P>
	The foreign policy review before us identifies two main 
objectives for Canada's trade policy. First, Canadians expect us 
to attract long term investments while eliminating barriers to 
our exports of goods and services. In this regard our objective 
will be to seek the further liberalization of trade and services 
and the removal of tariffs and non-tariff barriers, on a reciprocal 
basis, for all manufactured and resource based products.
<P>
	At the same time, we shall work for further liberalization of 
trade in agricultural products, including the elimination of 
barriers to our important agricultural exports and a prohibition 
of export subsidies. The era of the tariff is finally coming to an 
end. We must increasingly address other, more pressing and 
difficult issues that distort business decisions about where and 
how to invest to the detriment of smaller economies such as that 
of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	Second, Canadians expect us to work closely with business 
and workers, not only to ensure that the rules we are negotiating 
underpin growth and job creation, but also to encourage our 
transformation from being a trading nation into a country that 
can proudly and fairly portray itself as a nation of traders. The 
government has re-evaluated in depth its trade development 
programs with a view to increasing significantly their impact 
and relevance. I shall return to that point in a moment.
<P>
	Let me first briefly outline how the government intends to 
move forward these two objectives: the removal of barriers, the 
attraction of investment and the further promotion of an export 
commitment among Canadians.
<P>
	First, we plan to work with our trading partners to deepen the 
international rules governing trade, investment and technology, 
to discipline practices that disadvantage Canada.
<P>
	Foremost in this regard we must continue to manage 
effectively the Canada-United States economic relationship. A 
united Canada has done well in opening the U.S. market while 
protecting Canadian sensitivities in such areas as cultural 
industries and agricultural products. The ongoing, effective 
management of this special relationship requires vigilance and 
national teamwork to ensure that Canadian interests are 
defended whenever U.S. regulators or special interest groups 
attempt to bend the rules of either NAFTA or the new World 
Trade Organization.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9245"> 9245 </A></B>
<P>
	We shall pursue reforms that reduce the possibility of 
disputes with the United States concerning the issues of 
subsidies, dumping and the total operation of trade remedy 
laws. We shall seek better access to U.S. government 
procurement contracts and greater opportunities to compete 
with regard to financial services.
<P>
	Multilaterally, we shall remain in the forefront of the work 
under way to ensure that the World Trade Organization becomes 
a dynamic force for extending rule making beyond the level 
achieved last year in the Uruguay round. The new World Trade 
Organization has an ambitious agenda of negotiations already 
under way in such areas as financial services, maritime transport 
and government procurement. There is also considerable 
unfinished business with regard to trade distorting agricultural 
subsidies. These are all important issues for Canada.
<P>
	Moreover, past and present rule making and the increasing 
internationalization of markets are continually expanding the 
scope of domestic practices that require the attention of policy 
makers internationally to ensure that market access gains are not 
undermined by the use of new instruments to achieve old 
protectionist ends.
<P>
	The new agenda of rule making will encompass such areas as 
product standards; anti-trust policies and the relationship with 
anti-dumping reform; the link between environmental and 
labour standards and trade; and the use of massive subsidies that 
distort decisions about where companies locate their 
investments to the detriment of countries such as Canada.
<P>
	Second, we propose to widen our network of free trade 
partners to improve market access for Canadian exporters. Over 
the past year we have encouraged the expansion of NAFTA in 
order to ensure that this agreement is an outward looking, 
dynamic instrument.
<P>
	Last December the first stage of our efforts was crowned with 
success when the Prime Minister joined the Presidents of United 
States, Mexico and Chile in announcing the beginning of the 
process that should see Chile become a full member of NAFTA 
by late this year or early next year.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	Accession to NAFTA requires a consensus among current 
members. Canada worked hard to achieve that consensus on 
Chile. We also intend to build on this success to meet the 
challenge identified in the Miami summit of the Americas, of 
constructing a western hemisphere free trade area encompassing 
the whole of the western hemisphere no later than the year 2005.
<P>
	During last month's visit to South America the Prime 
Minister launched the process of consultations that will take us 
farther in that direction by proposing the initiation of 
discussions with the Mercosur countries, the countries of the 
southern cone of Latin America, with a view to integrating 
Mercosur and NAFTA.
<P>
	We intend to build realistically and vigorously from this 
starting point. We shall also pursue the widening of free trade 
through encouraging and participating in negotiations leading to 
accession to the World Trade Organization by several major 
economies that currently operate on the margins of the 
international rules based trading system.
<P>
	These economies are important players in the global 
marketplace. They include China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, 
Taiwan. Moreover, we shall seek further commitments across 
the Pacific with our partners in the Asia Pacific economic 
co-operation forum, or APEC as it is more familiarly known.
<P>
	These economies provide excellent markets for Canadian 
exporters. They are the source of much of the dynamism driving 
world growth today. Yet their commitment to the international 
trading system as measured by their level of acceptance of the 
obligations of that system is not yet commensurate with the 
benefits they derive from it. This must change.
<P>
	Canada for its part will work actively to encourage the 
necessary commitment, including pursuing actively the free 
trade commitment made by APEC's leaders during their summit 
last November in Indonesia.
<P>
	Then there is Europe. Although our ties of trade are 
proportionately somewhat less than a generation ago, they 
remain of the greatest importance. We also enjoy stronger than 
ever investment links across the Atlantic.
<P>
	How then do we re-energize the transatlantic economic 
relationship, building on progress in regional agreements to 
maintain the dynamic of global trade liberalization? This is a 
question well worth pursuing whatever the precise answer or 
mechanism eventually developed to recharge our European 
links in the post cold war world.
<P>
	While I have briefly outlined several of the key elements 
comprising our government's commitment to widening and 
deepening our network of rules based freer trade, this effort will 
have a considerably diminished impact for Canada unless 
Canadians take full advantage of the access secured through our 
international negotiations.
<P>
	Rules help to open the door to prosperity and to keep it open. 
However, rules do not trade. It is companies that trade. 
Consequently, the government's third trade related objective is 
to rationalize and energize our international business 
development programs in light of the foreign policy review and 
extensive public consultation with both the private sector and 
the provinces over the past year.
<P>
	We shall for our part redouble our efforts abroad to ensure that 
all our firms receive timely, relevant, accurate market 
information, access to foreign decision makers and the effective 
defence of their interest when authorities in other countries do 
not comply with their international trade obligations.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9246"> 9246 </A></B>
<P>
	Domestically we are committed to extending the Team 
Canada concept to include a more coherent, integrated approach 
toward co-operation with the provinces in order to help 
increase the export readiness of Canadian firms. We are also 
refocussing federal government assistance to encourage job 
rich, small and medium size companies to enter export markets 
while improving their access to export financing by launching 
greater collaboration between the private banks and by our 
Export Development Corporation.
<P>
<B>(1105 ) </B>
<P>
	To facilitate Canada's full involvement in the global, 
increasingly knowledge intensive economy the government will 
also foster the acquisition and development of technology by 
Canadian businesses, in part through their greater participation 
in international research and development alliances. We shall 
also vigorously promote increased awareness among foreign 
investors of Canada's science and technology strengths.
<P>
	Finally, we shall also focus more human resources on 
developing high growth markets in Asia Pacific and Latin 
America while targeting our efforts in western Europe more 
sharply on investment technology and strategic alliances.
<P>
	Widening the reach of our free trade partnerships abroad, 
deepening the international rules consistent with Canadian 
interests and renewing and recharging our partnerships with 
business, large and small, and with the provinces, this is the 
government's basic trade agenda. It provides the basis for 
sustaining growth and for job creation at home in Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased today to be involved in the conclusion of a project to 
which my colleagues and I devoted considerable time in the 
course of 1994.
<P>
	To their credit, the Liberal government's policies tabled today 
differ significantly from those of previous governments and 
take a somewhat new approach in terms of international trade. 
The need to tighten spending probably forced the government to 
make choices in its international trade promotion programs. The 
policies being presented today, however, are being presented as 
well thought out and considered.
<P>
	The government's approach differs from that of its 
predecessor in that it is proposing diversification of markets 
outside North America and would appear to be dismissing or 
even denying the phenomenon of continentalization. 
Furthermore, it is proposing a vigorous strategy to promote free 
trade through multilateral organizations such as the WTO, 
regional organizations such as APEC, the North and South 
America free trade area and a still theoretical European and 
American free trade area.
<P>
	Finally, the minister is initiating a series of measures to try to 
contain American unilateralism, which is viewed as a threat to 
Canada's commercial development.
<P>
	This is, in fact, one of the most striking elements of the speech 
by the Minister for International Trade and of the statement of 
policy tabled today. With your permission, I would like to 
comment briefly on it. I will say right off that we reject the 
one-dimensional image of our trading partner being painted for 
us. Once again, the minister has described the United States to 
us as some sort of elephant to be constrained or a geopolitical 
and commercial problem to be managed, to use the minister's 
wording.
<P>
	Given this analysis of Canadian-American relations, one can 
see why the minister seems to have had difficulty in developing 
a strategy consisting of anything more than, in a manner of 
speaking, aiming to contain, restrict, neutralize and indeed limit 
our relations with the United States. How can such an attitude be 
justified in view of the enormous market located just across the 
border whose influence will make or break our economic 
prosperity?
<P>
	The minister translates his vision into policies with a similar 
perspective on the United States. He does in fact mention 
``taking a united stand'', ``protecting'' ourselves and ``assuming 
a defensive position''. These overly cautious and defensive 
policies are born of this fearful attitude towards the United 
States and of a siege mentality.
<P>
	Some people, I am sure, would tell me that the United States 
have not always fully respected the principles of free trade. I 
would gladly agree. In this regard, I would even add that the 
Bloc Quebecois and I have not hesitated to criticize in no 
uncertain terms the unspeakable attitude of our neighbours to 
the south in regard to steel, wheat, timber, beer, uranium and, 
most recently, agricultural products subject to supply 
management as well as cultural products.
<P>
	In fact, that is the reason why we strongly support this 
government's desire to work towards an international system 
based on respect of the shared rules of the game by all parties, 
even commercial giants.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	We support the initiatives presented to the World Trade 
Organization, which must now prove itself and study crucially 
important issues such as rules on dumping and subsidies.
<P>
	We also support the government's wish to open NAFTA up to 
new players and to give us more weight against the United 
States.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9247"> 9247 </A></B>
<P>
	Furthermore, we support the trilateral discussions being held 
between the United States and Mexico in order to reach an 
agreement on dumping and subsidies before the end of the year.
<P>
	We expect a lot from the Prime Minister's campaign promise 
on this issue. However, this undue wariness, this near mental 
blocking of the United States troubles us, because it blinds the 
government to business opportunities and to the huge potential 
the American market holds, especially for our small and 
medium size businesses.
<P>
	Too preoccupied with the relative importance of the United 
States in our trade structure, the government refuses to see that 
we still have not exploited all of the potential there. 
Nevertheless, each year hundreds of small and medium size 
businesses baptize their export operations by naturally turning 
to the commercial entity which is geographically closest, where 
language is not a barrier, the culture is similar and, of course, 
where free trade rules apply.
<P>
	In fact, for the vast majority of small and medium size 
businesses, the United States is the export market of choice.
<P>
	As a consequence, the government should perceive the action 
plan for small and medium size businesses on the American 
market more in terms of development, exploitation and 
conquest of a new market. Policies on the promotion of 
international trade and the allotment of resources should take 
into consideration and reflect this inevitable reality.
<P>
	Need I remind members that economic growth in Canada is 
closely linked to our businesses' exports to the United States? 
One has but to consider the extraordinary increase of 19.8 per 
cent in Canadian exports to the American market, and the 
increase of close to 30 per cent for Quebec in 1993. Growth in 
that area was almost six times greater than growth in our exports 
to Asia.
<P>
	For the nine first months of 1994, our exports to the United 
States increased again, from 19.8 per cent to 21 per cent. These 
figures clearly show that our post-recession economic growth is 
not due solely to the new developing markets of Japan, China 
and other Asian countries, far from it.
<P>
	Despite what the Liberal government may think or wish, 
Canada is part of the increasingly integrated North American 
market. Trying to diversify our markets is one thing, but 
ignoring Canada's inevitable economic and trade integration 
with the rest of North America is another.
<P>
	This analysis brings me to the conclusion that we are now 
witnessing a re-emergence of the third option favoured by 
Liberals in the 1970s, namely replacing Europe with Asia as our 
main market.
<P>
	This ambitious but rather ineffective, not to say unproductive, 
policy overshadows once again the government's statements 
and options, something that we find quite alarming. 
Government efforts to target geographic markets are generally 
not effective. Only businesses are in a position to identify their 
markets of choice, and the government must adjust to their 
choices. Eighty per cent of Canadian businesses want to do 
business in the U.S. If some of them feel up to exploring less 
accessible markets, all the better. We welcome their success, 
which creates jobs and generates wealth.
<P>
	However, we cannot agree with efforts to redirect artificially, 
so to speak, Canadian trade toward other markets by 
unjustifiably neglecting to look forward with enthusiasm to the 
development of our full trade potential in the U.S. This would be 
a major strategic mistake.
<P>
	Allow me to quote from our dissenting report remarks that 
appear to be more appropriate than ever:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>However, it would be irresponsible to overlook the proximity of Europe and 
the enormous potential of this continent, particulary where Quebec is concerned. 
Is the St. Lawrence River not the most direct point of entry of Europe into the 
North American continent? Nor should we lose sight of the undeniable political 
advantages that Quebec enjoys because of its French and British roots.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-the European continent, reconciled from West to East, with a population of 
close to 600 million consumers, flush with capital and cutting edge 
technological and industrial expertise, is not a player to be dismissed lightly.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As Canada stands poised to redefine its relations with the world, it must 
rediscover the old continent from which it split and structure its foreign policy 
on the European axis, the counterpart of the American and Asian axes.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	In closing, I would like to touch on a number of concepts that 
have been incorporated in the governmental strategy before us. 
First, the government proposes the Team Canada concept. In 
clear terms, this means an Ottawa-based centralized approach 
to international trade. It may suit certain provinces, as is 
apparently the case of Ontario, who signed with the federal 
government a coordination agreement that could not be imposed 
upon any other province, especially not Quebec. Quebec has 
developed an extensive international trade representation 
network that is proven-I repeat, proven-and that it certainly 
has no intention of doing away with.
<P>
	The Team Canada approach ignores the economic and cultural 
reality of Canadian regions. It would be incorrect to consider 
this country as one, single, homogenous market. Canada is made 
up of several regions, each of which has its unique 
characteristics and its own primary markets, industrial fabric, 
strong sectors and geographic and cultural ties. Nowhere in this 
policy does the government take this into account, let alone in 
this great levelling whole that Team Canada is.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9248"> 9248 </A></B>
<P>
	On the other hand, the government tells us in this policy 
statement that it intends to cut administration expenses and 
restructure international trade development programs. These 
good intentions are truly commendable and we are looking 
forward to seeing what will come of these good intentions, in 
concrete terms, in the upcoming budget. Moreover, we feel that 
the government's emphasis on small and medium size 
businesses is the obvious thing to do, since the current fiscal 
situation does not leave any other option and that big 
corporations need government support the least.
<P>
	We also think that the government's intention to allow federal 
and provincial civil servants, as well as private sector people, 
take courses at the Canadian foreign service institute is an 
excellent idea, as well as a step towards greater utilization of 
government services.
<P>
	It is also interesting to see that Canada is reviewing its 
political approach in Washington, given the new realities, and 
particularly the emergence of a strong U.S. Congress, more 
powerful than ever. We hope for concrete steps in support of this 
new approach.
<P>
	In conclusion, we will ensure that the government implements 
the policies and programs which best serve the interests of all 
Canadians and Quebecers. We will continue to take a hard look 
at the controlling approach of that government. In order to 
ensure the prosperity and development of our businesses and 
communities, the vital importance of the American market must 
be recognized.
<P>
	Moreover, that recognition must come before a necessary 
acceptance of that reality and a strong will to fully develop that 
potential.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, it 
is gratifying for me to see that a little over a year has just passed 
and we have had a foreign policy review in Canada and we have 
had a response to the foreign policy review by this government.
<P>
	I was a part of that foreign policy review as well as my other 
colleagues on this side of the House and enjoyed the process 
very much. I enjoyed getting to meet the members of the 
standing committee who were involved and hearing the 
concerns of Canadians about where our foreign policy should be 
heading in the future. To a large extent this time around I believe 
foreign policy was driven by economic and trade policy.
<P>
	It is a pity the government's response to this policy arrived on 
my desk about 20 minutes before I came into this House at 10 
o'clock. It is very difficult for me to have an adequate response. 
I have to take this government to task for an ongoing series of 
short notices on these kinds of matters. What is there to hide 
here? I would have liked to have had adequate time to prepare 
my response and I simply did not have it. I must say I did get a 
fax of the minister's speech overnight and I do appreciate that. 
By necessity then I will be keeping my comments short.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	My colleagues and I believe in trade liberalization and we 
believe in it wholeheartedly. We have viewed with great 
satisfaction the tremendous transformation as well of the 
government on this issue. We recall that not too long ago we had 
a Prime Minister who was denouncing freer trade with the 
Americans. Now we witness him trotting around the globe 
promoting trade as the granddaddy of free trade. We welcome 
that.
<P>
	I would like to begin my response by taking the trade minister 
to task on his statement in the report. I quote him in saying that 
the era of tariffs is finally over. I wish that were true. I find his 
statement even more ludicrous because he ties it to a desire to 
eliminate trade barriers to export of our agriculture products.
<P>
	How can the minister say the era of tariffs is over when we 
have tariffs of over 300 per cent on our supply managed 
products? They are coming down at a very slow rate. In fact, 
they are coming down by an average of 36 per cent over the next 
six years. However if you take into account that we have a 
minimum tariff reduction of 15 per cent on all tariffs plus a 51 
per cent on minimum access, in fact the true figure would be 
more like a 16 per cent tariff reduction in supply managed 
products.
<P>
	Therefore we will not see any free trade in agriculture 
products under the supply managed sectors during our time in 
this Parliament unless something is changed. They are still very 
high. I believe the government has to take some leadership in 
this issue of supply management, be honest with Canadian 
producers and tell them there is a real world out there that they 
have to adjust to. We have been saying this all along.
<P>
	We are going to have retaliation from the Americans. It is 
starting to happen in this area. They are taking exception to our 
high tariffs in the supply managed sectors. They are looking for 
ways of retaliating. We have seen retaliation in the area of 
wheat. We see retaliation in the area of setting high tariffs on 
sugar products. Of course now we are going to have the cultural 
industries that are going to be hit.
<P>
	We have to show leadership in this area and help our 
producers to make this adjustment. It is our view that the supply 
managed sectors should be given 10 years to move to zero tariffs 
so that they do not interfere with other aspects of our trading 
relationships, particularly with the United States. The 
government should sit down with this industry and try to work 
out a plan to make this happen. It should show some leadership.
<P>
	The minister says that the government ``must continue to 
manage effectively the Canada-U.S. economic relationship''. 
We all know that the Americans are tough negotiators and they 
have the economic clout to carry through with their threats. I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9249"> 9249 </A></B>
<P>
ask: What is the point of not dealing decisively with these trade 
irritants that we have caused ourselves?
<P>
	I will move to a second aspect of the government's response to 
the foreign policy review. On page three of the response the 
government states that it rejects the committee's proposal to 
establish a joint public and private consortium to assist in 
international business development. I am sorry to see that is the 
case.
<P>
	This proposal would not entail any new government 
expenditures. In fact it would put into private hands some of the 
functions that government now performs thereby saving the 
government money. When we have a $40 billion deficit I would 
expect that we would be looking for ways to do that. Trade 
promotion is one that could fall well within that category and 
this recommendation should have been adopted.
<P>
	I would like to see the government devolve wherever possible 
tasks to the private sector that it can do better. This is one area I 
believe there is room to do something in terms of trade 
promotion.
<P>
	The final point I would like to make is with a statement that 
appeared on the very first page of Canada's foreign policy 
report. The statement reads as follows: ``Many witnesses 
stressed the importance of Canadians getting their own house in 
order in terms of fiscal management, making the economic 
adjustments necessary''. I could not agree more.
<P>
	We are going to be going through a process within a few weeks 
in this very House that has to deal very aggressively with 
Canada's debt problem. That is also causing a lot of problems 
for Canadian business. The high cost of doing business in this 
country is not allowing Canadian business the opportunity to 
take full advantage of the trade deals that have been made. We 
have the World Trade Organization, we have the signing of the 
GATT, we have a North American free trade deal and we have 
the Prime Minister and the trade minister trying to broker some 
other deals together. I think that is excellent.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	What we are missing here is a very important element. That 
element is that we have to concentrate on lowering the cost of 
doing business in this country. We have to get rid of internal 
trade barriers that are inhibiting our businesses, our opportunity 
to do business better. The concentration for the next while has to 
be here at home to resolve some of those problems; otherwise we 
are misleading our Canadian business people about the 
opportunities that are out there because we will not be able to 
take advantage of them.
<P>
	We all know that when we have trade liberalization it is a 
double edged sword. I would like to see the government take a 
stronger approach to informing, to making our business people 
aware of what opportunities are out there, but also what they are 
going to be facing in terms of competition here at home.
<P>
	In the past we have had barriers to trade within Canada, such 
as tariff barriers that have given our Canadian business people 
an opportunity to have all of the Canadian market or most of the 
Canadian market to themselves. That is no longer going to be the 
case. We are going to be facing increased competition at home 
and it is important that our business people realize that so that 
they can start to deal with this very important issue.
<P>
	Only when our companies are competitive at home can we be 
truly competitive in the international sphere. I believe the trade 
deals we have signed are going to drag us kicking and screaming 
into the 21st century but it is a good thing we have done it.
<P>
	Our party of course has issued a dissenting report the aspects 
on which it is based are: we have to have fiscal responsibility 
here at home; we have to tighten up in the area of the cost of 
doing business to our companies; we have to get our own house 
in order. We believe that trade promotion should be an aspect of 
business as well as government. We also believe that the cultural 
industries should be regarded as businesses in themselves.
<P>
	We hear that the government in responding to the 
recommendations that it be involved in promotion, development 
and distribution of culture wants to pursue that. I believe that is 
a mistake. We also hear that some American distribution 
companies will not carry our cultural industries. I believe they 
are producing a good product. They will be carried in the same 
way that any other product is carried.
<P>
	I do not think the government has a role in the area of culture. 
This should be left to the business sector or those sectors in the 
cultural industry that can do it for themselves. I believe they can 
compete very effectively.
<P>
	With that, I welcome this response. I would like to have an 
opportunity to finish reading it. I have not had the time to do that 
with this short notice. I would ask that from here on in we be 
given ample opportunity to look at these issues with enough 
time to respond properly.

provincial mental health legislation and what is the timetable for having the 
necessary agreements in place?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> 
Federal/provincial/territorial ministers responsible for justice 
will be meeting with a delegation of ministers responsible for 
health in the latter part of January or early February, 1995. The 
report of a federal/provincial/territorial task force respecting 
dangerous offenders will be a topic of discussion on the agenda 
and the use of provincial mental health legislation to effect civil 
commitment will be an option among those discussions. The 
degree of consensus we can achieve at that meeting will largely 
determine the speed with which we can proceed.
<P>
	Bill C-45 is currently before the House and contains 
amendments permitting the National Parole Board to detain 
persons with a high risk of offending against children until their 
warrant expiry date.
<P>
	While legislative amendments and 
federal/provincial/territorial agreements/protocols will go 
some way to providing better tools to deal with offenders of this 
sort, it is doubtful that any failsafe mechanism can be found to 
eliminate all risk. Prudent attention to crime prevention 
behaviours will always be required by careful citizens.
<P>
Question No. 127-<B>Mr. Simmons:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>What action will the government take in reference to the claim made by the 
Auditor General in his 1994 report that ``Health Canada cannot ensure that the 
food related and safety provisions of the Food and Drugs Act are applied fully 
and effectively to all food produced domestically or imported for sale in 
Canada,'' and what specific measures are being developed to deal with the gaps 
in information received from the provinces on ``the nature, extent, timing and 
results of food safety inspections they undertake''?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Health 
Canada recently initiated a food safety audit of inspection 
programs of the other federal departments dealing with food 
namely Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada and the Department 
of Fisheries and Oceans. Specific programs being audited 
include those for imported foods, shellfish inspection and food 
container integrity. The first phase of the audit, which is in 
<P>

<B><A NAME="9253"> 9253 </A></B>
<P>
process, will assess the suitability of these programs. A second  
phase of the audit, to be completed in the next fiscal year, will 
look at the application of these programs. Comprehensive 
standards for the inspection of domestic plants producing a 
variety of foods have also been developed.
<P>
	With respect to provincial issues, the responsibility for the 
inspection of food which is produced and sold within a province 
is the responsibility of that province. The only food inspection 
activities that are conducted by the provinces for which the 
federal government is currently responsible are those activities 
conducted by the provinces on behalf of the federal government. 
Health Canada is presently considering how the food safety 
audit program could be extended to cover these areas. This is 
being dealt with in the context of the recent Canadian food 
inspection system initiative to more fully integrate the various 
food inspection systems within Canada at the federal and 
provincial level.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="IMMIGRATIONACT">IMMIGRATION ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from February 6 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-44, an act to amend the Immigration Act and 
the Citizenship Act and to make a consequential amendment to 
the Customs Act, be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to participate in this 
debate on Bill C-44, an act to amend the Immigration Act and 
the Citizenship Act.
<P>
	Many of my constituents have expressed concerns regarding 
immigration and I welcomed the minister this past September in 
Guelph where he spoke to us about this important issue.
<P>
	Guelph-Wellington has welcomed immigrants in the past 
and it wants to welcome immigrants in the future. According to 
the last census our community is made up of new immigrants 
from Great Britain, Central and South America, India, various 
parts of Europe and parts of the Caribbean and Asia. 
Guelph-Wellington residents speak Italian, Portuguese, 
Spanish, German, Armenian and a host of other languages in 
their homes. Italians, Ukrainians, Germans, Austrians and other 
ethnic groups have associations where children learn about their 
heritage and people come together with others from their native 
lands to celebrate what they have in common.
<P>
	Each one of these individuals no matter what their country of 
birth or their language has a desire to live here in Canada. Their 
Canadian citizenship is the tie that unifies and joins them all 
with us.
<P>
<B>(1145 ) </B>
<P>
	There is no doubt that Canada is the best country in the world. 
It is then obvious that people from every part of the globe would 
want to share our abundance and come to communities like 
Guelph-Wellington to begin to live new lives in freedom and 
with the hope of prosperity.
<P>
	We have been generous as a people and a government, 
however my constituents have asked me to review the 
immigration system in order to ensure that our generosity is not 
abused. This bill is long overdue. It is necessary if we are going 
to restore integrity to a system that has been damaged by those 
who reject our generosity, ignore our laws, and fail not only 
every Canadian but everyone who wishes to immigrate to 
Canada.
<P>
	Our immigration system has been built on the same elements 
that have made our country great. Determination, respect for 
each other and for our laws, hard work, and dedication to self 
and family have been the hallmarks of Canadians born here and 
elsewhere.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9254"> 9254 </A></B>
<P>
	Guelph-Wellington's workforce is well respected because 
of its people. They have a tradition of excellence learned from 
their parents and grandparents who brought with them from 
foreign lands the desire to work hard and build products that 
are durable and of excellent quality. We have had the lowest 
unemployment in the country because of these qualities. Our 
business leaders have names like Samuelson, McCarthy, 
Briestensky, Sleeman, Youngman and Hasenfratz. By working 
together, old Canadians and new, natives and immigrants have 
built Guelph-Wellington into one of the finest communities 
in Canada.
<P>
	This bill recognizes that abuses have occurred and places our 
generosity on notice. This bill attempts to address the concerns 
of the people of Guelph-Wellington and elsewhere all through 
the country who have witnessed a desire for fairness being 
questioned and challenged by individuals who have no respect 
for our laws. We are doing something about those who fail to 
recognize that our society does not tolerate criminals and 
criminal acts.
<P>
	Bill C-44 is another example of a government that listens. 
Canadians have expressed legitimate concerns about current 
abuses. Every member in this House has heard them. This 
legislation is intended to help police forces do their jobs more 
effectively. I recently met with police in Guelph-Wellington 
who are frustrated by obstacles that hamper their important 
work.
<P>
	We have listened and we are acting now. My constituents have 
demanded that serious criminals who are a danger to the public 
not be allowed to claim refugee status as a means of delaying 
their removal from Canada. This bill ensures that a refugee 
application is not a tactic for stalling.
<P>
	My constituents have asked the government to eliminate the 
opportunity for one person to have several refugee claims 
processed at the same time. This bill answers those concerns.
<P>
	My constituents have also asked that persons with summary 
convictions, whether obtained here or abroad, not be allowed to 
enter this country. This bill responds to that concern as well.
<P>
	My constituents agree that refugees should be welcome to 
Canada under certain circumstances. They have watched the 
horror and famine in Somalia, the destruction caused by the war 
in Bosnia, and the plight of children in Romania. They want to 
share their abundance and protect genuine refugees, but they 
will no longer tolerate those who use the refugee system to hide 
behind criminal convictions and avoid deportation.
<P>
	My community has examples of refugees who have been 
forced to flee from their countries of birth and have made 
successful lives in Canada. Sadly this is not always the case. 
Guelph-Wellington residents are tired of those who abuse our 
system. They are disappointed that their concern and care have 
been rejected by those who have no respect for their generosity.
<P>
	I welcome the amendments that have been brought forward by 
the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration. These 
amendments clarify the definition of criminality and improve 
the enforcement package that was put forward by the minister.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	These amendments also clarify timeframes and various 
technical points. All members of Parliament should be proud 
that the work of our committees and the work of the immigration 
committee is finally coming to fruition in this legislation. This 
is what our constituents have been asking us to do.
<P>
	Bill C-44 gives the minister and senior immigration officials 
the tools to deal effectively with the concerns raised by my 
constituents and millions of other Canadians. This legislation, 
together with the immigration package recently announced by 
the minister, increases the credibility of our immigration 
system.
<P>
	Canadians and those applying for immigration status at 
embassies and consulates at every corner of the world want a 
system that is fair, balanced and credible. Constituents who visit 
my office daily or write to me with immigration application 
concerns want fairness. They know there are the few who make 
it even more difficult for their children, their spouses, their 
parents and siblings to make application and be accepted into 
this country. They want fairness too. Those who abuse make it 
difficult for those who want to come to Canada to be reunited 
with their families and contribute to our society.
<P>
	Bill C-44 prevents exploitation of our generosity. It speaks to 
fairness and attempts to end abuse. Who in this House would not 
want that? The bill recognizes the hard work and contribution of 
immigrants, while realizing that Canadians no longer accept 
criminal acts by bogus individuals or those who attempt to come 
to or remain in Canada to perpetuate their criminal lives. They 
will not stand for it.
<P>
	Liberals have a long history of tolerance and fairness. We 
helped build Canada with people of every race, from every part 
of this world. Tough times have made us question our ability to 
welcome new immigrants.
<P>
	It is my belief that we can encourage new Canadians to 
become active participants in our great society, while 
recognizing the legitimate concerns of our citizens, many of 
whom are first or second generation Canadians themselves. This 
legislation informs those who question our generosity that we 
will no longer allow abuse.
<P>
	Our country can be shared, but with those who respect our 
laws and want to contribute to make this nation great. My 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9255"> 9255 </A></B>
<P>
constituents have demanded no less. For them this legislation, 
Bill C-44, deserves every member's support.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I appreciate that the member has clearly outlined the 
concerns of her constituents. Those concerns have been 
expressed right across this country as Reformers have brought 
these matters to the attention of this House and forced this 
debate.
<P>
	I would like to point out to the member she was not present 
when any of the witnesses stood forward at the standing 
committee and testified to their concerns about this bill.
<P>
	Since the member has chosen to debate the matter, what does 
she intend to advise the government, or how will she express her 
concern when it comes to matters of insufficient numbers of 
people on the front line to enforce any provisions of this act and 
the present act? Many of those provisions are already there.
<P>
	There are insufficient numbers at the front line. There are 
insufficient numbers in the enforcement agency of immigration 
itself to carry out deportation warrants. The detention centres 
are already overcrowded because of lengthy hearings and 
removal processes that are literally hindering efficiency.
<P>
	What does the member intends to do to direct her government 
to address those problems? They are there whether Bill C-44 
exists or not.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Chamberlain:</B> Madam Speaker, I would certainly like 
to respond to the comments that Reformers have brought this 
issue to debate. That is not so at all. Every single Liberal 
member here has brought the same concerns forward from 
across this country. We, the Liberals, have brought this bill 
forward in conjunction with a committee report.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	As I stated in my speech, I think every member should be 
proud to support this bill. It is a very real mistake if people do 
not support it. As the hon. member has said, I think he will find 
his constituents will not be happy if he does not support a bill 
that will address such things as refugee claimants who have 
committed serious crimes being denied access to Canada.
<P>
	The member keeps calling out to me to answer the question. 
The question I think he put to me is how will we enforce it. Let 
me assure the member we will enforce it. We believe in it, and 
this government is not about to make legislation it cannot 
enforce.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I do 
not share the views expressed by the member for 
Guelph-Wellington. I think that this bill tends to add fuel to a 
climate of hostility and even panic among immigrant 
communities in Canada.
<P>
	This morning, I received a call from Toronto's Latin 
American community. Several Argentinians have been detained. 
They are in a jail near the airport. Children have been taken out 
of school to be deported. People do not want to go to Our Lady of 
Guadaloupe, a Latin American church in Toronto, because they 
are afraid of being arrested. They are not criminals.
<P>
	I will tell you about the case of Taramatie Seeratan 
Kamsubhag, a woman from Trinidad and Tobago. She will be 
deported in the next few days but her husband, who assaulted 
her, will stay here because he is remarried to a Canadian woman, 
and has thus acquired permananent resident status. Is this the 
kind of tolerance toward immigrants and refugees that the 
Liberal Party of Canada is talking about?
<P>
	In September 1993, in Montreal, the Deputy Prime Minister 
promised that no female victim of violence would be deported if 
the Liberals were elected. Fourteen women are being deported. 
What are you doing to prevent these women from being 
unjustifiably deported? I repeat, they are not criminals. These 
women have children, some of whom were born here in Canada, 
and they are now being deported.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Chamberlain:</B> Madam Speaker, the member is bringing 
up specific cases. It is most difficult to comment on particular 
cases when I do not know the facts about those cases, but first I 
would say we have the fairest system in the world.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> The most liberal system in 
the world.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Chamberlain:</B> You are right, it is a liberal system. You 
are absolutely right and we are proud of it.
<P>
	The second point is the fact our ministers are prepared to 
examine individual cases, and will act on those individual cases. 
We have to have trust and faith in the process if we put the right 
legislation in place. Bill C-44 will speak to the abuses in the 
system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it is now February 7 and the Liberals have been 
in power since October 26, 1993. There are existing provisions 
in the Immigration Act dealing with refugees and the 
enforcement of these provisions to deal with people who come 
into Canada and commit crimes, and people who come into 
Canada through the use of devious means. These provisions 
have been in existence since the Liberals were elected in 1993. 
The Liberal member for Guelph-Wellington is saying to us and 
to the Canadian people: ``Now that we have Bill C-44, now that 
we are going to get this bill passed''-they have the numbers, 
unfortunately-``we are going to start to deal with this thing''.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9256"> 9256 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	My colleague from Calgary Northeast asked the question: 
``Why aren't you using the existing provisions of the 
Immigration Act, existing provisions that are already in force?'' 
That is the question Canadians have been asking for the last year 
and one-half. We see these criminals running around our 
country laughing at our laws, laughing at the fact that the 
immigration department is powerless and have no people on the 
front lines to enforce the act.
<P>
	This is a haven for criminals who cannot get along in their 
own countries. They come to Canada because they know that 
governments like this current Liberal government support this 
bleeding heart, liberalized legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Chamberlain:</B> Madam Speaker, I am shocked. It is easy 
to stand up and refute everything. That is the basis they start 
from across the way. The reality is looking at what the bill does. 
The hon. member asked why we do not use the laws we have. We 
are, but we are also improving them. There is nothing wrong 
with improvement.
<P>
	The world goes on and the world changes. As it does the 
government will look at each individual case, as the Bloc 
member mentioned. It will also continue to pass legislation that 
will address current concerns that my constituents have talked 
about.
<P>
	I am sure the member from the Reform Party has had 
constituents asking him about some of these various things. Can 
the member say to me that his constituents would not be happy 
to see any refugee that has had two summary convictions not 
allowed in Canada? Would the member say that if a refugee 
claimant has committed a serious crime, he should not be denied 
access to Canada? These are things that I am sure this member's 
constituents want too.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is really a pleasure to talk to this bill today. I like the 
way the Liberals take credit for all of this immigration change 
we are talking about. As we have said, the majority of these 
changes have already been enacted. However, any change that 
has moved the government off its position has come from our 
critic from Calgary Northeast. He should be congratulated.
<P>
	The folks over there have not gone far enough. I am going to 
talk from personal experience, from my time in immigration 
hearings and refugee board hearings out of necessity and out of 
requests from people in my constituency. They are requests 
from victims. That is who we are talking about.
<P>
	I really take exception when the Liberal government starts 
talking about the vast majority of people saying that we are only 
talking about a very small minority. That is true, but it is not a 
small minority when we count all the victims that lie in the wake 
of some of these creeps it is allowing in.
<P>
	Let us make one thing very clear and concise on this whole 
issue. It really does not matter what all of the rules are from the 
day a person comes into the country until he or she leaves the 
country. What really matters is whether they can leave the 
country on demand from Canada. That is where the fault lies 
with the philosophy that is expounded over there. I am going to 
demonstrate that with letters I have from the minister.
<P>
	One might ask: ``Is there not something that will work in the 
bill?'' That may be. There may be some things that work in some 
aspects of these changes. The Liberals have had an opportunity 
until now to undertake the actions that are outlined in the act. 
They have not taken them. In many cases they will not get these 
people out even if they say they are going to deport them.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	I discussed a recent case with immigration officials who, by 
the way are very frustrated at the inaction of this government. 
They say that Bill C-44 will not work. People on the task forces 
talk to us rather than these people because they know that at least 
we understand what the position is.
<P>
	What about the 10 Vietnamese fellows arrested and on 
deportation orders by a task force? All have been released 
because they could not get travel documents. A travel document 
is necessary if we are to send these people back to Vietnam. If 
Vietnam is not going to take them back, then they do not go.
<P>
	What happened? They brought these 10 scum in off the streets 
and then let them out again. These Vietnamese are walking 
around Vancouver. If the Liberals think we like these kinds of 
people, let us talk about the young man who shot a kid in the face 
in Vancouver; another one who has been charged with sexual 
assault with a weapon; another one B and Es and is a member of 
a gang; another one has robbery, assault, trafficking times four 
in heroin. He is out on the streets again. Another one who must 
have been his buddy has trafficking times four in heroin. They 
probably have a company going.
<P>
	Liberal members are talking about all of the rules up to the 
point of getting them out of our country. However when it comes 
time to boot them out they let them out on the streets because 
they cannot get a travel warrant. That is not addressed in Bill 
C-44.
<P>
	There was another fellow I was contacted about by 
immigration. This guy was ordered deported. He lost his 
deportation appeal. He cannot get a travel warrant. They have 
been trying for a travel warrant since September 1993. They 
cannot get him out of the country no matter what rules we are 
applying in Bill C-44. He must be a harmless guy. Why not let 
him out on the streets? They did. In 1990 he had a sexual assault 
conviction. He has two 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9257"> 9257 </A></B>
<P>
outstanding criminal charges. He ripped up a government office 
in British Columbia and he is on welfare.
<P>
	The Liberal government sanctimoniously talks about how 
well it is doing and how it is going to get these people out of the 
country. It is false. It is all rhetoric. It is rhetoric like half a 
dozen other bills it has put through the House. We are sick and 
tired of it.
<P>
	I wrote to the minister in July. When he announced the task 
force to move these people out I suggested to him that since he 
has this task force and he is trying to oust these animals, why 
could I not give him some names to put on his list, the list that he 
said he had. I did. I gave him the name, José Salinas Mendoza, 
from my area. The minister stood up in the House and said: 
``That's an isolated case. You are making the whole system look 
bad because of José Salinas Mendoza''. He has only 12 criminal 
convictions.
<P>
	I gave him another name, another isolated case in my 
community, Karel Kral. I talked a bit about good old Karel who 
has been in this country for 17 years, 14 of which he has been 
behind bars for so many convictions we lost count.
<P>
	Then I wrote the minister a letter about Charles Dennis Martin 
who has only been ordered deported and escorted out of Canada 
nine times. Wow, what a track record the government has.
<P>
	I received a letter back from the minister which stated: 
``While I appreciate your interest in these matters, the Privacy 
Act prohibits the release of information on our clients''. They 
are clients. Because of the Privacy Act I cannot find anything 
out about these guys.
<P>
<B>(1210 ) </B>
<P>
	I said: ``Gee, am I exempted?'' ``Oh yes, except to members 
of Parliament and Senators who are seeking to assist the client in 
solving the problem''. I am not the least bit interested in 
assisting the client to solve a problem. I am really interested in 
getting some of these creeps out of the country, which is directly 
opposite to what the government is attempting to do.
<P>
	``In the case of Karel Kral'' the minister says, ``you state that 
he is currently awaiting trial on a sexual assault charge. The 
conclusion of the criminal proceedings and the serving of any 
prison sentence supersedes any action by immigration 
officials''. I am going to get back to that in a minute.
<P>
	Lots of problems have not been addressed. In this bill the 
government has not addressed removing these people from our 
country. It has not addressed the major understaffing at our 
borders with our enforcement people, at detention centres. If 
members took the time to talk to their own employees in 
immigration and on these task forces they would tell them so.
<P>
	The immigration officers do not really have the authority of 
arrest of the police. You would expect them to go to approach 
some of these creeps, heroin and narcotics dealers. Some of 
them are murderers. Does you expect them to go to them and 
say: ``I am from  immigration. How would you like to be 
arrested today? Do not use the Uzi in your back pocket''.
<P>
	They have to be given some authority. They have been asking 
for this and they have been denied it. The Liberals have in no 
way addressed those inept individuals on parole boards and on 
the refugee boards. I am going to talk about a few of those.
<P>
	Actually the member did address one, Marcelle Brisson, who 
actually gave a decision in 15 minutes on Bounjan Inthavong 
who I am going to talk about. The member addressed her all 
right. She got another three year agreement to stay on. None of 
that is addressed in here. That is what really counts. That is the 
meat of the issue. The government is not addressing what is 
important.
<P>
	Let us talk about my three favourite buddies in my riding. 
What an interesting chap is Karel Kral. He has been in this 
country for 17 years. Why would I bother addressing Karel as a 
refugee, as an immigrant, whichever he came in on. I am not 
sure of that. Why would I bother?
<P>
	He has been in and out of prison for 14 years of that time, not 
at one time. He has so many records against him that it is a real 
shame. I was asked by Joan to give her some moral support, go to 
the sentencing, go to the court case and see what goes on with 
good old Karel.
<P>
	Karel sexually assaulted Joan in my riding. Joan is 63 years 
old and good old Karel attacked her with a needle full of 
cocaine. He got his due, did he not? He was sent up for four 
years. He is getting out after the sentence. He was sentenced in 
November. He will be out on an unescorted day pass in May.
<P>
	I was told that the privacy laws prohibit me from getting his 
record. Fortunately we have some responsible people within the 
system who got me the record anyway.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> The Liberals would fire those guys.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Yes, Liberals fire people 
like that. We thank them.
<P>
	In the sentencing the judge says this. This is a first. ``In view 
of the elite circumstances surrounding this offence and the 
reasonable and realistic fears of the victim relating to possible 
actions of the accused upon his release, deportation be effective 
prior to the accused's release from prison to protect this and any 
other victim''.
<P>
	That really does not happen in the courts today and we made 
the point of saying: ``We have to get this guy out''. He actually 
had deportation orders twice before he sexually assaulted Joan. 
That is kind of sad.

<P>
	A letter from Joan to the hon. minister says that she was the 
assault victim. Let me give a couple of words from her letter: 
``He has a long criminal record and has spent 14 of his past 22 
years or so behind bars in Canada''. It was 22 years. ``As a 
taxpayer I find this intolerable. Many years ago I became a 
landed immigrant in the United States in order to be able to work 
there while my husband was attending university. I can recall 
that the American immigration authorities made it abundantly 
clear to us that if either of us committed a criminal act or became 
a charge on the state in any way we would be immediately 
deported''.
<P>
	What does that say for Canada? What does that say for Bill 
C-44?
<P>
	Joan wrote again to the minister: ``I have not had any response 
to my letter of September 30''. That is not all that uncommon. 
``One statement your assistant made struck me as being quite 
absurd. I asked her what Canada's position would be vis-à-vis 
the Czech republic if the Czechs refused to take back Mr. Kral. 
In other words, how does Canada retaliate? Your assistant said 
that she could not answer that and that I should call the foreign 
office. I said surely your department is in touch with the foreign 
office on this matter, and she indicated that she could not answer 
this''.
<P>
	By the way, she said in her letter: ``Mr. Kral's GST refund 
cheque came back to our address recently. Is he allowed to 
receive this while he is in prison?''. Just ask this group across 
the way.
<P>
	There is a letter here from the minister which reads: ``The 
Hon. Sergio Marchi, Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, 
asked that I respond to your transmissions of September and 
October. While we appreciate your interest in this matter 
Canada's Privacy Act prohibits us from releasing information 
on an individual's case without his or her written consent''.
<P>
	Can you imagine good old Kral saying ``Give it to them. They 
want to move me out of the country''.
<P>
	The letter continued: ``As a result I am unable to discuss the 
details of Mr. Kral's situation, other than to confirm that he was 
made the subject of a deportation order some time ago and to say 
that the order will be carried out in due course''.
<P>
	That is a load of hogwash because it has not been done.
<P>
	I wrote to the chief crown prosecutor because I was trying to 
find out what Kral was all about, to see how bad he was. I wrote 
to her, Wendy Young, and I said that I found it incomprehensible 
that an MP is not allowed access to the public decisions of our 
country's courts and that neither her office nor the RCMP nor 
the Matsqui police would provide the criminal record of Mr. 
Kral.
<P>
	The answer was predictable: ``The disclosure of criminal 
records is governed by either the provincial Freedom of 
Information and Protection of Privacy Act or the federal Privacy 
Act which limit the circumstances in which such records can be 
disclosed and provided for the method of making requests for 
such information. It would be a breach of law to furnish you with 
Mr. Kral's record''.
<P>
	It is really interesting how on the one hand they come up with 
all of these nice rules to remove people but in the final analysis 
they are not going to do it.
<P>
	I got a letter from the manager of hearings and appeals. I do 
not think this was the guy who was promoted, since he bungled 
up José Mendoza's problem, but it is one of them. The letter 
read: ``As you have observed, Mr. Kral was ordered deported on 
March 29, 1994 as a consequence of a lengthy criminal record. 
We intend to remove Mr. Kral to the country of his formal 
nationality as soon as possible. However'', and this is the 
critical aspect, ``he must first obtain a travel document''. We 
will not get that because Czechoslovakia will say: ``Why do we 
want this guy back? You keep him''. All of the frills up front on 
this thing are just rhetoric. You know it will not work and the 
minister knows it will not work.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	Let us talk about Inthavong Bounjan. This fellow came to us 
from Thailand at the age of 14 as a landed immigrant. He has not 
had a bad record, mischief, theft under $1,000, assault with a 
weapon, failure to comply with a disposition as a young 
offender. I believe he is 23 now.
<P>
	Good old Inthavong at a shopping centre beat young Kirby 
Martin over the head with a bat in front of 100 witnesses until he 
was laying on the street.
<P>
	This guy was supposed to get five years. He got out in less 
than three. He is on the streets. He had a deportation order. The 
deportation was appealed. The appeal took two years. He has 
been on the streets all that time. To protect him from getting 
deported his legal aid lawyer went to the refugee board. The 
incompetence on that board gave him refugee status in 50 
minutes. That was used in his favour in the deportation appeal. 
We asked for a fast decision on it, but of course it has not come 
yet.
<P>
	He must be a good guy. He was actually chumming, he said, 
with the countess group. The countess group is a gang. It is not a 
group. When asked what he does with the countess group at 
night he said they sit around, talk and have coffee. I would say in 
someone else's house after they broke down the door and ripped 
the furniture apart.
<P>
	This is what you are keeping in this country. You are not going 
to remove these people. That is the fallacy in Bill C-44. You 
know it and we know it. All of the stuff in between counts for 
nothing.

<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
yesterday when you were in the Chair it was incumbent upon 
me to explain due process. Today I guess it is going to be 
incumbent upon me to explain some of the amendments to the 
bill.
<P>
	The hon. member opposite talked about unescorted day passes 
in his speech. With the greatest of respect I would like to let him 
know that there is an amendment, which I presume he has read, 
preventing the release on day parole and unescorted temporary 
absences of inmates who have been ordered removed and who 
are the subject of an immigration detention order pending their 
removal from Canada. That seeks to minimize the risk of escape 
so as to ensure that criminals will be deported at the end of their 
sentences.
<P>
	There are a number of things that the member has brought to 
our attention here this morning that have been problems in a 
very small but nonetheless serious number of cases. It is a big 
country guys.
<P>
	At this point I can only say to the empty barrels on the other 
side that what they really need to do is read the bill. I find it very 
interesting that the hon. member who just spoke did not know 
about the amendment to clause 20 which changes the day parole 
problem.
<P>
	I wonder if thus there are other things in the bill that the hon. 
member has not read and therefore does not support. Certainly 
his party is not supporting this. I would like to echo the words of 
the member for Guelph-Wellington who said she was pretty 
sure that there were members on the other side who had 
constituents who would support this bill very strongly.
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member a question and he 
certainly will have a chance to respond. I wonder if the hon. 
member has read the 11 amendments which came through at 
report stage and if he has read the bill.
<P>
<B>(1225 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Madam Speaker, I have 
read the bill. I suspect I know it as well or better than the hon. 
member. I suspect I have a little more experience at some of the 
creepy crawlers in our country.
<P>
	What is wrong here is that if they will not enforce these laws 
then nothing matters. I would like one of these people across the 
way to address whether they will have travel documents or 
travel warrants to remove these people because everything else 
in between is really a bit of waste now, is it not, if we cannot get 
them out. They know darn well they cannot remove them.
<P>
	We know with the experience of the front row here already, 
with the failures in the fisheries department, with the failures of 
the human resources programs, with the failures of public works 
building the $3 million tunnel down the road, all of these 
failures here, there is no exception with the minister of 
immigration. This is rhetoric. People out there who believe that 
they are actually doing good in immigration are getting the  
blindfolds put over them again. This is rhetoric. You not have 
one clue how to effect deportation-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Order, order. I am sorry 
to interrupt the hon. member. Would you please address your 
comments through the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Madam Speaker, through 
you to them, in three years from now when the hon. member for 
Calgary Northeast is immigration minister we will work out the 
flaws in Bill C-44. We will have to balance the books too but 
that is okay. We will have to fix up the problems in HRD that 
they have now blown out the door. However, the important part 
here is we will effect deportation, they will not. Regardless of all 
the rules they put in they will not effect deportation, mark our 
words and read our lips.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to make a preliminary comment. We are told that 
there are several Canadian criminals abroad, especially in Latin 
America, an area that I know quite well. There are Canadians in 
jail in Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Venezuela, Costa Rica. Would 
you like them to be treated the way you want to treat foreigners 
in this country? I do not think so. However, what I observed in 
Latin America is that all Canadians are welcome. The fact that a 
small number of Canadians are occasionally involved in drug 
trafficking does not reflect on the way other Canadians are 
treated. People make a clear distinction between this small 
group and the vast majority of Canadians.
<P>
	Here is my question: Yesterday, the hon. member, who is 
immigration and citizenship critic for the Reform Party, said 
that we must reduce immigration to solve this problem. By 
extrapolating this simplistic reasoning, we could say that if we 
did away completely with immigration we would no longer have 
any foreign criminals. However, it is impossible.
<P>
	How do you explain that last year you were asking for a 
maximum of 250,000 immigrants, this year 200,000 and in the 
future even less? Considering that the birth rate is very low in 
Canada, what are you going to do? How are you going to cope 
with an aging population, a very serious situation in Canada and 
all industrialized countries? How are you going to fulfil 
Canada's international obligations in the area of political 
asylum? Canada signed a convention. Do you think that we can 
refuse to receive refugees in order to do away with immigration 
or criminality problems? How are you going to solve the 
problem? Are you going to keep on lowering the number of 
immigrants you accept, while the birth rate continues to go 
down? In the next century, our population will start to decrease 
if we no longer accept immigrants. How are you going to solve 
that problem?

<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Madam Speaker, it is ironic 
that comes from one of the separatists from Quebec. I am not too 
sure whether the proportionate share of immigrants and refugees 
is quite received in Quebec as it is elsewhere.
<P>
	We said that we should reduce the level of immigration. We 
acknowledge there is a need for immigration but we do not 
acknowledge the high levels. We acknowledge the need for 
genuine refugees on a humanitarian basis. That is not what this 
discussion is about.
<P>
	Regardless of how many people come into the country, a 
proportion will be criminals. We acknowledge that. We know 
that of the citizens within this country a certain number are 
criminals. There is no question about that. We have to 
acknowledge that those people coming in who do not abide by 
the laws, who terrorize innocent victims in Canada should not be 
allowed to stay. That is what C-44 is trying to address.
<P>
	My whole theme on this discussion is the fact that we cannot 
necessarily get travel warrants to remove them from the country. 
The minister told me that yesterday. Therefore what is being put 
into C-44 and what is actually going to be achieved at the end 
are two different things.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I did read the hon. 
member's lips when he was debating this topic. I heard from 
those lips the words ``these animals''.
<P>
	I have been in this House for 11 years now but I have not heard 
any member refer to a group of people as ``these animals''. They 
may have committed crimes, some very serious, but they are 
still people. They are still human beings. They are not animals.
<P>
	I did not raise this on a point of order because I think the table 
will find it is parliamentary and acceptable language. However I 
am giving the hon. member this opportunity to withdraw the 
words ``these animals''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Madam Speaker, my 
reference was clearly to some of these people trafficking times 
four in heroine, robbery, assault, sexual assault, rape. I cannot 
refer in a kind way to a person like José Salinas Mendoza who 
had 12 criminal convictions, one a sexual assault of a young lady 
and another sexual assault charge where he got out of the 
country, in the trunk of his car I presume. I cannot refer to that 
person as a nice individual. How would the hon. member like me 
to refer to him?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> People.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> I do not think the victims 
would agree.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Maria Minna (Beaches-Woodbine, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am most pleased to speak on Bill C-44 now before the 
House.
<P>
	All of us have heard countless stories of successful 
immigrants to Canada. As representatives of the Canadian 
people we know in each of our ridings the stories of people who 
have chosen Canada.
<P>
	Even before there was a Canada, waves of immigrants, many 
penniless, swept ashore to scratch out a life in this new country 
full of promise. Thousands were escaping famine, grinding 
poverty, religious persecution and other horrors too awful to 
mention.
<P>
	Today despite the progress the world has made, immigrants 
still wash up on our shores escaping the same horrors, the same 
persecutions and the same unimaginable poverty. Some still 
climb blinking and stunned into the sunshine of a Canadian 
dockside after a perilous trip by ship. More step fearfully off an 
aircraft at one of our airports.
<P>
	However, each immigrant has the same questions and the 
same fears as the immigrants of 150, 200 or even 50 years ago 
had: Will this country allow me to live here? Can I work to make 
a better life for my family in this place?
<P>
<B>(1235 ) </B>
<P>
	This bill marks a progression in the approach of this 
government and this country in the respect we accord people 
from around the world who come here. It also marks a step 
forward in the way we see Canada's role as a protector of 
individuals who are refugees from oppression.
<P>
	The reasons for this improvement are numerous. They are not 
comforting reasons at first glance, but when we take away the 
rhetoric and the posturing the reasons for this progression are 
abundantly clear.
<P>
	Since the very first immigrants came to this country a very 
minuscule number of newcomers have entered this country as 
criminals, liars, thieves, murderers and opportunists who seek 
to prey upon newcomers and citizens alike. One would suspect 
that even the earliest Vikings who settled and explored this land 
had their share of people with less than honourable intentions.
<P>
	It is an immutable law of the human condition that there has 
always been and will always be those who are bad people. It is 
also an immutable law of the human condition that the vast 
majority of immigrants to any country are hard working, honest, 
loyal and very grateful to the country that opened its doors and 
its heart to the newcomer.
<P>
	This is true of Canada. It has been true in the past. It will 
continue to be true in the future. However, we have before us a 
collection of amendments to the Immigration Act that seek to 
change Canada's response to this law of the human condition.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9261"> 9261 </A></B>
<P>
	Bill C-44 may become very popular with the racist element 
of this country. Some may point to this bill as proof that all 
immigrants are crooks and dangerous to this country but they 
are wrong.
<P>
	Bill C-44 is designed to honour the hard working immigrants 
to this country. Immigrant gangs and criminals grab more 
headlines and take up more air time than stories about 
immigrants who have contributed to the growth of Canada. As a 
result, the public has a false perception of our immigrant 
community.
<P>
	Statistically, new Canadians are less of a burden on the public 
purse than natural born Canadians. They are less likely to 
commit crimes, steal, cheat, rob and murder, and they only want 
that which our own forebears wanted when they came to Canada: 
to be left in peace to make their way in this land of opportunity.
<P>
	Bill C-44 promises to play a pivotal role in removing the 
minuscule percentage of the immigrant population who seek to 
steal, deal, intimidate, extort, rob, injure and even murder.
<P>
	This may seem like using the heavy hand of legislation to 
solve a small problem, putting out a candle on a birthday cake 
with a fire hose if you like. However, the confidence of the 
Canadian people in our immigration system has been dealt many 
sensational and disheartening blows through the evil actions of a 
very few. Therefore, we will make it easier for all of us, 
descendants of immigrants, old immigrants and relative 
newcomers, to remove the bad apples from our country. We will 
do this with the provisions of Bill C-44 and the Immigration 
Act.
<P>
	These conditions will demonstrate to Canadians that we will 
act vigorously with the full force of the law. The naysayers will 
have no response. Canadians of all walks of life will continue to 
respond generously to newcomers, secure in the knowledge that 
the new Canadian down the street, across the hall or in the next 
seat on the bus is a person worthy of the privilege of Canadian 
citizenship.
<P>
	Canadians have demanded that their immigration and refugee 
systems not only be fair and effective but efficient and well 
managed. Bill C-44 represents a careful, reasoned approach to 
the principles of fairness and tolerance with the balance of the 
respect of the rule of law.
<P>
	Bill C-44 closes loopholes that unscrupulous people have 
exploited. It gives the enforcement authorities the means to 
remove the thugs who would abuse our society, abuse our people 
and dishonour the name of new Canadians everywhere.
<P>
	At the same time, we will honour the millions of new 
Canadians who over the years have built this country. We will 
honour our ancestors by forcing those who choose lawlessness 
to pay for their actions.
<P>
	We will not open our doors and hearts to those who have little 
interest in contributing to our country's society in a positive 
way. We will not open our doors and  hearts to those who seek to 
manipulate and pervert the refugee system.
<P>
	We will do this because our newcomers deserve no less from 
us than that we as people of Canada expect of ourselves.
<P>
<B>(1240 ) </B>
<P>
	Canada does not tolerate lawlessness. That is our collective 
word. We will demonstrate that our sentiment about freedom, 
rights, tolerance, openness, and generosity are not merely words 
but ironclad pillars of character.
<P>
	In closing, Bill C-44 is not about punishment. It is about 
standing by our word. It is about delivering on the promises that 
every Canadian and every immigrant to this country has ever 
made. We owe our new Canadians no less than we owe 
ourselves.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened very carefully to the speech of my colleague. I agree 
with several paragraphs in that speech, but the problem is in 
reconciling a compassionate speech with a bill that is not 
compassionate at all. It is very regressive and unworthy of a 
democratic society such as Canada.
<P>
	Unfortunately, my colleague did not take part in the meetings 
of the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration. She 
would have been able to hear testimonies of people coming from 
Ontario, Quebec or other provinces. They all criticized this bill 
very severely. Some even asked for its withdrawal; they were 
lawyers, legal experts and even members of the Canadian 
Ethnocultural Council, that is of ethnic communities in Canada. 
Not a single ethnic community came to say: Yes, we agree with 
this bill; go ahead with it. They all said no or showed a great 
reluctance toward the bill.
<P>
	For instance, someone who has lived here for 40 or 50 years, 
who is still a permanent resident and has never become a 
Canadian citizen will be able to be deported because they have 
committed a crime punishable by 10 years or more. In fact, they 
were only sentenced to two years in prison or a fine or a 
probation period. The bill will allow these inequities.
<P>
	There are people who came to Canada at a very young age, 
children who never became Canadian citizens for whatever 
reason. They could be deported, yet they are the product of this 
society. They were educated here. They were influenced by this 
society.
<P>
	These inequities will be allowed if this bill is passed. I would 
ask my colleague to give us her response on that.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Minna:</B> Madam Speaker, it is important to point out that 
the bill is not dealing with people who have come to this country 
and have abided by the laws of this country, have respected the 
laws of this country and have tried to become productive 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9262"> 9262 </A></B>
<P>
citizens of this country. It is talking to people who have tried to 
subvert the system in one way or another.
<P>
	The hon. member mentioned an area on which I must say I 
agree and on which I have some concerns myself, that is, those 
individuals who have come here at a young age. To me, they are 
the product of our society and that is an area we must address 
and look at. That is an area I have had some difficulty with for 
some time because young people who come here at the age of 
four or five or whatever the age-I came here myself at the age 
of nine-once they have been here for 20 or 30 years they are 
products of our society. We need to take responsibility for that.
<P>
	Apart from that, the rest deals very effectively with the 
problem that we have with people who come in and out of this 
country. Some of them have been deported and have come back 
in again and we do not even know they are in the country. We 
need to address those kinds of problems and make sure that once 
and for all individuals who refuse to abide by Canadian laws and 
who do not respect Canadian citizens are not allowed to stay in 
this country.
<P>
	I do not see that as being draconian or unacceptable. It is the 
normal way any society should proceed. It should make sure that 
those immigrants who come into this country who are law 
abiding, who come here to improve their lives and to participate 
in and contribute to Canadian society are freed from the 
oppression sometimes that these individuals put on them in their 
own communities.
<P>
	The bill speaks very clearly to this issue. It is important to 
make sure that when a country has open doors and open hearts 
the way we have that we also deal with the reality of some of the 
bad apples that do come in. They are a very small minority. I do 
not ascribe what the Reform Party has been doing over the past 
six months where we seem to be looking at the immigrant 
criminal of the day every single day. We need to deal with the 
issue, so let us get on with it.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to address this bill.
<P>
	I find myself in an interesting position on this bill as I am 
Canadian born and raised and obviously a white male. I think 
one would say I am probably not the individual who might be the 
most experienced on an immigration bill, even though members 
of my own family came to this country as immigrants and settled 
in a rural location. They went through bankruptcy, drought and 
picked themselves up and success ensued.
<P>
	Since I recognize my own inadequacies in this area and stand 
here as someone who was raised in Canada and has not 
experienced the hardship of immigration, I asked immigrants 
for their advice and help so I could better understand their 
circumstances.
<P>
	Since I have been in Ottawa the immigrants I have been able 
to query the best and get the best advice from are the taxi 
drivers. I would like to title my little discourse here today as, 
``taxi tales''. I have talked with taxi drivers from a number of 
different countries such as Lebanon, Iran and Afghanistan in the 
last week.
<P>
	The member opposite says they are Canadians. They are 
recent, hard working immigrants. They are individuals whose 
opinions I value, although it is possible the member opposite 
would not.
<P>
	I speak with them and ask their opinion of Canada as a place 
for immigrants to come. They speak glowingly of Canada. They 
speak of Canada as a place they value that gives them 
opportunities they did not have in their home countries. They 
speak of opportunities to work hard to advance and improve 
their lot, and give their children the opportunity to improve and 
use the educational opportunities Canada provides.
<P>
	As recent immigrants to Canada, they tell me there are 
problems with our immigration system. I would ask members 
opposite to listen to what they say and not to what I say. As I 
have already said, I have not had those personal experiences.
<P>
	A young man from Iran told me he came to Canada to work 
and he immediately looked for a job. He was told not to worry 
too much about finding a job because he could collect welfare. 
He said he did not come to Canada to collect welfare, but to find 
work immediately. He thinks Canadians are very foolish to very 
visibly offer the opportunity to go on welfare as soon as 
immigrants arrive here.
<P>
	A fellow from Afghanistan who left a country in turmoil told 
me immigration must be acceptable to Canadians or 
immigration will fail. He made comments about those 
individuals breaking the rules who Bill C-44 is trying to go 
after.
<P>
	Yesterday the minister said Canada wants to keep the porch 
light on. I agree. The porch light for immigration should be 
glowing bright and attracting immigrants to our country.
<P>
	Bill C-44 is going after a very small group of people in our 
society. It is going after those individuals who have broken the 
rules.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	Reformers say over and over again the whole premise of Bill 
C-44 will break down unless we have the ability to hold back 
those individuals coming in who are known criminals, or 
remove them if they have committed crimes. I am trying to say 
in the most reasoned way I can if we cannot deport it is no good 
to have a deportation order. If we cannot send those individuals 
<P>

<P>
home there is no point in putting a flag up and saying 
deportation will happen.
<P>
	Bill C-44 says a person who commits a serious crime will be 
deported after he or she is sentenced, but I say good luck. I have 
watched the task force the minister set up for this very purpose. 
He identified some 1,800 serious criminals in Canada who had 
deportation orders and his task force was designed to pursue and 
remove those individuals. The information I have is that 30 
people have been deported from Canada through that task force. 
These criminals have not done insignificant crimes; they have 
committed major crimes.
<P>
	Who do they seem to be able to deport? In my own riding a 
woman from the Philippines came here and married a Canadian 
farmer. Before she was able to process her documents to become 
a Canadian the farmer died. Because she did not understand and 
could not speak English very well she went over the time limit to 
report her husband's demise. She was deported. A 
self-supporting, law abiding, clean living, perfect immigrant 
was sent down the road back home. What do we do with those 
individuals who slit people from stem to stern? We cannot get a 
travel document so we keep them in Canada. Bill C-44 does not 
do what it was intended to do.
<P>
	We say literature that could be used by individuals trying to 
stay in Canada inappropriately will be intercepted at the border. 
I say fat chance. One of my confreres went to the border not so 
long ago and sat with the border guards. He had not sat there 
very long when he saw seven transport trucks go by without 
stopping at the border. He asked why they had not stopped and 
was told the guards take down their licence numbers and put 
them into the computer because they do not have the people to 
enforce Canadian laws. So now we are going to intercept 
literature at the border and stop these inappropriate passports. I 
say fat chance.
<P>
	We are going to prevent day parole. I listened to a member 
opposite say day parole for criminals would no longer be 
possible. That is a good step, but at the end of their sentences 
what do we do with them? We put them back out on the street. 
We cannot get travel documents.
<P>
	Has anybody figured out we should be paying more attention 
to getting travel documents for deported criminals rather than 
looking for other rules to put another bunch of deportees on our 
streets? We line them up one after another and end up with 
thousands more who cannot be deported. Does anybody think it 
would be more sensible to find travel documents? It is a simple 
solution. We have had lots of discussion on this topic and I do 
not think it is being heard.
<P>
	I want to turn the focus a little. Reformers say it will not work 
if we continue to have an overflow of these individuals who 
should be deported. We think there should be a mechanism to 
actually deport if they are deportable. But at the other end with 
the open tap, what are we doing in our country? I want to switch 
focus by saying we are bringing in another group of individuals 
as  immigrants and refugees who I do not think should come to 
Canada.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	One example comes from a recent CBC radio article and 
involves a lesbian woman from Costa Rica whose sole reason for 
admission to Canada is the fact she is gay. I am sure Canadians 
sitting in lines waiting for social services would be interested in 
knowing that is one of the criteria that allows an individual to 
come into Canada as a refugee. She was being discriminated 
against in Costa Rica because of her sexual preference.
<P>
	Another example is an HIV positive Polish refugee who is 25 
years of age. His reason for admission into Canada was that he 
was being persecuted because of this HIV positive status. He 
was present in Canada for three years and living in Montreal on 
welfare of $670 per month. He could not work initially because 
his English was not up to par. His health now prevents him from 
working and he has no incentive to work. He does not feel good 
enough. His drug costs of $200 per month are free because he is 
on welfare.
<P>
	I went over the transcript of why he came to Canada. ``So you 
came here mostly to get proper medical care?'' ``Yes, quite 
right. In Canada they have proper medicine available ''. ``Do 
you think a lot of Canadians or many Canadians hearing your 
story might be angry? What would you say to Canadians who 
would say, `Why should we have to pay through our taxes for the 
medical care of all the people in the world who are HIV positive 
and come from countries where the health system is not 
prepared or equipped to deal with these cases?'' The answer 
was: ``It is a serious problem''.
<P>
	I thought this must be a very unusual case. Surely we cannot 
be accepting HIV positive people into Canada with that as the 
criteria. Surely that cannot not be true. I found out that one 
refugee advocate has had 30 cases exactly like this in the last 
two years. Three quarters of them were allowed to come into 
Canada.
<P>
	What do the Canadian people think when they line up for our 
social services? What do the students in Canada think when they 
line up and cannot get into university? What do the individuals 
here think who have HIV positive problems and line up unable to 
access services? Do they think we should take on all the 
problems of the other countries of this world?
<P>
	The member for Calgary Northeast put a bill in front of this 
House not so long ago suggesting HIV positivity would disallow 
admission to Canada along with tuberculosis, parasites, leprosy 
and the other reasons we say people should not come into 
Canada if it would add to our Canadian medical burdens. What 
happened to that bill? It was shot down in flames by the two 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9264"> 9264 </A></B>
<P>
other parties in this House who told their constituents we have 
lots of resources in Canada so we can accept these people.
<P>
	I am sorry. We should look after our own people first. As our 
resources shrink and we cannot look after our own, these 
individuals opposite will have to face that music.
<P>
	Immigration is good for Canada when immigrants are skilled 
and able to converse and fit into our Canadian job situation 
quickly. When refugees come along we treat them with all the 
compassion we can muster.
<P>
<B>(1300 ) </B>
<P>
	Numbers must be flexible. Immigration cannot be static. 
When our economy does wonderfully well, the immigration 
numbers should rise. When our economy is struggling, 
immigration numbers should fall. Members who ask the taxi 
drivers who are recent immigrants those questions will hear 
them say: ``I agree''. I challenge them to do that. Talk to the 
recent immigrants. Ask them that question.
<P>
	Members of the Bloc say they disagree with this bill on the 
other end of the scale and I say we have a great lesson to learn 
from those Quebec members.
<P>
	Quebec has taken immigration and put it into a much clearer 
frame of reference than the rest of Canada has. Quebec has said 
that immigration must have specific goals for Quebec. 
Interestingly enough Quebec accepts fewer immigrants than the 
rest of Canada does. It puts criteria on those immigrants for 
language ability, for employability and those criteria allow them 
to be far more flexible as they look at Bill C-44.
<P>
	I admire what those members have done. They are right in 
what they have done, 100 per cent on. Not everything that Bloc 
members say do I agree with, but the reason they are able to say 
this I agree with.
<P>
	I repeat that immigration is important for Canada. It is a 
significant improvement for Canada. Bill C-44 starts out in all 
the right directions. However it misses the mark completely 
because we cannot remove those individuals who have done 
wrong here. We cannot send them where they belong. It is for 
that reason, and I cannot say it strongly enough, that Reformers 
will not support this.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
was interested in the comments of my colleague just a minute 
ago. I want just by way of comment to expand on them a bit and 
then get his response.
<P>
	It is rather interesting that in the last election in the wisdom of 
the voters of Ontario they elected 98 out of 99 members to this 
House from the Liberal Party, but I wonder who really speaks for 
the people of Ontario. The reason I ask that question and wonder 
why this issue has remained dormant as far as the follow-up 
from the members from Ontario is that with respect to what my 
colleague was just saying, there is federal funding to help with 
immigration settlement.
<P>
	I am working from documents provided by the government 
which show that $90 million goes to the province of Quebec to 
help with the settlement of immigrants. There is $110 million 
that goes to the province of Ontario.
<P>
	It is relevant to note the proposed immigration levels for 
1995. In Canada the total immigrant and refugee intake is 
proposed to be 190,000 to 215,000 of which Quebec is only 
going to take 40,000. That is relatively interesting because if I 
divide 40,000 into 200,000 for a percentage it comes out to 
significantly smaller than the number that were accepted.
<P>
	With respect to immigration by metro area in 1993, Toronto 
alone accepted 28.3 per cent of the immigrants coming to 
Canada which equalled 71,964 people. Why there are no Liberal 
members speaking up on this particular issue is beyond my 
comprehension. Clearly the Reform Party has to do it for them.
<P>
<B>(1305 ) </B>
<P>
	I do not really understand how they can take the figure from 
1993 of Toronto accepting 71,964 immigrants and Quebec only 
accepting 40,000 in 1995, not quite half, and Quebec is 
guaranteed $90 million for the settlement of immigrants, 
whereas the entire province of Ontario only gets $110 million. 
There is obviously a lack of voice for the people of Ontario in 
this Chamber, particularly in the area respecting immigration.
<P>
	I wonder if my colleague has any further comments he would 
like to give on this.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> Madam Speaker, it would be very easy to 
use this issue and say we could somehow be divisive about it.
<P>
	I simply say that I believe those individuals from Quebec who 
are making the decisions are on the right track. We are talking 
now that there must be some benefit both to the immigrants and 
to Canada in immigration. In my view Quebecers have figured 
out that there is a balance. They have looked very specifically at 
what their needs are and I believe they are trying to meet those 
needs.
<P>
	I would encourage those members opposite to think very 
carefully about that. Is there in fact an imbalance? I will leave 
that up to the colleagues on either side to think of very carefully.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleague for his remarks. He made a few references to 
the situation in Quebec. We are very proud, in Quebec, of having 
a Department of Cultural Communities and Immigration, 
something you will not find anywhere else in Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9265"> 9265 </A></B>
<P>
	I do not understand why there is no department of 
immigration in Ontario, with the most immigrants, or in British 
Columbia, the province with the most immigrants in Canada 
on a per capita basis.
<P>
	Quebec signed agreements with the federal government and 
receives transfer payments, because Quebec subsidizes COFIs, 
which offer French courses to new arrivals and help them get 
settled, find work, housing and so on.
<P>
	The federal government and the provinces share jurisdiction 
for immigration. But English speaking provinces are at fault for 
never taking on any responsibility for immigration. Why? The 
constitution is very clear on this point: the jurisdiction is shared.
<P>
	Quebec is expecting 40,000 immigrants this year; 42,000, 
next year; 44,000 the following year, because we have the power 
to decide on and set our own immigration quotas. I invite people 
from the English speaking provinces to put pressure on their 
individual governments to sign agreements with the federal 
government. This way, some of the problems can be resolved.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Madam Speaker, Quebec's approach is the answer 
for everyone in Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, like many of us here on all sides of the House I 
was not born in Canada, I am an immigrant myself. Many of us 
here are immigrants. I think it would be fair to say that 
immigration has provided Canada with many blessings.
<P>
	The collective contribution of immigrants to Canada has been 
immense. We have built our farms, we have built our cities, we 
have built our quality of life, we have built our railways on the 
work, on the toil and on the immense sacrifices of the immigrant 
community.
<P>
	We have to recognize that immigration has been to us a great 
benefit, a blessing. At the same time, we must live in the reality 
of our world today. I was interested in listening to my colleague 
from Bourassa. I must commend him for the way in which he 
approached the debate in measured tones and a constructive 
spirit. I appreciate this.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	The hon. member says that we are going far too far, that the 
government's legislation is very regressive. On the other side of 
the House colleagues from the Reform Party are saying that the 
government has not gone far enough, that this legislation will 
not serve its purpose.
<P>
	We stand in the middle of what may be two positions at either 
end of the spectrum. We say that today the reality in Canada is 
that a tiny minority-I think we all agree it is a tiny 
minority-abuses the system.
<P>
	What we want to do is to say that if you are a legitimate 
immigrant, if you live by the rule book, by the law of Canada, 
then you are most welcome. The hospitality we give will be the 
hospitality that you have always received here. At the same 
time, if you breach our laws, if you use unfair or criminal 
methods to jump the queue, if you use fraudulent means to come 
into Canada or if when you are here you abuse the system in such 
a way that you prejudice the rest of us new and older immigrants 
and natural born Canadians, then there is a price to pay.
<P>
	What this bill says in effect is that we will reward and will 
recognize the legitimate, the fair immigrant. At the same time 
we will say to the immigrants who take advantage of our system 
that enough is enough and they cannot do it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Then he will just say: ``I am a refugee''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln:</B> I gave you your chance to speak. Give me my 
chance to speak. Be courteous at least.
<P>
	This bill wants to give certain powers to the immigration 
ministry and the immigration minister so that certain cases of 
extreme abuse are rectified.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The legislation will give the minister the power to intervene 
to prevent appeals against deportation where the deportee has 
been convicted of serious criminal offenses. The legislation will 
give us the authority to interrupt the process of Canadian 
citizenship acquisition when the applicant's claims are being 
investigated. This will make it possible to declare non eligible 
for immigration the persons convicted on summary proceedings 
in Canada or abroad.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We propose to remove the right of appeal for all persons 
involved in crimes of violence, involved in crimes involving 
weapons, sexual assault or drug offences, those crimes that have 
been punishable with sentences of 10 years or more. I do not 
think this is extreme. I do not think this is abusive.
<P>
	I find it sad. I must join my seatmate here to say that I found it 
sad, that I felt the member for Fraser Valley West lowered the 
standard of debate in referring to animals, creeps and creepy 
crawlers.
<P>
	His colleague from Macleod gave him a very good example. 
We can debate. We can differ. At the same time, we can use 
language that is measured in tone, that is constructive, that 
makes a point. You convince people far more readily that way 
than by using abusive terms such as animals, creeps and creepy 
crawlers. I do not think this kind of language helps the debate. It 
certainly does not raise the standard and it convinces very few 
people.
<P>
<B></B>

<HR>

<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	My hon. colleague from Kootenay East raised the question of 
statistics between Quebec and Ontario, whether it should be $90 
million to Quebec, $110 million to Ontario, and dividing and 
adding and multiplying. When I listened to him in this debate I 
thought to myself what about human beings? What about 
people? People are not statistics. Human beings are not 
statistics.
<P>
	We should all remember back to our First Nations, to our 
aboriginal people who have been there for thousands of years. 
All of us, regardless of our political stripes, regardless of the 
colour of our skin, regardless of our faith, regardless of whether 
we are young or old, are all immigrants. They have accepted us 
here, sometimes not willingly, but today with great calm, with 
great patience and fortitude.
<P>
	We have to remember that all of us, whether we were born 
here or not, were immigrants too. We have to give a chance to 
the others who want to join with us. At the same time that we 
give them a chance we want to make it a fair game and say 
``Those of you who want to make a contribution, those of you 
who want to be true Canadians, we will help you, we will support 
you, we will give you all the blessing of our hospitality and 
welcome. At the same time, those of you who do not want to play 
the game, who want to abuse the system, there will be a law, a 
fair law to use in cases of abuse''. That is the reason I support 
Bill C-44.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
continuing with the parliamentary secretary in this debate I 
believe the issue is for the people, particularly of the Toronto 
area, who presently under the current socialist government in 
Ontario have seen their taxes increase very significantly. As 
revenue critic we are frequently bringing up the issue that 
probably this federal government is going to be increasing 
taxes. They see their municipal taxes increasing and then at the 
same time they see that another jurisdiction, the Quebec 
jurisdiction as opposed to the Ontario jurisdiction, is given 
approximately twice as much money for the immigration 
settlement.
<P>
	I wonder if the parliamentary secretary might not agree that if 
we are attempting to create an environment in which people are 
not going to be hostile toward legitimate immigrants coming 
in-I agree with him, building Canada but I cannot help but 
wonder when there is this imbalance that the Liberal members 
from Ontario and particularly Toronto are not raising this 
particular issue. Would he not agree that with this imbalance, 
where Quebec has taken its affairs into its own hands and has 
said that it can afford to assimilate 40,000 people, whereas the 
federal government seems to be imposing much larger numbers 
on Ontario, particularly on the Toronto area, and the practical 
fact that people are seeing their dollars going further and further 
awry, that this is part of the reason for the  hostility, some of it 
founded, some of it unfounded, nonetheless this does contribute 
to the problem.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln:</B> Madam Speaker, the answer is very clear and 
simple. Are Quebecers agreed under flexible federalism, under 
federalism that works, that shows that it works, to share 
immigration duties with Canada? It provides all kinds of 
services to new immigrants that the federal government 
transfers money for.
<P>
	It is perfectly legitimate. If tomorrow Ontario chose to do the 
same and take over a lot of these duties that would be worth 
compensation.
<P>
<B>(1320 ) </B>
<P>
	I think this is really fair under the system of federalism. If 
there is one example that is so clear of federalism at its best, it is 
the immigration system which is in use in Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I wanted to address the matter to this member 
regarding the difference between Quebec and the rest of Canada 
as far as immigration policy is concerned.
<P>
	Reform has been saying for some time that all we want is a 
similar type of agreement for the rest of Canada as what Quebec 
now enjoys and really prospers under. That is the only thing we 
are saying. Quebec's numbers and levels are very satisfactory 
given the economic situation of the country. Quebec also cited 
for low immigration levels, the reason it had decided to go lower 
on its immigration levels, was economic problems within the 
province.
<P>
	Does the member not think there is an economic problem in 
the rest of Canada too when he sort of favours the view that 
Quebec has taken on this immigration debate? It really is not 
part of the debate. It already has the matter settled in its own 
province.
<P>
	The member basically accuses Reform of belittling the 
parliamentary process by so-called name calling and the like in 
the immigration debate. The Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Citizenship and Immigration has been much more 
cutting in her viewpoints of Reform and the position we have 
had. This parliamentary secretary has said absolutely nothing.
<P>
	I would suggest the parliamentary secretary look to his own 
party and perhaps attempt to assist it in being more diplomatic in 
its viewpoints.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln:</B> Madam Speaker, very briefly, I have never liked 
to wear Paris hats, Quebec versus Ontario, Ontario versus 
British Columbia. I have never been that kind of person. I am a 
Canadian. I believe in the Canadian state.
<P>
	At the same time, fair is fair. The immigration system as it is 
today allows all the provinces to enter the same kinds of 
agreements that Quebec has entered.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9267"> 9267 </A></B>
<P>
	There are negotiations going on now with other provinces. 
If a province wants to take over the immigration there are 
negotiations going on now with the provinces. To introduce 
Quebec and this other debate is not very constructive. I will not 
get into this game at all.
<P>
	It is important to make sure that people always come first, 
regardless of whether they immigrate to British Columbia, 
Newfoundland, Quebec or Ontario.
<P>
	With regard to the tone of the debate I will mention what I 
heard today. I heard one member speak about animals, about 
creeps, about creepy crawlers and I said that does not raise the 
tone of the debate. That detracts from it and that really makes it 
very unfortunate because it does not convince anybody. That is 
all I said.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to thank the member for Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis 
for his speech. I think it was a good speech, although I do not 
agree with its substance. As he stated, he is a Canadian federalist 
and I am a sovereignist.
<P>
	Nevertheless, I should like to pay tribute to the English 
speaking community in Quebec for its interest, support and 
financial contributions in the areas of immigration and refugees, 
especially the Jewish community, which is heavily involved 
with refugee matters in Montreal and other cities. Having 
experienced hardship, I believe they never forget it, just as I 
never lose sight of my immigrant origin.
<P>
	But I would put the following matter to my fellow member. It 
is difficult to accept that in regard to international mail, for 
example, an immigration officer may open and seize 
international mail if he believes that it may contain identity 
papers or passports which might be used for fraudulent 
purposes.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	To my knowledge, no democratic country in the world gives 
civil servants the authority to open mail. It is always up to the 
judge to do so once reasonable grounds have been established to 
believe that a crime has been committed or is in the process of 
being committed.
<P>
	The other part of my question pertains to senior immigration 
officers who are entrusted with several new powers. 
Immigration officers will for instance be authorized to issue 
warrants for arrest. In all democratic societies, a judge would 
normally do this, but this bill allows it. What do you say to that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln: </B>Madam Speaker, unlike my hon. colleague, I 
did not get the chance to participate in the parliamentary 
committee as I am not a member. However, my colleagues who 
took part told me that there were numerous representations. 
There were representations from the Canadian Bar Association 
and other very credible institutions, who said that the bill was 
valid, that the principle of the bill was sound. This is not  a 
stand-alone bill; it is part of a 10-year immigration reform. It 
must be seen as part of a whole package.
<P>
	We took into account the representations made by these 
credible institutions and made 11 amendments. In today's 
context, I think that this bill makes sense. There will be a debate 
here in this House and I think that the bill in its present form is 
worth supporting. I hope that you will think it through and that 
we can count on your contribution and support.

	Bill C-65 is part of a concerted effort to act on our

have spoken. Their message was loud and clear. They are tired of 
large government. They have entrusted us with the task of 
ensuring the careful management of public funds. They want 
honesty and integrity restored to their federal institutions.
<P>
	The previous government made a process of selecting friends 
when making appointments to the many agencies, boards and 
commissions that cabinet is required by law to carry out.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, you may recall that in the last budget the 
Minister of Finance announced that we would have a full scale 
review to examine the size and relevance of existing boards, 
agencies, commissions and advisory bodies in order to both 
achieve cost savings by shrinking the size of some boards and 
commissions and by eliminating those that no longer play a 
useful role.
<P>
	Over the last year we have listened to Canadians and taken 
action. An obvious measure of the importance that we attributed 
to the renewal and downsizing of the federal government was 
the Prime Minister's decision to ask me to assume responsibility 
for public service renewal. In this capacity the government has 
moved simultaneously on three fronts which will lead to a 
leaner, more cost effective and efficient government.
<P>
	Bill C-65 will bring into force some decisions taken last July 
to reduce the numbers of, the size of, and otherwise streamline 
the operations of certain agencies, boards and commissions 
where this is in the interest of Canadians.
<P>
	As hon. members will recall, on July 8 of last year I issued an 
interim report on progress to date. With the co-operation of my 
cabinet colleagues I was able to report that decisions had been 
taken affecting 41 agencies in nine different portfolios.
<P>
	The legislation before the House today will place into law 
those decisions requiring legislative action.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	More specifically, this bill will make it possible to abolish, or 
significantly streamline, 22 agencies and advisory bodies. As a 
result, we will be able to eliminate 150 positions staffed by the 
Governor in Council. In concrete terms, this will mean an annual 
savings to taxpayers of $1.5 million, and this is only the first set 
of such measures.
<P>
	I am sure you realize, Mr. Speaker, that it would take too long 
to mention all these measures individually. However, perhaps a 
few examples will serve to illustrate how proper planning can 
yield major dividends.
<P>
	The Board of Directors of Petro-Canada Limited, which now 
has 15 members, will be reduced to three members. This agency 
has no employees, its sole function being to manage the 
remaining accounts receivable of Petro-Canada, which was 
privatized in 1991. By reducing the number of members on the 
board and replacing them with employees of the Department of 
Finance, the government will be able to achieve a substantial 
savings.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	The Canadian Saltfish Corporation, which was created almost 
25 years ago, is being abolished because there is no longer any 
need for it. When it closes, 24 positions filled by governor in 
council appointees will disappear.
<P>
	The staff of the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Board will 
shrink from 18 to 7, which will allow it to rationalize its 
activities in Cape Breton and enlist more help from Enterprise 
Cape Breton to implement more effective programs in that 
region. Seven positions will disappear when the board of 
trustees is abolished for the Queen Elizabeth II Canadian fund to 
aid in research on the diseases of children. In the future, the 
Medical Research Council will administer this fund.
<P>
	This is a very good example of what I mean when I say that 
good planning pays dividends. Continuing to study childhood 
diseases is essential. However, since the government supplies 
the funds but does not carry out the research, it is illogical in 
these times of fiscal restraint to keep paying for a board that 
only administers the fund.
<P>
	By being more pragmatic and logical, we tried to expose areas 
of overlap and to see if we could merge or group together certain 
functions. This is what we did for the Fund to aid in research on 
the diseases of children. We managed to save the fund by having 
it administered more effectively by the existing Medical 
Research Council of Canada.
<P>
	Another example of this kind of amalgamation was the 
elimination of Emergency Preparedness Canada as a separate 
agency. Emergency preparedness remains necessary and Canada 
will be well served in that area, except that this function will 
now be performed by DND.
<P>
	The functions of each agency were also reviewed for 
relevancy, to see if they were still useful or had become 
redundant. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9269"> 9269 </A></B>
<P>
Where it was determined that we had to keep the agency, we then 
looked at its structure with a view, if  at all possible, to fulfilling 
its role with fewer people, less money and, perhaps, more 
efficiency.
<P>
	Some agencies had very large staffs. Given the present 
financial situation, that seemed difficult to justify.
<P>
	Internal structure is also an important criterion and one that 
we have taken into account. For example, at the National Capital 
Commission, it is essential that adequate regional 
representation be maintained on the board.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Similar criteria of course apply to many types of boards and 
we have been careful to maintain appropriate representation of 
the boards that we will be reducing in size.
<P>
	Over a dozen organizations will have their number of board 
members reduced, resulting in significant savings. Just to 
mention but a few in this group are the Canada Council, the 
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the National Arts Centre 
and the boards of four of Canada's national museums.
<P>
	I believe that hon. members will agree that this demonstrates, 
as I said last summer, we want to ensure that federal agencies 
continue to be relevant and that they are serving Canadians as 
effectively as possible. Bill C-65 will give effect to our 
objective which is the identification of sensible and practical 
actions to eliminate overlap and duplication and simplify 
government wherever possible.
<P>
	Program review and efficiency of the federation: As I have 
already mentioned the review of agencies, boards and 
commissions is one aspect of the government's overall approach 
to streamlining and restructuring government.
<P>
<B>(1340 ) </B>
<P>
	The program review and our work in improving the efficiency 
of the federation are two additional initiatives. The efficiency of 
the federation initiative has allowed us to work jointly with the 
provinces in reducing overlap and duplication. With nine of the 
provinces and with two of the territories we have signed action 
plans which deal with specific sectoral issues where overlap and 
duplication can be reduced or eliminated within specific time 
frames.
<P>
	I will soon report on the progress that we have made in this 
important area which will result in more effective and less 
costly government for all Canadians.
<P>
	The program review is the other very significant initiative 
that will give the government a new look, a substantially 
different government which focuses on its core roles and 
responsibilities. The government is at one in understanding the 
absolute necessity for the government to renew itself, to 
restructure itself to better meet the evolving needs of our society 
during the next century.
<P>
	As members know, the full details of the results of the 
program review will be announced by the Minister of Finance 
when he tables his budget.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Third, there is no such thing as the status quo; the federal 
system is evolving. What I have just described to you is but one 
example of this evolution in government. If we are able to take 
the steps I just referred to, it is because our system is flexible, 
adaptable and capable of meeting the changing needs of our 
society and our country.
<P>
	Similarly, federalism is a form of government characterized 
by the capability of adjusting. Our history demonstrates the 
extreme flexibility of our government system.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Madam Speaker, if I can refer to my opening remarks of a few 
moments ago, where I mentioned the wishes of the Canadian 
people, I am certain that you and all colleagues in the House will 
agree that the government is taking the measures that will meet 
these expectations. Perhaps more than anything else, Canadians 
expect and want their government to be more responsive. A 
more responsive government will result from the efforts I have 
outlined here today.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	To conclude, I invite all the hon. members to support Bill 
C-65. It is with legislation like this that we can give you a 
modern and efficient government. In closing, I would like to 
advise the hon. members that we will be introducing in a little 
while another omnibus bill to finish the job started with Bill 
C-65.
<P>
	By the time our review is over, we will have dissolved many 
other agencies, boards and commissions; eliminated more than 
600 positions and effected savings of over $10 million a year for 
the taxpayers. I cannot wait to be done with this review.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise following the speech made here this afternoon on 
Bill C-65 by the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal. In the context 
of that legislation, the minister is also acting as President of the 
Privy Council.
<P>
	Bill C-65 is a measure to reorganize and dissolve certain 
federal agencies. The bill amends and reorganizes 15 federal 
agencies by reducing the number of their members. It also 
dismantles seven other federal organizations. I say dismantle 
because, in some cases, the mandate of these agencies is 
transferred to the sector department or is merged with that of 
another body.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9270"> 9270 </A></B>
<P>
	For several months now, the minister has been making a lot 
of statements regarding his reorganization of the federal public 
service.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	Let us take a closer look at the effect of these cuts in the 
context of the public service taken as a whole. In its current 
form, Bill C-65 seeks to restructure the boards of 15 federal 
organizations and reduce the number of their members. As the 
minister said himself, the changes proposed in that legislation 
would result in the elimination of 150 positions held by 
governor-in-council appointees, as well as in savings of about 
one million dollars.
<P>
	At the same time, the government is about to eliminate 45,000 
jobs in the federal public service. If we estimate the average cost 
of these positions to be $40,000, a figure which includes the 
salary and the fringe benefits, these cuts could result in savings 
of $1.8 billion for the government. Compared to these drastic 
cuts and their impact on the government's budget, the changes 
proposed in Bill C-65 seem very minor indeed. They look more 
like a device to attract the public's attention than like a real 
change in the government's way of managing.
<P>
	The savings which would result from the minister's piece of 
legislation represent merely one eighteenth of one per cent of 
the savings related to the anticipated elimination of the 45,000 
jobs mentioned earlier. As you can imagine, the minister's 
interest in such cuts is great, given their impact on the budget; 
on the other hand, the savings resulting from the reorganization 
and elimination of some federal agencies, which amount to a 
million dollars per year, seem minor.
<P>
	The fact is that all this publicity about savings of one million 
dollars is designed to prepare the ground and show that the 
government is setting an example. The aim is to show that 
political positions are being cut, before public service positions. 
Let us not forget that most of these political positions are 
part-time positions, and the people in them usually have another 
income. This is not the case for public servants, who work only 
for the government.
<P>
	A bill, in proper form, to save one million dollars is far too 
little, when public service positions are about to be slashed. This 
is not good enough. In many cases, the savings will not be real. 
Costs will simply be transferred to the public service. The 
government wants us to believe the bill will reduce waste in 
public spending. What we need are fewer political positions, 
that is appointments by the Privy Council, in other words, by the 
Prime Minister himself. This bill is simply a smoke screen.
<P>
	Saturday's <I>Globe and Mail</I> made it very clear that there was 
no shortage of political appointments under the Liberals. The 
article is headed: ``It pays to be a Liberal'' and goes on to list 84 
Liberals who have been appointed by the government. Certain 
well-known Liberals were named to important positions. Some 
of them had supported the Prime Minister at the leadership  
convention; others had lost out in the October 1993 elections 
and others were longtime Liberal supporters.
<P>
	This omnibus bill creates the illusion of government 
transparency. The red book makes the following promise: ``A 
Liberal government will review the appointment process to 
ensure that necessary appointments are made on the basis of 
competence. Persons appointed by a Liberal government will 
better represent women, visible minorities, Aboriginal peoples, 
and people with disabilities''. Are the 84 appointments listed in 
last Saturday's <I>Globe and Mail</I> based on the red book's criteria? 
Or are there double standards? I shall let you judge for 
yourselves. We heard one speech during the election campaign, 
but, having been elected, they are singing a different song now. 
The same Liberal credo as usual.
<P>
	The elimination in the bill of all legal references to 
commissions and advisory boards leads us to doubt that the 
Liberals are seriously committed to transparency in government 
operations. Will Parliament and elected members have the right 
to examine appointments to such advisory boards, which in fact 
will no longer be legally constituted?
<P>
	These agencies will no longer be required to submit annual 
reports to Parliament. The expected savings may be quite 
minimal and government appointments may become even more 
concentrated in the hands of the executive. Is this the 
transparency that the Liberals promised us during the last 
election campaign in October 1993?
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	They have also been silent on the issue of consultation with 
the provinces. Is that the flexible federalism promised by the 
Liberals? At the National Capital Commission, the legal 
obligation to have a member representing each province has 
been lifted in favour of local representation, that means 
representation for the city of Hull and for the city of Ottawa.
<P>
	And the government is still wondering why Westerners feel 
alienated? Why do Canadians from the west feel they are getting 
less than Ontarians and why was the government unable to have 
a majority of members of Parliament elected in the west of the 
country?
<P>
	The North Pacific Fisheries Convention Act will be revoked 
and the International North Pacific Fisheries Commission will 
be created. Was the Government of British Columbia consulted 
during this process and on the changes proposed by this act? 
Again, the minister remains silent.
<P>
	The Canadian Saltfish Corporation is being dissolved, says 
the minister, and the Saltfish Act, revoked. There is no more 
saltfish to sell anyway. The corporation was already inactive. 
Why has the government sat 15 months in office without acting? 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9271"> 9271 </A></B>
<P>
Dissolving this corporation was not the decision of the century, 
you will agree.
<P>
	The Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency Act is being 
amended. Have the governments of the four maritime provinces 
been privy to discussions leading up to this decision? Have they 
been included? Once again, we are in the dark.
<P>
	There will no longer be representatives of the armed forces on 
the National Film Board. The government finally recognizes 
that the NFB is not a propaganda machine. Does it also 
recognize that Canadian taxpayers should not be helping to pay 
for partisan propaganda? Is the government prepared to stop 
funding the Council for Canadian Unity and let pressure groups 
from the no side in the next Quebec referendum pick up the 
slack?
<P>
	The government says it wants to put an end to political 
appointments and senseless references to advisers. Seven 
advisory councils have been abolished. This is all very fine and 
well, but the directors of agencies can still call on the services of 
these people for advice of all sorts. The same group of friends of 
the regime will therefore continue to hover around government 
agencies, but more informally, less visibly than before.
<P>
	The government plans to table a second omnibus bill, the 
minister tells us, after bringing down the budget, while an 
examination of all federal bodies continues under the 
responsibility of the minister himself.
<P>
	All in all, the two bills will affect fewer than 300 positions, 
the majority of them part time, and will save one million dollars 
at best.
<P>
	As we mentioned, the reorganization of these 15 federal 
bodies and the winding-up of seven others provided for in Bill 
C-65 will abolish a total of 150 political positions. This 
initiative should be pursued, although it still strikes us as much 
too timid.
<P>
	The government should be directing its attention to the 
process of appointing people to these organizations. This is the 
sore point. The existing appointment process leaves the door 
open to taxpayers' money being used to reward friends of the 
party in power. There will be fewer of these political appointees, 
I agree, but they will still be Liberals.
<P>
	What has changed? Let us look more closely at the nature of 
this administrative reorganization by the Minister responsible 
for Public Service Renewal. The number of members of the 
Canada Council has dropped from 21 to 11. The position of 
assistant director is no longer mentioned in the bill's provisions. 
The Council could, however, create such a position without any 
other approval. Parliament is losing control. The position of 
secretary of the Canadian Film Development Corporation, 
Telefilm Canada, is in fact no longer mentioned in the bill. The 
creation of such a position will therefore be up to the 
corporation in the future.
<P>
	The Minister of National Defence is henceforth responsible 
for emergency preparedness, the organization formerly presided 
over by the minister, but under the direction of the executive 
director.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	Emergency Preparedness Canada is no longer required to 
submit an annual report on its operations. Of course, the risk of 
politicizing emergency preparedness for partisan purposes is 
still there and we must remain very vigilant in this regard. It is a 
matter of government openness and parliamentary control.
<P>
	The established policy of no longer requiring departments to 
submit annual reports is part of the cheeseparing economies this 
government is trying to achieve, when its mismanagement in all 
areas is costing us billions of dollars.
<P>
	A one-point hike in interest rates increases the deficit by $1.7 
billion, which is close to the $1.8 billion to be gained by 
eliminating the 45,000 public service jobs targeted by the 
government.
<P>
	The abolition of the National Advisory Council on Fitness and 
Amateur Sport was already announced in the 1993 budget of the 
Conservative government. Are the Liberals taking credit for 
these savings or are they using the same data a second time?
<P>
	Any legal reference to the National Archives of Canada 
Advisory Board and the National Library Advisory Board is 
eliminated. Management at the National Archives and National 
Library will thus be free to set up an informal advisory 
committee that will be beyond control.
<P>
	The minister said that other changes would be implemented as 
part of the reorganization through separate legislation, 
orders-in-council or administrative measures. These additional 
measures will eliminate 125 governor in council appointments 
and save $4 million. Did you notice that this government's 
estimated future savings are always much bigger than the 
savings generated by these concrete measures?
<P>
	Bill C-65 and the second omnibus bill that will be introduced 
after the budget is tabled will eliminate 300 jobs and save $1 
million, while future measures will cut 125 jobs and save $4 
million. This second series of measures to be implemented in 
the coming year will thus save four times as much. The jobs that 
will be cut must pay much better than those already abolished.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It being two o'clock, pursuant to Standing 
Order 30(5), the House will now proceed to Statements by

	<B>Mr. Bill Graham (Rosedale, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is

problems, we Canadians must also remind ourselves from time 
to time that the vast majority of humankind is not as well off as 
we are. We must also recognize that our own interests and values 
require that we aid others in development.
<P>
	As the Minister of Foreign Affairs said this morning, aid for 
development attacks the threats to our own security that are 
posed by over-population, poverty, disease and conflicts in 
other countries. It also allows us to share our Canadian values of 
tolerance and pluralism; aid women in development; encourage 
the establishment of a vibrant private sector in developing 
economies; and help others create the foundations for 
democratic government that make this country so great.

this government is contemplating raising to 30 per cent of

in order to save on social housing and apply these savings to 
reducing the federal deficit.
<P>
	We recognize in this measure the unimaginative, heartless 
ways of the Liberals, and particularly their lack of vision. What 
this raise means, in real terms, is a 20 percent per year rent 
increase for the 110,000 Quebec families in social housing.

to pay $500 more in annual rent, or $40 to $50 more per month.

these policies will have on the economic development of

<P>
	Now with the impending budget Canadians are getting 
nervous because deficit reduction targets will not be met. They 
are nervous because of strong rumours of proposed tax increases 
in the budget.
<P>
	Low and middle income Canadians have been taxed enough. 
They have been burdened by government mismanagement and 
excessive spending for too long.
<P>
	I have proposed a solution to the Minister of Finance, a 
solution that every low and middle income earner in Canada will 
support. The solution is to designate 1995 a tax freeze year for 
low and middle income earning Canadians. It is time for the

Development, with the support of the Liberal majority within 
the committee, jeopardizes their ability to get university and 
post-secondary education by triggering a significant rise in 
tuition fees. Moreover, the minister and the Liberal majority 
want to make it more difficult for young people to get UI 
benefits.
<P>
	Because of such measures, which show contempt and a lack of 
understanding, the federal government fully justifies the 
dissatisfaction and resentment young Quebecers and Canadians 
feel toward leaders who do not care at all about their future.

<P>
	In the video a black paratrooper, like his white colleagues,

degraded at a second level. In the video his captors wrote on his

intended effect was only achieved because its host was black. In 
this case the individual was humiliated but as well all members

become systemic in our society.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, now that the financial community is becoming 
increasingly sceptical about the government's willingness to 
deal with the deficit, the Prime Minister and the Minister of 
Finance have refused to promise not to raise taxes in the next 
budget. Once again, the government is about to attack the 
middle class, which is already heavily taxed.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Prime Minister. How can the 
Prime Minister claim that, three weeks before the budget, he 
still does not know whether the government will raise taxes and, 
above all, how can he renege with such impunity on a campaign 
promise that he would not raise taxes during the first two years 
of his mandate?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the final decisions concerning the budget have yet to be 
made, so it would be premature for me to say anything definitive 
on certain aspects of the budget.
<P>
	What we have to do is not an easy job. Decisions are in the 
process of being made, but they are not final. As soon as we have 
finished the job, the Minister of Finance will be able to 
announce the budget date, and members will get their answers 
on the night the budget is brought down.

<HR>
<B><A NAME="9276"> 9276 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as far as I know, the Prime Minister's arguments do 
not release him from his commitments. He was elected on the 
basis that he would not increase taxes during the first two years 
of his mandate.
<P>
	I want to ask the Prime Minister whether he agrees that during 
the past year, his government's failure to cut spending was 
mainly responsible for increasing mortgage costs by up to $200 
per month for the same taxpayers who would be affected by his 
surtax.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have said it before and I will say it again, a budget will 
be brought down in the House a few weeks from now. I want to 
point to hon. member that Canada's economic performance has 
been exceptional.
<P>
	We have achieved higher growth objectives than any other 
western country. We have had a year with zero inflation. For the 
first time in a very long while, the forecasts of the Minister of 
Finance with respect to the deficit have been reached. This will 
be explained in the budget.
<P>
	Our performance was excellent, and we intend to keep it that 
way. And when the Minister of Finance rises in the House to 
propose budget cuts, I will be delighted to see the hon. member 
supporting those cuts.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if we are in such good shape, why not promise not to 
raise taxes? Why this reluctance to make certain decisions, 
when the government is prepared to make decisions like the one 
I am about to mention?
<P>
	Considering the present state of our public finances, how can 
the Prime Minister justify a decision to give away $2 billion in 
tax credits to the wealthiest taxpayers in this country who can 
afford a vacation home in the United States?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member 
ought to know that what this means is, that we negotiated an 
agreement with the United States to avoid double taxation of 
Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	Formerly, a Canadian who had a residence in the United States 
had to pay taxes unless he had a tax credit, and the same applied 
to an American who had a residence here. Since many 
Americans have residences in this country, what we did was to 
protect Canada's tax base.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Just yesterday, the Minister of Finance asked the official 
opposition to make suggestions for reducing expenditures. Yet 
on December 15 in this House, he denounced proposals made by 
the Bloc Quebecois and denounced the fact that they would only 
amount to a reduction of $5 billion.
<P>
	Rather than contemplating another tax increase for the middle 
class, why does the government refuse to act on the suggestions 
made by the official opposition, such as collecting $6 billion in 
unpaid taxes, eliminating duplication which costs $3 billion in 
Quebec alone, scrapping over $1 billion in unproductive 
subsidies to companies, cutting the defence budget-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order, please. I remind hon. members that they 
should ask questions and not give little speeches. I would ask the 
hon. member to state his question immediately.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brien:</B> What a shame, Mr. Speaker, I still had a few 
hundred million dollars earmarked for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Why is he considering raising taxes for the middle class 
instead of following the suggestions made by the Bloc 
Quebecois?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the only 
suggestions offered by the Bloc Quebecois were the same ones 
as the Auditor General made. In congratulating us, the Auditor 
General also congratulated the Minister of National Revenue on 
his efforts in this regard. There is nothing new in their 
suggestions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a supplementary question for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Finance intend to act on the warning 
against increasing taxes given him by the business council on 
national issues, which said that the overall tax burden in Canada 
is already too high, jeopardizing investment projects and, more 
seriously, hampering efforts to reduce unemployment faster?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I have said 
repeatedly that we intend primarily to cut government spending. 
As to specific decisions, we will have to wait for the budget.
<P>
	I find it somewhat of a paradox, however, with the whip of the 
Bloc Quebecois having just suggested that we should pay no 
attention to business leaders, to have the member for 
Temiscamingue ask us now to listen to what the business leaders 
have to say. There seems to be a bit of a lack of consistency here.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday the finance minister said it would be fruitless 
for Reformers to ask questions about the budget because he 
would not under any circumstances get into specifics. Yet 
representatives of the financial institutions seem to be learning a 
great deal about the budget from off the record conversations 
with government insiders. For example, Sherry Cooper, chief 
economist of Nesbitt Burns says that those in the know tell her 
the government will save $5.25 billion in spending reductions 
next year and $7 billion in 1996-97.
<P>
	Will the minister provide the House with the list of 
institutions and others who have been provided with this type of 
information about the forthcoming budget and will he explain 
why he is not willing to provide the same details to this House 
and the Canadian people?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can assure the 
leader of the third party that no such information has been 
provided to any financial institutions and therefore he has his 
answer.
<P>
	I did participate in a telephone conference call with Sherry 
Cooper along with 50 or 60 others, including a full 
representation from the financial press.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I can understand why the finance minister wants to try 
to con the markets and outline his budget strategy to financial 
analysts. They are uncertain and worried about the 
government's fiscal direction. The Canadian people are also 
uncertain and worried about the government's fiscal direction 
and they need some reassurances.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	How is it that the government can find ways to reassure 
financial analysts on the size of the budget deficit and spending 
cuts, but will not tell the Canadian people anything about 
pending tax increases? Why the double standard? It is their 
money.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have been able 
to reassure financial markets because we have been able to say 
that this year, as the Prime Minister has said, for the first time in 
a long, long time the Canadian government is going to hit its 
deficit targets. We have also been able to reassure financial 
markets because we have said that in the years to come we are 
going to continue to hit those targets.
<P>
	We have been able to reassure the Canadian people and those 
who are in need when we have said that we will not engage in the 
kind of fiscal savagery recommended by the Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if you set your targets low enough, even the 
Conservatives can hit them.
<P>
	The government seems to be finding ways of getting 
information to the money markets about the budget in order to 
prepare their reaction and calm their fears, but it is unprepared 
to provide the same information to this House and the Canadian 
people who have an even greater stake in the budget.
<P>
	I am wondering whether the Prime Minister condones this 
double standard or whether he is willing to be as frank with the 
Canadian people as his finance minister is apparently willing to 
be frank with financial analysts.
<P>
	Is the Prime Minister willing to tell the Canadian people 
today, yes or no, whether the government intends to increase 
taxes in the forthcoming budget? Be as frank with them as the 
minister is with the analysts.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, you will have to be patient because we will be asked 
that question every day until the day of the budget. Everybody 
knows we cannot reveal the contents of the budget before budget 
night. We will respect the rule that has existed for a long time.
<P>
	One thing is clear. This government has said to the Canadian 
public and the business community that we would meet our 
targets and the targets will be met.

	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human 
Resources Development. Of all the recommendations made in 
the Liberals' majority report on social program reform, one is 
particularly heinous since it aims to require that young people 
work more weeks than the rest of the population in order to 
qualify for unemployment insurance, even though young people 
already have a hard time finding stable jobs.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Human Resources Development endorse 
the recommendation made by his Liberal colleagues, which, in 
an underhanded and discriminatory way, sets up a two-tiered 
unemployment insurance system with the lower level of 
coverage going to young people?

<P>

<P>
human resources who completed their work in sometimes 
somewhat trying circumstances.  I want to tell them I appreciate 
very much the way in which they made a real effort to reflect the 
views of Canadians.
<P>
	As far as the specific recommendations are concerned, we 
will be looking at all the views and recommendations contained 
in the committee report submitted, both the majority and 
minority reports. We will be looking at them very carefully as 
we go about preparing government programs for the reform of 
our social institutions.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the problem is that, during the consultation 
process, not one of the witnesses told us that a system penalizing 
young people was needed.
<P>
	How can the minister justify his government's determination 
to make young people second class citizens, by forcing them to 
increase the debt load they accumulate during their studies and 
by restricting their access to unemployment insurance, even 
though they often hold unstable jobs?
<P>

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I just explained a 
committee report is not a government policy. It is very 
important that we clarify the distinction.
<P>
	On the other hand, I would say that having read the majority 
report very carefully, I was very impressed by the number of 
recommendations made concerning the way in which we could 
begin to target more assistance directly to young people to help 
them get into the job market.
<P>
	It seems to me that one of the most important initiatives or 
directions the committee majority report recommends is that we 
devote far more resources to things like internship programs, 
transitions between school and work, helping students get better 
aid and assistance to go back to school.
<P>
	Providing positive programming is really the direction we 
have to go in. That was certainly the spirit in which the majority 
committee report was expressed.

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
today the Reform candidate for Ottawa-Vanier said that the 
soon to be appointed Governor General should be required to 
pay his fair share of taxes. I and I am sure every other Canadian 
wholeheartedly agree. Now that the Queen pays income tax, why 
should her representative in Canada not pay?
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Will he send a positive 
signal to Canadian taxpayers by asking the new Governor 
General to voluntarily pay income taxes like the rest of us?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, to begin with, the Governor General has voluntarily 
returned his pension to the crown. He was not obliged to do that. 
There was no obligation at all, yet he accepted to do that.
<P>
	This legislation has been in existence for a long time. Perhaps 
we might have to review it and adjust the circumstances to that 
reality, but this is the way governors general have been treated in 
Canada since 1867.
<P>
	We will look into that and see if we can do something. At the 
same time we have to treat this Governor General the same way 
we treated the governors general in the past.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, of 
course the Queen set the precedent in 1993 when she offered 
voluntarily to pay income taxes.
<P>
	Things are different now from what they were in 1867. With 
today's harsh economic climate when Canadians are being 
forced to make do with less from sea to sea, a $95,000 salary tax 
free plus benefits does seem a little steep.
<P>
	The government has talked a lot in the last few weeks about 
making the taxation system fairer. Why not start at the top with 
the Governor General? Equal means equal.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is not necessary to tell the House that the Governor 
General on his private income, if he has other income, is paying 
his taxes. It is exactly what the Queen has offered to do in 
England if I am well informed. She is paying taxes on her private 
income, not on her public income.

suggested by Liberal senators and members of Parliament on

<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Roy MacLaren (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in Canada's search for additional 
international markets it is not in any way our intention to play 
down opportunities in the United States. They are real, they are 
tangible and of course they represent the greatest part of our 
foreign trade.
<P>
	Our programs of support range across a whole spectrum. 
Some relate to the border states for example. Some relate to 
small and medium sized enterprises entering the export world 
for the first time, principally in the United States. It is our 
intention to continue to support those programs.

	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
supplementary question is for the Prime Minister. The Prime 
Minister claims that he cares about human rights; why in that 
case did he not see fit to raise this issue during his meeting with 
Central American leaders, including the President of 
Guatemala, a country denounced by Amnesty International for 
its systematic violation of human rights?
<P>
<B>(1435) </B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I raised this kind of issue several times whenever 
circumstances allowed it. In fact, I raised this very issue, in the 
presence of the President of Guatemala, at the breakfast meeting 
we had with the six Central American government leaders.

	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday the report tabled by the human resources 
development committee offered the curious vision that social 
programs are working brilliantly yet they are desperately in 
need of reform.
<P>
	Almost all of the recommendations are based on three false 
assumptions: that governments create jobs through ever 
increasing public spending; that a government monopoly is the 
best means of caring for those in need; and that ever increasing 
government debts and deficits are justifiable if they are spent on 
government run, make work projects and social programs.
<P>
	Last week the Minister of Human Resources Development 
told the news media that deficit reduction had overtaken social 
program reform as the top priority. Can the minister tell 
Canadians if he will proceed with  social program reform only if 
he can spend more money and control program delivery?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is obvious the hon. 
member was so busy reading his own minority report that he did 
not bother to look carefully at the majority report.
<P>
	It very directly says we must put social reform in the context 
of a stable fiscal economic system because we have to build 
upon that base of stability. This is something we are certainly 
favouring because we do believe that part of social reform is to 
have a well functioning economy which is not subject to the kind 
of vulnerabilities and volatility we are now receiving in the 
international finance market.
<P>
	Beyond that it said it is very important to look at many of the 
existing programs and shift resources for those programs to 
much more active employment development so that we can get 
people back to work. After all, the ultimate strength of our 
economy is to have more Canadians going back to work. That is 
how we will build this country, by investing in people.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Once again colleagues, it is early in the year 
but I would appeal to you to make the questions brief and the 
answers brief.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if the government would get its fiscal house in order 
there would be a lot less need for social programs.
<P>
	I travelled with the Commons committee for five weeks. 
Many ordinary Canadians I heard were not saying the things that 
are in this report. It is obvious the government is paralysed 
because it has spent too much time listening to government 
funded special interest groups.
<P>
	Can the minister tell us, is his government going to continue 
the Liberal tradition of social programs dominated by decisions 
made in Ottawa and make promises it cannot keep and add to the 
worry of average Canadians because of its lack of vision?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the vision we put forward 
in the social paper was to ensure that a wide range of Canadians 
would be able to fully participate in the process.
<P>
	I am glad to report that well over 100,000 Canadians 
participated mainly through the efforts of members of 
Parliament who held town hall meetings, through the work of 
the committee itself and through the effective work of the 
department in getting out workbook questionnaires. It probably 
has been the largest exercise of public involvement in any 
decision on public policy.

<P>
	We are heading toward the budget and the downsizing that is 
going to occur in the public service as a result of the program

say that there were not people involved in the past. What we are

just that, to create jobs and increase prosperity in Canada.

Brazil, some $600 million; and in the case of Chile, some $1.7

<P>
	On January 1, the CRTC forced the country music television

Canadian country artists out of a global audience estimated at 32

Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	We have learned that not only did the CBC chairman meet the 
federal Liberal caucus in Toronto to discuss the budget of the 
corporation, but that he also had a meeting with the members of 
the Quebec wing of the federal Liberal Party to discuss coverage 
of the referendum campaign by the CBC.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister justify the fact that Mr. Manera 
participated in a second meeting which only involved federal 
Liberal members from Quebec and the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage, specifically to discuss coverage of the referendum 
campaign?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the reason is that the Liberal caucus is very large. 
Consequently, the CBC chairman first met Ontario members, 
and then Quebec members, the next day, after they had arrived.
<P>
	In fact, the chairman had sent an invitation to meet Bloc 
Quebecois members, but the hon. member was not in her office 
to find out what was going on.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B>

information, the letter arrived on February 3 and I came back to 
my office on the sixth. My supplementary is for the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	Following his blunder with the CRTC, and given his 
ministerial responsibility, how can the minister justify 
participating in a meeting on the CBC's coverage of the 
referendum campaign, thus directly jeopardizing the autonomy 
of a crown corporation of which he is supposed to be the 
guardian?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, surely the hon. member knows that members 
of Parliament attend caucus meetings. However, she forgot to 
mention that the Premier of Quebec has also asked for the 
resignation of the heritage minister, but I will provide an 
explanation. The reason is that the Premier is so desperate to 
find a Quebec minister of culture that he is now turning to 
Ottawa; however, I have no intention of doing him that favour.

Speaker, people are appointed regularly to boards. We look for

one once in a while. Last week, in order for the <I>Globe and Mail</I>

jobs as best we can. I am sure all hon. members know that 
sometimes papers do not arrive on time or they are occupied 
otherwise and that should be taken as an explanation.

AGENCIES)</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-65, an act to reorganize and dissolve certain federal agencies, 
be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> If I am not mistaken, the 
hon. member for La Prairie still had a few minutes left. 
Therefore, he has the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, why did 
we not abolish these positions first, since every million dollars 
saved has an impact on the deficit?
<P>
	The Auditor General certainly made the point in his 1993 
annual report. A few billion more in spending increase the 
deficit and, in less than a decade, inflate the accumulated debt 
tens of billions of dollars because of compounded interests.
<P>
	In his July 8 press release the minister said that he had 
undertaken a thorough review of the 350 agencies and advisory 
boards, hoping to find reasonable and practical ways to 
eliminate overlapping and duplication, and to streamline in the 
best possible way government operations.
<P>
	The minister did not say whether he consulted his provincial 
counterparts. Is he really going not only to reduce overlapping 
and duplication within the federal system, but also streamline 
management of the public sector in Canada, considering that 
there is only one taxpayer, at the federal and provincial levels?
<P>
	It is so true that the main brokerage firms and credit rating 
agencies are talking more and more about the public sector debt 
in Canada.
<P>
	The increased pressure resulting from public borrowing 
reduces the taxpayers' capacity to pay. Streamlining public 
administration requires agreement between the federal and 
provincial levels of government, and the minister did not seek 
the agreement of his provincial counterparts.
<P>
	The most tragic in all this is that in the time it took the 
minister to deliver his speech, the debt of the federal 
government increased by $1,3 million, while the whole bill will 
produce less than one million dollars in savings. In the time it 
took me to deliver my response to the minister's speech, the debt 
went up two million.
<P>
	In his July 8 press release, the minister said that he does not 
have a set objective as to the number of agencies which will be 
affected or the savings which could result. He added that it was 
the government's aim to identify the logical and practical 
changes to be made to improve the workings of government.
<P>
	The minister does not appear to have a structured or well 
defined approach. He has no specific streamlining objective in 
mind. This does not come from me, or the Bloc Quebecois or the 
Reform Party, but from the actual press release issued by the 
minister's office.
<P>
	The President of the Privy Council, who should be providing 
the coordination, leadership and training needed to make the 
project a success is leaving most of the responsibility for 
recommending changes within their portfolios to the ministers 
themselves. How can the ministers do the job? There is no 
objective, no plan, no decision-making criteria or parameters 
and no decision grid for either the departments or the ministers 
involved.
<P>
	Are the decisions made by guess and by gosh? Is this a 
rigorous approach? The poor results show how poorly the thing 
was thought out.
<P>
	All of this upheaval, this whole game of musical chairs in 
political appointments for a saving of less than a million dollars, 
which we are not even sure about, since a number of jobs have 
been transferred to the public service.
<P>
	On the recommendation of the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans, five advisory bodies will be eliminated because they are 
no longer active, we are told. It is only normal, in our opinion, to 
abolish them. What do they advise on, when there are hardly any 
more fish to be caught on the east coast.
<P>
	The minister's press release of December 21 promises that a 
total of 72 agencies will be abolished and 16 others will be 
restructured.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	This in fact represents only 25 per cent of all federal agencies. 
We are told that this should result in the elimination of 589 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9285"> 9285 </A></B>
<P>
positions, the incumbents of which are appointed by the 
governor in council. The total savings  should amount to four 
million dollars. When will we see a piece of legislation enacting 
these promises?
<P>
	Each press release from the minister's office mentions old 
measures to which some new ones are added, every time, to 
reach the magic four million number, but we are still waiting for 
a piece of legislation enacting these measures.
<P>
	In our view, Bill C-65 does not go far enough in the present 
context. Eliminating 150 positions, adding up to a real saving of 
less than one million dollars, is not enough when the federal 
debt is growing at a rate of more than 100 million dollars a day.
<P>
	We should, instead, review federal advisory bodies in the 
context of the fiscal restraints we are facing currently. First of 
all, the government must maintain the integrity of its tax base. It 
must recover the $6.6 billion in unpaid taxes, deal with tax 
evasion, tax havens and family trusts as well as the underground 
economy, all of which the Bloc Quebecois has denounced on 
several occasions. Taxes must not be increased. The middle 
class is paying enough as it is. We must fight resolutely and 
unwavingly on all fronts to wipe out the deficit.
<P>
	Bill C-65 only skims the surface and shows a lack of 
determination and political will on the part of the government. 
We must first and foremost reduce the deficit and this will 
demand steps much more significant and substantial than those 
the minister is suggesting in the bill before us today.
<P>
	All this will only amount to savings of four million dollars, of 
which more than three have not materialized yet. I will admit 
that the original idea was good, but in the end the objective is not 
bold enough. We must act much faster and go much further. In 
view of the huge deficit, Bill C-65 seems like a drop in the 
bucket of necessary reforms which can no longer be avoided.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am delighted 
to rise in the House today to add yet another perspective to what 
is happening here today with Bill C-65.
<P>
	The government has undertaken to reduce the membership on 
some of the boards. It has even undertaken to eliminate some of 
the boards and direct their activities to other government 
departments or agencies. My first response is to give a mild 
cheer because this is definitely going in the right direction.
<P>
	I cannot help but relate an analogy that came to my mind. I 
remember when I was a very young lad on the farm in 
Saskatchewan before we used tractors exclusively. For a while 
we had tractors as well as horses. I remember on one occasion 
the tractor got stuck and we had to use the horses to pull it out of 
the ditch. My dad hooked up the horses and lined them up 
perfectly in the right direction. Then he said `chlick, chlick', 
because that was how one got the horses to go, but they just 
tightened up the traces. They did not make any great  effort. So 
my father again went `chlick, chlick' and still nothing happened. 
The tractor would not move. Then very unexpectedly he hauled 
out, brought down his hand on the rump of one of the horses in 
the team and gave a yell like I had never heard my father give 
before. The horses leaped forward and pulled the tractor out of 
the ditch.
<P>
	I want to applaud the Liberals because I think they have the 
horses lined up. The problem is we need to give them a yell; we 
need to give them a motivation. I will not use the one we used on 
the horses but we need to get them going. We need to get them 
moving. While they are headed in the right direction, they have 
not yet begun to move.
<P>
	One might say that cannot be because we are going to reduce 
costs here and this is really significant. We are going to cut 
government expenditures and help balance the budget. Yes, that 
is true. As I am going to show in a few minutes, the direction is 
correct but unfortunately, all we have done is just barely 
tightened up on the traces. We have not yet begun to pull the 
tractor out of the mud. It is still firmly bogged down.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	This act has a lot of potential to look good in the press. There 
is a possibility here of some good symbolism, because as I said, 
it is moving in the right direction. Unfortunately, I do not 
believe it has enough substance. It is not substantive enough to 
do anything real and tangible. As a matter of fact, it will be very 
interesting to see whether there actually are savings that result 
in basically terminating the employment of a number of board 
members in these different agencies; then turning around and 
hiring a bunch of them back.
<P>
	Undoubtedly these different departments and components of 
government need leadership. However, the real problem is not 
so much how many people are giving that leadership as how 
much money those departments and different agencies are 
spending. I briefly looked at the list of organizations that are 
being revised.
<P>
	In the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency Act the number 
of board members is being decreased from 18 to 7. Yet, we know 
the proportion of money spent in the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency Act is very small with respect to the 
board members as opposed to the money they are giving away.
<P>
	Perhaps we ought to look much more seriously at how they are 
spending their money and how that can be reduced instead of 
reducing simply the number of people that are, shall we say, 
trying to manage the affairs.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9286"> 9286 </A></B>
<P>
	In the Broadcasting Act the number of members is decreasing 
from 15 to 12. In the Canada Council Act the number is 
decreasing from 19 to 9. I could keep on going all the way down 
the list.
<P>
	The National Advisory Council on Fitness and Amateur Sport 
is being dissolved. That is a very wise decision in the sense that 
nowadays there is so much awareness already of the need for 
physical fitness that individuals should be taking the initiative 
on their own. We do not really need a government bureaucracy 
that is taking taxpayers' money in order to try to promote this.
<P>
	One of the items I noted in the minister's statement was that 
there was a full review of all of the agencies. That too is good. I 
am one who is much in favour of looking at a problem, analysing 
it, trying to break it down into smaller pieces if possible. 
Identify the problems. Identify all of the possible solutions. 
Choose from the better solutions and eventually nail it down to 
those solutions which will work.
<P>
	Presumably that is what this review was all about. However, it 
is not possible for us to get a copy of the review. I find that rather 
distressing. As members of Parliament who have input into 
whether or not this act will pass and whether it is good, we will 
be dealing only with the issues the government has decided to 
bring forward. The whole review is in fact being kept under 
wraps.
<P>
	This is a violation of a principle of democracy as well as being 
a substantial violation and a breaking of a promise of the 
government members when they were running for election. 
They promised more openness and accountability. We are not 
receiving that in this particular process because of the fact that 
the total report of the review is not being made available. We are 
told succinctly that it is not available to us.
<P>
	Why does the government not release these findings? Why is 
the government keeping it a secret? Speculation is all I can do 
because I do not have the report. Perhaps the reason might be 
that there were more cuts identified by the review than the 
Liberals are prepared to go ahead with.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	Consequently they choose the few they want. Really what 
they have here are a few cosmetic changes, minor reductions in 
the number of board members but no substantial cuts in terms of 
total cost and the total efficiency of these organizations and 
groups.
<P>
	Some of these reductions appear suspect in any case. The way 
the act is written is rather interesting. It says that all of the 
members will cease their employment, but then when that takes 
place the government will be ready to reappoint new members. 
It does occur to me that perhaps one reason we have the 
legislation that way is because a number of the members of these 
boards are probably carry overs from a previous government of a 
party which essentially no longer exists. There is now an 
opportunity to replace the members of the board from  those old 
appointments with brand new appointments where the 
government so chooses.
<P>
	Frankly, this adds to my cynicism and the cynicism of 
Canadians who are observing this. We all ought to look at that 
type of activity very carefully. Again I am speculating. We will 
be watching with interest to see what happens when this bill is 
passed. I am certain it will; it is a government bill. The Liberals 
have the majority. We will speak and will show the obvious 
shortcomings of it, but in the end it will pass because of the 
majority and because of the rule of voting with the party. 
Consequently, it will pass and then we will watch to see how 
many of the new appointees have Liberal connections.
<P>
	I would also like to speak very briefly about the need to go 
beyond reducing. I guess this is the part of getting the horses 
moving. We are going in the right direction when we say: ``Here 
is a department or an agency and we need to cut back''. 
However, perhaps what we ought to do is to start pulling 
Canada's fiscal tractor out of the mud by getting the horses 
moving.
<P>
	That might involve complete elimination of a number of these 
agencies. Instead of reducing from 15 board members to nine 
perhaps we ought to be reducing from 15 to zero and winding up 
the agencies and what they do. We do not as taxpayers save 
money if all we are doing is taking the money spending function 
of these people and moving it to another government agency. 
The money is still going to be flowing through. We need to do 
some hard work to eliminate the deficit. That can only happen if 
we reduce spending. We can only reduce spending by 
eliminating programs which are no longer needed and which are 
at the lower end of the priority level.
<P>
	I am going to say again what I say in probably every speech I 
make here. Even just a few minutes ago there was an innuendo 
from the member for Yukon who said that the government might 
want to take the Reform Party tactics and eliminate health care 
and education. That is wrong. That is not our policy. We have 
said it, we have written it, and we will just keep on repeating it 
and hammering it until members opposite hear.
<P>
	Our members and the citizens of this country we represent 
have told us very clearly that health care and education are of a 
top priority. That is why we want government costs and 
expenditures reduced and the budget balanced, so that we can 
continue to provide the things which Canadians have placed at a 
high priority.
<P>
	They are empty promises to say we will keep those programs 
if we lose our ability to deliver them. That is very important to 
us. We need to reduce the programs that Canadians do not want.
<P>
	In that regard I want to talk about one program specifically. 
One agency which is being affected here is the National Capital 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9287"> 9287 </A></B>
<P>
Commission. There are many others and probably some of my 
colleagues will speak about those. I want to talk a little about the 
National Capital  Commission. I want to speak to this from the 
perspective of a person who lives some distance from Ottawa.
<P>
<B>(1525 ) </B>
<P>
	As a matter of fact, until just three or four months before the 
election I had never been to Ottawa, being way out in the west 
and never having the financial means to take the huge trip out to 
the east. I would always have liked to but we were not able to do 
that within the confines of our family budget. Of course since 
the election, I have had the privilege of spending a lot of time in 
Ottawa.
<P>
	One thing impressed me and that was the tonnes, the 
truckloads of money Canadians have poured into this region. I 
suppose there is nothing wrong with saying that this is Canada's 
national capital. Surely in this part of the country, in this city 
which houses our capital, we can do some special things to make 
it good, to make it attractive, to make it a tourist centre, to make 
it fun for citizens to visit and to see more than just the workings 
of government.
<P>
	It is quite evident that after the dog and pony show of question 
period is over most citizens find this not that interesting. The 
galleries are mostly empty now and I admire those who are still 
here listening to this. They come to Ottawa and after question 
period they want to go and visit some other things.
<P>
	We have museums, we have parks, we have all sorts of things. 
However this being the seat of government, by that token it 
attracts tourists here, other Canadians and indeed people from 
around the world. Would it not then be reasonable to ask the city 
of Ottawa to capitalize on that and as every other city in Canada 
needs to do, have it look after making other attractions in the 
city that will attract and help entertain the people who come 
here?
<P>
	That happens in every city in Canada except this one. This city 
alone receives this huge input of government money, which 
translates into taxpayers' money from across the country, in 
order to provide these nice things. I am not speaking against 
what is being provided. I am saying that the money ought to be 
provided in a much more efficient way, managed by private 
enterprise primarily but also with some involvement by the city 
itself.
<P>
	The National Capital Commission is not accountable. It is 
another one of those places where the taxpayers are being 
coerced into sending their money to Ottawa. As I said, we send it 
here in truckloads. At the same time, there are many areas of 
government where we taxpayers do not have any say on how the 
money is spent. We can each legitimately ask the question: What 
value is this expenditure to me as an individual living in a part of 
the country away from Ottawa, or indeed what value is it in 
terms of the country itself?
<P>
	It is unfortunate that the National Capital Commission has 
decided to hold all its meetings in camera. When suggested that 
those meetings should be made public it said: ``No, this is the 
same as any other crown corporation. We are not required to and 
therefore we will not''. I do not think that is acceptable. I know it 
is not acceptable.
<P>
	People complain to me about the high level of taxation just 
about every day. Those people are very upset when their money 
goes into a black hole, a dark sinkhole somewhere and there is 
no accountability on how it is spent. We do not know how much 
is given to certain individuals. We do not know how contracts 
are let. We do not know whose friends are getting paid what.
<P>
	Again, it is innuendo that could be so easily solved by just 
doing what the Liberals said they would do, that is, having open 
government: openness and accountability. If there is nothing to 
hide, why would you be afraid of having someone look at what is 
happening? If you have something to hide then you will hide it. 
If you simply hide it, then the conclusion on the part of many 
Canadians is that there must be something to hide.
<P>
	Right now it is winter. People back in my riding who happen 
to be watching this are enjoying today, a plus one day, but right 
here right now we are feeling the brunt of winter. In Ottawa 
these days, we have a little thing called Winterlude, a wonderful 
cultural event. Last year it cost just under $264,000. We are told 
that it is time to restrain ourselves, to reduce our spending and to 
look after the mounting debt. What is the response of this 
unaccountable capital commission with the Winterlude concert? 
The best information I have is that instead of spending 
$264,000, as it did last year, it is spending $383,000.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	I know $383,000 is not much in terms of total government 
spending, but when a citizen is having trouble making ends meet 
and is being asked to pay $800 or $900 a month in taxes, seeing 
one-third of a million dollars being spent here, to him it is a 
huge amount of money. That lack of accountability is something 
we need to really address.
<P>
	I believe we need to look very seriously at disbanding the 
National Capital Commission. The parts that pertain to the 
Canadian government could easily be transferred to public 
works and government services. Yes, we want to keep the 
grounds nice. We want to keep the buildings in repair. We need 
to occasionally undertake to build a monument or something 
like that. It could be done under the aegis of the minister, with 
accountability to the people via Parliament instead of just being 
done by an unaccountable, appointed group.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9288"> 9288 </A></B>
<P>
	Canadians universally will be upset when they hear me say 
that the National Capital Commission bought new office 
furniture for around $2 million, selling their old stuff for 
$50,000. I do not know how old and how decrepit it was. Maybe 
it really was down to the place where when it was sat on the 
chairs collapsed. That is possible but I doubt it. If that were 
the case I do not know how it received $50,000 for the used 
stuff.
<P>
	In these times of restraint it would be totally appropriate to 
say, okay, it would be nice to have $2 million worth of new 
furniture, but perhaps in deference to the taxpayer we should not 
spend it. Perhaps we ought to be under budget instead of 
working so hard to spend every penny that is allocated in the 
budget.
<P>
	The NCC now has a new building that occupies 11 floors. It is 
larger than most city halls. We have an organization just in this 
city, aside from the city hall organization, occupying 11 floors 
in a building with $2 million worth of new furniture. I am upset 
with that. I represent all of the citizens in Elk Island and I 
believe most people across the country would agree when I say 
that is an obscenity which has to be stopped.
<P>
	I know it is nice to have a beautiful family rendezvous centre 
on Sussex Drive for $250,000, but when we cannot afford it that 
is when you say it is a lower level of priority.
<P>
	I would like to point out to the members here and to all 
Canadian citizens that when I say we need to get the horse 
moving it is not just rhetoric. It is not just trying to make a point. 
There have been some accusations even today about the Reform 
Party trying to gain popularity by making the tax revolt thing. 
We did not cause it. We were talking to citizens who were telling 
us increasingly that the deficit must be brought under control.
<P>
	What is the government's plan? I will round off the numbers 
so I do not have to read them all. The income of government is 
around $120 billion per year. It spends $160 billion; hence it 
needs to borrow $40 billion. As a result of this bill and the 
savings that are promoted by it, which I cannot really figure out, 
when I add up the numbers in the document that we were given 
they come to $5.9 million. I believe the minister said the savings 
would be $15 million. The member for the Bloc said it was going 
to save $1 million. I guess at this stage we do not have any solid 
accounting for how much it will save. However, if we take the 
safe number of $15 million how big a dent does that make in the 
deficit? Instead of having to borrow $40 billion we now have to 
borrow $39,985,000,000. Big deal. It is almost insignificant.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	I was a math teacher in my previous life. I taught for 31 years. 
Let us look at this as if it were proportioned down to a family. 
Let us say that a family has an income of $48,000. If it was 
patterned along the Canadian government that family would be 
spending $64,000 a year. With a family income of $48,000 it has 
to borrow  every year $16,000 in order to keep going with its 
spending patterns which it is not willing to give up.
<P>
	That family would have to reduce spending or get more 
income. If more income was not available it would have to 
reduce its spending by $16,000 a year in order not to go further 
into debt.
<P>
	It is illustrative to look at the Liberals' projection and their 
goals. We hear so often-and this is wonderful-the Prime 
Minister and the Minister of Finance saying, ``We will meet our 
goals''. The minister was very clear. That is great.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> Go ahead and applaud. It is a wonderful goal.
<P>
	Again, if you look at the goal in terms of the family, it would 
bring its borrowing down to $10,000 per year from $16,000. 
That is the goal. In other words, it is still going into debt $10,000 
per year.
<P>
	What does this bill do to reduce the deficit? For this family, 
which is spending $64,000 a year and borrowing $16,000, it 
reduces its annual spending by $6,000.
<P>
	Yes, it is important. But I am saying let us get the horses 
moving. It is good to save $6, but we need to save $16,000. That 
is the proportion that this bill proposes to save in our budget. I 
am appealing to hon. members in the government who have the 
responsibility, who have the power to do something about it: Let 
us get with it. The longer we wait the harder it gets. While this is 
good, we are wasting a whole day talking about pennies when we 
should be talking about the billions that are threatening the 
well-being of all of our citizens and, indeed, this whole country.
<P>
	I am very pleased the government is heading in this direction. 
But from all of the information and all of the input that I get, not 
only from residents in the Elk Island constituency but from right 
across the country who write to us in huge volumes, it is 
becoming very urgent that we reduce our deficit. Let us get on 
with it.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> We will now proceed to 
the next stage of the debate where members will have up to a 
maximum of 20-minute interventions, subject to 10 minutes of 
questions or comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John English (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be 
sharing my time with the hon. member for Outremont.
<P>
	I would like to respond before I begin debate on this bill to the 
points raised by the hon. member for Elk Island. One of his 
specific remarks was when he talked about the agency review 
being conducted in secrecy. In fact, there will be a report on the 
process which will explain what the process was, how it was 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9289"> 9289 </A></B>
<P>
carried out and what the results will be. That report will be 
appearing very shortly.
<P>
	Second, he talked about his early days with his father on the 
farm and about a tractor and a horse. He suggested that in the 
case of the Liberal government we have the horses tugging at the 
tractor but it is not yet out of the mud. In fact, if you look at the 
details of what we have done-and this touches on some 
questions which were posed earlier today-I think the hon. 
member will agree that the tractor is out of the mud and is 
moving fairly briskly.
<P>
	We have eliminated 589 governor in council positions, 
agencies close to the type we talked about. I accept the 
congratulations that he offered to the government for what we 
have achieved. In fact, we have made only 700 appointments to 
agencies, boards and commissions. Despite what the hon. 
member suggested, some of these boards and commissions such 
as the National Archives Advisory Board are essential to the 
operation of the government. It brings to government the advice 
of ordinary citizens of the type we hear of so often from 
members of the Reform Party, and rightly so in that respect.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	Even the <I>Globe and Mail</I>, when trying to find information on 
this particular matter, could identify only 80 of the 700 
appointments we have made with the Liberal Party. To give 
members an idea of how the tractor is moving very quickly, in 
the period November 4, 1991 to February 3, 1993, the previous 
government, the Conservatives-and I recognize that the hon. 
member was not a part of that government-made 1,819 
appointments. In summary, the Liberal Party has abolished 589 
of these positions and has appointed only 700. The previous 
government in exactly the same number of days appointed 
almost four times as many as the number we did. That is not 
quite the right math, but it is close enough for my friend who was 
a mathematics teacher.
<P>
	Having made these comments it is my pleasure to begin 
debate on Bill C-65. This bill, as the minister indicated earlier, 
amends the statutes that established 15 federal boards, agencies 
or commissions in order to reorganize the boards or reduce the 
number of members and to dissolve seven other federal 
organizations. The passage of the bill will eliminate and 
streamline the operations of these federal agencies and will 
improve their efficiency and their service to Canadians.
<P>
	Why are we doing this? We are doing this because we know 
that the world is changing rapidly and government must as well. 
In order to remain a strong competitor in the marketplace, as a 
country we need to adapt to the new challenges we face in the 
global environment. To remain competitive we know that we 
must, as the private sector has, undergo an unprecedented period 
of change and restructuring. We recognize the inevitability of 
change and we are committed to bringing good and efficient 
government to Canadians. In managing this  change we wish to 
do it in a fashion that is fair, careful and never casual.
<P>
	Earlier the hon. member for Elk Island talked about the 
possibility of abolishing certain boards quickly. We have carried 
out a careful process that looks at what the boards do. I would 
suggest that if members look at the list of boards they will find 
many with whose functions they agree in their entirety. They 
will also find many boards that are carrying out functions that 
are essential to the operation of government.
<P>
	The danger, as the member for Carleton-Charlotte said to 
me, to make an analogy to another animal, the cow, the Reform 
Party cow if you like, may give a good pail of milk but it will 
then kick the pail over. We do not want to do that. We want to 
look at the agencies that work and many of them are working 
very well.
<P>
	The Public Service of Canada is an effective and efficient 
public service by any measure internationally and it has over the 
past provided Canadians with services of the highest quality. 
Where services are duplicated, and they are, they will be merged 
and streamlined. Where agencies and boards are obsolete they 
must be eliminated. In other words, the government must 
continue to serve our taxpayers effectively but it must do so in 
alignment with their needs and with less resources.
<P>
	We promised Canadians in the red book that we would renew 
government and reduce its size and unnecessary cost. As part of 
the initiative, the finance minister announced in his budget last 
year that a review of all federal agencies would take place. That 
review has been conducted under the leadership of the Minister 
responsible for Public Service Renewal. The objective, as it was 
set out in that review, was to eliminate unnecessary or inactive 
organizations, streamline operations by examining the size of 
boards and the remuneration of members; ensure that the role of 
these bodies was geared to meet the challenges of today and the 
demands of the years ahead. Those were the criteria for the 
decisions made about these boards.
<P>
	The first decisions were announced in July of last year by the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. These announcements 
reflected the recommendations given to the minister by the 
individual ministers responsible for agencies. They included the 
Ministers of Canadian Heritage, Finance, Fisheries and Oceans, 
Health and National Defence as well as the Minister responsible 
for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency.
<P>
<B>(1545 ) </B>
<P>
	This bill then is the first of two omnibus bills to implement 
through legislation the streamlining measures for agencies and 
boards announced since this government took office. It also 
allows for the streamlining of the operations of a number of 
agencies, boards and commissions by reducing the number of 
board members, as has been done with the boards of the Canada 
Council and Petro-Canada, folding one organization into 
another, as in the case of Emergency Preparedness Canada 
which  was 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9290"> 9290 </A></B>
<P>
folded into the Department of National Defence, the kind of 
approach the member recommended earlier, or combining 
functions of organizations such as merging the Procurement 
Review Board of Canada with the Canadian International Trade 
Tribunal.
<P>
	When these decisions were announced the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> 
wrote an editorial congratulating the government: ``Yuletide is a 
traditional season of political patronage appointments with a 
generous distribution of partisan favours at public expense, so it 
is especially happy news that 314 patronage positions have just 
been abolished by the Chrétien government''.
<P>
	It goes on to point out that not all these boards are bad and that 
patronage sometimes serves a good purpose: ``Boards and 
commissions can do work beyond the competence of the public 
service sometimes and patronage in its place can allow a 
government to choose the people it wants to execute policies it 
was elected to advance. Jean Chrétien's ministers are right to 
scrutinize these governor in council positions, all 3,000 or them, 
one by one'', which is what we are doing. ``If patronage 
appointments are not doing something essential to the public 
interest or doing it better than public servants could, the 
positions should be eliminated''.
<P>
	That is the criterion we have employed.
<P>
	In conclusion, the agency review was conducted in 
conjunction with a number of other reviews, including the 
program review which has examined federal programs and 
services as well as policy reviews.
<P>
	This process of examination will not come to an end with the 
formal completion of the agency review but will, members have 
suggested earlier, continue as an integral part of providing 
Canadian taxpayers with value for their money.
<P>
	We know the importance of meeting our commitment to 
provide Canadians with good government. Improving how our 
nation is governed remains a priority with this government.
<P>
	The bill before us makes sensible changes in a reasonable way 
while ensuring national interest is served. It will result in 
administrative savings and increased efficiency and delivery of 
government. I would urge hon. members to ensure speedy 
passage of this legislation because it is the kind of bill that all 
members can support. The Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> said in December: 
``Marcel Massé is on the right side. He is on the side of fairness, 
flexibility and efficiency in government''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
member for Kitchener for his very well reasoned, prepared 
speech. It was well delivered.
<P>
	I want to say something about this farm analogy which 
occurred to me the instant he said it. He indicated that he thought 
Reformers, after the pail was full of milk, would then kick over 
the pail-not so. We are more committed than anybody around 
here to very carefully carrying that pail because it is not our 
milk. It belongs to the taxpayers.
<P>
	Also, the thought occurred to me that before they kneel down 
on the stool beside the cow, they are forgetting to check whether 
the pail has a bottom. Theirs does not. When putting $120 
billion a year into the government coffers as Canadian taxpayers 
are and there is $160 billion coming out of the bottom, we know 
the hole at the bottom is larger than the input at the top. That is 
an item of great concern.
<P>
	I want to ask the member to respond to a question having to do 
with the urgency of reducing the deficit. Does he 
acknowledge-I know he cannot speak for the other members of 
his party-that the leadership of that party is an item of great 
concern to thinking Canadians because of the rapidly growing 
debt? Even if they are on target they are going to be adding 
roughly $80 billion to $100 billion to the debt before this 
Parliament is finished. Even very modest interest rates of 5 per 
cent indicate an additional cost of $5 billion per year. Just 
having the debt grow at this rate adds basically one-eighth to 
our present deficit without any additional programs being 
financed.
<P>
<B>(1550 ) </B>
<P>
	What I would like to hear just one Liberal member say is it is 
time they attack this, attack it vigorously and quickly and very 
effectively to get government spending down.
<P>
	<B>Mr. English:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am confident that the member 
when he sees the budget when it is produced probably later this 
month will see that this government is serious about the deficit. 
We have given every indication in public statements by the 
Prime Minister, in statements by the Minister of Finance who 
has engaged in a very long process of consultation, longer than 
any other consultation by previous finance ministers. He has 
done so with a commitment to fighting this deficit and of course 
by implication the debt.
<P>
	In terms of the debate about various animals there is a 
difficulty with the Reform Party's approach to government and 
we can talk about <I>Animal Farm</I>. There is a slogan in that book: 
``Two legs good, four legs bad''. What I find troubling, with 
respect, about the criticisms of agencies which I heard from the 
hon. member for Elk Island is that all the agencies were lumped 
together.
<P>
	If we actually look at the list of agencies affected by this 
legislation we see that some of them are essential. As I said 
before the National Archives of Canada advisory board decides 
independently apart from the bureaucracy what documents must 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9291"> 9291 </A></B>
<P>
be kept. I am certain the hon. member would not want to entrust 
to the public service the decision on which documents generated 
by  bureaucrats should be kept. Obviously it has to be private 
citizens with some knowledge of the subject.
<P>
	The Canadian cultural properties export review board looks at 
the value of properties that are exported in terms of their value 
as part of our national heritage. These are essential boards with 
activities that are best done by private citizens appointed to 
these boards.
<P>
	In terms of appointments we can see that these boards are 
being reduced in size. We are eliminating positions where they 
are not necessary. It seems to me that anyone would agree a lot 
of these agencies are essential.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin Cauchon (Outremont, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like, first of all, to thank the parliamentary secretary for 
sharing his time with me.
<P>
	I should say from the start that I am very proud to be able to 
contribute to the efforts made by the minister in charge and the 
government in general.
<P>
	Bill C-65, an act to reorganize and dissolve certain federal 
agencies, is a piece of legislation that fits into what we could 
call changing times. It is no secret that governments the world 
over are facing dramatic changes. Canada is embarking on a 
significant economic realignment. The same is happening in 
Europe and in many other areas of the world. Free trade zones 
which will define our future and create the jobs of tomorrow are 
being created everywhere.
<P>
	When I talk of major realignment, I am thinking of the major 
changes that are taking place, changes that we must accept in 
Canada and to which we must adapt. To face these changes, we, 
the Canadian government, must essentially rethink the role of 
the state. Speaking of reforming and rethinking the 
government's role, you will remember that when the current 
government came to power in 1993, the Prime Minister declared 
in this House that we would be proceeding with four major 
reforms, which essentially aim to rethink government's role in 
order to better serve the interests of taxpayers as a whole. That is 
our role as the government, and that is our task as elected 
representatives.
<P>
	Speaking of four reforms, I think I should take the time to list 
them. These four reforms are the cornerstones of the 
government's policy.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	There is the reform of Canada's economic structure, which 
will now lead the government to concentrate its efforts on small 
and medium size businesses, which, as we know, create 85 per 
cent of all jobs in the country.
<P>
	There is also the reform of taxation. The parliamentary 
secretary stressed earlier that we will obviously have a clear 
idea of what the current government means by tax reform when 
it tables its budget at the end of the month. Let us also talk about 
a major reform, a most comprehensive reform, on which a 
partial report was tabled yesterday: the reform of social 
programs. These programs make us the envy of many countries 
around  the world and ensure that we Canadians have in common 
the values of co-operation, sharing and tolerance. And lastly, 
there is the fourth reform we are dealing with today, the reform 
of the government machine.
<P>
	I am proud to support this bill because of its intrinsically very 
modern and dynamic vision of what the government should 
resemble in 1995. The objective of this bill is to reorganize 22 
government agencies. Of these 22 agencies, 15 will be 
completely dissolved. As a result, firstly, approximately $1.5 
million will be saved annually. But given the vision of the 
present government, the machinery of government will be much 
more flexible, much lighter, closer to the population and, 
obviously, will be called upon to deliver much more appropriate 
service. This is our role in government, as parliamentarians, and 
I am proud because that is the desired objective of this bill.
<P>
	You know that Bill C-65 represents a continuation of the 
government's policy of reforming the government machinery 
since the minister has already taken certain other steps in this 
regard and, in sum, there are presently 119 agencies in Canada 
which have been reorganized, some of which have of course 
been dissolved.
<P>
	Reorganizing the machinery of government also involves new 
policies. People are looking for clear and straightforward 
policies, with government structures existing solely to serve the 
public. And when we speak of streamlining the machinery of 
government, which this bill addresses, we are meeting the needs 
of the people as a whole in this regard, too.
<P>
	When the Conservatives were in power, from November 1991 
to February 1993, they appointed a total of 1,819 of their friends 
to these quasi-governmental agencies; these 1,819 partisan 
appointments did not in any way serve the interests of the 
taxpayer. So there you have Liberal government policy, a policy 
issued by a government which regards itself as, and indeed is, 
very progressive.
<P>
	This bill of ours is indeed a dynamic one. It shows the 
commitment of the government to tackling the real problems. It 
also shows that our government is a responsible government, 
and fiscally responsible as well. That is what the Canadian 
people as a whole expect.
<P>
	Of course, on the subject of responsible government, I must 
admit that, if you compare what is being accomplished in this 
House to what the separatist government is doing in Quebec, the 
contrast is quite striking.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	While we, in Ottawa, are downsizing, trying to have a system 
that will serve the people better, the separatist government in 
Quebec wastes public money, as you know, on the famous 
commission on the future of Quebec, a regional commission that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9292"> 9292 </A></B>
<P>
will cost at the very least between $5 and $6 million to the 
Quebec taxpayers. And this commission will deal with a biased 
bill in which only one option is considered, it being, of  course, 
the separation of Quebec, the option advocated by the Parti 
Quebecois as well as all the members of the Bloc Quebecois in 
this place.
<P>
	The problem with these people is that, basically, 
fundamentally, they are not there to serve the interests of the 
taxpayers and the people of Quebec, but the very narrow 
interests of a group of people with one political purpose in mind, 
namely the separation of Quebec.
<P>
	I for one am convinced that the step we are taking with this 
bill, the policies put forward by this government, will show the 
people of Canada and Quebec that you can go a long way with a 
government who has vision, a government intent on building. In 
that context, I am convinced that, in the referendum, the people 
of Quebec will tell the separatists that they have had enough of 
this squandering of public funds and, from now on, that they 
want their political leaders to deal with real problems and help 
improve the standard of living in Quebec and build a better 
Quebec as part of what I might call the Canadian coalition, as 
part of the Canadian federation.
<P>
	Coalitions, huge trade zones are the way of the future, and 
Quebec wants to be a part of this. The people of Quebec are very 
broad-minded. They will never stand for the narrow and obtuse 
view represented by separation, because it is not in their 
interests.
<P>
	This being said, let me tell you again, Mr. Speaker, how proud 
I am to join in the minister's efforts in support of this bill which 
is basically aimed at the renewal of federal administration and 
government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am surprised but when we know how the member 
who spoke before me is out of touch with Quebec reality, his 
vision of things should not come as a big surprise.
<P>
	I wish to remind him that the government which, according to 
him, does not meet people's expectations was elected by 45 per 
cent of voters on September 12, 1994, that it was committed to 
holding a referendum on sovereignty and that even the Prime 
Minister wanted this referendum to be held as soon as possible.
<P>
	Of course, when we look at the democratic process under way 
in Quebec from his perspective, no nation in the world is 
currently undergoing such a process in order to define itself, to 
say how it wants to prepare for the 21st century. Of course, that 
is not consistent with the centralizing vision of the government, 
which thinks that the truth can be found only in Ottawa, and we 
can see the results.
<P>
	These results include the Axworthy reform, which required a 
five-week tour of Canada so that people could say time and 
again to the Liberal majority that a two-level UI system did not 
make sense. This required five weeks of consultations across 
Canada. I think that people throughout Quebec should have their 
say on how Quebec should define itself as a country. People are 
currently participating in all the different commissions.
<P>
	People are flocking to say what kind of Quebec they want, to 
express their agreement with the bill tabled by the Quebec 
government, to say that Quebec belongs to them and that they 
have the right to define it as they see fit.
<P>
	As for his opinion that coalitions are the way of the future, he 
should keep in mind that 28 new countries have joined the UN in 
the last 10 years and that, with free trade, it is no longer 
necessary to be a large political entity to reach major markets.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	Small countries can have access to large economic markets 
and do very well on international markets.
<P>
	It is not true that countries must be very big to hold their own 
in the new global economy. This theory is not consistent with 
current reality.
<P>
	If, instead of holding a forum on health care without inviting 
the provinces, instead of using their majority to set aside a 
proposal to hear provincial authorities during the Axworthy 
reform hearings, the Liberal government had decided to hold 
real consultations while respecting the structure and jurisdiction 
of each level of government, we would have ended up with a 
much more democratic process, as the Quebec government's 
current process will be.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cauchon:</B> Mr. Speaker, it goes without saying that the 
remarks of my colleague from the Bloc Quebecois do not 
surprise me either. He says that I am out of touch with reality. 
The members of the Bloc are welcome to look at my schedule to 
see who spent the most time in Quebec.
<P>
	I can assure you that no member of the Bloc Quebecois was 
more present in Quebec than I was during the past year.
<P>
	My honourable colleague from the Bloc wants to teach me a 
thing or two about democracy. He should start by looking at the 
actions of the Parizeau government in Quebec to see how 
democracy can be distorted, to see the shameful things that are 
taking place in Quebec as we speak. A democracy in shackles, 
Mr. Speaker!
<P>
	In order to present the whole picture, Mr. Johnson's party 
asked for permission to distribute information pamphlets using 
government facilities. It was refused. And they call this 
democracy, they who use their majority to go ahead with 
commissions, the sole purpose of which is to secure Quebec's 
separation, by 
<P>

<B><A NAME="9293"> 9293 </A></B>
<P>
any means possible. They are afraid of finding out what 
Quebecers really think, and this is the reason for this tainted 
process.
<P>
	What is taking place in Quebec is shameful, truly shameful. 
There is much we could say about what is going on there. Take 
Mr. Parizeau's trips abroad. I regularly have the opportunity to 
travel abroad as a French speaking Quebecer, as a member of 
Parliament, and I am proud to be from Quebec, when I find 
myself in another country, and to be able to negotiate with other 
countries as an equal. But when I see Mr. Parizeau seeking the 
blessing of other nations, seeking their views on whether or not 
to go the independence route, I am no longer proud. I feel almost 
like some poor colonial when I see their cap in hand behaviour 
on the international scene.
<P>
	Quebec is greater than that. It is a great province, great on its 
own merits. It has made its mark within Canada and we will 
continue to build this wonderful country with Quebec's best 
interests at heart.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I really 
hesitate to do this on a point of order, but Standing Order 11(2) 
clearly indicates this thing called relevance. I think we have 
strayed significantly from Bill C-65.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The member's time has 
lapsed and we will now resume debate.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion, that Bill 
C-65, an act to reorganize and dissolve certain federal agencies 
be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I rise in the House today to speak to Bill C-65, the purpose of 
which is to reorganize a number of federal agencies. I must say I 
was surprised to hear the minister refer to this bill as an example 
of renewed federalism, as an indication that the government is 
proceeding in a constructive manner and is adjusting to change.
<P>
	Earlier, I was amazed to hear the hon. member for Outremont 
referring to Bill C-65 as though the changes that were taking 
place were truly impressive. He used any number of adjectives 
to drive the point home that this bill is a major change for the 
Liberal Party and a sign of the progressive and dynamic 
initiatives being taken by the government.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9294"> 9294 </A></B>
<P>
	Well, if we take a close look at this bill, if this is supposed 
to be renewed federalism, it is not moving very fast. As the hon. 
member for the Reform Party said earlier, it may be the right 
direction but progress is slow.
<P>
	The hon. member for Outremont has the audacity to criticize 
Quebecers with regard to the proposed commission on the future 
of Quebec and to accuse us of not being democratic in our 
approach. He prefers the kind of back room democracy that 
assumes that voters, all these people who are listening, will 
believe anything.
<P>
	To claim that Bill C-65 marks an impressive change is to 
assume that people do not know enough to tell the difference 
between a thunder clap and a fart.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	Because when all is said and done, what the government has 
produced with Bill C-65 is a mere fart, a fart they are trying to 
disguise as an impressive roll of thunder, a portent of 
fundamental changes to the government's apparatus. But under 
all the rhetoric it is just a fart, and one has to call it that because 
this lingering odour of-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I was not listening to the 
interpretation. I do not know how it was translated. However, I 
would like to ask all members to co-operate by using the most 
appropriate wording possible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> Mr. Speaker, to use a more stylish 
expression, let us say that there is a significant gap between 
reality and what is being proposed. If we put things in 
perspective, we realize that the federal Liberal government is 
making fun of people, as did the hon. member for Outremont 
when he exaggerated with a little smile on his face.
<P>
	Bill C-65 does provide for the reorganization of certain 
agencies and commissions. The number of members of some 15 
boards is reduced from 12 to nine, while other agencies are 
dissolved. For example, the Canadian saltfish corporation is 
abolished, and it is not too soon. After all, it has been a long time 
since there was any saltfish to sell; yet, that corporation is still 
in existence. Such a measure is obviously appropriate, as are all 
the other changes proposed in Bill C-65. These changes 
obviously make a lot of sense.
<P>
	I could mention other examples. In the past, there were such 
excesses that the least we can do is to make these cuts; in fact, 
we should go even farther. Indeed, this is the problem with this 
bill: the government barely cuts into the fat because, once again, 
there is the issue of patronage, of appointments made by the 
government to reward long time members and friends of the 
party, as well as those who helped get the Prime Minister 
elected. All in all, some 125 patronage positions, out of a total of 
close to 3,000, are being abolished. This is a small step in the 
right direction, and we are told that it will result in savings of 
about one million dollars. This is said to be a very important 
saving for the government.
<P>
	To put this in perspective, I would like to remind you that 
while eliminating a few patronage appointments will apparently 
lead to one million dollars in savings, the government has 
already taken a few billion dollars from the unemployed in 
Canada and is constantly finding all kinds of ways to attack the 
poor. For example, with regard to public housing, 110,000 
Quebec households will soon see their rent increased by about 
30 per cent. These 110,000 households who live in low cost or 
co-operative housing are among the poorest in our society. 
Their average income is about $10,000 a year.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	The government drags its heels when it comes to making 
significant cuts in patronage appointments, and yet it does not 
hesitate to take $500 more a year from the poor, who earn just 
$10,000 a year, in order to recover $26 million. This is only in 
Quebec, but it has already happened in other provinces. The 
government has already succeeded in increasing the rent in most 
provinces.
<P>
	The government is giving the impression that it is cutting the 
fat, but it is really keeping the patronage system in place and 
making marginal cuts while increasing the burden that the 
poorest people in our society must bear.
<P>
	So I am extremely disappointed when I see Liberal members 
rise in this House to say that Bill C-65 represents an important 
shift in the Liberal policy. People should understand that Bill 
C-65 brings only minor changes.
<P>
	The elimination of 125 to 150 patronage appointments out of a 
total of nearly 3,000 is obviously a good thing; I cannot say that 
it is bad. The government is cutting some fat, but if it could 
eliminate half of these appointments, it would really show its 
willingness to reduce patronage, as it promised to do in the red 
book during the election campaign.
<P>
	The current prime minister had indeed said that he would 
change the patronage appointment process and abolish or at 
least reduce such appointments. Now, with this decision, the 
government is reducing a number of patronage appointments, 
without however changing the whole system; the patronage 
appointment system remains the same. This is only the Liberal 
version of what went on these last eight or nine years under the 
Conservatives. The same type of patronage goes on, despite all 
the promises to get rid of it.
<P>
	The director of Liberal appointments, Penny Collenette, the 
spouse of our Minister of National Defence, said in 1993, not 
long after the election of the Liberal Party, that the selection 
criteria for these appointments would rather be based on 
capacity, merit, integrity, honesty, and community service. In 
fact, Mrs. Collenette was only trying to reiterate to Canadians 
and convince them that things were about to change.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9295"> 9295 </A></B>
<P>
	But of course, her statement was refuted by Liberal Senator 
Rizzuto, a Quebec Liberal organizer, who promised in October 
1993 to find jobs for every defeated Liberal candidate. And 
indeed, he did it. In fact, a list was published recently in the 
<I>Globe and Mail</I>, containing around a hundred political 
appointments to various boards, associations, and 
commissions.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	Under the title ``It pays to be a Liberal'', the <I>Globe and Mail</I> 
published a whole page giving a list of people for whom it really 
paid to be Liberals, people like Richard Croft, director, National 
Research Council, former Liberal fund-raiser and key 
leadership organizer for the present Prime Minister; Patrick 
Lavelle, chairman, Federal Business Development Bank, 
Ontario chairman of the present Prime Minister's leadership 
campaigns in 1984 and 1990; Jack Reid, Governor General of 
Saskatchewan, chairman of the present Prime Minister's 
leadership campaign; John Cordeau, director, Petro-Canada, 
Manitoba campaign chairman for the present Prime Minister; 
David McLain, chairman, CNRail, fund-raiser in the leadership 
campaign of the present Prime Minister. I could go on.
<P>
	That is an impressive list. Interestingly enough, the Ottawa 
newspaper <I>Le Droit</I> indicates that in the 25 most important 
patronage appointments by the Liberal Party, in that long list, 
only three go to Quebecers. That does not mean there were no 
patronage appointments in Quebec. There have been many. The 
list contains the names of Benoît Choquette, Auguste 
Choquette, Margo Brousseau, a defeated candidate in 
Louis-Hébert who was appointed director of the Quebec Port 
Corporation, and many more.
<P>
	For the sake of its squeaky clean image, this Liberal 
government has established new procedures to select political 
nominees. Some people can be fooled into believing that justice 
will prevail, and that administrative procedures will secure the 
appointment of the most qualified candidate, even if he or she 
has no political affiliation.
<P>
	A certain Mr. Hall quickly came back to reality, as did many 
others when they lost potential jobs to the hands of candidates 
who had chosen the political path and who obtained the 
positions without even going through an interview.
<P>
	The Prime Minister, who knows the answers to all questions, 
says he cannot eliminate the 65 per cent portion of the 
population who has the good sense to support the Liberals. He 
will not punish people who vote the right way. According to him, 
nominations are made on the basis of skills and competence, and 
that cannot be determined unless he knows the person. What an 
unshakable logic! According to that way of thinking, no one in 
the world would ever get a job unless he or she personally knows 
the boss. Goodbye personnel manager, hello contacts.
<P>
	How strange that this government can maintain its popularity 
in spite of its inaction and its outrageous patronage. Just think, 
more than 100 Liberals profited from political nominations. I 
even read some editorials that claim that the figure is closer to 
400. What is the exact number? In any case, over a period of 
fifteen months, it represents more than one nomination a week. 
Why were Canadians and Quebecers so deeply shocked when the 
Tories practised patronage if they can now accept the Liberal 
nominations with such lack of concern?
<P>
	Whatever the reason, this government is well aware of its 
failsafe popularity and uses it shamelessly to its advantage. 
Whereas tories would place one friend in a position and 
everyone would shout murder, nowadays the Liberals make just 
as many nominations, if not more given the present pace, and all 
agree wholeheartedly that, after all, the candidate was the most 
competent one for the job. What hypocrisy on the part of the 
Liberals who, when on this side, denounced all Conservative 
patronage appointments and called them a form of political 
corruption, but now that they are in office, they ostentatiously 
play the same game, saying: See how good our judgment is, see 
how competent our candidate is. Is it not incredible how 
transparent we can be in politics?''
<P>
	The prime minister should read his speeches anew. Here is 
what he said during the election: ``I warn all my colleagues that 
they get into politics not to help themselves but to serve the 
Canadian people.'' They now realize that charity begins at 
home.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	The <I>Ottawa Citizen</I> recently contained the following:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
``The Chrétien campaign promise was emphatic and 
unequivocal. The Liberals would end nine years of Conservative 
misrule and the squalid patronage that went with it. In the 
Liberal red book's own words, a Liberal government will review 
the appointment process to ensure that necessary appointments 
are made on the basis of competence. That was the promise and a 
good one it was. Only a restoration of integrity could dispel 
public cynicism and replenish the strength of the government 
itself. But as it turned out, the Liberals have taken up the 
patronage trade with a Tory like enthusiasm''. That is from the 
Ottawa <I>Citizen</I>.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Also, there was a general outcry concerning the Liberal 
patronage appointment process. Here is what a well-known 
individual said: ``When appointing faithful slaves to various 
positions, the Liberal government has its nose in the trough, is 
bringing the cause of federalism into disrepute and is giving the 
rest of the world the impression that the Canadian political 
system is based on stupidity''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9296"> 9296 </A></B>
<P>
	I will make no secret of the fact that these comments are from 
the leader of the Reform Party who is right for once. The 
government's shameless patronage appointment process 
undermines the integrity of the Canadian system and the image 
of federalism and reinforces the people's perception that the 
system is corrupt.
<P>
	In fact, when a government is elected by making promises that 
it will not keep, when a government promises to reduce 
patronage but does not do it, and when it tries to reduce its debt 
on the back of the destitute, it is time that such a government be 
removed by the Quebec people. I think Quebecers now 
understand they will be better served by a sovereign government 
in Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Ringuette-Maltais </B><B>(Madawaska-Victoria, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have listened amusedly to the hon. 
member's remarks. He talked about loyal slaves and described 
political appointments as a shameful practice showing how 
corrupt the Canadian political system is.
<P>
	I would like to know if he has a list of the political 
appointments made by the Parizeau government and a list of the 
Quebec senior government officials who have been dismissed 
when Parizeau was elected.
<P>
	Just in the past four months, there has been a spectacular 
political appointment in Quebec that made the headlines: that of 
the president of Radio-Québec. Now the Bloc member comes 
and tells us that political appointments are used to reward loyal 
slaves and that the people of Quebec find it shameful.
<P>
	I think that when the hon. member has the chance to get out of 
here and take a good, hard look at himself in the mirror, he will 
figure out whether his approach makes sense or not. He will see 
that we are a little bit all over the place today.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I must inform my hon. 
colleaque that it was the leader of the Reform Party who spoke 
of loyal slaves. And he was right, because he was referring to the 
appointment of the governor general and the appointment of 
certain Liberals to the upper House, the other place, the Senate, 
which is perhaps the highest patronage appointment of all in the 
federal system.
<P>
	Bill C-65, in essence, may be showing only a small part of the 
big picture of patronage in the federal system. It does not tell the 
whole story about the huge amounts wasted on all those 
appointments that are made-nearly 3,000 patronage 
positions-not including all the squandering going on regarding 
the other place. Here we have 102 extremely well paid 
individuals who may or may not be doing much to further the 
cause or the well-being of ordinary people. It is the highest body 
of patronage and it is a part of the federal system.
<P>
	At present, the federal system is so mismanaged and is 
plagued with so much patronage and squandering that we are 
stuck with this incredibly huge debt, a $600 billion debt that is 
extremely difficult to reduce. Again, I think that the people of 
Quebec are getting the picture and I am sure that they are 
looking forward to the referendum to cast aside this system that 
no longer serves their interests.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Ringuette-Maltais (Madawaska-Victoria, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, indeed, I can see that the hon. member was 
unable to answer my questions on political patronage in the 
Parizeau government. Perhaps I could also point out to our 
colleague from the Bloc, when he talks about the other place, at 
a time when-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The hon. member for 
Charlevoix, on a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Asselin:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Québec-Est 
was engaged in a debate. The hon. member for 
Madawaska-Victoria rose during the period for questions and 
comments. The hon. member for Québec-Est should be the one 
who concludes the debate. This is turning into a debate between 
two members.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. Obviously, if, 
during the ten minute period for questions and comments, other 
members had indicated an intention to ask questions to the hon. 
member for Québec-Est, who had the floor, I would have 
recognized them. I asked if there were any questions or 
comments. I looked around and the hon. member for 
Madawaska-Victoria was the only to rise. Consequently, she 
still has the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank you for 
recognizing me. The Bloc member answered my question by 
alluding to the other place. However, I can tell him that it is his 
supporters, the separatist PQ party in Quebec, who formally 
opposed any change to the Senate during the last national 
referendum on the Constitution. Come on, be serious!
<P>
	The hon. member should look at what goes on in his own party 
before commenting on what takes place within other parties.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member still does not 
realize that we are not interested in changing the way the other 
place operates. We just want to get rid of it. We want to get rid of 
the other place because it is just a waste of money, like most 
patronage appointments in the federal system.
<P>
	If the federal government, if the Liberal Party really wanted to 
improve the system to reduce the debt, it could have used this 
bill to reduce the number of agencies without reducing 
efficiency. It could have used it to really reduce the number of 
members of boards of directors and committees.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9297"> 9297 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	In fact, the government could have introduced all these 
measures in one fell swoop, if it had been so inclined. Not so. 
They are doing this piecemeal to give us the impression they are 
working very hard. There will be subsequent legislation to 
implement another 125 cuts in a matter of weeks or months. Just 
to give the impression that, my goodness, this government is 
really working, although the fact is they are not doing much to 
reduce patronage. Instead, they are doing everything they can to 
get money out of the pockets of the needy, those who have no 
resources at all, like the people in substandard housing and the 
unemployed. These people are being hit, but careful how you 
treat the friends of the party. Once again, I want to make it clear 
to the hon. member that as far as the other place is concerned, we 
do not want to change it. We just want to get rid of it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully to what the hon. member was 
saying, and I must say that the hon. member has a very short 
memory. As a professed separatist although he is a 
Franco-Ontarian, he probably remembers Denis de Belleval 
who was a well-known PQ minister but nevertheless accepted 
the offer of an order in council appointment from his good friend 
Brian- we all know who that is-to the board of directors of 
VIA Rail. I wonder whether the hon. member remembers those 
appointments.
<P>
	Perhaps he also remembers, and I am sure the name will ring a 
bell, a woman in North Bay who had been appointed to the board 
of directors of CN Rail. When her appointment was announced, 
the <I>North Bay Nugget</I> interviewed her and asked:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
``Madam, why do you think you were chosen as a member of the 
board of CN Rail?''. She answered: ``I come from North Bay, a 
railroad town, and my grandfather was a well known railroader 
in the maritimes''. The individual's name was Marie Marchand 
of North Bay.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> Mr. Speaker, as far as Mr. de Belleval is 
concerned, I cannot speak for him, since this was one of the 
appointments that were made under Mr. Mulroney's 
Conservative government.
<P>
	It all goes to show that following the example of the 
Conservatives is not necessarily the best way for the Liberals to 
improve things in this country, and in fact, if we look at what the 
government is doing now, the Prime Minister is about to go 
further than the former Conservative Prime Minister, Mr. 
Mulroney, ever did. That is the problem. Meanwhile, they are 
making all these cosmetic changes but people are not easily 
fooled. They realize that the Liberal government is doing 
exactly what the Conservative Party used to do.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It is my duty pursuant to 
Standing Order 38 to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. 
member for Fraser Valley West-the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Godfrey (Don Valley West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am very pleased to address the matter of the second reading of an 
omnibus bill concerning the elimination and streamlining of 
federal agencies.
<P>
	In July of last year the Minister for Public Service Renewal 
announced the decision to eliminate 21 agencies, boards and 
advisory bodies and 275 governor in council and ministerial 
appointments.
<P>
	The bill before members today is part of that initiative to 
eliminate and streamline 15 agencies and 150 governor in 
council appointments.
<P>
	The July announcement represents a partnership initiative 
among federal ministers involving the ministers of finance, 
fisheries and oceans, government services, health, industry, 
national defence, national revenue and public works.
<P>
	As we headed into the last election the Liberal Party of 
Canada recognized that one simple question stood out in the 
minds of Canadians: What kind of a country do we want for 
ourselves and for our children?
<P>
<B>(1645 ) </B>
<P>
	Among the qualities we identified, we recognize that we want 
a country whose governments are efficient, innovative and 
co-operative, not only with each other but with other sectors as 
well.
<P>
	The red book states that as a government we have premised 
our agenda on an integrated and coherent approach to economic, 
social, environmental and foreign policy. As a government we 
want to explore innovative and creative solutions to old 
problems, looking at them from a new perspective. And as a 
government we know that it is necessary to tend to one's own 
housekeeping.
<P>
	We have therefore chosen a plan of action that will help us 
streamline government activities, make government less 
cumbersome and therefore develop better government and to 
adapt the structure of government to provide improved services 
to the public. To do this, we have to determine whether specific 
government programs, agencies, boards and advisory bodies 
actually deliver results over time.
<P>
	The omnibus bill which is before the House for second 
reading today is an important and progressive part of that 
process. Our aim is to establish better, more efficient and more 
effective government. The passage of this bill will bring us 
closer to that goal.
<P>
	Today's climate is one of change. Canada as a nation, the 
federal department, the agencies and crown corporations for the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9298"> 9298 </A></B>
<P>
Department of Canadian Heritage and the myriad components of 
government cannot  escape this one inevitability, change. Three 
factors contribute to this atmosphere of change.
<P>
	First, fiscal restraint is forcing us to rethink the way that 
governments do business. The reduction of the deficit is in the 
interest of all Canadians and constitutes a priority of our 
government.
<P>
	Second, the global village of which Marshall McLuhan wrote 
so prophetically in 1962 has become a reality. In particular, the 
globalization of world markets creates a new context for 
business and trade, a context which is increasingly important to 
Canada which is becoming more and more dependent on 
exports. This context demands that the machinery of 
government be up to date, finely honed and highly effective, 
capable of responding to an international economic 
environment in which transactions take place instantaneously.
<P>
	Finally, the relentless evolution of new technologies impels 
us to revisit the means by which we distribute products and 
services among the population. Canada, which has repeatedly 
overcome challenges of geography and climate, particularly 
today, is no stranger to revolutions in communications.
<P>
	The red book has articulated our commitment to simplify 
public sector structures and streamline operations wherever 
possible to respond to today's changing environment. We also 
want to encourage creativity and innovation in meeting 
challenges, not as problems but as opportunities.
<P>
	Toward these ends, my colleague the minister has undertaken 
this exercise which promises to bring efficiency gains. It is an 
exercise that will maximize the opportunity for the good 
governance of the work that agencies, boards and advisory 
boards do.
<P>
	Our goal is clear: to modernize the machinery of state with a 
view to rendering government more efficient and more 
responsive to the needs of the citizens which it serves.
<P>
	The Department of Canadian Heritage along with the agencies 
and crown corporations of the Canadian heritage portfolio 
participated in this renewal exercise. As a result it was a very 
collaborative, open process. There was a collegial tone to the 
consultations with full agreement achieved so that the boards 
could continue their work efficiently, effectively and with 
smaller numbers.
<P>
	A November 26 article in the Montreal <I>Gazette</I> asked the 
following question: When governments are strapped for cash 
can they afford to support culture? I can assure this House that 
culture is one of our strongest allies in building a stronger and 
more unified nation.
<P>
	As the red book states, culture is the very essence of national 
identity, the bedrock of national sovereignty and national pride. 
At a time when globalization and the information and 
communications revolutions are erasing national borders, 
Canada needs more than ever to commit itself to cultural 
development.
<P>
	The government's intention has not been to weaken Canada's 
national cultural institutions but to streamline them and to make 
them more effective and efficient. I support the July initiative to 
eliminate and streamline agencies in an equitable fashion and 
support the continued development of culture in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	The government's initiative to eliminate and streamline 
agencies underscores the reality that better more effective 
government does not necessarily mean more government, or 
that this concept is incompatible with the need to work with less. 
We can work with less without affecting quality. Canadians have 
proved that throughout our history.
<P>
	Our intention is clear: to modernize the machinery of 
government. That means reducing the parts to streamline our 
activities where applicable and thereby optimize the success of 
board appointments. This provides some assurance to Canadians 
by placing the onus on governments to make good 
appointments, appointments that are necessary and that are 
made on the basis of competence.
<P>
	As a result in the area of Canadian heritage I support such 
measures as reducing the size of the Canada Council, as well as 
the boards of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the 
federal museums and the National Film Board to name a few. 
Together these reductions will account for 85 government in 
council positions and 10 ministerial appointments.
<P>
	This process of streamlining will not adversely affect the 
development, support of, or dissemination of Canadian cultural 
expression. Culture is not simply an expression of the 
artistically inclined or spiritual abstract. Culture infuses every 
dimension of society. There is an inextricable connection 
between the cultural sector and its contribution to the economy.
<P>
	I am among those who cannot imagine a society, a viable and 
vibrant society, without culture. Our challenge goes beyond that 
of mere economic stability. Our challenge is to protect the sector 
whose role and vocation is to give a sense of what it is to be 
Canadian, to be a witness to our collective consciousness. In 
fact, I am among those who believe that as a society it will be our 
culture that will affirm our position and strength in the 
community of nations in today's global village.
<P>
	It is incumbent upon us therefore to go forward to maintain 
the gains that we have made as a nation. We must adapt to the 
new realities that confront and challenge us and move forward 
on a solid foundation of effective and responsive government. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9299"> 9299 </A></B>
<P>
This is our most profound challenge. I believe that our 
government is  helping to position Canada and Canadians not 
just to meet that challenge but to surpass it.

do thank all of my colleagues in the House for their indulgence. I 
am embarrassed and will continue.
<P>
	I rise today to speak to Bill C-65, an omnibus bill designed to 
streamline or eliminate a number of federal agencies. This bill 
legislatively dissolves seven agencies that have outlived their 
purposes and purports to restructure the boards of 15 other 
agencies or commissions.
<P>
	As per its normal course of action, the party in power has done 
nothing more than mount a finely orchestrated public relations 
campaign. It is highly rhetorical, evidencing little substance.
<P>
	This bill fails to take into account the dismal fiscal realities 
we live in. It fails to address the issue of accountability, making 
the activities of these boards and agencies open and accountable 
to the Canadian taxpayer. On this issue of our dismal fiscal 
reality we are now hearing what Canadians want and most 
certainly what they do not want.
<P>
	People in this country are outraged that our government has 
been in an out of control spending mode for two decades. Our 
nation is like a Hollywood front, all glitter and glass purchased 
on borrowed money with nothing of substance holding it up.
<P>
	It is a stunning picture of the reality of this House that 
Parliament has not directly acted to cut expenditures since the 
minority Parliament of 1972-74. Even in that situation where 
the government lacked a controlling majority, the House of 
Commons achieved only two small cuts amounting in total to 
$20,000.
<P>
	To give a sense of proportion, since the current procedure for 
committee review of estimates was initiated in 1969, Parliament 
has authorized about $2 trillion worth of expenditures. This 
means Parliament has made cuts that represent only 
one-millionth of one per cent of total expenditures it had 
approved.
<P>
	I oppose this bill, however I have to acknowledge the 
miserable attempt to legislatively eliminate seven already 
defunct federal organizations. I understand more agencies will 
be dissolved and I look forward to seeing those changes 
implemented.
<P>
	What truly concerns me about this bill is the lack of 
commitment by the government to really effect change in those 
boards that remain functioning. Its downsizing efforts are 
encouraging, but I believe any comprehensive review of these 
boards must include a review of how appointments to those 
boards and agencies are made, and a complete review of their 
budgets and spending.
<P>
	According to the government's own figures this bill will 
eliminate a mere 150 GIC appointments and save a paltry $1 
million.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	Surely this bill could have aspired to embrace more 
significant change. This whole exercise becomes a waste of time 
when other appointments are springing up as these are 
disappearing. A case in point is the new tourism commission 
with a new budget of $50 million and no agenda. It is brand new 
and has no agenda.
<P>
	Rather than merely changing the title of chairman to 
chairperson of each board, I believe the minister for public 
service renewal should have included clauses in this bill to make 
these boards and agencies open, accountable and responsible.
<P>
	Criteria should be developed and implemented to prevent the 
patronage process from taking over future GIC appointments. 
To demonstrate the changes necessary, let us briefly look at the 
current state of the councils and agencies affected by this bill.
<P>
	The Canada Council had a $100 million dollar budget last 
year. Do we know if this money was well spent? Is the council 
being held accountable? We have no idea regarding the effec-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9300"> 9300 </A></B>
<P>
tiveness of the council. It was not part of the government's 
review, but it should have been.
<P>
	It is even more interesting that the current chairman of the 
council appointed in May 1994 is Donna Scott, a former 
provincial Liberal candidate in Ontario. Is she the best candidate 
for the job? I do not know. We do not know.
<P>
	As Susan Delacourt of the <I>Globe and Mail</I> recently 
discovered, it seems the Liberals have a two-tiered process for 
appointments. There is one for qualified candidates and one for 
faithful Liberals.
<P>
	Patronage is not only limited to the Canada Council. Several 
other agencies in this bill have been affected. Let us look at the 
National Capital Commission.
<P>
	The NCC's decisions are mired in secrecy and there seems to 
be universal demand that it be more open. Yet the current 
Minister of Canadian Heritage has no plans to enforce 
significant change at the NCC. He is reported to have said, and 
one wonders where his brain was when he said this: ``On 
accountability for the NCC it is a bit more tricky because it is not 
an elected body''. It is spending my tax dollars and those of the 
other members.
<P>
	It should be noted that one of the NCC's members is Pierre 
Isabelle, the son of a former Liberal MP from Hull. The list 
continues. Andrew Ogarcenko, the director of the National Arts 
Centre is a well known Winnipeg Liberal supporter.
<P>
	The Cultural Property Export Review Board appointed a new 
chairman in November 1994. Mr. Ian Christie Clark was the 
special adviser to a Liberal Secretary of State who founded the 
CPERB. He was also its founding chairperson in the late 1970s. 
He lost that position under the Tories, but like a proverbial 
yo-yo, Mr. Clark has returned to the post he created for himself.
<P>
	The National Film Board is in dire need of change. Michael 
Spencer, a respected National Film Board executive from 1946 
to 1967 and the founding boss of what is now Telefilm Canada 
has advocated chopping the NFB's annual $80 million budget in 
half. To date this government's response to the ongoing problem 
at the NFB has been to decrease the number of NFB board 
members by two. Those are earth shattering reforms indeed.
<P>
	How can the government hope to effect real change in the 
public service without addressing these concerns? In this era of 
fiscal restraint, the Canadian taxpayer has to be assured the 
advisory boards and councils are being held accountable for the 
money they spend.
<P>
	They need ironclad guarantees that these organizations will 
not be subject to patronage appointments but are staffed with the 
most qualified people available. Unfortunately, Bill C-65 does 
not provide the Canadian taxpayer with these guarantees.
<P>
<B>(1710 ) </B>
<P>
	Liberal loyalty in this country is rewarded with jobs, jobs, 
jobs, and all of them are patronage based appointments. Stay 
tuned, Canada, because even now the turnover in our legal 
community, which is another patronage based organization, is 
beginning to rattle through the provinces. Liberal linked 
lawyers and not Conservatives are now being chosen to act as 
agents for federal cases in provincial courts.
<P>
	Legal agents, as I understand it, are the law firms that receive 
work, parcelled out by the government, and mostly handle drug 
prosecutions. In 1993-94 about 600 firms were legal agents and 
billed Ottawa for nearly $45 million. The system has been a 
traditional form of patronage.
<P>
	Legal patronage has not been a flawless process for our Prime 
Minister's government. The Progressive Conservative 
appointees who have been tossed out are now suing prominent 
Liberals and making the issue public.
<P>
	Some Liberals resent that party loyalists have not been 
appointed faster. That is scandalous.
<P>
	Historically, new governments lost no time dropping 
hundreds of agents and replacing them with party loyalists. Our 
justice minister, to his credit, has tried to proceed more slowly. 
He wants to overhaul the system by replacing the number of 
agents and introducing guidelines. Wanting to is very different 
from acting, and we are waiting.
<P>
	Some Liberals feel our justice minister made them lose face 
by failing to provide patronage plums fast enough to supporters. 
They believe competent candidates should not be discarded 
because they are Liberals. At the same time, talk of reform has 
set high expectations so replacing any Conservative lawyers 
would make the government look hypocritical.
<P>
	This is the cynical and corrupt face of patronage, no matter 
where it exists at any level of government today. I hear hon. 
members of this House smacking one another on the side of the 
head because they have this patronage in the Liberal 
government. Then we have Mr. Parizeau's government involved 
and they smack them up a little. What we are looking at is a 
corrupt system and that has to change.
<P>
	I ask you, Mr. Speaker, in my closing comments, where is the 
accountability to the Canadian people? Where is our 
responsibility as elected representatives to the Canadian 
people? Where is the consistency of members of Parliament so 
we truly represent one another and ensure that these councils, 
boards, agencies and commissions are truly open to the 
Canadian people?
<P>
	So much for the Liberal red book promises of a fair system.
<P>

<B><A NAME="9301"> 9301 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roger Simmons (Burin-St. George's, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I too want to make a few comments on this bill. I have 
spent some time in opposition myself, both here in this 
Chamber and in the Newfoundland House of Assembly, and I 
see that the members of the opposition have recognized this bill 
for what it is, in part, and that is an opportunity for the 
opposition to have some fun with a number of issues.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cummins:</B> It is serious business.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> I will talk about the serious business of this 
bill, but first, why should my hon. friend from Delta deny me 
some of the fun?
<P>
	I notice my hon. friend from Cariboo-Chilcotin trotted out 
his tractor anecdote once again today. I missed part of it so I do 
not know what colour the tractor was today. Was it green or blue 
like the last time? I say to him that some time he should tell us 
about the cow that having given the full pail of milk, good 
wholesome milk, was manoeuvred into kicking over the pail. I 
am not suggesting of course that my friend from 
Cariboo-Chilcotin or his colleagues are a bunch of cows. They 
are not that at all. Some could accuse them of being the people 
trying to manoeuvre the productive cow into wasting something 
that has been produced.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	I digress. I say to my friend from Lotbinière that I notice that 
patronage is getting a fairly full workout here this afternoon, 
and so it should. Patronage has always been with us and always 
will be, and so it should.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I say through you to my friend from Calgary 
North, hear it in context. I said patronage has always been with 
us, always will be, and so it should. Before she gets too 
disbelieving I invite her to hear it in context. I was about to say 
that members of this Chamber practise patronage in your 
families on a regular basis, in your church and your community 
organizations. You regularly reach out to those people you know 
or can trust. That is not to imply that all the people you do not 
know you cannot trust. It is just that you do not know whether 
you can trust them because you have not yet met them.
<P>
	What is so surprising if in that church group, community 
group, that municipal council or whatever the group may be, you 
reach out to somebody whose credentials you know, whose 
people skills you know when you want a job done. I repeat, that 
is not to suggest that all the people you do not know in this world 
are not to be trusted.
<P>
	It is no accident that if a Liberal government is in power a 
number of the appointments will be people who are known 
Liberals. It would be no accident that if a Reform government 
were in power some of the appointments would be Reform 
appointments. The law of averages alone takes care of that. If we 
had to exclude all the people who either voted Liberal or were 
active in the Liberal cause over the years, we would virtually 
exclude the entire population of Canada.
<P>
	Is anybody suggesting that the label itself ought to be a 
disincentive? There is more to it than that. Let me construct an 
example for members. If I am an employer and have an opening 
and there are two applicants for a particular position, both of 
whom have equal credentials, equal qualifications, equal 
experience and I know one and I do not know the other, I am 
going to hire the one I know. The principle stands that the devil 
you know is better than the devil you do not know, to put it in the 
vernacular. More generically, the person you know is better than 
the person you do not know. By definition if you do not know the 
second person there may be something about that second person, 
which despite the paper qualifications, despite the experience, 
has something less to commend him or her to the job. In its 
purest form that is patronage.
<P>
	I believe what my friends are talking about is something 
different altogether. They may not have the courage to put the 
term on it. I think what they are talking about is corrupt 
patronage.
<P>
	I return to my example. I the employer have two people in 
front of me applying for a position. The person I know does not 
know a row of beans about the job. The second person, whom I 
do not know, has good credentials, commends himself or herself 
to the job in every way, comes through well in the interview. 
Despite all that I hire the person I know. That is the beginning of 
corrupt patronage. That is the tail wagging the dog. That is the 
employer in the example using something other than his head. 
That example itself may not be corrupt but it is certainly stupid 
to rush out and hire the person because you know him rather than 
the person who can do the job. However, that is the beginning of 
corrupt patronage.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	Governments over the years, Tory governments, have 
practised some corrupt patronage and Liberals have practised 
corrupt patronage but that does not make it right. I submit that 
we cannot go back and undo the elections of many years past 
with the people who sat in Liberal cabinets or Liberal 
governments or headed Liberal governments and Tory 
governments over the years. I mention those two parties because 
they are the only two strains we have had at the federal level. I 
could go to the provincial level and talk about governments of 
other stripes, including Social Credit and NDP. We all know the 
range of governments we have had in Canada heading provincial 
and federal administrations. There was the Union Nationale in 
the province of Quebec and other governments. We cannot go 
back and rerun those elections.
<P>
	Therefore I submit that the only credentials we can examine 
now are the credentials of the present administration which is 
the administration which will be accountable in the next 
election. Before we are all tarred with the same brush, hear some 
of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9302"> 9302 </A></B>
<P>
the facts. Has this government appointed Liberals? Yes, it has 
and I can give  this House a good list of them. Has it appointed 
people of other stripes? Yes, and I can give this House a good list 
of those as well. However, that ought not to be the governing 
criterion as to what the person's party label was.
<P>
	I will return to my example again. If that minister is selecting 
a person for a board only on the basis of his label or on the basis 
of who he knows versus who he does not know rather than on the 
basis of the competence of that person to do that job, that is 
where it becomes corrupt patronage. I do not agree with that and 
I will give notice that when I see it and as I see it I will do my bit 
to blow the whistle.
<P>
	However, do not ask me to subscribe to a dictum that says all 
persons of the same party label as the party in power are hereby 
disqualified for appointment however qualified. That makes no 
sense. Nobody in this House in their right mind would subscribe 
to that kind of dictum. It would be unfair. As much to the point it 
would be counterproductive because we would be robbing 
ourselves of the opportunity to appoint some competent people.
<P>
	Let us look at something off the record. This is not 
particularly an attack on the Tories. There are no Tories left 
around here to attack. I want to draw a couple of recent example 
and it just so happens that the last government that was in power 
in this country federally was the Tory government. Let us have a 
look at comparable periods.
<P>
	The big bad Liberals, I will pick two equivalent periods, from 
November 4, 1994 to February 3, 1995 in the one case and an 
earlier set of years in another case. In the first case, the present 
case, the big bad patronage infested Liberals over a 15-month 
period from November 4, 1993 until February 3, 1995 have 
made 700 appointments. The <I>Globe and Mail</I> with a research 
team looking into this for days and weeks, we saw the article last 
weekend, managed to identify that fewer than 80 of those 
appointed had Liberal connections. That is only 80 out of 700. I 
have to talk to the Prime Minister. That is discrimination. The 
balance ought to be a bit more than that.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	I say to my friend from Delta when he was a card carrying 
Liberal he would not have stood for that kind of unfairness.
<P>
	Let us look at the period November 4, 1991 until February 3, 
1993. These are not conveniently chosen dates. They are the last 
dates I could choose within the mandate of the last government 
that would parallel the 15-month period we are talking about 
and that is why I chose that period. In that 15-month period the 
Conservatives made 1,819 appointments, about two and a half 
times as many as had been made in this period.
<P>
	One of the realities of being in government is that there are 
agencies, there are boards that need to have personnel appointed 
to them. We cannot ignore that. This government under the 
minister responsible did undertake a review. As a result we have 
made a lot fewer appointments but some of them have to be 
made.
<P>
	The very people who stand in this House and decry 
appointments have themselves been patronage appointments in 
past times. I will not follow in the footsteps of someone else who 
spoke earlier and name names. I do not believe that is fair in 
terms of making the case. It is half fair in the sense that the 
individuals whose names I have there are now members of this 
Chamber and would have an opportunity to respond. However, 
others were mentioned today who have never sat in this 
Chamber and more to the point do not sit here presently and have 
no recourse and cannot protect themselves.
<P>
	I submit to my friends who were dragging out names today 
that we can make the point that somebody may be the grandson 
or the son or whatever relation. I did not have any say who my 
grandparents were. I did not have much say who my parents 
were. Should it disqualify me because my dad was a humble 
carpenter, because my mother came from a family of 
shipbuilders and worked as a domestic before her marriage? 
Does that disqualify me? Should I carry those labels and 
somebody should decide that I have to be pegged here because 
my mother was a domestic and my father was a carpenter? How 
far do we carry this thing in order to make some point about 
patronage?
<P>
	I guess my last sermonette could have been entitled ``people 
who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones'' because some 
of them sitting in this Chamber right now had patronage 
appointments from the former Tory administration.
<P>
	There is one other issue that I would like to talk about. I am 
not referring to the gentlemen from Charlevoix, 
Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, Elk Island, Red Deer, Fraser 
Valley East, Calgary North, Port Moody-Coquitlam or Delta, 
nor to the members for St. Boniface, Parry Sound-Muskoka, 
Kitchener, London West and Oxford, not to mention the 
members for Niagara Falls and Stormont-Dundas. Are there 
other offers-or the member for Louis-Hébert. Just to pull 
together what I have said on that issue, if there is something 
wrong with the patronage system, it is the system that is wrong.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	There is no need to make scapegoats of individuals to make 
one's point about what needs to be done with the system. That is 
the only point I am making. I give notice. I have in front of me 
the names of present members of this House but unless I 
eliminate everybody and by extrapolation name the person, I 
cannot go any further.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9303"> 9303 </A></B>
<P>
	In fairness to the people who asked me the question, they did 
not need to ask the question. They would know full well if they 
had been appointed. If they had been appointed they would not 
be so loud in their protests that I inject a disclaimer on their 
behalf.
<P>
	If the member for Delta did not exist, we would have to create 
him. He is such a delight. The members of the Reform Party 
might have some say in that matter. There is one other item that I 
want to go on to.
<P>
	This bill is umbrella legislation. In many respects, it is what 
we used to call comma legislation. It is not of any particular 
consequence but it tidies up some things. It needs to be done. I 
am not dismissing its importance but it is probably not going to 
create a lot of jobs. Indeed it is cutting out quite a few, for 
example ACOA.
<P>
	I see I have my two minute signal so I had better say this very 
quickly. I want to spend most of my time on ACOA, an 
instrument of regional development very dear to my heart 
because I have seen the good it has done in my own riding.
<P>
	I can talk to members about an agriculture operation in Bay 
St. George where 35 or 40 people are full time employees thanks 
to some initiative from that agency. I can talk to members about 
the salmon operation in Bay d'Espoir which employs 80 people 
full time where we fly salmon on a daily basis to San Francisco 
and Toronto and so on. It is a good producing industry that has 
been going on now for 10 years.
<P>
	I could talk to members about people who sit in Milltown, 35 
of them, and do computer inputing for companies in Germany, 
England and Australia on contract as a result of a little SEED 
money they got five or six years ago from ACOA.
<P>
	I see as I look around that the transition to the new economy, 
the high tech part of it but agriculture in our case in 
Newfoundland, the transition to a new set of endeavours in 
Newfoundland is fully aided by that kind of agency. I sought to 
speak in this debate particularly to give support to it. I would be 
glad to invite any member of the House to go with me to my 
riding so I could show members some of those success stories 
that are the result of ACOA money.
<P>
	The member has had an invitation that he has not yet taken me 
up on. The invitation still stands. I see my time is up.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have just one 
very quick comment. Perhaps the member for Burin-St. 
George's will respond to it. Of all the agencies mentioned in Bill 
C-65, almost all of them have a little clause that reads 
something like this.
<P>
	It says that on the day when this bill is proclaimed all people 
who are on the commission prior to that will cease to be on the 
commission. That unfortunately raises the sinister question, 
why would we have to eliminate all present members of the 
present board? Is it because the present government wants to be 
able to appoint new  people, displacing the patronage 
appointments of the past?
<P>
<B>(1735 ) </B>
<P>
	We will be watching all of those agencies very closely and 
noting the people who are dropped. We know they will all be 
dropped if this legislation is passed; we expect with a majority 
of Liberals it will be. Then we will be watching very carefully to 
see who is put back on to the boards even though it is in reduced 
numbers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> Mr. Speaker, I say to my friend for Elk Island, 
he should be very watchful. That is what makes good 
government, when we have people in the opposition and in the 
government benches who monitor those situations.
<P>
	To the first part of his question, although it is a question better 
answered by the minister responsible, I would fully assume that 
if one is going to alter the mandate of an organization, one might 
want to start afresh. People who were put there, given the former 
mandate, may or may not be qualified or as qualified to pursue 
the new mandate. That is just an answer off the top of my head.
<P>
	It is not uncommon when winding up and redefining an 
organization to replenish its membership. The litmus test is the 
one he put his finger on. The litmus test is whether any 
hanky-panky-he did not say this, but I will say it for 
him-goes on. If there are 10 people on the board with four 
Liberals and six Tories or whatever, they will all be shoved 
aside. If when the board comes back the next day the four 
Liberals remain and the six Tories have all been replaced for no 
better reason than they had different labels when it comes to 
parties, then that is hanky-panky. I would be there with him 
when he raises the point.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John English (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
congratulate the hon. member on his excellent speech and his 
very shrewd and wise comments about patronage. I wonder 
whether he realizes that many of the positions we have abolished 
were vacant. The government had the opportunity to fill them 
but chose not to do so.
<P>
	I wonder if the hon. member would care to comment on the 
contrast with patronage practices of the past. He has been a 
member for a considerable period of time. Could he make a 
comment on that fact?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> Mr. Speaker, to my friend from Kitchener on 
his first point, I tried to get the figure, but I did not get it in time. 
There are many hundreds of vacancies on government boards 
now because we wanted to do the review before we began 
appointing people to agencies that we either no longer need in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9304"> 9304 </A></B>
<P>
terms of the government's policy thrust, or did not need in such 
numbers.
<P>
	For example, the ACOA board is going to be reduced from 18 
members to 7. There were vacancies on that board, but it would 
have been foolhardy for the minister responsible, my friend 
from Cape Breton-East Richmond, to rush in and appoint those 
people, knowing full well it was the government's intention to 
reduce the size of the board.
<P>
	As far as the second part of his question is concerned I say to 
my friend from Kitchener that I think I alluded to that in my 
speech when I said that both Liberal and Conservative 
governments over the past have been guilty of what I 
described-what I defined first but then described in the 
context-as corrupt patronage, where you appoint people of a 
particular party label for that reason alone, not because of their 
competence to do the job.
<P>
	A party label ought not to be the reason for the appointment, 
but it should not exclude one from receiving such an 
appointment. That was my point. A fair amount of it has gone on 
in the past. What is more to the point is that since the 
government took office I believe it has been fairly diligent. It 
has had 150 backbenchers keeping an eye on it, as well as the 
opposition. It has been fairly diligent on this matter. I do not 
honestly believe that one can make much of a case that there has 
been an orgy of patronage under this administration.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I too would like to congratulate my colleague for his very 
interesting remarks and ask him to share his experience with us 
on this point.
<P>
	All too often in my view we have heard-as he said in his 
remarks-names put forward that because there is some sort of 
party connection, that person should somehow be disqualified. 
Does the member in his experience feel that when a person 
levels that sort of a charge, there should be an onus on that 
person to show the individual appointed is in fact unqualified for 
the position? To do otherwise is just to smear people who may 
have this or that political affiliation, if that is the sole reason. It 
is my view that the onus should be on the accuser to put the case 
when they make the accusation.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	I wonder if the member would share his experience and his 
point of view on that idea.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not get my jollies by 
smearing people and I do not think that sets me above anybody 
in the Chamber. I do not think anybody in the Chamber really 
gets their jollies out of it. Sometimes we fall into the trap of 
doing it. I have fallen into that trap over the years myself, but 
that does not make it right.
<P>
	Just now when I singled out an example of an earlier speaker 
in this debate-not only one speaker, two or three speakers-I 
did not name names. That would have defeated the point I was 
making that one smear does not justify a second smear because 
the thing just grows.
<P>
	It seems to me, and I think I said it in my speech, that if people 
have concerns about the system and document those 
concerns-I recognize that some arithmetic has to be 
done-then those people have this label or those people do not 
have those qualifications. I submit that can be done without 
naming names and make the same point.
<P>
	I would submit that the law of averages says that of all the 
people appointed, I dare say some of the 700 I mentioned just 
now cannot do their jobs. Of the 295 members of Parliament, 
probably some of them cannot do their job either. The law of 
averages takes care of those. Nobody is going to suggest that 
every one of the 700 appointments is absolutely brilliant. Some 
of them were, I would guess, clumsy, stunned appointments.
<P>
	But that is different than saying that somebody is sitting here 
full time asking: ``How can we warp the system so that only 
incompetent Liberals get all the jobs and nobody else will get 
any''? Well, if that is the thesis, prove it but do not smear people 
along the way.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to enter into this debate. I have just a 
couple of comments on the previous speaker's comments on 
patronage.
<P>
	First I refer to the picture he has of the cow. I remember from 
history class another famous cartoon of a cow. Perhaps some 
other time he would like to comment on it. It is a picture of a cow 
kind of straddling the Canadian map. It is foraging on the east 
coast, being milked dry in Ottawa and its rear end is pointed 
toward the west. That is a famous cartoon. It is kind of humorous 
but sometimes I think there is an element of truth in it too.
<P>
	On the definition of patronage, what causes concern for many 
of us on this side of the House is that the Liberals campaigned so 
hard against it. The red book comments on patronage. The 
definition of a patron includes someone who is a former owner 
of a slave. I guess depending on how you think their 
commitment is to the party that appointed them, a patronage 
appointment has a negative side to it.
<P>
	I rise today to speak to this latest legislative initiative of the 
government, Bill C-65, which gives legal force to an 
announcement made by the the Minister of Public Service 
Renewal on the day that he announced the downsizing of a 
number of federal government boards eliminating 150 
patronage positions. I assume he thinks that is a good thing. I 
certainly do. He even announced the abolition of seven councils 
and advisory boards.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9305"> 9305 </A></B>
<P>
	Like so many other Liberal initiatives this legislation is a 
half-hearted attempt to placate voters rather than a fundamental 
change in the way government works. There is much talk about 
what is wrong with the system and the systemic change that is 
required. He is very accurate. I do not see that this legislation 
changes any system at all.
<P>
	The Liberal government does not move quickly and 
decisively to resolve the problems that the electorate is angry 
about. It moves cautiously and slowly, inching far behind the 
will of the people.
<P>
<B>(1745 ) </B>
<P>
	On this side of the House we often wonder why. Why does the 
government drag its feet? It drags its feet because the 
government is elected, operated and sustained by a coterie of 
political friends. The way Liberal politics has always operated 
in this country is to weld together an extraordinary network of 
friends, often through the dispensation of favours.
<P>
	The cabinet puts hundreds of old Liberals horses out to 
pasture. Three hundred and fifty government boards, councils 
and commissions liberally water these Liberal pack ponies until 
the next election comes along. Every four years a very long list 
of names builds up, very personal and private promises are made 
and if the government delivers it can be assured of continued 
support.
<P>
	I want the House to know that the people who support the 
Reform Party now and in the future do so because they want 
good government, not because they have any chance of political 
patronage plums.
<P>
	Even during the last election when Reform had relatively 
little chance of actually forming a government, they worked 
their hearts out. That is because Reformers believe that there is a 
different way to govern in Canada, that there is something called 
merit that overrides patronage concerns, that there is such a 
thing as pure political motivation where people get together and 
become politically motivated because they love their country 
rather than their salaries.
<P>
	I am not saying that Liberals or even Liberal appointees do not 
love the country. I am saying that their love for Canada and their 
love of service to its people are sullied, are mixed, are mingled 
with the motivation of private gain in the minds of some Liberal 
appointees. When the collective will of the government, 
operated by thousands of Liberal friends in key posts, is 
expressed we are not surprised to find that any change from the 
status quo is slow and tortuous.
<P>
	Over a period of many years, even in a time of financial crisis 
such as we are experiencing today, real change is agonisingly 
slow, even when the public demands it. The movement of the 
government is hindered by the collective will of people who are 
gaining handsomely from the old way of doing politics.
<P>
	The old ways are passing. We are entering a new political time 
in Canada. Reformers foresee a government that is elected 
through the public demonstration of its value, its ability to act 
and react with speed and firmness to meet the real needs of the 
country, not the perceived needs of friends, of special interest 
groups, elite politicians and a few radical intellectuals.
<P>
	The Reform Party of Canada was elected. It has support across 
the country because Canadians are sick of the old ways 
governments operate. In the last few weeks I have attended 
meeting after meeting in my constituency. I have talked with 
hundreds of constituents and they are very angry in my riding. 
They are fed up. They are sick to death of the old ways and the 
old spending, the old taxation and the old ways in which their 
will is reinterpreted by the government.
<P>
	The Liberal government seems to have some kind of a hearing 
problem. When the people say no tax increases, the government 
hears them say readjust the tax system. That is just another way 
of saying there will be tax increases. When the people shout at 
the government that they are sick of patronage, the government 
hears them whisper they want to reduce patronage a little.
<P>
	The government is hard of hearing. It does not understand 
what the people want. Canadians want a different way, a 
systemic change if you will, of appointing people to our boards, 
our commissions and our advisory bodies. The people do not 
want a little less of the same old thing, they want real change.
<P>
	The Liberals cannot seem to hear what the people are actually 
saying. When the people say that they want a smaller, less 
intrusive government, the government repeats it in a different 
way. The government says ``We understand. You want us to 
eliminate a few advisory boards that did very little in the first 
place. You want us to get rid of a few commissions that do not sit 
anyway''. No, that is not what the people are saying.
<P>
	The people are saying loud and clear-I hear it every day in 
my office-that they want to get rid of government agencies that 
look busy, agencies that are doing too many things right now. 
They want to get government out of their lives. They want to 
reduce the number of things that government does.
<P>
	That is the difference between the Reform agenda and the 
Liberal agenda. In every way the Liberal government attempts 
to preserve the aging status quo.
<P>
<B>(1750 ) </B>
<P>
	The Liberals want window dressing. Reformers are window 
cleaners. The Liberals want theatre. The Reform Party of 
Canada wants real life. The Liberals want to throw today's hot 
potatoes into the laps of the next generation and let it pay for it. 
Reformers want to solve the difficult problems created by this 
generation in this generation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9306"> 9306 </A></B>
<P>
	That is why I oppose this legislation. Although it eliminates 
a few useless boards and commissions, it does not bite into the 
functions of government or into the systemic change that the 
hon. member across the way was mentioning earlier. Although 
it downsizes a few boards and eliminates a little patronage, it 
leaves the patronage system entirely intact. If it is left intact 
it must roll again.
<P>
	Even this morning when I sat on the Standing Committee on 
Human Rights and the Status of Disabled Persons the last item 
on the agenda was order in council appointments. There were 
not many of them, just four, but nobody knows who these people 
are. There is no way one can stop these appointments. Even the 
other Liberal members on the committee did not know what it 
was about. They asked if this was a rubber stamp and the word 
came back from the clerk that yes, it was a rubber stamp. That is 
why, as I mentioned earlier, if there is no systemic change I will 
oppose this legislation.
<P>
	Allow me to read the following. Some of it has been read 
before but I think it should be read into the record again. It is a 
list of patronage appointments being carried by the <I>Globe and 
Mail</I>. It is ironic that the list was compiled by a senator who used 
to work in Prime Minister Mulroney's office and today enjoys 
the rich patronage fruits of the old Conservative regime.
<P>
	If the listener can get over the nauseating hypocrisy of this 
particular pot calling the kettle black, I will get on with the 
business of reading a short part of this list. Just to get your blood 
boiling listen to a few appointments that the Liberals have made. 
Don Johnston, former Liberal Party president to the OECD. It 
cost $100,000 just to win enough favour to get him. Richard 
Kroft, director of the CNR. Jack Wiebe, the 
Lieutenant-Governor of Saskatchewan. Nova Scotia Liberal 
fundraiser Robert Pace has somehow become a director of 
Canadian National and his partner in Nova Scotia, Mervyn 
Russell, is now chair of Halifax Port Corporation.
<P>
	Robert Wright, a negotiator for the Pearson Development 
Consortium, did a really good job. I think he pretty nearly has 
the government into court now for a few hundred million 
dollars. Anyway, he was the Prime Minister's chief fundraiser 
for his leadership campaign and his services now cost us $1,000 
per day. The whole Pearson deal was a Tory patronage 
boondoggle in the first place and the Liberals won the election 
partly by denouncing Tory patronage. I guess it is only fitting 
that one be appointed to investigate it.
<P>
	I am sure all Canadians are happy that the Prime Minister's 
friend is benefiting from the old Tory patronage scheme in the 
same sort of a Liberal way I guess.
<P>
	I will resume my list. Jean Cordeau, chief aboriginal 
organizer for the Prime Minister, is now director of 
Petro-Canada. That obviously tied together. David Maclean, a 
fundraiser for the Prime Minister's leadership campaign, is now 
chairman of CN Rail. Gary McCauley,  a former Liberal MP, is 
now on the Immigration and Refugee Board, one of my 
favourites. He makes about $85,000 a year. Congratulations, 
Gary. Former Liberal candidate Bill Code somehow found his 
way to the NAFTA disputes panel. Yves Caron, a former Liberal 
MP, is now commissioner of the Canadian pension commission.
<P>
	Michael McDonald, the financial agent for the minister of 
public works, is now a director at Enterprise Cape Breton. The 
minister of goodies is still at it. Andrew Ogarcenko, a well 
known Liberal from Winnipeg-not to me-is now the director 
of the National Arts Centre. He is the director of the National 
Arts Centre which is a great job. Perhaps that is why in Question 
Period today the Minister of Canadian Heritage mentioned that 
the Liberal Party is doing an excellent job of promoting culture 
in Canada. Of course a Liberal would be able to do that at the arts 
centre.
<P>
	The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Health had a 
very good campaign manager in the last election and he has 
received his award. Ron Longstaffe is now chair of the 
Vancouver Port Corporation.
<P>
	Inderjit Bal was a member of the Immigration and Refugee 
Board for a while. He received his reward after organizing 
delegates for the Prime Minister and, who else, the Minister for 
Citizenship and Immigration. Unfortunately, Mr. Bal had to 
resign after it was found that he had entered Canada illegally 
himself. Otherwise, he was very well qualified in all Liberal 
aspects.
<P>
<B>(1755 ) </B>
<P>
	Richard Campbell is another campaign manager, this one for 
the Secretary of State for Veterans. He is now director of Marine 
Atlantic. We also have a judge or two. Judge Thomas Lofchik 
was with the Ontario Court of Appeal, a prominent Liberal 
organizer in Hamilton. I am sure that his appointment and his 
political involvements are just a coincidence. We have another 
judge, Federal Court Trial Judge Jean Richard. What was his 
connection? He was a partner of the Prime Minister in his old 
law firm. How about James Langston, former Liberal fund raiser 
and organizer, now on the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench.
<P>
	The taxpayers will be happy to see that the totally pure system 
of justice is being used in this way. I could go on and on and on.
<P>
	We have directors at the Bank of Canada, a host of appointees 
to powerful quasi-judicial panels and boards of large 
corporations. Patronage, I am sad to say, has even reached as 
high as the highest appointment in the land, that of the Governor 
General of Canada. He will be installed tomorrow, God bless 
him. On this side of the House we wish him well.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9307"> 9307 </A></B>
<P>
	All of this is to say that we need a different, more objective 
way of doing appointments. We need to find a way to select 
the best, the brightest, the people who will help Canada to get 
ahead in the world. To cut out the motivation of money would 
do a lot of good for public bodies in this country or for political 
favours cut out that motivation as well. We might have fewer 
people helping out in political campaigns but the ones who do 
so might be motivated with a higher and more noble purpose, 
the ambition of the public interest unsullied by the hope of 
personal gain.
<P>
	Big government is also a problem. For instance, we should not 
be reducing the board of the Atlantic Canada Opportunities 
Agency. The board should disappear altogether along with the 
political machine that funds it.
<P>
	The board of the Canada Council should not be made smaller. 
It should be wiped off the face of the earth, along with its 
funding of radical and violent groups like Buddies in Bad Times 
Theatre in Toronto, an organization which wrote a play 
suggesting that an editorialist who penned an negative column 
about its pseudo-masochistic seminars should be raped. That is 
good stuff. We have to keep it around. The Canada Council funds 
this group to the tune of $60,000 a year. I believe that any 
council with that kind of discretion is a danger to the public 
interest.
<P>
	There are other boards, institutions and activities which 
government should no longer be involved in. This noble bill 
even goes so far as to create a new board called the Canadian 
cultural properties export review board with up 12 new members 
on it, 4 of whom have to have been art collectors or antique 
dealers. I can hardly believe it. Even when the government is 
downsizing, it is upsizing.
<P>
	Patronage and big government are problems, big problems, 
and these are just two of the reasons why I cannot support this 
bill.
<P>
	There are one or two things that it does eliminate which I wish 
the government would have left in. For example, there is now no 
minister required to table an annual report on emergency 
preparedness. I guess Canada will never have an emergency. 
Again, it is a small thing but why eliminate that board and keep 
these other ones in place?
<P>
	Another one that comes to mind, again an accountability 
thing, a small thing, is the National Library of Canada, an 
important federal institution. The archivist now is allowed to 
destroy material without checking with anyone whether the 
material should or should not be saved. I would suggest in this 
day and age of political revisionists I seem to run into from time 
to time that there should be a check and balance on the powers of 
the national archivist. It is a small thing, an accountability thing, 
but I think that accountability should have been left in place.
<P>
	Finally, I believe sunset clauses should be included on each of 
the boards so that legislation would not be required every time 
we wish to wind down the operation of a government body. On 
the less important agencies we could include a clause that would 
require the minister to close the operations of the board at a 
certain definable point. Perhaps a timeframe would be suitable 
of five years for most boards. After five years the board would 
automatically dissolve unless the government renewed it 
through legislation.
<P>
	Requiring legislation to renew mandates would make it harder 
for these boards to be perpetuated long after their useful life is 
gone. It would require the government to justify their continued 
existence in the House of Commons and in the public. Of course 
it would reduce the Liberal pastureland, so to speak. It could do 
the taxpayer good and would make the government generally 
more efficient.
<P>
	We cannot support this legislation. This legislation is not 
worthy of support. Let us see some changes in the process, some 
real changes in the way we do government. As soon as the 
government quits it showpiece legislation and comes up with 
something concrete I will be applauding it, not from the front 
row but from the fourth row. The Reform Party of Canada will 
indeed support concrete solid measures.

be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
delighted to stand in the House today to address this particular 
bill. Before I begin I need to make a few comments with respect 
to the previous speaker, a colleague from the Reform Party who 
did 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9309"> 9309 </A></B>
<P>
not stay around to handle questions. He was probably frightened 
to do so.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I know sometimes 
it is difficult when a debate is split, in this case by a vote. I think 
we all realize the commitments each and every one of us has to 
fulfil at times.
<P>
	We should not reflect on the absence of any member from the 
Chamber at any time. I think it is a good practice and one we 
should maintain.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do want to add something else 
that has nothing to do with presence or absence. Mr. Speaker, 
have you ever envisioned that when Reformers speak a halo 
suddenly starts to appear around their heads? They come across 
as pure, white fallen snow. It is quite incredible. I am delighted 
to be a Liberal, because I am an ordinary human being who has 
strengths and weaknesses, unlike them.
<P>
	Today gross exaggerations that I want to address were made 
by a member of the Reform Party, but they have not fooled 
anyone, and certainly not Canadians. Reform Party polls in the 
whole of Canada are lower than the Bloc's in the whole of 
Canada, and it is trying to tear the country apart.
<P>
	Stay tuned. One of these days one of those Reformers will trip 
and the halo will fall down and crack. We will find out that the 
freshly fallen white snow is rather darkened and blemished. We 
will shortly see whether or not Reformers sin.
<P>
	I want to get to this important piece of legislation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It deals with the reorganization and dissolution of certain 
federal agencies.
<P>
	What we are talking about today is a bill aimed at renewing 
government and restoring confidence in it. That is what this bill 
is about. It is a new type of government. A less cumbersome one. 
A government aimed at increased efficiency. A government that 
is responsive to the needs of Canadians throughout the country.
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	A government concerned with increasing government 
efficiency.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I want to quote this because it appears to be the only safe way 
to not be misquoted by certain members of this House. The red 
book says, ``The most important asset of government is the 
confidence it enjoys of the citizens to whom it is accountable''. 
That has been extremely important to this government.
<P>
	We know that Canadians are tired of large government. They 
have entrusted this particular party with the task of ensuring the 
careful management of public funds. They want honesty and 
integrity restored to their federal institutions. That is exactly 
what is happening in spite of the Reform rhetoric.
<P>
	Some of my colleagues on the other side have a lot of 
difficulty listening to the truth. They jump and fidget and writhe 
whenever the truth is spoken.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> I will let you know if we hear some.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> In fact some of them have to rise from their 
seats because they cannot stand the heat. They are probably 
hungry too.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you may recall that during the last budget the 
Minister of Finance announced that we would have a full-scale 
review to examine the size and relevance of existing agencies, 
boards, commissions and advisory bodies in order to achieve 
cost savings and ensure that if they were no longer needed or no 
longer played a useful role they would be taken out. That is what 
this bill is all about as well. The government has moved 
simultaneously on three fronts, which will lead to a leaner, more 
cost effective and efficient government.
<P>
	Bill C-65 will bring into force decisions taken last July to 
reduce the numbers, and streamline or reduce the size of 
operations of certain agencies, boards and commissions where 
there is an interest to do so, when they are no longer as relevant 
or as important to Canadians, and where we can perhaps do 
without them.
<P>
	You may recall, Mr. Speaker, that on July 8, 1994 the minister 
responsible for this particular initiative issued an interim report 
on the progress to date with the co-operation of his cabinet 
colleagues. He was able to report that decisions had been taken 
affecting 41 agencies and 9 different portfolios. Some people 
will scoff at that, but I assure you it is a major initiative and has 
been a successful one.
<P>
	The legislation before the House today will place into law 
those decisions requiring legislative action, as necessary.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	What I wanted to stress more is that we are abolishing and 
streamlining 22 government agencies. We are eliminating 150 
positions filled by governor in council appointments. This is a 
lot; it is concrete, a success for this government. In concrete 
terms it means an annual saving of $1.5 million for taxpayers. 
This is only the first round of measures.
<P>
	I am going to give you a few examples of how thorough 
planning pays big dividends. This is planning that the minister 
initiated with his colleagues. He then began a long process of 
consultation which ended in success, as in the case of 
Petro-Canada with a reduction of its board of directors from the 
current 15 to three. This is a major reduction.
<P>
	I will give a few other examples quickly: the Canadian 
Saltfish Corporation, created 25 years ago, will lose 24 posi-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9310"> 9310 </A></B>
<P>
tions; the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency will now have 
seven board members instead of 18. Another major reduction. 
Seven positions will disappear with the abolition of the board of 
trustees of the Queen Elizabeth  II Canadian research fund, 
which manages funds intended for research on children's 
diseases.
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
	But the interesting point is that this agency will no longer 
exist to manage the funds, yet research will be carried on and 
will from now on be performed by the Canadian Medical 
Research Council. That is good planning.
<P>
	I can give the House another example of amalgamation of this 
type, namely the elimination of Emergency Preparedness 
Canada as a separate body. The protection it provided will not 
disappear, will always be necessary and Canada will continue to 
be well served in this regard, but this role will be taken on by 
National Defence and that makes sense. There is another 
example.
<P>
	We tried to establish whether certain roles were still relevant, 
still served their purpose or had become superfluous. If they 
were found no longer to be relevant, had become superfluous, 
we eliminated them.
<P>
	In cases in which it proved necessary to retain an agency, we 
attempted to determine whether its role could be carried out with 
fewer people, at a lower cost and perhaps more effectively.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Over a dozen organizations will have the number of their 
board members reduced resulting in significant savings. A few 
of those included in this group are, for example, the Canada 
Council, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the National 
Arts Centre and the boards of four of Canada's national 
museums.
<P>
	Bill C-65 will give effect to the government's objective of 
identifying sensible and practical actions to eliminate overlap 
and duplication, and simplify government wherever possible.
<P>
	As I have already mentioned, the review of agencies, boards 
and commissions is but one aspect of our government's overall 
approach to streamlining, restructuring and reorganizing 
government. The program review and the work in improving the 
efficiency of the federation are two additional initiatives which 
attempt to reach similar objectives.
<P>
	For example, the government has signed action plans that deal 
with specific sectoral issues where overlap and duplication can 
be reduced or eliminated within specific timeframes. That has 
been done, if my memory serves me correctly, with nine 
provincial governments and two of the territories. That is 
important progress.
<P>
	The program review is the other very significant initiative 
that will give the government a new look. It will result in a 
substantially different government, which focuses on core roles 
and responsibilities. It is very important to focus on what can be 
done and what we can afford to do.
<P>
	There will be more announcements made with respect to those 
initiatives very shortly.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would also like to mention, and I believe this is a point we 
should emphasize, the status quo does not exist, federalism is 
evolving. It is a system, not because of its ability to evolve but 
rather because of its ability to change and respond to changing 
needs and always be aware of the needs of its population.
<P>
	Our ability to embark upon the measures which I have just 
mentioned is a function of a body, a system which is flexible, 
adaptable and able to respond to the needs of our society and our 
country.
<P>
	By the same token, federalism is a form of government 
characterized by its adaptability. Our entire history illustrates 
the extreme flexibility of our system of government.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This point needs to be accentuated time and time again. Some 
people like to pretend government and its institutions have not 
changed, but this is blatantly false. Government continues to 
change. Those who will not admit it have not taken the time to 
look at it, study it, and really get into government to understand 
the profound changes that are occurring.
<P>
	Perhaps more than anything else, Canadians want their 
government to be more responsive. They want governments to 
listen to the people.
<P>
<B>(1845 ) </B>
<P>
	I understand that all MPs want to suggest they hold the truth, 
that they listen to their constituents and that they should be 
listened to. I believe that collectively somewhere lies the truth. I 
have never believed that there is necessarily one answer to one 
problem, particularly in today's society. I have never believed 
that one member or one party holds all of the truths. I wish all of 
us could think about that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	By the end of this program review, we will, as government, 
have dissolved many other agencies, boards and commissions; 
eliminated more than 600 positions and effected savings of over 
$6 million a year for the taxpayers. In my book, this is an 
enormous success.
<P>
	To sum up, there are three points I would like to stress. First, 
we have just reduced duplication and overlap in government. 
Positive progress has been reported but, more importantly, work 
will continue in that area.
<P>
	In addition, agreements were signed with the provinces and 
territories to ensure that every level of government can deliver 
the services it is responsible for. What we want to do, above all, 
it to ensure the efficiency of government operations, so that 
<P>

<B><A NAME="9311"> 9311 </A></B>
<P>
goods and services are delivered as efficiently and economically 
as possible.
<P>
	This work must and will continue because it is through such 
initiatives, bringing about improvements on a daily basis, that 
we will eventually have a better government in Canada. We 
already have a very efficient government, but there is still room 
for improvement. No organization can claim that it could not be 
better.
<P>
	I can see one of my colleagues from the Reform Party smiling. 
I think that, in all honesty, he should answer the following 
question. When I mentioned that the government we have is 
already a good one, but that it is trying to be better, it made him 
laugh. I have challenge for this person, a person who I am 
unfortunately not at liberty of naming, although I would love to 
and am tempted to do so, but I will not. He belongs to a political 
party. Does he think that everything is perfect with his party? 
Does he think that it cannot be improved in any way? Does he 
think that his political party has all the answers?
<P>
	I would like to hear what he may have to respond honestly to 
these questions I have just put to him.
<P>
	These are my comments for the moment.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As I have indicated, the government should be lauded for 
these initiatives. They will bring about a more effective, leaner 
government but not a meaner one. It is one that will attempt to 
respond to Canadians' needs, in fact one that will continue to 
respond to Canadians' needs and one that recognizes that we 
need to continue to improve in order to get even better than we 
are.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before recognizing the 
member for Fraser Valley West, I just want to make the House 
aware that at 6.50 p.m. we will move to Private Members' 
Business. With the two minutes remaining I will split the time 
evenly between the question and the answer. The hon. member 
for Fraser Valley West.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
guess that means I cannot speak to this today. That is too bad.
<P>
	I have a question for the hon. member who just spoke. First of 
all the assumption that this Liberal government already is an 
efficient government is not only suspect, it is a ridiculous 
comment. I do not think many Canadians would agree with that. 
If it is so efficient I would like the member to tell us why all of 
these charades are going across the country trying to get input 
into major changes. We just saw the human resources failure to 
prove that.
<P>
	Since the member has said there has been good planning here 
and the government has cut the number of board members, I 
would like him to tell us how many boards are actually going to 
be reduced. Never mind the board members, there are only a 
few. Tell us how many boards are going to be reduced.
<P>
<B>(1850 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Mr. Speaker, the gentleman says there is an 
assumption that we are a good government. What I said was that 
we were doing a reasonable job, in fact a very good job in certain 
sectors and we are going to get better. The polls would confirm 
that. Check our polls against Reform's which are lower than 
those of the Bloc Quebecois and it is trying to tear this country 
apart.
<P>
	With respect to travelling around the country and calling it a 
charade, let the record show that the Reform Party said 
consultation was a charade. What a shocking statement.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 6.50 p.m., the 
House will now proceed to the consideration of Private 
Members' Business as listed on today's Order Paper.

<P>

	<B>Hon. Roger Simmons (Burin-St. George's, Lib.)</B> moved 
that Bill C-282, an act to amend the Income Tax Act (medical 
expenses-disabled senior citizens) be read the second time and 
referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, this is an issue that is very dear to my 
heart. I know so many disabled seniors who are in a terrible 
financial bind because of the cost of dealing with their 
disability, the medication, the equipment and so on.
<P>
	At the same time, I cannot claim to be the first person to raise 
this issue in the House. Indeed a committee of the House, the 
Standing Committee on Human Rights and the Status of 
Disabled Persons made recommendations to the House in March 
1993. One of the recommendations was the very one that is in 
effect embodied in this bill, that the taxes that people with 
disabilities pay should be reduced by measures that offset their 
disability related costs. That is the spirit of this bill as members 
will see as I proceed.
<P>
	The proposed amendment to the Income Tax Act is designed 
to give tax assistance to disabled seniors with out of pocket 
medical expenses.
<P>
	The medical expenses tax is a non-refundable tax credit as 
members know, meaning that eligible medical expenses are 
added to other personal amounts. They are multiplied by 17 per 
cent, the result being deducted from federal income tax 
otherwise payable.
<P>
	In less jargon let me put it this way. At present, expenditures 
on eligible goods and services required for medical reasons in 
excess of the lesser of 3 per cent of net income or $1,614 may be 
used in calculating the medical expenses tax credit. To say it yet 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9312"> 9312 </A></B>
<P>
differently, you have to have $1,614 of medical expenses before 
you can have a tax benefit.
<P>
	That is not particularly a problem if you are hale and hearty 
and earn $50,000 or $100,000 a year. However if for example 
you are a disabled woman of 70 years of age living alone on an 
income of $12,000 then $1,614 represents essentially 
one-eighth of your income. Fully 12 or 13 per cent of that 
woman's income is being spent to buy her required medications. 
This bill is intended to address that issue.
<P>
	The amendment I am proposing here would remove the 
minimum threshold for tax filers age 65 and over and eligible to 
claim the disability credit. They would be able to claim all 
medical expenses from the first dollar, provided of course they 
are in the category of being disabled and senior.
<P>
	I submit that the proposal is very justified by the 
disproportionate burden borne by disabled seniors with respect 
to medical expenses. For example in 1991 the average 
deductible medical expense for all taxpayers was $1,580. For 
disabled seniors it was $2,716.
<P>
	Disabled seniors thus pay considerably more in medical 
expenses than the average person, while enjoying an income 
markedly lower than average. They are therefore prime 
candidates for tax relief with respect to medical expenses.
<P>
<B>(1855) </B>
<P>
	This is a time of cost consciousness and of deficit reduction. 
One question we should put on the table quickly is, how much 
would this proposal cost? The answer applied in 1991 terms is 
that across the country it would cost $2.7 million to implement 
this provision in the bill. Let us say in round figures, in today's 
terms, $3 million.
<P>
	Who would it benefit? At the moment about 170,000 seniors 
who are disabled and poor. The statistics on disabled seniors are 
mind boggling. They are absolutely horrendous and they cry out 
for a bit of justice here. Let me show you what I mean.
<P>
	Of people in this country aged 65 years and over, 46 per cent 
or 1,222,000 have some form of disability. Over 81 per cent of 
disabled seniors have a mobility or agility disability. 
Approximately 20,540 individuals or 8 per cent of the disabled 
seniors in households who require mobility aids do not have 
them. There are approximately 82,000 who require hearing 
devices and another 23,000 who require visual aids who do not 
have them.
<P>
	Another statistic: Women with disabilities are four times 
more likely to be widowed than men. It is 56 per cent compared 
to 13 per cent. Another thing: Approximately 45 per cent of 
disabled males compared with approximately 72 per cent of 
disabled females report incomes under $10,000 a year. Nearly 
half the disabled senior males and three-quarters of the females 
had incomes under $10,000. That is the target group we would 
seek to help here.
<P>
	Unfortunately this is not a votable item but that is the luck of 
the draw. I do not quibble with that. It is part of our procedure, 
but I do wish it had been votable. I know that all members of this 
Chamber would dearly love to have the opportunity to be 
identified with this particular measure. There is however 
another way. The government could introduce the measure as 
government policy.
<P>
	I can tell the House that I spoke several weeks ago with the 
Minister of Finance on this issue. At that time he was quite 
favourably disposed to the suggestion which we discussed in 
some detail. I intend to pursue it with him and I invite other 
members of the House to do so as well.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, as I indicated to you privately earlier, while I am 
entitled to 20 minutes as the lead speaker in this debate, I prefer 
to split my time with my colleague for 
Bonavista-Trinity-Conception. That will enable more 
members to speak to this particular issue during the hour we 
have assigned for this debate.
<P>
	In conclusion, I say to all members that this issue of allowing 
disabled senior citizens to claim the first dollar of expenditure 
for tax credit purposes is an issue of compassion. It certainly is 
that, an issue of compassion. I do not think I need to elaborate 
for any members in this Chamber on what I mean. We can ease 
some of the pain for those people who are hurting on that 
particular issue.
<P>
	Finally, it is also a dignity issue. These people have the double 
whammy of poverty and disability. In many cases the poverty is 
the result of dealing with the disability. Therefore in the name of 
dignity, in the name of compassion and some fairness I would 
appeal to all members of the House and the government to get 
behind this issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise enthusiastically to support my hon. colleague 
from Burin-St. George's on this proposed piece of legislation. 
I think it is an excellent initiative and I support the proposal he 
has made without hesitation.
<P>
	I do not think there is a member of Parliament in this Chamber 
who at some time or another early in the game has not heard 
from a disabled senior citizen who has not been able to find the 
financial means to survive like other members of our society.
<P>
<B>(1900 ) </B>
<P>
	Speaking of seniors in general, we have a large number of 
seniors in Canada and it is continuing to grow. In 1971, 8 per 
cent of our population consisted of senior citizens. In 1991 the 
census figures showed 12 per cent of Canadians were senior 
citizens.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9313"> 9313 </A></B>
<P>
	The growth is very rapid. The latest figures I have seen show 
that by the year 2036 we expect to have somewhere in the 
vicinity of 25 per cent of Canadians as senior citizens. This I 
believe gives even more impetus to the suggestion the hon. 
member has made.
<P>
	To recap, I will use some of the figures that may be slightly 
different from his, however the point is still the same. The 
purpose of the bill essentially is to make it more fair for disabled 
seniors, quite a few in Canada. Specifically, it removes the 
requirement for seniors to have to pay, to have to reach a 
threshold or to have spent a total of $1,614 or 3 per cent of their 
income, whichever is the lesser-it is usually the lesser based on 
the 3 per cent-before they can deduct the 17 per cent of their 
medical expenses; in other words, to get some return for an 
expense on necessity.
<P>
	Why would we make this proposal? Yes, it is out of 
compassion and it is out of dignity. However, there are some 
figures that support the reason we should be proposing and 
supporting this. First, disabled seniors make less and pay more 
for medical expenses. The figures quoted by my hon. colleague 
are accurate. The average income tax return in 1991, the year for 
which the figures are solid, was $25,639. That was the average 
income for those people who filed taxes. The average income for 
a disabled senior was $23,069. That is 10 per cent less than the 
average income filed.
<P>
	The average expense for medical deduction was $1,580, 
whereas the average expense for a disabled senior was almost 
twice that amount, $2,716. There is one reason we should seek 
compassion and consideration for disabled seniors.
<P>
	The second reason is that not only is their income lower, the 
income is based on the average, but the median income, the 
income that is the most recurring, not necessarily the average, 
the one that is basically what most of the disabled seniors earn or 
make, is closer to a low income level.
<P>
	I agree with the figures suggested by my hon. colleague. The 
last time I checked the figures of the 21,000 disabled seniors in 
the province of Newfoundland whom I represent, 18 per cent are 
from low income families.
<P>
	We have a group of people who deserve compassion, dignity 
and to be given some more hope than the average person who is 
not disabled or senior who can perhaps more afford to absorb the 
expense.
<P>
	I am very conscious that I am part of a government in which 
the hon. Minister of Finance is trying to scrape the barrel to find 
every cent he can. I think every member in this House is 
conscious of that no matter where we stand on the issue of the 
budget and how it is executed.
<P>
	The fact of the matter remains that for the number of disabled 
seniors this would help, we are looking at a sum of less than $3 
million. Three million dollars is a lot of money to you, Mr. 
Speaker, and it is a lot of money to me. What is it in the overall 
expenditure of things  considering the target and the group of 
people we are looking at?
<P>
	Consider that we give in the vicinity of $5 billion to business 
and it says it does not really need it and does not use it well.
<P>
<B>(1905 ) </B>
<P>
	There are a lot of loopholes that have been discussed in this 
House tonight, yesterday and before the Christmas recess. It is 
the subject of many recurring media reports.
<P>
	Against that backdrop $2.7 million is not a great deal of 
money.
<P>
	I have talked about the seniors we have. I also have to remind 
members that of the seniors in our country, 46 per cent have 
some kind of a disability. Of that percentage of 46, 84 per cent 
live in households. In other words, they do not live in 
institutions where medical care, wheelchairs, hearing aids and 
visual aids are available to them.
<P>
	Specifically, of those who live in households, 20,000-plus or 
8 per cent need mobility assistance and cannot get it. Thirty-one 
per cent need hearing assistance and cannot get it. Ten per cent 
need visual assistance and cannot get it. Why?-it is not because 
it is not available, it is because they cannot afford it.
<P>
	I would suggest if this private member's bill were passed it 
would certainly ease the burden on that group of Canadians 
which is least able to afford the expense to basically enjoy the 
necessities of life.
<P>
	There is another statistic that I did not recall from my hon. 
colleague. I was also told that of the expenses that seniors who 
are disabled spend out of pocket, 20 per cent is for prescription 
and non-prescription drugs. That is one-fifth of their out of 
pocket expenditure. That also gives some indication of the 
magnitude and the importance of this particular bill.
<P>
	I am like most other members in this House. I have 72 seniors 
groups in my riding. I have visited practically all of them. I have 
never visited one from which I have not come away inspired; 
inspired by the leadership they provide their community in 
helping themselves, in providing activities and staying very 
much alive.
<P>
	I also find they are a great inspiration to the younger members 
of the community, showing them how to live by providing 
examples of life as it can be lived and, perhaps more than 
anything, showing all the communities I represent and which 
other members of this House represent the whole idea of picking 
themselves up by their boot straps and moving together in 
co-operation so that the synergism of the groups and the 
individuals in the groups amounts to more than the sum of the 
separate individual members. In my riding the largest group has 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9314"> 9314 </A></B>
<P>
about 80 members and the smaller groups in some of the smaller 
communities sometimes have ten members, sometimes less.
<P>
	My point is yes, dignity; yes, compassion, but also hope. This 
measure would indicate to the seniors that kind of compassion 
that Canadians from all sides of this House have for them and for 
their well-being.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to support Bill C-282 proposed by my 
colleague from Burin-St-Georges.
<P>
	The main purpose of Bill C-282 is to amend the Income Tax 
Act in order to exempt taxpayers aged 65 and over who qualify 
for the disability credit from the provision that only expenses 
exceeding the lesser of 3 per cent of net income or $1,614 are 
included in the calculation of the allowable amount.
<P>
	In other words, this amendment will allow handicapped 
people over 65 to deduct from their income the cost of drugs and 
other medical expenses. This amendment changes the definition 
of formula symbol ``C'' in subsection 118.2(1) of the Income 
Tax Act.
<P>
	The main effect of this bill will be to alleviate the 
disproportionate burden that medical expenses represent for 
handicapped seniors.
<P>
<B>(1910) </B>
<P>
	We all know that our old people spend a larger proportion of 
their income on health care than other taxpayers.
<P>
	Some parts of subsection 118.2(1) of the Income Tax Act in its 
present form give us food for thought. For instance, we know 
that the medical expense credit and the disability credit are 
designed to alleviate the tax burden of eligible people. 
Subsection 118.2(1) contradicts this principle by taxing eligible 
people for up to 3 per cent of their income spent on health care.
<P>
	Subsection 118.2(1) clearly violates the tax principles 
currently recognized in the Income Tax Act, thus requiring 
handicapped people to spend more.
<P>
	According to a report by the National Advisory Council on 
Aging, seniors are twice as likely as the Canadian population as 
a whole to suffer from various diseases and health problems 
such as arthritis, high blood pressure, heart problems and 
respiratory disorders. They are also the most affected by 
physical and mental disabilities.
<P>
	Again, according to the National Advisory Council on Aging, 
44 per cent of men and 47 per cent of women in that age group 
suffer from various health problems. Seniors should get all the 
attention they deserve.
<P>
	When the last budget was tabled in February 1994, the Bloc 
Quebecois denounced the fact that the tax credits available to 
our seniors were cut by $500 million. The Bloc Quebecois has 
always asked this government to restore equity. So the $2.7 
million that this bill will give back to handicapped seniors is 
very little compensation.
<P>
	I might add that just as the federal government was cutting tax 
credits for seniors, we learned that the largest proportion of 
seniors living in poverty was found in Quebec.
<P>
	Bill C-282 is aimed at restoring a tax loophole. True, Canada 
is facing a major financial crisis and must put its fiscal house in 
order. This is why it is appropriate, just a few weeks before the 
next budget is tabled, to mention once again that the Bloc 
Quebecois asked for a thorough review of the tax system, so as 
to eliminate the loopholes used by high income earners and 
major corporations.
<P>
	The Bloc also proposed efficient measures to reduce the 
deficit and control government finances without targeting the 
poor. These proposals, ten of them, were listed in the Bloc 
Quebecois's minority report on the pre-budget consultations, 
which was tabled in December.
<P>
	As the Official Opposition critic on health, it goes without 
saying that I look at poverty with the issue of health in mind. 
Poverty affects 4.2 million people in Quebec and in Canada. 
There are 1.2 million children who live in poverty. A large 
majority of single mothers, women who are single parents, and 
seniors live in poverty.
<P>
	The link between poverty and health was clearly established 
in several studies. Low income people, such as seniors, are more 
frequently ill, use more medication and require greater medical 
attention. Poverty among the elderly has increased 
tremendously over the last several years.
<P>
	According to a study conducted by Santé Québec, almost all 
of the 25 most common health problems in Quebec are more 
prevalent among low income people than among those who are 
better off.
<P>
	To better control the general state of health of Quebecers and 
Canadians, and thereby control health costs, we must first work 
relentlessly to solve the issue of poverty. By refusing to 
acknowledge the link between poverty and health problems, the 
federal government compromises the efficiency of our health 
system, thereby jeopardizing the health of a large number of 
Quebecers and Canadians who live below the poverty level.
<P>
<B>(1915) </B>
<P>
	If we look past the numbers and the statistics, we see real 
people, people who are suffering, people who are sick and are 
hungry, people who are waiting for the government to assume its 
responsibilities and to propose long-term solutions.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to say that it has been proven 
without a doubt that the health of Quebecers and Canadians is 
closely linked to the endemic poverty that has swept across the 
country during the last recessions. Since it is well-known that 
this state of poverty, which affects too large a segment of the 
population that we represent, has a big impact on the cost of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9315"> 9315 </A></B>
<P>
public health care system, we feel that we must urgently attack 
the problem at its root, which is poverty.
<P>
	We should also remember that the men and women who are 
now seniors, only yesterday, blazed the trail and built with their 
own hands, their efforts and their lives, the Quebec and the 
Canada we live in today. Thanks to them, our society offers us a 
certain quality of life and certain values, because all through 
their lives, they worked to implant and strengthen them.
<P>
	Today, these builders are taking a well-deserved rest. They 
have passed the torch on to us, and it is important, even our duty, 
to ensure that they be treated with respect during this period of 
rest to which they are entitled. Bill C-282 faithfully provides 
this respect. I have explained to you why I approve of Bill 
C-282.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, before 
I begin my comments on Bill C-282, I would like to preface my 
remarks by putting this in its proper context.
<P>
	It was interesting when the member for St. Boniface was 
making comments in regular House business, he was saying that 
Reform members think they have haloes. No, we do not think we 
have haloes, not at all.
<P>
	We do look at some of the actions of the government. We do 
look at some of the things it is doing, particularly when we look 
at the plight of seniors in our nation and how they will be 
potentially impacted positively, I might say, by Bill C-282. All 
of these things have to be put into context.
<P>
	I draw to the attention of the House the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> of 
yesterday which states: ``Treasury Board president had met 
bitter caucus resistance to serious pension reforms'', that is 
from the Liberals, ``in December. He said he could only promise 
the government will fulfil vows made during the 1993 election 
campaign''.
<P>
	The issue in Bill C-282 is particularly near and dear to the 
people. They see the Liberals incapable of coming to a 
consensus on something very simple and straightforward. 
Return MPs' pensions to normal industry standards. What is 
complex about that? I do not find anything complex about it. I 
realize I should not imply or impugn values, so I would not use 
the word hypocrisy in that context.
<P>
	I am also interested in some of the actions of the government. 
The Calgary <I>Sun</I> on the weekend noted that in the past year 
Ottawa has announced a $50 million anti-smoking campaign 
while at the same time giving away $400 million of taxes 
because it was unwilling to enforce the laws of the land as they 
stood. It established a new $30 million anti-racism committee 
and will spend $1 million to celebrate the 30th anniversary of 
the Canadian flag.
<P>
	I have had the good fortune of being able to travel offshore as 
a tourist from time to time. I am very proud of the Canadian flag, 
wear it on my apparel, have it on my suitcase. It stands for the 
great nation that we are. But to be putting out $1 million at this 
time for a 30th anniversary when we are talking about the 
enactment of Bill C-282 being a potential cost of $3 million to 
the treasury, the numbers just do not add up.
<P>
<B>(1920) </B>
<P>
	While I do not see in any way the concept of Reform members 
feeling that they have haloes, on the other side of the coin I can 
see why Canadians might say to themselves: ``I do not 
understand a party where there are such willy-nilly things all 
over the place that just do not seem to make any sense''.
<P>
	Before I begin my comments on this bill I would also like to 
say that I really applaud and salute the member for Burin-St. 
George's for his initiative on this. His intent is very laudable.
<P>
	I rise today to speak to Bill C-282, an act to amend the Income 
Tax Act on medical expenses for disabled senior citizens. As has 
already been recited, the purpose of this bill is to lower the 
threshold for deductibles of seniors for the medical expenses tax 
credit. It lowers the threshold by altering the formula for 
determining the medical tax credit for disabled seniors by means 
of rewording item (c) of subsection 118.2(1) of the Income Tax 
Act.
<P>
	Under the current law the first $1,614 dollars, or 3 per cent of 
net income, is required to be spent before it can be taken into 
account for income tax purposes. The bill would make it 
possible for all eligible medical expenses from the very first 
dollar to, in effect, be income deductible for senior citizens.
<P>
	The reason for targeting disabled seniors for redress is 
because their higher medical expenses and lower incomes leave 
them with a disproportionately high relative cost from the 
limited deductibility. It is estimated that the average deductible 
medical expense for disabled seniors is twice as high as that for 
all other tax filers.
<P>
	The proposed amendment to the Income Tax Act could result 
in a potential revenue loss of approximately $3 million. 
Certainly not a huge amount in light of the numbers we were just 
talking about; a $400 million giveaway for taxes on cigarettes 
no longer collected. Actually I understand from other sources 
that it will be $800 million and $50 million for an anti-smoking 
campaign to counteract that. It seems to me we are getting close 
to a billion dollars when we add on the $30 million plus the $1 
million I was talking about. Therefore, $3 million certainly is 
not a huge amount.
<P>
	On the face of it, the bill seems fair and equitable. By altering 
part of a formula for the purpose of allowing disabled seniors 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9316"> 9316 </A></B>
<P>
more deductions for medical expenses is part of horizontal 
equity. In my judgement the current rumours very rampant 
around the country that the government is going to be taxing 
medical and dental benefits would all be part of this whole thing.
<P>
	I see the bill as an attempt to square a circle, the circle being 
the targeting of disadvantaged seniors inadvertently targeted by 
an aberration in the Income Tax Act. Therefore, the bill itself is 
not disturbing. As a matter of fact, I would probably as revenue 
critic for my party recommend that we seriously consider 
supporting it if it was votable.
<P>
	What is disturbing is discovered by attempting to determine 
the effects of the bill. The bill amends subsection 118.2(1) of the 
Income Tax Act. In that subsection is a formula for the medical 
expense credit. Let us look at just this little snapshot of some of 
the complications in the Income Tax Act.
<P>
	I have to read this. The formula is a(b) minus c (minus d) 
where <I>a</I> is the appropriate percentage for the year; <I>b</I> is the total 
medical expenses of the individual; <I>c</I> is presently the lesser of 
$1,614 and 3 per cent of the individual's income for the year; d 
concerns the income of dependants and spouses as claimed by 
the person filing for the medical expense tax credit. Part <I>c</I> of the 
formula is altered by this bill by adding (a) an amount under 
section 118.3. Section 118.3 deals with a tax credit for mental or 
physical impairment and (b) an amount under subsection 
118(2), in which case <I>C</I> is equal to zero.
<P>
<B>(1925) </B>
<P>
	That is really terrific. Therefore we have before us in this 
simple one-page bill which touches the medical expense credit, 
the tax credit for medical or physical impairment and the age 
credit, a bit of an idea why Canada's Income Tax Act is over 
2,000 pages long. One can see how it got to be that big. That is a 
matter of philosophy. Let me describe the philosophy that leads 
to an ever-growing act and a constantly increasing tax burden on 
Canadians.
<P>
	There is perceived a need or deficiency encountered by 
certain individuals such as, for example, mental or physical 
impairment. I really admire the work of the member from 
Newfoundland but he believes that the government is to be used 
as an instrument of action that enacts or changes legislation to 
address this need.
<P>
	I certainly accept that this was done with the best of intentions 
by well-meaning individuals, as was the case with this bill. 
What happens when the government acts to address the needs of 
only one group of people? Other groups and individuals seek to 
address their problems through government action. That is how 
we ended up with age credits, medical expense credits, GST 
credits, charitable donation credits, political donation credits. 
The list goes on endlessly.
<P>
	The Income Tax Act quickly changes from being 
straightforward legislation which sets rates of taxation and 
strictly defines taxable income into an amalgamation of credits, 
write-offs, grants seeking to redress or placate every group in 
Canadian society. This is the snowball effect where the small 
snowball starts at the top of the hill and picks up speed on the 
way down the hill.
<P>
	What the Liberals fail to ignore or to understand is that the 
fiscal crisis we are currently in is not a result of a few years of 
unbalanced books. It is a result of a conscious decision in the 
1960s and the 1970s of the government to involve itself in the 
lives of its citizens to an unprecedented degree. The 
involvement of the government into the lives of citizens, once 
begun, is very hard to slow down, to stop and even harder to 
reverse. What we see in this band-aid legislative proposal is that 
a band-aid would not stop the <I>Titanic</I> from sinking.
<P>
	It further complicates an overwhelmingly loaded, confusing 
and complex collection system. Combined with the Liberal's 
blind homage to the outdated concept of big brother knows best, 
Canadians lack real hope of reform.
<P>
	As I mentioned, if this was a votable bill, I would be 
recommending to my caucus that we support it for all the good 
reasons that will be expounded. But the real reason in my 
judgment for this bill to even have to be in place is the 
complexity of the Income Tax Act that the government refuses 
to do anything about.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to spend a few 
moments tonight addressing the House on the benefits of Bill 
C-282 and to congratulate my hon. colleague from Burin-St. 
George's for his initiative and work since 1993 on this valuable 
legislation.
<P>
	No doubt every member's riding, the same as mine in 
Cumberland-Colchester, is comprised of large numbers of 
senior citizens, many of whom are disabled. Most members, 
including myself, have parents whom this bill would potentially 
affect. In fact, it is the disabled parents and grandparents of this 
nation to which this bill is addressed and not just a change in the 
Income Tax Act. It is a statement of principle, namely Liberal 
principles, of how the government views and treats our rich 
resource of knowledge and wisdom, our human resource, our 
seniors, particularly our disabled seniors.
<P>
	These are men and women who have worked hard all their 
lives and have jumped one of the last hurdles toward retirement 
only to find themselves struck with the financial burden along 
the way having become disabled and not able to enjoy the fruits 
of their life.
<P>
<B>(1930 ) </B>
<P>
	Unfortunately, though, we helplessly watch as they grow 
older, the ravages of time and disease claiming their strength 
and vitality. They often require extra support from the medical 
community which in many cases was neither expected nor 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9317"> 9317 </A></B>
<P>
accounted for. This can easily drain their retirement savings, if 
they have any, and as a result  many seniors end up being the 
responsibility of the other spouse or some overworked social 
worker.
<P>
	For many seniors as they go beyond the 65 year mark their 
medical expenses in ratio to their income rises far beyond their 
ability to maintain anything human in lifestyle.
<P>
	It is inevitable that all people will eventually need some form 
of medical attention as they grow older. However, when the cost 
of this required attention becomes so burdensome that their 
overall financial freedom and quality of life are reduced, the 
so-called golden years become bitter tears.
<P>
	Added to this indignity, the Income Tax Act in its present 
form drops an extra load on them by not allowing adequate 
concession to deduct their medical expenses.
<P>
	As has been stated by my hon. colleagues, the allowable limit 
on the medical exemption tax credit is the lesser of either 3 per 
cent of net income or $1,614. This means that the cash outlay for 
seniors up to this amount is taxed as part of their incomes.
<P>
	This should not be. We should be giving every consideration 
to retired Canadians, especially those who have had the 
misfortune of falling prey to a disability.
<P>
	Technology kept in its rightful place is a wonderful thing. It 
has allowed individuals to progress from caster boards to 
modern electric wheelchairs. Microelectronics now allow 
hearing impaired individuals to do away with listening horns 
and progress to highly advanced optometry. All of these aids 
cost money. One of the beneficiaries of this great technology is 
the disabled senior but as it presently stands many cannot afford 
these technology products.
<P>
	A Statistics Canada survey on senior's health and limitations 
says that 8 per cent of disabled seniors who require mobility aids 
do not have them, 31 per cent who require hearing aids do not 
have them, 10 per cent of those requiring visual devices do not 
have them. The reason is financial cost.
<P>
	The income of many disabled seniors is low. Sixty per cent of 
seniors with disabilities have an average income of less than 
$10,000. Many simply do not have the money for medical 
prescriptions or appliances for their needs.
<P>
	We must remember that these people are the ones who built 
this country with their ingenuity and labour, who fought our 
wars and who endured hardships in the darkest times. They are 
parents, school teachers, doctors and neighbours.
<P>
	Jimmy Carter, former President of the United States, defined 
the quality of a nation: ``A strong nation, like a strong person, 
can afford to be gentle, firm, thoughtful and restrained''.
<P>
	There have been many comments from Canadians in recent 
years over the faceless and heartless form of government. We 
have been accepting of the norm and we are tolerant. I do not 
wish to see this Liberal government remembered as a faceless or 
heartless government. We must move back toward the gentler, 
thoughtful and restrained days of the Government of Canada 
they have known before these present years. Our firmness will 
not be lost. We are a strong a nation. We can afford to show our 
elderly consideration.
<P>
	What this bill is about is the cost of taxation that is too high to 
a particular sector of society which has a low ability to pay. This 
is inequitable. It is also very unfair. What this bill is about is 
putting fairness in the Income Tax Act for our disabled seniors. 
What this amendment does is allow all medical expenses to be 
deductible for disabled seniors.
<P>
	Recently I received a letter from a couple in my riding who are 
in the position of many disabled seniors across this country. 
They wrote to me and I telephoned them to get permission to 
read a little of their letter:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Dear Mrs. Brushett,</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I am writing on behalf of my husband and myself to express our concern for 
the government's proposed changes to social programs such as old age 
assistance. Our concern is for people like ourselves who are trying to live on 
fixed incomes, pay our usual living expenses, buy prescription drugs, walkers, 
wheelchairs and special devices, some of which we pay taxes on when 
purchased.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>While we realize something must be done about the deficit, the answer is not 
with people who don't have much of a chance of helping themselves.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	When we talked to Mr. and Mrs. Tower of Amherst, Nova 
Scotia, they said ``We are getting by. We are able to make do. We 
do not have much left but we are able to make do''.
<P>
<B>(1935) </B>
<P>
	This bill would allow eligible medical expenses from the first 
dollar to be effectively income tax deductible. This bill would 
help people like the Towers of Amherst, Nova Scotia.
<P>
	We have the opportunity as a government to exhibit strength 
of character and to make adjustments for those in this country 
who need it most. We cannot let this issue die only to be brought 
forward again in the future by those who may not see 
particularly as clearly as we do today.
<P>
	Finally, I wish to re-emphasize that Bill C-282 is going to 
effect the people who need it most. It will not be a set of 
statistical data sitting on a storage shelf collecting dust. It will 
not help the research notes of political science students. It will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9318"> 9318 </A></B>
<P>
help living, breathing human beings who need help most in our 
communities today.
<P>
	In the spirit of the words once spoken by the Right Hon. W.E. 
Gladstone I would affirm: ``Show me the manner in which a 
nation cares for its elderly and I will measure with mathematical 
exactness the tender sympathies of its people, their respect for 
the laws of the land and their loyalties to high ideals''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if adopted, Bill C-282 would amend the Income Tax 
Act to remove, for taxpayers aged 65 and over and eligible to 
claim the disability credit, the requirement that only 
expenditures on goods and services required for medical reasons 
in excess of the lesser of 3 per cent of net income or $1614 may 
be used in calculating the medical expenses tax credit.
<P>
	We in the Bloc Quebecois support this proposal, since all 
medical expenses would be fully deductible from the income of 
disabled seniors. This change in the system would be made by 
changing the definition of formula symbol ``C'' in subsection 
118.2(1) of the Income Tax Act.
<P>
	Disabled seniors have substantial medical expenses that are 
often higher than those of other tax filers. The 1993 national 
advisory council on seniors sketched the following picture of 
the health of seniors in Canada: About 80 per cent of seniors 
aged 65 and over said they were suffering from one or several 
chronic conditions, while only 20 per cent said their activities 
were restricted to the point where they required assistance in 
getting on with their daily lives-this according to statistics 
compiled in 1991.
<P>
	It is clear that limited deductibility represents an enormous 
expense for disabled seniors, considering their many medical 
expenses and low incomes. These people pay taxes on amounts 
that may represent up to 3 per cent of their income, which is not 
in accordance with currently recognized tax principles.
<P>
	The proposed amendment would only provide tax relief in 
terms of expenses actually incurred. It would not change the 
provisions on production of receipts, which are already included 
in the Income Tax Act. The 1993 national advisory council on 
seniors also described the health problems of seniors, saying 
that seniors aged 65 and over were twice as likely as the rest of 
the population to report respiratory problems, arthritis and 
hypertension, and three times as likely to report cardiovascular 
problems.
<P>
	Among seniors, the percentage of mentally or physically 
disabled in 1987 was 47 per cent for women and 44 per cent for 
men. These ratios, together with the rate of multiple disabilities, 
tend to increase with age. During the 1991 tax year, the latest 
year for which data are available, 153,490 tax filers aged 65 and 
over claimed the disability credit.
<P>
<B>(1940) </B>
<P>
	Of this number, 91,050 had taxable income. This is the group 
for which the proposed amendment could represent an 
additional cost to the federal tax system. Of the 153,490 filers, 
18,380 claimed medical expenses greater than the deduction 
limit.
<P>
	Basically, if the amendment were passed, all these taxpayers 
could see their medical expense credit increase by three per cent 
of their net income, that is to say by the amount they used to 
have to subtract on their return.
<P>
	On the other hand, this amendment affects a larger group: 
taxpayers with medical expenses lower than the deduction limit, 
often under $200, who would also be claiming the medical 
expense tax credit.
<P>
	The approximate figure of 91,050 disabled senior citizens 
with a taxable income is indicative of the potential number of 
claimants. If you subtract those who are already claiming the 
medical expense credit, the total number of persons affected is 
80,000.
<P>
	Combined tax expenditures in terms of basic federal income 
tax on both groups, the old and new medical expense credit 
claimants, for 1991 are about $2.6 million, without the federal 
surtax which, if it were added on, would bring the grand total to 
about $2.7 million. This amendment to the Income Tax Act is 
needed to improve the quality of life for handicapped seniors.
<P>
	A Canadian Press article published in the January 26 edition 
of <I>Le Droit</I> quotes a just released study by the national advisory 
council on aging as saying that Quebec seniors are the poorest in 
Canada and that Quebec holds the dubious record of the highest 
poverty rate among people aged 65 and over in Canada. 
According to the council, despite some improvement in their 
economic situation, many seniors, especially those living alone, 
live in poverty. The council also found that women aged 65 and 
over have less money than their male counterparts, a gap which 
increases after 75.
<P>
	Old age security is still the main source of income for seniors, 
especially women. People aged 65 and over get over 50 per cent 
of their income from government programs.
<P>
	The study shows that in 1992, the percentage of people 
making less than $15,000 increased with age, especially among 
women.
<P>
	A Canadian Press article published in the January 21, 1995 
edition of <I>Le Droit</I> stated that middle-class workers would not 
be able to spend their old age in comfort and that, according to 
the Canadian institute of actuaries, taxing RRSPs would have 
disastrous consequences. The institute feels that this measure 
would lower the savings rate in Canada and increase public 
<P>

<B><A NAME="9319"> 9319 </A></B>
<P>
expenditures in the long term, when the baby boom generation 
reaches retirement age.
<P>
	In the future, the challenge for individuals and decision 
makers will be to balance the various sources of retirement 
income, so as to ensure that private and public retirement funds, 
along with personal savings, will be such that the largest 
possible number of Canadians and Quebecers can enjoy an 
adequate standard of living in their retirement years.
<P>
	It is essential for the government to realize that it must not cut 
into social programs and thus reduce the quality of life of our 
seniors. Rather, it must cut into the family trusts of rich 
Canadian families, since assets held in these trusts are not 
subject to capital gains tax for several years.
<P>
<B>(1945) </B>
<P>
	These trusts allow rich families to protect part of their family 
assets from generation to generation. Family trusts, which were 
introduced in 1972 by the Trudeau government, required a 
deemed disposal of assets in trust after 21 years, that is in 1993 
for trusts set up before 1973.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois has nothing against family trusts; 
however, it does object to their use as tax loopholes. For 
example, the Bloc is against the deferral, to the next generation, 
of the tax payable on capital gains. We also ask the government 
to release the figures on the value of assets held in family trusts 
and on the loss of tax revenue resulting from the deferral of the 
tax payable on capital gains.
<P>
	The Income Tax Act should also be amended to prevent 
Canadian companies with subsidiaries abroad from using the 
fiscal losses of these subsidiaries to reduce their taxable income 
in Canada.
<P>
	Bill C-282 is an act to amend the Income Tax Act so as to 
eliminate, for taxpayers aged 65 and over who are eligible to the 
credit for disability, the applicable reserve. This bill is 
acceptable, since disabled senior citizens are often among the 
poorest people in our society.
<P>
	As spokesperson for Canadian associations and organizations 
representing seniors, I once again pledge to ensure that this 
social program review does not become a mere exercise to cut 
into programs which protect the poor, and particularly the 
elderly.
<P>
	I have always been firmly opposed to letting the federal 
government reduce the deficit at the expense of our seniors, who 
have worked all their life and who deserve a decent standard of 
living.
<P>
	We support this measure because all the medical costs would 
be deductible from the income of disabled seniors, and we feel 
that this amendment is essential.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John O'Reilly (Victoria-Haliburton, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to be able to reply to Bill 
C-282, moved by the member for Burin-St. George's, a most 
beautiful peace of the rock.
<P>
	I commend the hon. member for his initiative. I only wish it 
were a votable item. I find there are a growing number of seniors 
moving into my riding of Victoria-Haliburton. As the 
population in my area grows, this bill will be a great asset to the 
people in my riding. In other words, all eligible medical 
expenses will effectively be income deductible for disabled 
seniors.
<P>
	Elimination of the burden borne by disabled seniors with 
respect to medical expenses is indeed something to be 
commended. Disabled adults over the age of 65 have the highest 
medical expenses of any group in our society.
<P>
	This bill, moved by the hon. member for Burin-St. George's 
will provide relief for over 170,000 seniors who qualify because 
of low income, and the number of those in that age bracket is 
growing every year.
<P>
	The bill targets a very deserving group in our society and is 
designed to address the need for fairness in the Income Tax Act. 
Three million dollars will be available for 170,000 poor, 
disabled, deserving people who are seniors. Who could question 
this motivation? Fifty-six per cent of the group are women.
<P>
	I commend the member. I promise to bring my concerns and 
the concerns of other members to the minister, and work for 
disabled seniors not only in Victoria-Haliburton but in all of 
Canada.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The time provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired.
<P>
	Pursuant to Standing Order 96, the order is dropped from the 
Order Paper.

<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.

	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to once again pose a question I posed to the minister 
responsible for ACOA. I posed this question on December 8 and 
I do not believe I received a satisfactory answer. Therefore, I 
would like to raise it again.
<P>
	When I do get the answer this time I would rather not go into 
the rhetoric of regional development grants. I would like to get 
<P>

<B><A NAME="9320"> 9320 </A></B>
<P>
an answer to the question. With all due respect I am trying to 
determine whether or not this Liberal government can assess 
what is productive in regional development grants.
<P>
	I want to read the question I raised: Does this minister know 
the difference between a grant and a loan that is not repaid at 
taxpayers' expense? The reason I asked this was that when the 
minister was in Atlantic Canada he suggested that ACOA was no 
longer going to give grants, it was going to be dealing in 
repayable loans.
<P>
	In 1992-93 ACOA wrote off $50 million in loans. I guess 
what this government has to understand is that a loan that is 
written off is no different from a grant because the individual is 
really not accountable for the loans.
<P>
	If ACOA is now exclusively involved in the loan business, the 
question I posed to the minister was relevant to the FBDB which 
is actually the arm that provides venture capital to business on 
loans.
<P>
	I would like to pose the question again in a simpler way. If the 
government is taking grants away from ACOA and ACOA is 
now one of the institutions responsible for venture capital or 
repayable loans, why not close down ACOA and let the FBDB 
take its place? That would save some money on the operations of 
ACOA and still would provide venture capital to Atlantic 
Canadians.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The hon. parliamentary 
secretary. I would also like to mention that she is the member for 
Halifax.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, and I am a 
proud maritimer who did not go down the road.
<P>
	It gives me great joy to respond to the hon. member for Fraser 
Valley West and to remind him that on December 7, 1994 the 
minister for ACOA delivered an address which charted a new 
course for regional development in Atlantic Canada. That was 
the outlining of the Team Atlantic approach to private sector job 
creation and an end to grants to business.
<P>
	He said that within a couple of months ACOA would be 
releasing the policy and hey, guess what? February 7, two 
months to the day later, ACOA released the new policy this 
afternoon to make direct assistance to business repayable. I do 
not know when members opposite will learn that when this 
minister says he is doing something he does it.
<P>
	This new direction for ACOA will make 100 per cent of direct 
assistance to business under the action program fully repayable 
on a fixed timetable. This new policy was established in 
consultation with provincial governments and business which 
support complete repayability.
<P>
	ACOA will continue to make unsecured risk capital available 
for small and medium sized enterprises, SMEs. We have heard 
the concerns of SMEs which stated that access to capital is the 
key to success. This patient capital allows business to become 
successful before repayment is required.
<P>
	I was glad to hear that the leader of the Reform Party supports 
the government's direction in this matter as he stated on the 
CTV news in December 1994 that it was a step in the right 
direction. However, it is unfortunate that the member continues 
to spuriously attack the only agency of government devoted 
exclusively to the needs of Atlantic Canadian business. This 
must reflect some underlying attitude.
<P>
	I say we should stand and congratulate the minister for the 
constructive solutions he is offering to the problems confronting 
the region. We know what the problems are. We know that 
ACOA, not FBDB, is the answer to those problems and we are 
going to get on with the job.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 38(5), the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to 
have been adopted. Accordingly, the House stands adjourned 
until tomorrow at 2 p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 7.54 p.m.)
